Reorg depth is currently calculated as `newHead.slot - commonAncestor.slot` \r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nThe reorg depth counter should be able to determine reorgs and at what depth. We need to tweak the calculation with something else. @wemeetagain suggests maybe `Math.max(newHead.slot, oldHead.slot) - commonAncestor.slot` \r\n\r\nOpen for discussion/solutions.\r\n",
