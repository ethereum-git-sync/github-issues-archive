  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nMemory exhaustion occurs in periods w/o finality, mostly from many states / epoch ctxs stored in the StateContextCache.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nWe should prune the StateContextCache when it gets past a certain size. (pruning the oldest states first, perhaps with a few exceptions)\r\n\r\nThis likely must be done in tandem with two additional features:\r\n- state recreation - when pruned states are requested, they must be recreated from most recent available state. We can walk the fork choice block dag to retrieve ancestor state roots / block roots.\r\n- checkpointed states - replaying many blocks across many epochs to recreate a state may be \"too slow\". We should keep 1 state per N epochs per fork either in memory or on disk.",
