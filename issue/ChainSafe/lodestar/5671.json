  "body": "### Problem description\n\nSince the merge, both execution and Lodestar beacon nodes persist the block's execution payload into the DB.\r\n\r\nAt an average block size of 100Kb, that's about 720 MB / day or 263 GB / year of redundant data we don't _really_ need to store. See https://ycharts.com/indicators/ethereum_average_block_size According to metrics, current Lodestar DB growth averaged over the last 30 days on a mainnet node without validator is 666 MB/day.\r\n\n\n### Solution description\n\nInstead Lodestar should persist in its DB blinded blocks, and retrieve from the execution node the payloads on demand to comply with:\r\n- ReqResp beacon_blocks_by_root\r\n- ReqResp beacon_blocks_by_range\r\n- API requests involving the full block\r\n\r\nAll of this operations are not super time sensitive so the added latency is not a breaking deal\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
