  "body": "- _From https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/issues/4275_\r\n\r\nSim tests are a crucial tool for our CI pipeline, but currently lack of assertions to detect bugs. Currently tests only assert that:\r\n- Finality / Justification is reached within N epochs\r\n\r\n**Proposed assertions**\r\n\r\nAssertion on epoch:\r\n- [x] Attester participation rates a minimum threshold: Assert with debug states route\r\n- [x] Sync committee participation rates a minimum threshold: Assert with following beacon blocks\r\n- [x] All blocks in epoch are proposed: Assert with debug state route\r\n- [x] Blocks received by all nodes with max threshold: ?? How to assert?\r\n- [ ] Gossip scores of all peers at a minimum value: Prysm, Lighthouse, and Lodestar expose peer scores via custom API routes\r\n- [ ] Correct voting of a majority vote of eth1_data \r\n\r\n**Run modes / actions to perform**\r\n\r\n- [x] Run to finalization + N epochs\r\n- [ ] Validator exit: Assert inclusion with blocks, effect with validator status route\r\n- [ ] Validator proposer slashing: Assert inclusion with blocks, effect with validator status route\r\n- [ ] Validator attester slashing: Assert inclusion with blocks, effect with validator status route\r\n- [ ] Process deposits from eth1 contract: Assert inclusion with blocks, effect with validator status route\r\n- [x] Go through forks: Other assertions cover healthy transition\r\n- [ ] Finalized sync: Assert reaching head within some time limit\r\n- [ ] Unknown block sync: ?? Not sure how to trigger\r\n- [ ] Lightclient sync + follow head: Light-client should be managed programatically against a node run in another process. Assert syncs to head + follows the head in time\r\n\r\n**Background**\r\n\r\nTo get started, Prysm has done an excellent job on this field so we should base our work on theirs.\r\n- Prysm's e2e infra is documented here: https://docs.prylabs.network/docs/devtools/end-to-end/\r\n- Assertions source code: https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/develop/testing/endtoend/evaluators/operations.go",
