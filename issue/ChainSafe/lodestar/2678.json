I have not been able to reproduce this locally tho.\r\n\r\n@tuyennhv I have a separate branch https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/tree/benchmark that logs memory usage and triggers garbage collection manually and when run it CI it clearly shows that there is a leak preventing > 1GB of memory from being garbage collected.\r\n\r\nThe initial resident set (rss) is `rss: 2453975040`. However here you can see that after manually triggering GC it fails to clean up extra memory.\r\n```\r\n2021-06-10T14:56:00.2470992Z @chainsafe/lodestar-beacon-state-transition: getAttestationDeltas 73 2021-06-10T14:56:00.229Z {\r\n2021-06-10T14:56:00.2473552Z @chainsafe/lodestar-beacon-state-transition:   rss: 3928752128,\r\n2021-06-10T14:56:00.2475721Z @chainsafe/lodestar-beacon-state-transition:   heapTotal: 3481997312,\r\n2021-06-10T14:56:00.2477814Z @chainsafe/lodestar-beacon-state-transition:   heapUsed: 3455106752,\r\n2021-06-10T14:56:00.2479703Z @chainsafe/lodestar-beacon-state-transition:   external: 141899282,\r\n2021-06-10T14:56:00.2481274Z @chainsafe/lodestar-beacon-state-transition:   arrayBuffers: 140033162\r\n2021-06-10T14:56:00.2483111Z @chainsafe/lodestar-beacon-state-transition: }\r\n2021-06-10T14:56:00.2485741Z @chainsafe/lodestar-beacon-state-transition: getAttestationDeltas                                                   4.928093 ops/s      202.9183 ms/op     73 runs    15.15 s\r\n2021-06-10T14:56:00.2488794Z @chainsafe/lodestar-beacon-state-transition: Triggering GC...\r\n2021-06-10T14:56:07.1150965Z @chainsafe/lodestar-beacon-state-transition: Epoch transitions\r\n2021-06-10T14:56:07.1152891Z @chainsafe/lodestar-beacon-state-transition: ================================================================\r\n2021-06-10T14:56:10.5502598Z @chainsafe/lodestar-beacon-state-transition: Triggering GC...\r\n2021-06-10T14:56:14.5048743Z @chainsafe/lodestar-beacon-state-transition: process 1 empty epoch 1 2021-06-10T14:56:14.498Z {\r\n2021-06-10T14:56:14.5052136Z @chainsafe/lodestar-beacon-state-transition:   rss: 3653804032,\r\n2021-06-10T14:56:14.5053846Z @chainsafe/lodestar-beacon-state-transition:   heapTotal: 3199950848,\r\n2021-06-10T14:56:14.5055508Z @chainsafe/lodestar-beacon-state-transition:   heapUsed: 3133330992,\r\n2021-06-10T14:56:14.5057191Z @chainsafe/lodestar-beacon-state-transition:   external: 144259767,\r\n2021-06-10T14:56:14.5058882Z @chainsafe/lodestar-beacon-state-transition:   arrayBuffers: 142041391\r\n2021-06-10T14:56:14.5060900Z @chainsafe/lodestar-beacon-state-transition: }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe logs above are from the benchmarks job in the `benchmark` branch.",
