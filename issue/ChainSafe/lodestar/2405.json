Our `BeaconChain` class does not have this convenient methods.\r\n\r\nWe could move the logic to perform this basic operations to the `BeaconChain` class so they can be used by users of the chain instance. I personally missed this when I was hacking some random stuff not exclusively required by the Eth2.0 node, and missed that functionality.\r\n\r\nAt least I would add\r\n```ts\r\ngetBlockByRoot(beaconBlockRoot: Root): Promise<BeaconBlock>\r\ngetStateByRoot(stateRoot: Root): Promise<BeaconState>\r\n```",
