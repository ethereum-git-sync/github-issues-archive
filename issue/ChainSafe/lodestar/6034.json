  "body": "### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nWe have this function `handleAttesterDutiesReorg` which is mostly called when head (`onNewHead`) is updated\r\n- and dependent root for next epoch changed\r\n- or dependent root for current epoch changed\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/blob/1aa656191c84e3b55281bb8f21c9f4a529282500/packages/validator/src/services/attestationDuties.ts#L348\r\n\r\nIn both those cases we handle the reorg by\r\n- getting updated attestater duties (`getAttesterDuties`)\r\n- update cached duties (`dutiesByIndexByEpoch`)\r\n- recalculate proof (`is_aggregator`)\r\n\r\nBut I noticed we are not resubscribing to beacon subnets (`prepareBeaconCommitteeSubnet`). This is not an issue if the dependent root for the next epoch changed as we re-/subscribe to current (_N_) and next epoch (_N+1_) at the start of each epoch.\r\nhttps://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/blob/1aa656191c84e3b55281bb8f21c9f4a529282500/packages/validator/src/services/attestationDuties.ts#L196\r\n\r\nHowever, this is an issue if dependent root for current epoch changed as previous subscriptions are no longer valid\r\n- validator duties changed (slot, committee index, etc.)\r\n- `is_aggregator` results are different\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nValidators should be resubscribed to beacon committee subnets if current epoch dependent root changed.\r\n\r\nIdeally, should just always resubscribe when `handleAttesterDutiesReorg` is called even if dependent root for next epoch changed as the subscriptions for epoch _N+1_ are outdated as well and the sooner we subscribe to subnets, the more likely it is to find good peers.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Operating system\r\n\r\nLinux\r\n\r\n### Lodestar version or commit hash\r\n\r\nv1.11.3 / unstable (1aa656191c84e3b55281bb8f21c9f4a529282500)",
