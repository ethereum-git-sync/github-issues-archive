Check this metrics where an AggregateAndProof stayed in the queue for 40 min :rofl: \r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2021-04-25 22-34-13 (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35266934/116008795-a3a62c80-a616-11eb-958a-c6419b3282cb.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nShould not happen, each queue should have a max TTL, a max duration or timestamp after which the job is dropped. Otherwise we could re-structure the LIFO queues such that when full the oldest jobs get dropped instead of the last to be added.",
