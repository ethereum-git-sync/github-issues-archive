Please describe.**\r\n\r\nDuring the release of v0.38.1, some issues arose.\r\n\r\n- We wanted a stable release with sepolia config (PR #4164)\r\n- #4164 did not apply cleanly to `stable`, built off changes from other PRs\r\n- Cherry-picking #4164 onto `stable` (branch `rc/v0.38.1`) required fixing merge conflicts\r\n- Finishing the release process, we now cannot merge `stable` back to `unstable` due to merge conflicts - see https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/pull/4172\r\n- `stable` cannot be modified to fix the conflicts, it is ridiculous to modify `unstable` to fix the conflicts\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\n- only merge `stable` to `unstable` on  major / non-hotfix releases",
