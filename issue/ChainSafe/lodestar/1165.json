  "body": "we might have a `lodestar init` to burn in the chain params to disk for use across `beacon`, `validator`, etc. The `init` wouldn't be very useful to run by itself, but its there conceptually as initialization required across lodestar commands. In the same way that `beacon run` should run `beacon init` if it needs to be run.\r\n\r\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nIn the CLI, some initialization will likely be required for use across different commands. This initialization looks like writing some files to disk, for future consumption by cli commands.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nAdd `init` command to write beacon params to disk. Have `init` called before other commands if chain params doesn't exist on disk.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n<!--A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.-->\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nPrereq: https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/pull/1136 and separating chain params from `beacon.config.json`",
