  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nThe validator API checks the syncing status before every method. This check is important to ensure that validator duties/blocks/attestations are not retrieved/submitted unless the chain is 'synced up' enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nCurrent behavior and implementation need to be revisited. We can't allow a completely unsynced chain to provide (incorrect) duties to a validator. But we also need to allow duties to be found in cases of many skip slots.\r\n\r\nThe implementation can also be cleaned up, code-wise.",
