  "body": "Current branch: `greg/expirement/start-beacon-chain`\r\n<!--NOTE: -->\r\n<!--- General questions should go to the gitter room instead of the issue tracker.-->\r\nI've begun to spin up lodestar with deposits, and tracking how the process of processing blocks. I'll be using this thread to document the issues I find along the way. Expect this thread to update frequently.\r\n\r\n## **List of bugs**\r\n- [x] effective_balance_increment #211 & #213 \r\n- [x] Beacon --db flag #212\r\n- [x] Update deposit contract [chainsafe/deposit_contract#4](https://github.com/chainsafe/deposit_contract/pull/4)\r\n- [x] Deposit value is 0 #227 \r\n- [ ] Deposit proof missing\r\n- [x] Total deposits incorrect #227 \r\n- [ ] Update deposit CLI paramaters\r\n- [ ] BLS Private key as a uint8array / buffer\r\n\r\n## **Detailed Bugs**\r\n#### **Deposit**\r\n- **commit:** `8356cde5a533126ede29bbb0cc429cf3efdd676e`\r\n- **Start command:** `yarn build && ./bin/lodestar beacon --rpc \"\" --db test-db --eth1RpcUrl http://127.0.0.1:8545 --depositContract 0x8c594691C0E592FFA21F153a16aE41db5beFcaaa`\r\n- **Eth1 Command:** `./bin/lodestar eth1:dev -m \"vast thought differ pull jewel broom cook wrist tribe word before omit\"`\r\n- **Deposit Command:** `./bin/lodestar deposit -m \"vast thought differ pull jewel broom cook wrist tribe word before omit\" -n http://127.0.0.1:8545 -c 0x8c594691C0E592FFA21F153a16aE41db5beFcaaa`\r\n- **Notes**: I commented out `sync` and `networking` modules for the time being\r\n- **Error**: `verifyMerkleBranch` found in `stateTransition/util/misc.ts`. The `proof` command is an empty array and causing the app to throw with an unhandled promise rejection. \r\n- **Analysis**: ethers.ts line 203 states `//TODO: calculate proof` which is the probably cause for failure\r\n\r\n#### **ETH1 Validator Deposit balance**\r\n- Same config as **deposit config**\r\n- **Error**: When a running `processDeposit()` the balance for the deposit is `0` and causing arithmetic errors.\r\n\r\n#### **Beacon --db flag** \r\n- Same config as **deposit config**\r\n- **Error**: The db flag condition had a strange bug where the flag exists but defaults to using the toml file\r\n\r\n#### **Total Deposits**\r\n- Once the genesis event begins, the BeaconState shows the total deposits to be 0 rather than 10 (in my simulation)",
