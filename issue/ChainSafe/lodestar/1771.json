    "body": "oh I thought we want to process a chain segment (check linear chain first) in this issue. Something like:\r\n+ do not change `lodestar-beacon-state-transition`\r\n+ lodestar side: new `runMultipleStateTransition(..., jobs: IBlockJob[])`. Consumers would be initial sync and regular sync.\r\n+ Accumulate signatures and use `bls.verifyMultiple()` to verify signatures beforehand\r\n+ Run `fastStateTransition()` directly or the old `runStateTransition()` for each job/blocks without signature verification\r\n\r\n@ChainSafe/eth2-0  can someone confirm if we plan to do it, and we want to do this in this issue or another one?",
