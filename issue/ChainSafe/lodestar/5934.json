It is not connected to any datasource or query metric, and the chart that is rendered is literally just random timeseries: query source is Grafana/Random Walk.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nShould be removed or updated with relevant metric if it's a placeholder.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nN/A\n\n### Additional context\n\n![image](https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/assets/13218496/4f668d29-1f7c-4c6b-ab63-707d5b530d6b)\r\n\n\n### Operating system\n\nLinux\n\n### Lodestar version or commit hash\n\nv1.10.0",

    "body": "This is definitely something we should fix, we could just remove the panel but I think we could also use the opportunity to add few more metrics and rework the dashboard a bit.\r\n\r\nThe Lodestar summary dashboard should be tailored towards node operators as it is the dashboard that comes by default in solutions like eth-docker and  dappnode. It is also not really used by client devs as other dashboards usually provide better and more detailed insights.\r\n\r\nWe could for example add validator performance metrics, e.g. we have a panel that tracks metrics based on formula used by [rated.network](https://www.rated.network/). Maybe @aaronmboyd you have some metrics in mind you would like to see there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Well, the bug report was more that a release tagged version contains placeholder or erroneous panels.\r\n\r\nThis is important to me as a solo validator, because I provision the dashboards directly to my grafana instance (containerized) by mapping the git repo / dashboards folder to my grafana container, then auto-loading these boards with the mapped config file:\r\n```\r\napiVersion: 1\r\n\r\nproviders:\r\n  - name: \"Dashboard provider from docker compose\"\r\n    orgId: 1\r\n    folder: \"Lodestar Presets\"\r\n    type: file\r\n    disableDeletion: false\r\n    updateIntervalSeconds: 10\r\n    allowUiUpdates: true\r\n    options:\r\n      path: /var/lib/grafana/dashboards\r\n      foldersFromFilesStructure: false\r\n```\r\nSo I treat the contents of `dashboards` as they are, and assume that tagged versions (not unstable) will be feature complete. Periodically I update the repo to a new tag and then bounce the grafana container and it will pick up the new dashboards.\r\n\r\nRe: What validators would like to see on the dashboards:  I would like to see more documentation or clarity on the job name mapping. It's not immediately obvious that the boards are expecting `beacon` and `validator` all over the place, and this makes it hard where you have a datasource with multiple consensus / validators. (I have Goerli and mainnet setup and collecting from the same datasource, for example).\r\n\r\nWould also love to see more \"effectiveness\" measures as suggested above. I observe the beaconcha.in validator page and have no idea how they evaluate \"Effectiveness\". Would also be interested in something that can visualise MEV or execution rewards. Perhaps even withdrawal address monitoring?\r\n\r\nThe Lodestar team dashboards are actually really great as they are, much more detailed and clear than say, Besu's default boards in my opinion.",

It's not immediately obvious that the boards are expecting beacon and validator all over the place\r\n\r\nI agree here, it is not ideal but we need some way to differentiate between beacon and validator as some metric names are duplicated such as process metrics. I already looked at this problem and one solution for this was to give the user the option to configure the job name via a variable when importing the dashboard (https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/pull/5211). In this case it would be more obvious for a user that those names are relevant and you would not have to change your prometheus scrape config but if you use auto provisioning, this unfortunately does not work. Highlighting this somewhere in our documentation would definitely help.\r\n\r\n> Would also love to see more \"effectiveness\" measures as suggested above. I observe the beaconcha.in validator page and have no idea how they evaluate \"Effectiveness\". Would also be interested in something that can visualise MEV or execution rewards.
