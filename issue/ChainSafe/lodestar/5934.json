It is not connected to any datasource or query metric, and the chart that is rendered is literally just random timeseries: query source is Grafana/Random Walk.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nShould be removed or updated with relevant metric if it's a placeholder.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nN/A\n\n### Additional context\n\n![image](https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/assets/13218496/4f668d29-1f7c-4c6b-ab63-707d5b530d6b)\r\n\n\n### Operating system\n\nLinux\n\n### Lodestar version or commit hash\n\nv1.10.0",

    "body": "This is definitely something we should fix, we could just remove the panel but I think we could also use the opportunity to add few more metrics and rework the dashboard a bit.\r\n\r\nThe Lodestar summary dashboard should be tailored towards node operators as it is the dashboard that comes by default in solutions like eth-docker and  dappnode. It is also not really used by client devs as other dashboards usually provide better and more detailed insights.\r\n\r\nWe could for example add validator performance metrics, e.g. we have a panel that tracks metrics based on formula used by [rated.network](https://www.rated.network/). Maybe @aaronmboyd you have some metrics in mind you would like to see there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
