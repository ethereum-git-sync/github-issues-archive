If yes, how? The github actions checker currently does not enforce this usage.\r\n- Modify examples of PR titles with bullet points instead of quoting\r\n- Define when and how to indicate breaking changes on commit level and further discuss how to display those in the Changelog which should be targeted towards non-developer user/operator of Lodestar.

    "body": "> What's the purpose of (scope)?\r\n\r\nI think scope could be an easy way to give the commit more context, especially because Lodestar monorepo has several packages and subcategories\r\n\r\n- gives more clarity on what part of the code was modified, meaning the commit message itself does not need to do that and can focus on the change being done\r\n- makes commit easier filterable/searchable, would only work if this patterns is consistently applied\r\n- depending on how we generate changelogs, most tools group by scope, this makes changelog easier to read\r\n- generally, it should be easy to define a scope for most commits based on\r\n   - package (or subcategory)\r\n   - hard fork\r\n   - EIP\r\n\r\nThe scope is not required by the PR title checker as discussed here https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/pull/5342#discussion_r1158126144, so usage would be based on personal preference. For me, it sometimes makes it easier to convey all required information in the commit message.",
