Since the cache memory size is technically unbounded this strategy is great for preventing OOMs.\r\n\r\n- [ ] The head state should be kept separately with a strong reference.\r\n- [ ] Test how JS chooses to garbage collect multiple WeakRef. By age? By least used?\r\n- [ ] Test performance of WeakRef.unref() if it's called very often (attestation processing)\r\n- [ ] Consider adding a shufflings cache to mitigate the risk of a key state getting dropped\r\n- [ ] Don't regen for attestation verification if the head state already has the correct shuffling\r\n\r\nNote: this is a huge en-devour with uncertain payoff. Teku has had issues in the past with this approach as all states disapears and the node death spirals\r\n\r\n- Also see https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/pull/3420\r\n",
