Please describe.**\r\nIf we want to prototype any phase1-related work, we will need the new phase1 params and types.\r\nPh1 params only add additional params.\r\nPh1 types, on the other hand, both extend existing types and add additional types.\r\n\r\nWhatever solution we choose, we should be mindful of backwards compatibility.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nOne solution would be to namespace our types by phase:\r\n```typescript\r\nimport {phase0, phase1} from \"@chainsafe/lodestar-types\";\r\nconst v: phase0.Validator = {...};\r\nconst vv: phase1.Validator = {...};\r\n```\r\nEvery extended type would simply be a new type definition, and we would be able to retain all existing types. All untouched types can \r\n\r\nThe config would be similarly namespaced:\r\n```typescript\r\nimport {config} from \"@chainsafe/lodestar-config\";\r\nconfig.types.phase1.Validator.toJson({...});\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n- Separate repos for different phases\r\n- Rename types to include phase in the name eg: Phase1Validator or ValidatorPhase1\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nSee https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase1/beacon-chain.md\r\n",
