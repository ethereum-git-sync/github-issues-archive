That's a hard ask since some issues are not reproducible.\r\n\r\nLighthouse logs to file by default, and I really think we should do the same. It would be incredibly helpful to debug situtations. Just tell users: \"can you please send us this log file you already have?\"\r\n\r\nProposed changes:\r\n- [ ] Set logFile to default location relative to dataDir, and enable\r\n- [x] Set logFileLevel to debug by default\r\n- [ ] Enable log rotate by default",
