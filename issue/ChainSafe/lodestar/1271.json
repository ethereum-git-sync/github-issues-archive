  "body": "The inital idea behind the different options and commands was as follows (things may have changed, this is the original conception):\r\n- `init` will write a beacon configuration (+ other configuration files) to disk\r\n  - the configuration it writes to disk is, by default, the default values of the Options\r\n  - the `templateConfigFile` overrides any default values\r\n  - cli flags (and env vars) can further override values\r\n  - the `configFile`, in this `init` context, is the _output_ of the command. It isn't used as input, because the purpose of the `init` command is to create the config when it does not exist. Overriding this value sets the location of where to write the generated configuation.\r\n\r\n- `run` will run the beacon chain with a configuration (+ other configuration files)\r\n  - the default values are, by default, the default values of the Options\r\n  - the `configFile` overrides any default values\r\n  - cli flags (and env vars) can further override values\r\n  - the `templateConfigFile`, in the `run` context, has no meaning. It isn't used because its purpose is simply as a _template_ for the config file written in the `init` step\r\n\r\nMy proposal is to refactor the process:\r\n- replace `beacon init` command with `init` with the following responsibilities\r\n  - initialize all configuration to disk (params (point 3 of https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/issues/1155) + beacon configuration + other configuration files)\r\n  - don't overwrite existing configuration, if it exists, check first and bail if it exists\r\n  - support verbose logs\r\n- rename `beacon run` command to `beacon`\r\n- in every command other than `init`, if `init` has not been called yet for that `rootDir`, call it first (possibly suppress this w an explicit cli flag)\r\n- `init` is left as a command that may be run explicitly, for the same reasons `beacon init` was separated from `beacon run` initially: to provide a step where sysadmins can verify/edit on-disk configuration files before running lodestar commands\r\n- `templateConfigFile` is either removed entirely, or only exists as an _advanced option_ in `init` using the original semantics. If it remains, it is intentionally _only_ available as a flag in the `init` command, having no effect in any other command.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @wemeetagain in https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/issues/1251#issuecomment-666527008_",
