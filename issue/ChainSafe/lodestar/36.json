  "body": "As we are converting this repository to typescript (and our other repos) and as we continue to build out the tooling necessary to implement our client, we will see an increase in the usage of packages in this repository. Currently, the repo is small and we have few (if any) outside packages in use and is not much of a concern. However, I think starting a discussion and thinking about what tools we can use to improve managing libraries early is important so that we have less surprises down the road.\r\n\r\nI discovered this tool called [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) that is being used for js-libp2p for managing JS projects with multiple packages.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts?\r\n\r\nCC'ing @GregTheGreek, @priom, @ansermino ",
