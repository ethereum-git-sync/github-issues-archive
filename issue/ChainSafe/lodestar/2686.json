This logic should happen in the worker side to reduce communication.\r\n- We can add logic to only allow this behaviour on certain work packets.\r\n- The BLS queue should not apply this strategy to work with a lot a signature sets, only to those with fewer than 3-5 (aggregates + attesations)\r\n\r\nStill WIP: How to efficiently force buffering without slowing processing when it's necessary? I.e. we don't want to slow syncing or block processing.\r\n- Def we should only buffer objects that request than. The gossip att and agg functions should pass a flag to the bls verifier\r\n- The BLS verifier can have two arrays (a, b) where it places objects depending on the current time.\r\n```ts\r\nonWork(work) {\r\n  if (work.shouldBuffer) {\r\n    if (now % 100 < 50) {\r\n      a.push(work)\r\n    } else {\r\n      b.push(work)\r\n    }\r\n  } else {\r\n    submitWork(work)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nwhen(now % 100 === 0, () => submitWork(a))\r\nwhen(now % 100 === 50, () => submitWork(b))\r\n```",
