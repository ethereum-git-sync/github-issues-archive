    "body": "It looks like your node has issues connecting to peers as well. Based on the logs it looks like a networking issue, see also the Erigon error.\r\n\r\nI am honestly not sure how to resolve this without knowing more details about your setup, it does not look like an issue with the client itself.\r\n\r\nBetter to move this discussion to discord as github is not great to debug such issues, could make sense to bring this up in eth-staker or gnosis discord, maybe someone had a similar issue before.\r\n\r\nAnd feel free to join the [Chainsafe discord](https://discord.gg/tvdwcAz4), can continue debugging in #lodestar-help channel if you are not able to find a solution for this.",
