Is this sufficient for the publicity aspect of being listed on Gitcoin? I don't believe anybody can send money to it so we don't need to worry about any donations. If it is sufficient, I can edit our ./github/FUNDING.yml file to update the link in our Lodestar repo OR we can get rid of this file altogether because the current link leads to a 404.",
