  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nThe current state from #71 and #73 would require us to pass around the state object on functions that mutate state which could become a bit difficult. If we switched to a class based approach we could access and manage state much easier.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIdeally, if we have something like `class BeaconChain {}` then we can get acccess to state via `this.state` and guarantee we're mutating the correct state (you can imagine, if we have async and non async actions flying around then theres a chance we would mutate state in the incorrect order). That being said the actual startup functionality should probably be changed over to a command line argument based setup.\r\n\r\nEDIT: expanded on `the correct one`.",
