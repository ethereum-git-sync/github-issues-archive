  "body": "This issue is to track the implementation of #5299 into Lodestar's logging. After the Shapella hard fork, we experienced a consistent, ignorable error messages relating to the `QUEUE_ERROR_QUEUE_MAX_LENGTH` which created a poor logging UX to users of Lodestar during the fork transition due to the flow of large batches of BLStoExecution messages. This is a wake up call for us to urgently implement the new logging policy for the next attainable release to fix our poor logging UX.\r\n\r\nThere are many errors we would like to fix listed in #4400 which should now also abide by the new policy.",
