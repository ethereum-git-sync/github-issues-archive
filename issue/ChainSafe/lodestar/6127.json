We have a bunch of references to the consensus spec, e.g. in the README\r\nhttps://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/blob/3f3a207643f6c35ae4b3cfe683cd167cfe70a2c3/README.md?plain=1#L8\r\n\r\nAll those references are kinda outdated as we already test against v1.4.0 (which has no major release yet) but could at least update to v1.3.0\r\nhttps://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/blob/3f3a207643f6c35ae4b3cfe683cd167cfe70a2c3/packages/beacon-node/test/spec/specTestVersioning.ts#L18\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @nflaig in https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/issues/6126#issuecomment-1824524736_\r\n            ",
