  "body": "Beacon node needs to provide suggestedFeeRecipient which could be a validator specific field. Since [timing preparePayload](https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/issues/3488 ) could be an independent operation from produceBlock api call by the validator, the BN needs to be aware.\r\n\r\nHow this can be achieved is in a bit of flux with the debate over if its Beacon/Validator driven. A [`prepare_beacon_proposer endpoint`](https://github.com/ethereum/beacon-APIs/pull/178) has been suggested for the same.. However some issues/race conditions have come up(https://github.com/ethereum/beacon-APIs/issues/187)\r\n\r\nTrack and discuss how to best implement this in lodestar.\r\n",
