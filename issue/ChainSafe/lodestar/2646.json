Please describe.**\r\n\r\nBuilding the docker image for Lodestar is very slow, since it has to install all dependencies and build everything. @mpetrunic  proposed to just do npm i @chainsafe/lodestar and run it which would be super fast. However we can't easily run nightly versions, which is what I need to do all the time.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nOn every commit to master publish a new `next` version to NPM only, not Github.\r\n\r\nTypescript does it, see as example: https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/main/.github/workflows/nightly.yaml",
