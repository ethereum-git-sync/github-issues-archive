  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nRight now, we are using a confusing solution to propagate default values for dependent `Option`s, involving parsing yargs args in a non-standard way.\r\nSee https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/blob/master/packages/lodestar-cli/src/util/parseArgs.ts\r\nSee https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/blob/master/packages/lodestar-cli/src/util/mergeOptions.ts\r\nhttps://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/blob/master/packages/lodestar-cli/src/cmds/beacon/options/index.ts#L19\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nInstead of continuously re-parsing args in the \"build\" stage, parse at the \"handler\" stage.\r\nRemove the \"default\" from the options that are dependent on other options, so that arg values can be null-checked to determine if they've been set or not.\r\n\"Downstream\" nullish args can be set based on \"upstream\" args in a utility function that resolves the arg heirarchy.\r\n\r\nThe one wrinkle to this is https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/blob/master/packages/lodestar-cli/src/cmds/beacon/cmds/run/index.ts#L19\r\nin `beacon run`, we're currently using the `args.config` value in the builder, before the handler runs. So in that case, we will likely still need to pre-parse the args to determine the correct `args.config`.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nKeep the solution we have now, more documentation on the nonstandard method we're using\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nSee https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/pull/1097 implementing the described solution for the validator CLI",
