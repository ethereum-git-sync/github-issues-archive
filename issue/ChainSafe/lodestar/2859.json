We can manually cache the roots that we need.\r\n\r\nThe lifetime of an AggregateAndProof is relatively simple:\r\n\r\n1. Gossip\r\n2. Validation queue\r\n3. Gossip validation\r\n  3A. Verify AttestationData signature. Compute the AttestationData root and keep it.\r\n  3B. Verify AggregateAndProof signature. Recycle AttestationData root to compute the signing root.\r\n4. Op pool: Reuse the already computed AttestationData root\r\n  4A. Block production\r\n  4B. Pruned\r\n\r\nA struct or even binary backed takes less memory, it's cheaper to deserialize and it's cheaper to access it's properties.",
