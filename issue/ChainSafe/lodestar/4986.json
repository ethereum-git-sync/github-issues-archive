  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nThere was a discovery made when wanting to import multiple keystores under different passwords that our validator `--importKeystores*` CLI doesn't actually import keystores and their password using the `--importKeystores` and `--importKeystoresPassword` flags. They act more like \"override\" or \"use only\" functionality. It will ignore what was already imported via `validator import`. \r\n\r\nExample: \r\nIf you run `validator import --importKeystores a`, then `validator --importKeystores b`, only keystore b will be used.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nThe nomenclature of `--importKeystores*` flags are not accurate and should be renamed. Options include using the word `override` or `use` instead of `import`. \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nFor now, documentation has been updated via #4985 for clarity, but this issue should be considered when making a big breaking change to Lodestar.
