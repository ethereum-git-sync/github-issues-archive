  "body": "The Number constructor is very unsafe because:\r\n- It takes `any` as parameter. If we change from passing a string to Number to some object Typescript will compile and we'll get `NaN`.\r\n\r\nIf you do a text search of the `Number` constructor there are many occurrences:\r\n- If Number arg is already an argument, remove\r\n- If Number arg is a string, use `parseInt()`\r\n- If Number arg is a bigint, use a custom util that types like `bigintToNumber(bn: bigint): number`\r\n\r\nIf the input of any of those functions is un-trusted data, verify the return is not NaN\r\n",
