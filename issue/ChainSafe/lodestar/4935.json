  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nCurrently we have to always fetch all historical deposits, even through we do a weak subjectivity sync. This enhancement supports extracting and downloading a compressed merkel tree that's enough to produce deposit proofs (in order to produce blocks), and we can build our partial merkle tree from there\r\n\r\nRefer to https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4881\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\n- Implement Deposit Contract Snapshot beacon api https://github.com/ethereum/beacon-APIs/pull/245/files . This depends on https://github.com/ChainSafe/ssz/issues/293 , this is likely for the public apis we already have.\r\n- Consume it when doing weak subjectivity sync\r\n- Prune deposit root tree when Eth1Data is considered finalized",
