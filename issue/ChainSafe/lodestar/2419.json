This meaning is not easy to get at first glance.\r\n\r\n**Proposed solution**\r\n\r\nCreate a helper function that clearly shows what it does that AND is type safe.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nfunction dropTree<T>(treeBackedValue: T): T extends ByteVector ? Uint8Array : T {\r\n  return treeBackedValue.valueOf()\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this code would read like\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst randaoReveal = dropTree(block.body.randaoReveal)\r\n```\r\n\r\ninstead of \r\n\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst randaoReveal = block.body.randaoReveal.valueOf() as Uint8Array;\r\n```\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nRelated to https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/issues/2408",

    "body": ":+1: A typesafe wrapper would be really nice. I suggest something like this exported from `@chainsafe/ssz`:\r\n```ts\r\nfunction toStruct<T extends CompositeValue>(value: T): T extends ByteVector ? Uint8Array : T {\r\n  if (isTreeBacked(value)) {\r\n    return value.toStruct();\r\n  }\r\n  return value;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nA note about the name, its not that we're dropping the tree but rather that we're converting the tree to a \"struct\", ie a primitive javascript datatype. (our `valueOf` method is an alias for `toStruct`)",
