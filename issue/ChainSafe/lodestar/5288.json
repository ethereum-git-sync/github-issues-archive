In my opinion, generally, the word `error:` should be reserved for issues where a user misconfiguration or inaction by the user created a problem. Thus, it should only be used as a way to prompt users that they _must_ do something to rectify it.\r\n\r\nIf it's not something a normal user can fix, it should be more of a warning type of message or something where stacktrace can be logged elsewhere but not saturate the CLI with endless errors a typical user cannot do much with.
