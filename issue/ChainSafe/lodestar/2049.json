  "body": "Research potential ways to improve epoch transition total CPU time\r\n\r\n- We might already have the balances in an array, would not need to compute this again\r\nhttps://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/blob/a5e8116af83df67faa0da2bff47d90f731fb523c/packages/lodestar-beacon-state-transition/src/fast/epoch/processRewardsAndPenalties.ts#L14\r\n- Improve creating the tree from balances. We might be able to use a BigUint64Array, then just chop up the underlying buffer into Uint8Arrays and manually create the leaf nodes. This solution might be faster than the default SSZ implementation\r\n- Investigate using a number instead of a BigInt when possible. For example for single validator deltas, math is much faster.\r\n- Remove forEach, reduce for a regular for loop if iterating over very large arrays. Merge multiple iterations if possible.\r\n\r\nBased on the profile of https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/issues/2046",
