  "body": "This issue can be used to discuss potential solutions to improving the security of how we currently manage keystore and password files.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, the Lodestar VC creates two folders the `keystores` folder which contains encrypted [BLS12-381 private keys](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-2335.md) and the `secrets` folder which contains the plain text passwords to decrypt the keystores. This setup does not provide any additional security for the private keys in the keystores as the encryption keys are stored on the same device and even the same folder in most cases.  The described setup relies on the file system access to be secure which is sufficient security for most setups but we are not getting any benefits from additionally storing user provided passwords in plain text to just storing the keystore files in an unecrypted format. The main concern here is that leaking the user password can have further consequences as a lot of users reuse passwords which might give an attacker further access to the operating system itself or other services.\r\n\r\nIn an ideal world, we **never** want to store the plain text user password, only the first time the user imports a encrypted keystore, the password should be interactively provided through the CLI or keymanager API. While this should be easily possible we still want to be able to restart the VC in case of a reboot without human interaction.\r\n\r\nPossible solutions to this problem\r\n\r\n1. store password files on a different device then encrypted keystores and only mount drive if required, we would still store the password but at least get benefits from encrypted the keystores as an attacker would need access to multiple devices\r\n2. use a remote signer/key manager, this solution already exists and seems to be a good option to improve security\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth those options are not really something we can influence on Lodestar directly as **1.** requires an advanced server setup and might not be suitable for most users and option **2.** requires to use another software component such as [web3signer](https://github.com/ConsenSys/web3signer).\r\n\r\nLooking forward to further ideas and suggestions on potential solutions we could directly implement in Lodestar itself.",
