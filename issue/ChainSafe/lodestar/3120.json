    "body": "because its an approximation as we skipped counting the queued but are deriving it from queued processing. so assume at sec 1 one gets 10 requests, which gets queued, on second 2 queued length processes those 10, so delta(total) - delta(queued processed) creates these artifacts. \r\n\r\n\r\nthe better solution will be to count queued in the same function scope as where we count total so that there is no drift when we do delta(total) - delta (queued). let me know if you would want me to make this change?",
