Please describe.**\r\n\r\nCurrently, we want to support client diversity by making it easy for users to migrate to Lodestar with minimal effort, which means being able to handle all types of encryption standards for EIP-2335. Prysm account export feature uses PBKDF2-SHA-256. We should support this in our validator client to help users easily migrate to Lodestar from Prysm by reusing their exported keystores.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nInclude support for PBKDF2-SHA-256 keystores as defined in the EIP-2335 spec:\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-2335.md#json-schema\r\n",
