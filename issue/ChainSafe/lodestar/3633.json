    "body": "Adding some discussion points from Devconnect here after speaking to @nflaig and conversations with other node operations teams. It seems like this would be a preferred approach to helping adoption and enabling node operators to work with Lodestar in their setups if this issue is completed. \r\n\r\n- Ethereum on ARM would be able to benefit from this and potentially look at running Lodestar on smaller, lower powered devices.\r\n- Other large node operators have expressed this to be an option for running Lodestar\r\n- We also benefit by having users of Lodestar running executables rather than building or using Docker to prevent user issues relating to package incompatibilities and it should always force users to use the most up-to-date supported dependencies such as node v20. \r\n- Should benefit UX for most node operators\r\n\r\nWe previously tried Caxa, but ran into issues with Windows binaries. This might not be a huge issue anymore if Windows users are able to benefit from WSL.",

Caxa does not seem to support cross-compiles but we might be able to just use a arm64 runner to built the binary for arm.\r\n\r\nI quickly looked at two other libraries similar to caxa\r\n- https://github.com/nexe/nexe\r\n- https://github.com/vercel/pkg\r\n\r\nFurther testing is required, need to do some research on different approaches used to bundle the binary.\r\n\r\nIdeally we want to publish binaries on github with every release, support linux (amd64/arm64), macos, windows, and also publish a verifiable signature for each binary.

    "body": "## Research\r\n\r\nI have researched and tested a few different tools but have not found an ideal solution yet\r\n\r\n### [pkg](https://github.com/vercel/pkg)\r\n- does not support node 20 https://github.com/vercel/pkg/discussions/1972 yet, project has maintenance issues\r\n- does not support ES modules https://github.com/vercel/pkg/discussions/1388\r\n- does not support worker threads https://github.com/vercel/pkg/discussions/2023\r\n\r\n### [nexe](https://github.com/nexe/nexe)\r\n- native module support is limited ([native-modules](https://github.com/nexe/nexe#native-modules)), [nexe-natives](https://github.com/nmarus/nexe-natives) offers potential workaround\r\n- prebuilt node binaries are not available for node 20 and must be compiled from source\r\n\r\n### [boxednode](https://github.com/mongodb-js/boxednode)\r\n- does not support multiple js files, requires to bundle Lodestar in single js file first\r\n- does not support ES modules https://github.com/mongodb-js/boxednode/issues/26\r\n\r\n### [sea](https://nodejs.org/api/single-executable-applications.html)\r\n- does not support ES modules\r\n- still experimental (stability 1)\r\n\r\n### [caxa](https://github.com/leafac/caxa)\r\n- has been archived / deprecated few days ago (Nov 21, 2023)\r\n- requires to arm64 runners to build arm64 binaries https://github.com/actions/runner-images/issues/5631\r\n\r\n### [package](https://github.com/radically-straightforward/radically-straightforward/tree/main/package)\r\n- successor of caxa, see [difference between caxa and package](https://github.com/radically-straightforward/radically-straightforward/tree/main/package#related-work)\r\n- does not produce single binary (might not be an issue)\r\n- requires to arm64 runners to build arm64 binaries\r\n\r\nAnother summary comparing different tools can also be found [here](https://github.com/leafac/caxa/tree/63f28fb7a1e62e9f08edd1a9f697e0ac5b7ecb85#prior-art).\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nBased on the research I think the only long-term viable solution that does not break between node versions is caxa (or package) as those just provide as thin wrapper around the source code and dependencies ([great video on how it works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRwxx2jc2zU)). All the other tools try to create \"real\" binaries but this causes too many issues especially due to the use of native modules and worker threads (and other low level APIs) in Lodestar. We also already know that caxa works on arm64 if build on an arm machine ([generatebinary.sh](https://github.com/EOA-Blockchain-Labs/ethereumonarm/blob/795fef1104d7dabfd6021dd55996526ec31d1da5/fpm-package-builder/l1-clients/consensus-layer/lodestart/generatebinary.sh)).\r\n\r\n## Issues\r\n\r\n- caxa does not support cross-compiles which means we have to use a arm64 runner to build the binary but github does not yet natively support it\r\n- attempt to built arm64 binary (https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/compare/unstable...nflaig/arm64-binary) does not fully work due to native modules as those are built for x86-64 and I haven't found a way to build aarch64 binaries\r\n\r\n## Possible solutions\r\n- self-hosted arm64 runner as suggested in [comment](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/issues/2536#issuecomment-766795411)\r\n- wait for native arm64 runners on github ([Q1 2024?](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/issues/2536#issuecomment-1789290633))",
