The Prysmatic Labs team uses Renovate to keep their packages up to date. The main issue I have with this is that it may break the code due to API changes,etc of a particular package.\r\n\r\nShould we manually update packages in order to easily spot code breaks or should we use something like Renovate to automatically do it for us?\r\n\r\nCC'ing @GregTheGreek, @priom, @ansermino ",
