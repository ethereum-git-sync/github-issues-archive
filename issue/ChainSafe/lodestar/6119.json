  "body": "### Problem description\r\n\r\nCurrently, our networking stack consists of a TCP transport, crypto and multiplexer to get Lodestar working via libp2p. We believe there is significant benefit to supporting the QUIC transport protocol which bundles these handshakes together into one handshake which may provide significant benefits to our networking stack. \r\n\r\nThis issue is to track the progress of our implementation of QUIC into our stack. \r\n\r\n### Solution description\r\n\r\nOur strategy is for quicker implementation is to look at NAPI-RS and the Rust implementation of QUIC (quinn-rs/quinn) and wrap it with the NAPI bindings. We aim to create a repo specifically for our implementation (@ChainSafe/quinn-ts) and to bring QUIC to Lodestar sooner.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_",
