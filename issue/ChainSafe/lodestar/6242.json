  "body": "### Problem description\n\nAs discussed [on discord](https://discord.com/channels/593655374469660673/605818244036821012/1186256566056390667) it would be useful to be able to configure a different builder URL per validator. It is relevant for DVT setups when running different solutions like Obol and SSV together via same beacon node which requires builder relays to be different. This can be achieved by running two local mev-boost instances with the specific relay configuration but right now it also requires to run multiple beacon nodes as it is only possible to configure one mev-boost instance per node.\n\n### Solution description\n\n**Solution 1**\r\n\r\nSimilar to the proposer settings file on the validator client we could introduce a  (builder) proposer settings file on the beacon node which allows to configure a builder URL per validator pubkey.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Solution 2**\r\n\r\nCould have a `profile` based approach instead of key based (as SSV is all automated) and the `builder_profile` would need to be passed by Obol or SSV in `produceBlockV3`. The `builder_profile` option could be integrated into the validator's proposer settings config and keymanager to allow key based configuration. And on the beacon node side we would require a `profilename => builder url` mapping with a `default` (current `builder.url` cli options will override/set the default).\r\n\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

    "body": "I think from a design perspective, if we had a profile based solution, does this give us much more flexibility to adapt to various DVT infrastructures? Both Obol and SSV function slightly differently and if we think about other upcoming infrastructures like Diva, it seems like with profiles we can customize more to adapt to the individual stack differences.
