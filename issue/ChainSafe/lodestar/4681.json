In order to build a PoS testnet that provides proofs in blocks, it would be great if it were possible to create a branch with the required fields to be added to the `ExecutionData`.\r\n\r\nThe `ExecutionData` needs to have two more, optional fields:\r\n\r\n * `VerkleProof`, a byte array of variable length\r\n * `VerkleKeyVals`, an array of (key, value) pairs, in which the key is a 32-byte vector, and value is a byte vector of length either 0 (missing value) or 32.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, there is no need to support forking as for this testnet, verkle trees are used since the genesis.\r\n\r\nIf present, these two fields should be propagated over the network with the rest of the ExecutionData so that other clients can inject these fields in their verkle-enabled EL.",
