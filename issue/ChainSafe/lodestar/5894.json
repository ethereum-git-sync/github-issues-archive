Large operators are recommended to include fallback URLs, but a validator still experiences 12 seconds of downtime until fallback kicks in\n\n### Solution description\n\nWe could add two new routes in a validator client API:\r\n- Route to check if any registered validator has block proposer duties: `/proposer_duties`\r\n- Route to call fallback first, switch URL priority for a limited period of time: `/fallback_first?duration_sec=1800`\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
