  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nWith CGNAT becoming more prevalent, peering is hard for users when IPv4 incoming connections are not available.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nSupport IPv6 for P2P. This could be done by doing dual-stack by default, and as well by allowing one v4 and one v6 `--listenAddress`. Lighthouse for example does `--listen-address 0.0.0.0 --listen-address ::` for dual-stack, and specifying only either gets you a v4 or v6 solo stack.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nP2P support is the driver, here. Metrics, REST, key manager, all can stay v4, at least initially. If it's trivial to make them dual-stack as well, by all means do, but for the bulk of users where this is an issue - home users with CGNAT - they'll have v4 available and they won't need to reach REST via v6 from \"the Internet\"\r\n",
