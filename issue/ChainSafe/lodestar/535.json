  "body": "Currently, the CLI is within the lodestar package. The idea is to move that into it's own package, so that the executable lives there. This will allow us to have a unified CLI to spin up a beacon node or validator client all in one place.\r\n\r\nThis is important to maintain our design philosophy and architecture.\r\nThe idea is our modules should not care about the external resources that we use, as long as the interface is compliant. Configuration of external resources should happen outside.",
