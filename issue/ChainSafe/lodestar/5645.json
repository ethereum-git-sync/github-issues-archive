  "body": "### Problem description\n\nWIth the `@lodestar/prover` we have the following scenario where we have to update the payloads in case of re-orgs. We need a better way to handle these re-orgs.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/blob/08b82af89f83e89ecaa164e8d94e4e296e0ee65e/packages/prover/src/proof_provider/payload_store.ts#L155-L159\n\n### Solution description\n\nOne solution could be that `lightclient` exposes a re-org event which tells the base slot where re-org happens and then `prover` should purge and update the payloads from that slot onwards. \n\n### Additional context\n\nThis issue was extracted from https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/issues/4706",
