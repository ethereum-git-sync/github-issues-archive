  "body": "@nazarhussain I noticed that the `validator_keys.cache` is stored in the same directory as my `validator_keys` folder which I set via `--importKeystores`. This is a not ideal in a containerized environment as the cache file is likely not mounted to the container or persistent in a volume. Maybe it would be better to store the cache file in the data directory (`dataDir`).\r\n\r\nIn our `docker-compose.validator.yml` file we also only mount the `/keystores` which would not include the cache file.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/blob/2042c3b1c1916ceed6bc825057515a4456c33a08/docker-compose.validator.yml#L4-L11\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @nflaig in https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/pull/5043#discussion_r1103874698_\r\n            ",
