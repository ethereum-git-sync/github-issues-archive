If this is normal we have to rethink the consumer code of chain because .getHead() is called very often.\r\n\r\nEDIT: In a new CPU profile 5.39% of total CPU time is spent in getHead(), that def seems excessive\r\n\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2021-05-01 15-32-32](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35266934/116784117-ba270a80-aa92-11eb-8d1a-3331a33666af.png)\r\n",
