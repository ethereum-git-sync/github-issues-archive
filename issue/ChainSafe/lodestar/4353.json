Please describe.**\r\n\r\nI observed recently that some code was pushed without proper linting to the PR, which result in the failure of the litning task in CI and delayed the response cycle. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nWe can add the Git commit hooks to run the linting and prettier before committing the code. This will cover most of the cases to lint the code and will speed up the development process. \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/husky\r\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/lint-staged\r\n",
