The implication is we want to reflect the weight of votes if effective balances of validators get changed.\r\n\r\nRefer to lighthouse for a reference implementation.",

But it's equally important to make sure it works correctly under adverse network conditions. Differences in fork-choice logic between clients can be grounds for attack, so everyone must follow the same spec to ensure a safe network ",
