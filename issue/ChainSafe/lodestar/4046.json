  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nIn a previous PR [here](https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/pull/3868), changes were made to allow ability to run metrics infrastructure (grafana /prometheous) locally on macos. \r\n\r\nMain changes in that PR involved not using `network_mode` since it is not supported in MacOS, see [here](https://docs.docker.com/network/host/) where it is stated:\r\n\r\n> The host networking driver only works on Linux hosts, and is not supported on Docker Desktop for Mac, Docker Desktop for Windows, or Docker EE for Windows Server\r\n\r\nThe workaround on MacOs is to use port mapping instead.\r\n\r\nThe PR also introduced using `host.docker.internal` instead of `localhost` as localhost does not work with Docker for Desktop for Mac.\r\n\r\nIn a follow up PR [here](https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/pull/3905) that de-duplicated files and re-organised the dashboard, the possibility to set needed endpoints via environment variable was introduced. Unfortunately this breaks the ability to run the dashboard on MacOs as it assumes `network_mode: host` works on MacOS\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nMake changes to make it possible to run metrics via (grafana/prometheus) on macos again. \r\nEnsure little duplication of configuration files as possible.\r\n",
