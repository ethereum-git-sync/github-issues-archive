I waited for about 15 minutes and sync never recovered and I quit the node.  Upon restart, the same results happen.  \r\n\r\nMy log from one of those restarts is attached here:\r\n[testlog.txt](https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/files/5171819/testlog.txt)\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n<!--A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.-->\r\nNot lose peers and continue syncing\r\n",
