  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nCurrently lodestar takes a lot of disk space, because it stores every new finalized state to disk.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nAn alternative would be to store states to disk every N epochs, or at most every N epochs. (I think some clients store as few as 1 state per 8196 epochs)\r\n\r\nThere's some discussion to be had around how specifically this should/could be accomplished. Here are two ideas.\r\n\r\nProposal 1:\r\nTrack epoch of latest stored state in `stateArchive`\r\nOn new finalized state: if newEpoch - latestStoredEpoch > N, store new state in `stateArchive`\r\n\r\nOn boot (eg: inside `BeaconNode#init`) feed any additional archived blocks into the chain.\r\n\r\nProposal 2:\r\nCreate a new db bucket or special entry `latestFinalizedState`\r\nOn new finalized state, always overwrite `latestFinalizedState`\r\nTrack epoch of latest stored state in `stateArchive`\r\nOn new finalized state: if newEpoch - latestStoredEpoch > N, store new state in `stateArchive`\r\n\r\nOn boot, use `latestFinalizedState` as anchor state to init the node.\r\n\r\n--\r\nWould like to get feedback / consensus on a direction before implementation.",
