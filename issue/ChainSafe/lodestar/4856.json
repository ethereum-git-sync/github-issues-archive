    "body": "Looking into moving the network into a thread. Some annoyances/hurdles (that could be treated as refactoring prereqs):\r\n- ~some consensus objects can't be `structuredClone`'d. Any BitArray gets converted into an object.~\r\n  - ~convert BitArray methods to functions?~\r\n  - ~build generic ssz type \"rehydrator\" to recursively convert any BitArray subproperties back into BitArrays?~\r\n  - transfer across thread boundary as bytes\r\n    - start with this, only consider ^ solutions if there are problems with this\r\n    - see if bytes can be [transferred](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Transferable_objects)\r\n- INetworkOptions can't be `structuredClone`d. Contains functions / instances\r\n  - refactor so it can be `structuredClone`d\r\n- Network submodules contain refs to chain / config\r\n  - worker can own its own config and clock\r\n  - any chain data required for init can be passed in worker data (initial validator count)\r\n  - gossip validation and req/resp handlers can be performed in main thread\r\n  - push chain.getStatus() into network worker on new head calculation\r\n- ~libp2p initialized at a higher level and passed into network constructor~\r\n  - resolved in #5131\r\n  - initialize libp2p inside the network module / worker",
