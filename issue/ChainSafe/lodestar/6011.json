There's a bit of maintenance friction that can be mitigated.\n\n### Solution description\n\nEvaluate, contribute to, and use the chainsafe eslint-config here and in our other repos.\r\nWe should upstream as many linter rules as we can (as many rules as makes sense).\n\n### Additional context\n\nSee https://github.com/ChainSafe/eslint-config",
