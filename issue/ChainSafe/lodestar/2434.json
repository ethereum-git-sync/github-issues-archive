It will continue reading all the keys in the background.\r\n\r\nThe issue comes from the many layers of wrapping:\r\n\r\n1. leveldb abstract down returns an iterator https://github.com/Level/level-js/blob/master/iterator.js\r\n2. levelup wraps that with which returns a readable stream https://github.com/Level/iterator-stream\r\n3. We wrap that with an `it-pushable` subscribing to the readable stream's callback\r\n\r\nWhen we just subscribe to the callbacks the iterator just does whatever in the background. it-pushable instance has no control over it.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nIf you break early out of `entriesStream` it should stop reading from the DB and cleanup.",
