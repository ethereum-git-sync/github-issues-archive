  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nThe documentation on how to run Lodestar on local testnet [here](https://chainsafe.github.io/lodestar/usage/local/) is no longer accurate and hence following the instructions does not work.\r\n\r\nOn a quick look I found the following issues:\r\n\r\n- It states that _State will be written to .tmp/state.ssz_ It seems state is now stored in $XDG_DATA_HOME/lodestar/$NETWORK/chain-db instead\r\n- The instructions included the `sync.minPeers` flag. This flag no longer exist\r\n- Instructions states to pass `--genesisStateFile ./dev/genesis.ssz` to the cli, but no mention on how to get the `genesis.ssz` file\r\n- The second command to run lodestar should probably include `--api.rest.port` to set the port number to something other than the default. Without this, a connection refused error prevents it from running as it classes with the first instance.\r\n\r\nHaving fixed the above issue locally, and was able to run the lodestar instances it looks like everything is still not quite right As I only keep getting the follow log message:\r\n\r\n> Eph 0/11 7.864 [VALI]             info: Node is syncing - Error on getProposerDuties - Service Unavailable: Node is syncing - waiting for peers\r\nEph 0/12 0.001 []                 info: Searching peers - peers: 0 - slot: 2065010 (skipped 2065010) - head: 0 0x8c0e…ee87 - finalized: 0x0000…0000:0\r\n\r\nLooks like no peer is being found.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nI'll like to find out the correct steps needed to currently have lodestar run in local testnet. After that, update the documentation as needed.\r\n",
