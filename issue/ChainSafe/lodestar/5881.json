    "body": "Thanks for the quick reply.\r\n\r\nI'm certain previous versions worked- I run Rocket Rescue Node for the Rocket Pool folks and we've been using basic auth with an hmac credential for a while now. I can see connections from lodestar clients still (presumably they just haven't updated yet):\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/assets/116244/aab54e82-e47b-4ec5-a295-1a70ecac1ee5)\r\n\r\nAs for `fetch`, I think their assumption is that they're running in a browser, and browsers have started disallowing `username:password` creds in the URI... which is especially frustrating given that `fetch` comes standard in Node 18.\r\n\r\nThat said, while the RFC specifically mentions deprecating `username:password`, userinfo is still a valid part of the authority section of the URL.\r\n\r\nAny non-browser-focused http library worth its salt should parse the `userinfo` element of the URI and encode it in the `Authorization` header before any http(s) requests are made- golang's standard http client does this automatically, for instance.\r\n\r\nIs it possible for Lodestar to parse the URI and populate the `Authorization` header when calling `fetch`? That would certainly solve our issue. If not, we can work with a cli flag that adds `Authorization` to requests, though I think this is more operational state to maintain- prysm has such a cli flag for grpc headers, and they occasionally forget to include them on requests.\r\n\r\nI can confirm that a small wrapper around fetch succeeds with the behavior correct:\r\n```javascript\r\nimport fetch from 'node-fetch';\r\n\r\nlet u = new URL(\"https://foo:bar@fbi.gov\")\r\n\r\nfunction fetch_internal(url) {\r\n  let stripped = new URL(url)\r\n  stripped.username=''\r\n  stripped.password=''\r\n  \r\n  let opts = {}\r\n  if (url.username) {\r\n    opts.headers = { \r\n      Authorization: `Basic ${Buffer.from(`${url.username}:${url.password}`).toString('base64')}`\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  fetch(stripped, opts)\r\n} \r\n\r\nfetch_internal(u)\r\n```\r\n",

The previous library allowing this and not populating the header was rather a bug and has been addressed by https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch/pull/1268 but they also just throw an error now as per spec.\r\n\r\n> Any non-browser-focused http library worth its salt should parse the userinfo element of the URI and encode it in the Authorization header before any http(s) requests are made\r\n\r\n> Is it possible for Lodestar to parse the URI and populate the Authorization header when calling fetch?\r\n\r\nThat makes sense to me and we can add that to our HTTP client.
