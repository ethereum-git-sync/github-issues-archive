Must investigate and ensure memory is released\r\n- [x] Instead of decrypting 100 keystores at once, decrypting 5-10 is fine, which provides a significant speed up. A good number would be to decrypt thread count at once\r\n- [x] Implement similar strategy to Prysm and Lighthouse where private keys are stored in a single keystore such that subsequent start-ups are fast\r\n",
