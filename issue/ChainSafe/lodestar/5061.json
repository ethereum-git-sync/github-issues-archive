Please describe.**\r\n\r\nCurrently, if you run a setup with multiple beacon nodes, there isn't an easy way for monitoring tools like Grafana to know exactly which beacon node the validator client is connected to. This would be useful for more sophisticated setups where it isn't a local environment with a 1:1 beacon node <> validator setup, or using remote beacon nodes. This is especially useful if we setup multiple fallback nodes in the `beaconNodes` array.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nA validator endpoint which tells us which beacon node it is currently connected to. Whether that is IP address or if we had a configurable parameter to name beacon-nodes that it would pull the name and/or IP address of what it's connected to so Grafana and other monitoring tools can see the current connection status.\r\n",
