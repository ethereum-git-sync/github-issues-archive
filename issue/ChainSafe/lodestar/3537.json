  "body": "While importing blocks, EL errors with various kind of errors (bad merkle state, internal error etc) as well as possible timeout/connection refused error.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of all these currently is that that block verification errors and the peer is downscored, which leads to downscoring/banning of peer and soon making lodestar loosing all peers and going out of sync! The lodestar doesn't find peers till the peerstore directory is removed and then the same cycle happens again (based on EL again erroring)\r\n\r\nExpected:\r\nThe EL executePayload call should be try catched for these errors, and a separate status responded from executionEngine, which should log the error, but lodesstar shouldn;t penalize these peers and also accept this blocks with syncing.\r\n\r\nHowever there is debate in the devnet debug group is that CLs should try discriminate these error (like treat merkle state error as invalid). Waiting till that discussion resolves.\r\n\r\nObserved with: lodestar <> nethermind ",
