  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nA light client might require the beacon state for all sorts of state proofs. In my case, I would like to use `block_roots` for ancestry proofs. I have a finalized beacon header, and now want to provide that a beacon header is an ancestor of the finalized header. To do that, I need at least one finalized header beacon state per sync committee period to import older beacon blocks.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nA flag to optionally persist the last finalized header beacon state on disk. A nice extra would be to say how many states should be persisted (e.g. 50, and if there are more states they will pruned).\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nI could update this parameter myself: https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/blob/unstable/packages/beacon-node/src/chain/archiver/archiveStates.ts#L12\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nContext on Discord: https://discord.com/channels/593655374469660673/621838504955084830/1074751947728498811",

    "body": "@g11tech I see you changed the issue title from \"last update\" to \"best update\". I am not sure \"best update\" will work, because say in sync period (of `64` slots) 1 the best update is slot `10`, and in the next update the best update is slot `120`, there will be a where the beacon state won't contain block roots for slots `11`-`63`. Unless I misunderstand how the best update works, maybe it already looks at the most recent block in a sync committee period.",
