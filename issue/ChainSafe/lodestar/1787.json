  "body": "Problem:\r\nWe used npm to distribute spec tests, but spec tests reached size limit of npm registry.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nExtend lodestar-spec-test-util to download spec tests archive from https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-spec-tests/releases/download/v1.0.0/general.tar.gz and resolve file path relative to extracted spec tests.\r\n\r\nMethod that should be extended:\r\nhttps://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/blob/master/packages/lodestar-spec-test-util/src/single.ts#L61\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is to add spec tests version as required param and extraction location as optional (defaulting to node_modules/.cache/@chainsafe/lodestar-spec-test-utils).\r\nUpon executing describeDirectorySpecTest, we should check whether directory <spec_tests_location>/<version> directory exists.\r\nIf it does resolve spec test path against it.\r\nIf it doesn't, download tar archives for given version extract them all into <spec_tests_location>/<version> location",
