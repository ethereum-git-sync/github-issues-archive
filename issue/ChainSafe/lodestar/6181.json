I opted to only log the URL which is actually used.\r\n\r\n@g11tech Is it intentional that we don't allow a fallback for the builder? I guess mev-boost is already doing the multiplexing and builder flow is stateful which makes fallback logic a bit problematic.\r\n\r\nMaybe we want to reflect that in the CLI as well as currently it looks like it supports multiple urls\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/assets/38436224/3feb859b-0374-4e33-afc5-df38029f36d7)\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @nflaig in https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/pull/6175#discussion_r1423131914_\r\n            ",
