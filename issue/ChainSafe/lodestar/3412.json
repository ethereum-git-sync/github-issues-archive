Note that our db schema will have to be updated to persist the block root to prevent re-hashing. For now peers will be accepted, since it's better than throwing an error on `getBlockRootAtSlot()` \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/blob/fbeabc6acb9bd9b018c10f58ee0d1291843371b0/packages/lodestar/src/network/peers/utils/assertPeerRelevance.ts#L97-L99",
