  "body": "Currently Lodestar follow the simpler strategy (1) on start-up to just consider the latest finalized state as the head. Then sync all blocks from finalized state to head from our peers, and re-populate fork-choice graph.\r\n\r\nAnother strategy (2) is to persist the fork-choice state (on shutdown and / or periodically) and restore that state on startup. This approach will prevent \"reverting\" the head to a much older state. This caused:\r\n- https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/issues/3647\r\n- https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/issues/3717\r\n\r\n**TODO**:\r\n- [ ] Research what each other client is doing\r\n- [ ] Estimate the positives of strategy (2) vs (1), specially in periods of long non-finality\r\n- [ ] Estimate the complexity of strategy (2) vs (1), and the cost of persisting this data + pruning.\r\n\r\nOnly if it's clear that **positives >> complexity + cost**, consider implementing.",
