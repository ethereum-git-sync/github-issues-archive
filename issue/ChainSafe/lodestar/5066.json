There are further unknown amount of references we would probably break but might not be a big deal and would be fixed sooner or later.\r\n\r\nCould maybe consider to publish an image (`chainsafe/lodestar-dashboards`) which includes all dashboards and other projects can get them from there. This would also be a possible solution to our local metrics setup as mentioned in [this comment](https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/pull/5123#issuecomment-1426768630).",
