  "body": "While syncing Altona, CPU profiler shows significant time spent in `archiveStates`, specifically, because we call `stateCache.values`, which iterates thru all states/contexts and copies them. Even though this is relatively lightweight, it adds up.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nSlow `stateCache.values` is a bottleneck.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\navoid calling `stateCache.values` alltogether. Ideally, we should be able to use the information from the `forkChoice` (with some minor refactoring) to figure out which stateRoots to remove. Currently, it seems we immediately delete the old `forkChoice` data, and only delete the old `stateCache` afterwards as a \"task\".\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nMake copying/cloning cheaper (we should try to do this too)",
