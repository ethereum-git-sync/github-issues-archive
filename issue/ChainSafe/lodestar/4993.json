  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nThe API client implementation is not fully compliance with the API specs. There are following observations. \r\n\r\n1. The API specs tend to specify two key information 1) Status Code 2) Response body \r\n2. The API client implementation only `resolves` with the response body and skip the the other piece of information \r\n3. For endpoints which are not returning body API client resolves to `undefined`\r\n4. For the endpoints which are returning multiple status codes e.g. `GET /eth/v1/node/health`, `POST /eth/v1/beacon/blocks`  there are no way to identify what response code was returned the API call. \r\n\r\nWith these observations, it's not easy to use the API client with any CL node which have fully compliance implementation. \r\n\r\nLodestar is missing some edge cases on implementation e.g. Lodestar writes the node health code as response body as well as status code. While reading it just reads the body and ignore the status code. \r\n\r\n**Proposals**\r\n\r\nThere are two approaches we can fix this issue. \r\n\r\n1. Resolve API calls with the either `response body` or `status code`. When response is available we resolve with it otherwise status code. This will introduce minimum change, but could introduce some confusion the API client users. \r\n\r\n2. Create a new response structure given below and always resolves with it. \r\n\r\n```js\r\n{ok: boolean, status: number, [body,result]?: T}\r\n```\r\nWith this approach API client user can get both information as response body and status code and use on his convenience. This approach would require a bit extra refactoring compared to option 1, but is more steady and future proof approach. \r\n\r\nWe can additionally create an optional config parameter for the API client `resolveErrorResponse: boolean`, if user set we can also resolve error response with `ok: false`. That should be a optional flag, if user want to avoid try/catch and alway check the response in data centric approach. ",
