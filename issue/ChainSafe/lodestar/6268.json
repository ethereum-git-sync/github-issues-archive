  "body": "### Problem description\n\nFor now next epoch shuffling computation in `afterProcessEpoch` takes the most time of epoch transition in normal condition. In some `gc` intensive condition, `processRewardsAndPenalties` takes more time (I used to see it took up to 1.8s) see #6229\r\n\r\nthis is a holesky profile:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"621\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-01-09 at 11 05 15\" src=\"https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/assets/10568965/5ab76cde-05ad-42f9-96b3-97610dac7eb3\">\r\n\n\n### Solution description\n\nas discussed with @dapplion we can go with these 2 approaches:\r\n\r\n- Right after `beforeProcessEpoch`, we have `nextEpochShufflingActiveValidatorIndices` and a finalized `randaoMixes`, we should be able to offload next epoch shuffling computation to a worker thread, and epoch transition becomes `async`\r\n- `unshuffleList` is the main part of shuffling computation, we should be able to implement it in assembly script importing `as-sha256` from there\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
