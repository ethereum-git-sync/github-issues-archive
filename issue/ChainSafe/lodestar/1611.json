  "body": "Currently, if we have a branch of blocks like block 1000 -> 1001 -> 1002 in block pools, when block 1003 comes, which is child of 1002, we emit parentRoot of 1003 which is 1002 as \"unknownBlockRoot\" event, but we have block 1002 in pool already.\r\n\r\nWe should emit the ancestor root of that branch instead, which is parentRoot of 1000.\r\n\r\nIn regular sync, I see we have a lot of blocks in pool but we keep emitting the latest block parent which we can't find in any sync peers because it's quite new, something like `410504,410505,410506,410507,410508,410510,410511,410489,410489,410491,410494,410513,410514,410488,410487,410485`\r\nWe should emit parent root of 410504, which is probably 410503 and gradually we go overlap to the followup beacon_block_by_range requests of regular sync faster.",
