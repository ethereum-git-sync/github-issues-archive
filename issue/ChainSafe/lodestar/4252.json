This happens because each `peer.lastReceivedMsgUnixTsMs` is checked before executing a ping, and this happens every call to `pingAndStatusTimeouts`. `peer.lastReceivedMsgUnixTxMs` doesn't have a chance to update until after a single ping is completed.\r\n\r\nThis same thing also happens with status requests for a similar reason.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nno simultaneous ping or status requests to a peer.",
