It's not a lot but it could be less.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nLogging should have a near 0 impact on performance. Review if https://github.com/pinojs/pino can achieve this. Fun fact we are already using pino within fastify, it shows up in the profiler.\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce**\r\n\r\nRun the multiNodeSingleThread test with 128 validators per node and attach a profiler\r\n\r\n",
