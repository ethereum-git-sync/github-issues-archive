This log mostly means there is no bid greater than our `min-bid`\r\n- % of block produced locally panel is not easy to view, if I change the rate_interval to 7d the value is >50% - need to double check\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1348\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-11-14 at 14 05 05\" src=\"https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/assets/10568965/953b6e11-5af4-40c9-abc8-19d5b3dc83b5\">\r\n\n\n### Solution description\n\nAdd metrics to grafana dashboard (may need to enhance lodestar):\r\n- fix % of published local block (see above)\r\n- histogram metrics of block value for both types of blocks\r\n- track all results of `mev-boost` requests. At least we should able to answer how many \"getHeader\" requests returning no bid (\"`no bid received`\" log in `mev-boost`)\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
