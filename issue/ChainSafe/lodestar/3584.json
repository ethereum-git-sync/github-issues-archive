Please describe.**\r\n\r\nWhen our node is super busy, we can't even handle `ping` message on time:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngrep -e \"message=Timeout\" -rn beacon*-05.log  | grep \"Resp error method=ping\" | wc -l\r\n122\r\n```\r\n\r\nat that time, our clock is drift, it's our own issue and we should not downscore peers if our p2p requests return timeout error. Found a lot of request timeout errors from our log:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngrep -e \"code=REQUEST_ERROR_DIAL_TIMEOUT\" -rn beacon*-05.log | wc -l\r\n138\r\ngrep -e \"code=REQUEST_ERROR_TTFB_TIMEOUT\" -rn beacon*-05.log | wc -l\r\n25\r\ngrep -e \"code=REQUEST_ERROR_RESP_TIMEOUT\" -rn beacon*-05.log | wc -l\r\n6\r\ngrep -e \"code=REQUEST_ERROR_REQUEST_TIMEOUT\" -rn beacon*-05.log | wc -l\r\n29\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich result in losing a lot of peers\r\n\r\n<img width=\"787\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-01-07 at 14 24 44\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10568965/148507498-b6bd7aa2-dab4-488e-b311-5db2fb51297f.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\n+ If we can't handle ping requests on time, don't penaltizing peers for request timeout errors in the next x minutes.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\n+ Detect clock drift issue in the node and don't penaltizing peers for request timeout errors at that time\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nThis issue happens during prater non-finality time, some nodes have only 2 peers and have to wait for 1 day to get more peers to recover.\r\n",
