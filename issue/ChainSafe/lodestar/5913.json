  "body": "### Describe the bug\n\nThere has been a recent occurrence, and it seems to be getting more frequent where our end-to-end and simulation tests either hang or fail for unknown reasons.  In many instances the tests are running for several hours which also increases our CI budget from the excess VM time.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nSim tests and e2e tests should run to completion in a “reasonable” amount of time.  They should also all be passing.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nAdd a PR that merges to unstable and CI will run.\n\n### Additional context\n\nIt seems like this behavior started within the last month or two so maybe back to June/July time is when it began but perhaps it was earlier.\n\n### Operating system\n\nLinux\n\n### Lodestar version or commit hash\n\nBranches from unstable",
