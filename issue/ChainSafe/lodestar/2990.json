I found this: [lerna/lerna#1893](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/issues/1893)\r\n> > > Association with the current NPM versions is very hard. If the published version is `foo@0.1.5-alpha.124`, I have to count 124 commits up from `0.1.4` or go through CI logs to figure out which commit that version is tied to. If it were `foo@0.1.5-alpha.124.3d6bee55` or `foo@0.1.5-alpha.3d6bee55` it would be much easier.\r\n> > > It looks like Lerna is publishing with the `+${sha}` suffix, but it seems NPM is stripping it out. If that's the case, why is this format [not configurable](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/blob/master/commands/publish/index.js#L359)?\r\n> > \r\n> > \r\n> > At first glance, there seems no easy way to force lerna to do that properly.\r\n> \r\n> What if we write our own version format? Not use any counter at all and only the commit hash:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> 0.28.2-dev.022659b5fc0\r\n> ```\r\n\r\n@dapplion I'm totally down to change the version strings to our custom format. This, however, might change the release process (and ci scripts) that basically just used `lerna publish`.\r\n\r\nI'll leave this open for discussion and maybe I can find a suitable alternative to `lerna` during the week.",
