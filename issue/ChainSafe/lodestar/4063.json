The ones I see are for either [generating client libraries](https://openapi-generator.tech/) from the OpenAPI schema, or [this paid tool](https://swagger.io/solutions/api-testing/) that offers help with testing.\r\n> \r\n> The only way I found to validate the response is to use a tool like Ajv to check that the response from the API conforms to the OpenAPI spec.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=openapi+to+json+schema+converter\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/openapi-contrib/openapi-schema-to-json-schema\r\n\r\nUsing generated client libraries may also work but may be more complicated\r\n",

The output of the conversion, can't also be used directly for comparison in tests. As the tests needs to validate that the json returned by the API is the same as what is specified in the spec. \r\n\r\n> Using generated client libraries may also work but may be more complicated\r\n\r\nI'll check this out but I am not sure how that will work, The client libraries will be generated client code that calls the API, they might not have facility to validate the response. And we do not need client code to call the api as we have that already in lodestar itself. ",
