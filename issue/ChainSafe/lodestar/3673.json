  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nWhile working on issue #3568, I noticed a couple of things not consistent or confusing regarding how some peer discovery settings are configured and used. \r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n- We configure the libp2p node to use Bootstap and MDN as peer discovery mechanism but we essential switch it off by setting both `peerDiscovery.autodial` and `connectionManager.autodial` to off. Is it not better (less confusing) to remove the peer discovery configurations, if it is not going to be used and handle discovery and peer dialling in code as we are doing in the `discover.ts`?\r\n- It seems `network.discv5.enabled` is not being used in the code (at least I could not find where it is being used) Confirm if it is used. If not, should it be used to determine if to connect to peers based on `network.discv5.bootEnrs`? or it has another purpose?\r\n- What is the difference between `network.bootMultiaddrs` and `network.discv5.bootEnrs`. Is `network.bootMultiaddrs` now redundant? and can it be removed?\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nLook into the questions raised above, and work on any follow up tasks if required (code changes, update to documentation etc) \r\n",
