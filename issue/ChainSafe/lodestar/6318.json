  "body": "### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nCurrently with how sim test is set up with `ethereumjsdocker`, `gethdocker` and `netherminddocker`, it requires docker to use host network to run. \r\neg.  In gethdocker/post-merge.sh: `docker run ... --network host ... $EL_BINARY_DIR ...`\r\n\r\nHost network driver is not available on Mac and Windows as per https://docs.docker.com/network/network-tutorial-host/#prerequisites . So we can either \r\n1) Mention in the contribution [doc](https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/blob/unstable/docs/pages/contribution/testing/simulation-tests.md?plain=1) that `yarn test:sim` is not available in the aforementioned platforms. Which should be fine as contributors rarely need to run sim tests locally but to pass the CI.\r\n2) Deploy a workaround suggested by the official docker [docs](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/networking/#i-want-to-connect-to-a-container-from-the-host) which forwards the necessary ports to the host ie. `-p $ETH_PORT:$ETH_PORT -p $ENGINE_PORT:$ENGINE_PORT`. Note this way we will also need to update the address the EL client listens to. For example `--http.addr 0.0.0.0 --authrpc.addr 0.0.0.0` for geth. \r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nTo run sim tests `yarn test:sim` locally on Macs and Windows without error\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Operating system\r\n\r\nmacOS\r\n\r\n### Lodestar version or commit hash\r\n\r\nv1.14.0",
