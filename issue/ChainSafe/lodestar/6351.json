  "body": "After reviewing the spec values I noticed we are still missing plenty of network values which should be part of the config ([configs/mainnet.yaml#L113-L150](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/3727a757450feb6110e2d4e403604572a478343d/configs/mainnet.yaml#L113-L150)). We either don't support them or those are defined as constants.\r\n\r\nI looked into refactoring this to move all of the constants into config but not all parts of the code that use those values can get access to configs easily, for example values used in `rateLimitQuotas`\r\nhttps://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/blob/2db7120f3534faf5c023954f4065912dd0c2691f/packages/beacon-node/src/network/reqresp/rateLimit.ts#L11\r\nWhile it should be possible to refactor the code to make this work, I think we should avoid large changes before the Deneb hard fork as current configuration is well tested already and there is no specific requirements to move those values from constants to config.\r\n\r\nFrom https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/pull/6328",
