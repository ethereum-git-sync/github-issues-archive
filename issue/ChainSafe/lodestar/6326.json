Note that this `fork_version` may be different from the one used to verify the `optimistic_update.sync_aggregate`, which is based on `optimistic_update.signature_slot`.\r\n\r\nI don't think we are following the spec here, but based on our current design of spec types it is difficult to use a different fork type for nested properties. \r\n\r\nThis seems to be mostly relevant during a hard fork and only if the `SyncAggregate` changes between those forks.\r\n\r\n@wemeetagain @g11tech any thoughts?\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @nflaig in https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/issues/6309#issuecomment-1899215202_\r\n            ",
