This issue is similar to #5477 but specifically to expose the timing of the next attestation and/or upcoming block proposal via logs. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nThe VC log would (similarly to the BN) show a line every slot (12s) and will include an extra output of `nextAttestation` and/or `nextProposal` or something similar to indicate upcoming duties for the attached validators.\r\n\r\nImplementation in Nimbus:\r\n![image](https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/assets/58080811/d714fd93-c8e1-494b-95d9-ede0f0f45063)\r\n",
