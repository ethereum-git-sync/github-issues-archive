Unfortunately this is not very customizable and always pollutes the logs. It is also not easy to export these profiles to other places, eg: metrics.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nDo profiling separately from logging, using separate tooling.\r\nWe can then log the results under a high logging level and create/populate additional metrics that track profiling results.",
