  "body": "> The requester MUST wait a maximum of TTFB_TIMEOUT for the first response byte to arrive (time to first byte—or TTFB—timeout). On that happening, the requester allows a further RESP_TIMEOUT for each subsequent response_chunk received. For responses consisting of potentially many response_chunks (an SSZ-list) the requester SHOULD read from the stream until either; a) An error result is received in one of the chunks, b) The responder closes the stream, c) More than MAX_CHUNK_SIZE bytes have been read for a single response_chunk payload or d) More than the maximum number of requested chunks are read.\n\nI would propose adding another transform function to pipe reading responses (after response decoding).",
