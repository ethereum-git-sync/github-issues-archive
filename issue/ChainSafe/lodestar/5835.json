    "body": "@HiroyukiNaito This is not quite correct. The `block_id` can be one of: `\"head\" (canonical head in node's view), \"genesis\", \"finalized\", <slot>, <hex encoded blockRoot with 0x prefix>`, see https://ethereum.github.io/beacon-APIs/#/Beacon/getBlockAttestations for further details. \r\nIf you provide a number like 2900001 it will query for the block in the slot. To query for a specific block you have to provide the hex encoded block root with 0x prefix.\r\n\r\n@araskachoi Regarding your issue, I need to check what the expected behavior is if the slot you query for does not have a block, I would expect that it should throw a \"not found\" error and not return the block of a previous slot. Returning data from another slot seems like a bug.\r\n\r\n**Edit:** I was thinking for some reason the API you called is `/eth/v2/beacon/blocks/{block_id}` which should not give you a block of a different slot but will throw if the slot is empty. As Lion mentioned the block itself contains data like attestations with different slot numbers.",
