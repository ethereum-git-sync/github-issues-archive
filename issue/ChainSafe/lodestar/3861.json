That seems to be insufficient since after a while kiln-lodestar exits with exit code 137. When running in-terminal, the container suddenly disappears (due to `--rm`) and when running detached the container keeps restarting from slot 2112 (due to `--restart unless-stopped`).\r\n\r\nWith 4.00 GB it gets as far as slot 35904, and with 8.00 GB it appears to work fine.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nWhen a container exits abnormally, the script should inform the user. The user should be informed about the memory requirements.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n- OS: macOS Monterey\r\n- Branch: master\r\n",
