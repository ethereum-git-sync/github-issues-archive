Please describe.**\r\n\r\nWe should use number whenever possible as BigInt calculation is about x250 times slower as analysed by @dapplion \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\n1. effectiveBalance is always a multiple of 1e9 and it's <= 32*1e9 so should be able to track 30, 31, 32 instead of BigInt(30 * 1e9), BigInt(31 * 1e9), BigInt(32 * 1e9). This would resolve issue #2747\r\n2. In `epochProcess.ts`, totalActiveStake, prevEpochUnslashedStake and currEpochUnslashedTargetStake could also be tracked as number since they are sum of effectiveBalances\r\n    + May need to tweak a little bit for some functions like `computeBaseRewardPerIncrement(), processEffectiveBalanceUpdates()`\r\n    + Need to do an inventory for the usage of all of these variables but as far as I see it's all multiply/divide by `EFFECTIVE_BALANCE_INCREMENT` and this constant (1e9) is not likely to be changed\r\n\r\nThis should speed up `beforeProcessEpoch()` and some other calculations a lot since we don't have to deal with BigInt() there",
