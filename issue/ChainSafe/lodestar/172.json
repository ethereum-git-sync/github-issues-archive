(Implementation should be stubbed because we don't have proper bls implementation).\r\n- add to `beacon command, in cli, option `--validator <privateKey<`, generate public key from private key and submit along with rpc url to validator options.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n<!--A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.-->\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n<!--Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.-->\r\n",
