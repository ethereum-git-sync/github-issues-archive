  "body": "Currently, (as per #1806 ), we do `--testnet mainnet` to run lodestar on mainnet.  I did this for convenience so i didn't have to restructure the current --testnet logic.  Said current current logic (i.e. much of the architecture of `lodestar-cli`) is centered around the assumption that we have a `--testnet` flag passed in order to bootstrap us to a valid eth2 environment.  \r\n\r\nThis issue proposes to allow the user to bootstrap to mainnet without the `--testnet` flag (i.e. like `node lodestar beacon` instead of `node lodestar beacon --testnet mainnet`.\r\n\r\nOr maybe some feel it's not a big deal to leave as is (i.e. running as `--testnet mainnet`)?  Would be interested to hear everyone's thoughts.",
