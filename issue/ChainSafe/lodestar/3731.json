Lodestar's behavior in this is as expected and as per the optimistic specs.\r\n#### Kiln v2\r\n- [x] https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/pull/3777\r\n- [x] Rename random to prevRandao https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/pull/3787\r\n~~- [ ] Add engine_exchangeTransitionConfigurationV1 https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/pull/3785~~  moved to https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/issues/3945\r\n\r\n#### Devnet -5\r\n- [x] https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/pull/3821\r\n\r\n#### Kiln\r\n- [x] kiln network config update\r\n\r\n#### [Kiln spec v2.1](https://hackmd.io/@n0ble/kiln-spec#v21-change-set )\r\n- [x] https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/pull/3855",
