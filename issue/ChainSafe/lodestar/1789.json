  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nRight now an epoch processing take at least 2 validators loop, note that each validator loop is very expensive with TreeBacked data structure.\r\n\r\nI used to see some epoch state transition take more than 5s, some are up to 10s because we loop through validators multiple times (to prepare epoch, to rotate epoch, to slash validators, to process validator exits etc), this does not count the BLS signature verification. The goal is to loop through validators array only 1 time.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n+ Create a wrapped BeaconState inside lodestar-beacon-state-transition. The interface should be extended from BeaconState to ensure we don't break the current code.\r\n+ Cache a validator array inside that when preparing epoch.\r\n+ For reading loop, use the cached validators array. The performance should be way better than looping through TreeBacked data structure.\r\n+ When writing a validator, write to both the cache and the real TreeBacked<Validator>\r\n+ The cached validators array should be short-lived during an epoch process in order not to consume memory",
