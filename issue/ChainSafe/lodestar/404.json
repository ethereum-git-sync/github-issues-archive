    "body": "It’s also important to note that this can be quite decoupled from the JSON-RPC a node uses. That said, a few wish list items:\r\n\r\nThe sendTransaction should return the signed transaction, not a hash. The hash is easy to compute from the signed transaction, and this also lets the nonce, gas price, etc that the node filled in. That said, I would also like to see the sendTransaction (not to be confused with sendRawTransaction), signMessage, and other account operations moved out of the node, in general. Basically the same divide ethers makes between the AbstractProvider and AbstractSigner.\r\n\r\nA much bigger discussion is a reasonable pagination system for Logs. Like continuing from a given block number and log index, and a maximum number of entries to return. This would also allow for real-time queries.\r\n\r\nI’m sure I’ll have more. Lemme think for a while. :)",
