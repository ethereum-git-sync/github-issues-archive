  "body": "Debugging sim tests is time consuming. Having access to metrics and logs indexing would be a huge productivity boost. I propose:\r\n\r\n- Setup a new independent external Prometheus server to collect metrics\r\n- Setup Loki + Prometheus in sim test runs\r\n- Send logs + metrics to external Prometheus with label that's unique to each run. It must include at least `run_id = $GITHUB_RUN_ID_$GITHUB_RUN_NUMBER` and should be prepended by git data like branch name (see ref https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/environment-variables#default-environment-variables)",
