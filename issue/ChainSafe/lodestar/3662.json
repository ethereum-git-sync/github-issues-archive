  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nLodestar does not have a clear positioning that highlights how it is different and unique amongst other clients out there. We think such clear positioning, if present and consistently communicated, will help in making it clear why users should run Lodestar: thereby increasing adoption and also improving ethereum client diversity. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nFirst step towards a solution is to discuss and formulate the unique selling proposition for Lodestar. This is the reason behind the creation of this issue. It should serve as a placeholder for the discussion. \r\n\r\nThis should then be proceeded by agreeing on what the unique selling proposition should be and use that consistently in marketing endeavours.\r\n\r\nSome suggestions regarding this include:\r\n\r\n- Lodestar as the client that finally makes the dream of light client a reality\r\n- Lodestar as a community of Ethereum POS libraries\r\n- Lodestar as an accessible project (built with TypeScript) hence one developers can easily contribute\r\n\r\nWe also need to look into the resource utilisation of Lodestar and perhaps there could be characteristics that could also be presented as unique selling points.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nDuring the Lodestar planning meeting on 21/01/2022 it was stated that the content of the lodestar website will get a review/revamping. In other to make such a revamping worthwhile and effective, it was stated that we first need to identify what makes Lodestar unique, and why users should run Lodestar instead. Having a clarity on this would help in shaping the content review of the website and other marketing activities. \r\n\r\nThis issue is meant to track this discussions.\r\n",
