In that situation everything is extremely slow. The precompute epoch kicked in and ran an epoch transition which according to metrics had a total async time of 36 sec. \r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2021-12-12 12-01-39](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35266934/145709838-f27c9aa6-c970-44d5-88b2-77a7a44522d6.png)\r\n\r\nThe resulting state is guaranteed to be useless. However it does not show up in the \"Precompute Epoch Transition\" \"Hit vs Miss\" chart\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2021-12-12 12-06-33](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35266934/145709865-765fc1aa-b05f-45ed-80f7-d6cc991953b8.png)\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\n- Consider disabling precompute epoch on overloaded nodes. This item is not a priority, since we should work on preventing the node from getting overloaded in the first place.\r\n- Review metrics, the state above could not have been used but it still didn't show up as wasted. Maybe I'm missing something?\r\n\r\nAlso the charts could be improved, it's very hard to get a picture of what's going on with the way the info is provided now. For example the chart \"Run Result\"\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2021-12-12 12-14-19](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35266934/145710077-a3e7bbe1-f668-4376-a720-9d89f01daf27.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nIs answering the question \"What's it the run result of each epoch?, skipped or done? In my opinion doing this tweaks it looks much better\r\n- Scale up to rate per epoch\r\n- Stack\r\n- Reduce interval rate\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2021-12-12 12-11-06](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35266934/145710031-067973ee-0ad1-436d-bc09-6bd22a051bca.png)\r\n\r\nNow you can clearly see that:\r\n- exactly once run is done per epoch\r\n- the % of skipped runs\r\n",
