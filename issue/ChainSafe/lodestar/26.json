    "body": "Finally some internal engagement. \r\n\r\nAnyway, we should create a separate issue in order to discuss using bignumber.js in addition to buffers or not using buffers at all and just using bignumber.js. The bignumber.js library supports endianess for numbers and let's us convert to a buffer array later on. I think we should do some benchmarking in order to decide since it would also affect the ssz library.",
