    "body": ":pray: Thanks for helping bump this, we're struggling w this right now.\r\n\r\n- Current strategy\r\nManually publish to npm as versions get bumped, mainly due to breaking changes or wanting to use a package with another externally. We've been somewhat lacking in this, as latest published version has sometime fallen behind latest versions on github.\r\n\r\nWe hoped try moving to publishing in CI, so that if a new version was detected in any of our package.jsons, that new version would be published to npm.\r\nAnother idea we've been thinking about is switching to a single version for our monorepo packages, and upgrading them in lockstep w lerna.\r\nAlso, right now, creating a changelog would be a pretty painful process, it may be nice to experiment with [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).\r\n- Are there releases yet?\r\nWe've published a bunch of our auxiliary / utility packages to npm, but we have no published _lodestar_ releases.\r\n- Where are you releasing?\r\nI think it would be great to release on github, with a changelog and 'github release' page. Currently we're more focused on publishing packages to npm.\r\n- Are you using gitflow?\r\nNo, not currently. We mostly just have master. If there's a somewhat bigger feature, we'll create a branch for that (eg: 0.9.x upgrading to 0.9 of the spec).\r\n- Whats master? whats alpha? whats 0.9.x?\r\nmaster is most recent working version\r\nalpha is a stale(?) branch\r\n0.9.x is upgrading to 0.9.x of the spec\r\n- How can I help facilitating a release process?\r\nIf you have any suggestions, love to hear them.\r\nIf you see anything here that you think you can fix, please do it. We'll be really thankful. :pray: \r\nIf there are any low-hanging fruit we can do to make things more organized, I'd love to start there.",
