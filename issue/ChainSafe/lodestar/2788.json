We could use this PR as reference, the cache strategy is pretty solid and sufficiently DOS resistant https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/2319\r\n\r\nNote that given that Lodestar is a minority client this change is **not a priority**. Adding this cache benefits large stakers that send eager attestations. Since Lodestar always waits for the 1/3 mark in Lodestar only devnets it won't have much effect either.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @dapplion in https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/issues/2754#issuecomment-872936247_",
