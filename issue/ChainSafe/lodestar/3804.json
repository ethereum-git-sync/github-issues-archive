Node starts with latest finalized\r\n- 2. Node connects with some peers who label as \"Advanced\" and trigger a head sync\r\n- 3. Do a head sync up to the peer's head. Chain processor logs confirm that all blocks are processed successfully\r\n- 4. However, the node's head is still the initial finalized state\r\n- Repeat 2 -> 4 until for some reason the fork choice actually sets a new head\r\n\r\nRange fill metrics show the head sync that completes fast and then all peers are labeled as \"Synced\" because their head is known to the forkchoice.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2022-02-28 16-58-20](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35266934/155976117-7b5c1075-0a96-4611-9046-784f64eadcea.png)\r\n\r\nFork-choice metrics show that it is called, but the findHead() isn't actually run\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2022-02-28 17-00-19](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35266934/155976423-be3e0a37-1685-4a89-b105-92cdd85e8e0c.png)\r\n\r\nBlock processor metrics show all blocks processed\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2022-02-28 17-00-35](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35266934/155976763-5f97e8a3-a743-47f6-a73f-3d412997264c.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nUpdate head as the node syncs",
