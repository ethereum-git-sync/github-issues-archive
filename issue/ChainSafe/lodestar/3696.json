    "body": "IRT this discussion, it would be good to liaise with some of the other client teams to see how we can go about doing this. \n\n- Publishing checkpoints on our domain or other trusted channels (Discord/Twitter) seem to be a good idea to ensure we're all using correct checkpoints. \n\n- Not much consensus on baking checkpoints here as we shouldn't be making the determination of a \"correct chain\" for our users. \n\n- Not entirely sure about utilizing a eth2-ws-provider as it's another vector of attack. Can use more discussion on this one and how it works so we can mitigate any centralized points of failure. \n\n- We can have some non-default flag like `--trust-lodestar-ws-checkpoint` as suggested by @wemeetagain ",
