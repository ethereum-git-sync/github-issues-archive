  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nRight now we wrap gossipsub `processRpcMessage` function in our gossipsub queues so that we only call `getMsgId()` in our queue, note that `getMsgId()` function is not cheap at all because it involves compressing message in order to compute message id.\r\n\r\nThis helps us gain better performance when we have to drop gossip messages from our queue, see #3554 metrics of a `subscribeAllSubnets` node.\r\n\r\nHowever, when we do that we send different copies of same attestation, for example, to our queues and queue size is just the same.\r\n\r\n+ This https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/issues/3732#issuecomment-1033431847 shows that gossipsub sends too many messages to our queue and it causes performance issue there (thanks for this, we found `array.shift()` has a performance issue too)\r\n+ This is possibly the root cause of https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/issues/3691 because different copies of same block is sent to our queue\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\n+ With new gossipsub in #3661 , we use `fast_msg_id` function to detect message duplication instead of `getMsgId()` so we don't need #3554 any more\r\n+ Plus other issues described above, I think we should revert #3554",
