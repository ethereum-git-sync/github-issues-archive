  "body": "I'd recommend to bring back the default `good-first` and `help-wanted` labels for issues instead of the customized `meta-good-first-issue` or `meta-help-wanted`. Good first and help wanted are 'special' labels within Github itself which can be used as standards across repos, e.g. explorers, queries, etc. like your contribute page\r\nhttps://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/contribute\r\n\r\nBut also allows 3rd-party website and integrations to query those over Github's API\r\nE.g. https://www.useweb3.xyz/contribute\r\n\r\nThis would make it a lot easier for first-time contributors to find and explore such issues.",
