    "body": "On further digging through realized that the the forks were lined up at 0-> `phase0`, 1 -> `altair`, 2-> `bellatrix`. `phase 0` and `altair` were subscribed at/before epoch 0, but the `bellatrix` fork subscription was never happening.\r\n\r\nOn further digging, figured out that `getActiveForks` being used to subscribe new forks on `onEpoch` in the network, wouldn't even get bellatrix till epoch 4. because the getActiveForks shifts the epoch back by 3 to calculate current and next epoch, so till epoch 3, it would only give `phase0`, and `altair`.\r\n\r\nHowever our bellatrix epoch is at 2. So hence the bug!!!",
