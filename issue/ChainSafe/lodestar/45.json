    "body": "Yeah, the blake2 library in use was from way back when the spec just came out.\r\n\r\nI see 2 sides of this: write our own in typescript/wasm and get it audited. Note that writing a safe hash function library is no joke but I'm up for the challenge. Or, use the one thay @gregthegreek suggest that appears to be un-audited at the moment. It would be great to minimize the amount of external dependencies since it makes it easier to audit + we don't need to worry about licensing. ",
