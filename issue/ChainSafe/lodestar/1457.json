  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nAccording to the spec https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/fork-choice.md#get_latest_attesting_balance\r\nAttestations should be weighted by the balance at the justified state. Currently we're using the balance at the target state.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nAttestations should be weighted by the balance at the justified state.\r\nPossibly wait until https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/tree/cayman/separate-fork-choice/packages/lodestar-fork-choice is ready. In this implementation, attestations are fed to fork choice w/o weights, and all validator weights are updated at once whenever the justified state changes.\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce**\r\nSee https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/blob/master/packages/lodestar/src/chain/attestation/processor.ts#L60\r\nwhich uses the state fetched here: https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/blob/master/packages/lodestar/src/network/gossip/utils.ts#L101",
