  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nWe have type consistency checks that check each exported interface in `src/types/` against an exported const to ensure that they match.\r\nDue to how it works, if we use our 'custom' types, the test will fail.\r\nThis is because our 'custom' types are aliases of underlying types The \"runtime type\" used by ssz evaluates to the underlying type, but the interface types get manually parsed, and the type is evaluated as a string literal.\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport interface CrosslinkCommittee {\r\n shard: Shard;\r\n validatorIndices: ValidatorIndex[]\r\n}\r\nexport const CrosslinkCommittee = {\r\n name: \"CrosslinkCommittee\",\r\n fields: [\r\n   [\"shard\", Shard],\r\n   [\"validatorIndices\", [ValidatorIndex]],\r\n ],\r\n};\r\n```\r\nIn the above example, our test fails, because the interface field `shard`'s type is seen as `\"Shard\"`, while the const field `shard`'s type is seen as `\"uint64\"`.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nWe want to be able to describe our interfaces in terms of these aliased types for additional readability.\r\nWe need to update the consistency test to allow for the above example to pass.\r\n",
