  "body": "Our current solution for \"configurable constants\" is to edit a file as a precompilation step. See #220.\r\nA more full-featured solution would be to create a `BeaconConfig` object that would store tweaked \"constants\", ssz types, and misc other things (eg: a logger). (See https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/pull/220#issuecomment-494942476 for more context)\r\n\r\nIt could look something like:\r\n```typescript\r\ninterface Constants {\r\n  SHARD_COUNT: number;\r\n  // ... the rest of the configurable constants\r\n}\r\n\r\ninterface SSZTypes {\r\n  Fork: AnySSZType;\r\n  // ... the rest of the ssz types\r\n}\r\n\r\ninterface BeaconConfig {\r\n  constants: Constants;\r\n  ssz: SSZTypes;\r\n  logger: AbstractLogger;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThen we can pass around the BeaconConfig (created in cli startup or BeaconNode constructor) throughout the project, even down to the more functional bits:\r\n```typescript\r\n// pass in a BeaconConfig to the state transition helpers\r\nexecuteStateTransition(state, block, config);\r\n\r\n// and pass in a config to any functions that use constants, ssz types, need logging, etc.\r\nexport function getShardDelta(state: BeaconState, epoch: Epoch, c: BeaconConfig): number {\r\n  return Math.min(\r\n    getEpochCommitteeCount(state, epoch, c),\r\n    c.constants.SHARD_COUNT - intDiv(c.constants.SHARD_COUNT, c.constants.SLOTS_PER_EPOCH),\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```",

    "body": "I think the biggest downside is the verbosity, and how this effects the ergonomics of calling functions that require the config object, but this comes with subtle benefit over a singleton.\r\n\r\nI think it leads to more understandable code. Instead of hiding parameters in global state, parameters are passed in explicitly. We can easily see that functions are reliant on this state by reading the function signature, rather than needing to scan the entire function body.\r\n\r\nThere are no surprise side-effects. If a function needs to log, it gets passed a logger. If it needs a runtime-constant, it gets passed the constant.",

This is one of the major issues with our current file-based approach.\r\n\r\nUltimately, I think its a pretty subjective call. Are these variables actual constants? or are they runtime parameters?\r\nIf they're constants, they should just be imported and used as implicit parameters.\r\nIf they're runtime parameters, they should be passed in as parameters explicitly.\r\n\r\nMy current thought is that we should treat many of the constants as runtime parameters, even if mainnet will only use one specific definition of them, with definitions known well ahead of time.\r\nWe'll be doing enough testing that non-mainnet configurations will be an important \"first-class\" usecase.\r\n\r\nRealistically, we won't need to add a BeaconConfig to every function everywhere, just functions that require these runtime parameters (mainly top-level modules and a bunch of state transition functions).\r\n\r\nPerhaps in the purely functional sections, we can add the config as the first parameter, rather than the last, to avoid issues with defaults.\r\n\r\nI'm hopeful we can avoid most of the boilerplate in tests:\r\n```typescript\r\nconst conf1: ChainConfig = getMainnetConfig();\r\nexpect(funcTested(conf1, arg1)).to.be.foo()\r\n// or\r\nconst conf2: ChainConfig = getMinimalConfig();\r\nexpect(funcTested(conf2, arg1)).to.be.bar()\r\n\r\n// which isn't much different than the ergonomics of a singleton approach\r\nsetChainConfig(mainnet);\r\nexpect(funcTested(arg1)).to.be.foo();\r\n// or\r\nsetChainConfig(minimal);\r\nexpect(funcTested(arg1)).to.be.bar();\r\n```",

    "body": "I definitely see how its a lot less of a code change, and how it could work.\r\n\r\nMy main concern is more that singletons are process-wide, whereas injected dependencies are only instance-wide.\r\nSingletons are configured by a series of side-effects, whereas injected dependencies are configured by creating a new dependency via constructor or function.\r\nI think dependency injection is just a conceptually cleaner way to build up a big project like this and in this case worth the additional parameterization. Hiding the chain config in a singleton is easy to implement, but it couples everything in a subtle way that I don't think is the best.\r\n\r\nEg: Should a `BeaconConfig` apply to all running `BeaconNode`s? or is the Config unique to the Node that's running?\r\n```typescript\r\n// compare 6 second block time to 2 second block time\r\nconfig.applyMainnet();\r\nconst nodeA = new BeaconNode();\r\nconfig.applyMinimal();\r\nconst nodeB = new BeaconNode();\r\nnodeA.start();\r\nnodeB.start();\r\n// unfortunately, now nodeA and nodeB both follow the minimal config\r\n```\r\nI don't actually think (m)any people will be running multiple beacon nodes with different configs, but this highlights a bit of the reasoning.\r\nI think the config is a product of the running beacon node, rather than a product of the environment in which its running. Using a singleton makes the config a product of the environment.",

Ideally we will have this constants configurable using toml as well but we have a few issue before we sort this out:\r\n- throughout code we used it as read only constants so it's quite a major refactor to allow it to change in runtime\r\n- ssz library types depends on these constants and they are also defined as constants (read only)\r\n\r\nOnce we can set those params in runtime, it's quite easy to apply toml/json config to them",
