  "body": "### Problem description\n\nFor some testnet or dev networks, we do not need to archive any states and there should be a mode that will allow us to enable it. Instead of continually upgrading SSDs on these no-value networks or manually dumping the beacon data periodically, we should just enable this feature.\n\n### Solution description\n\nSimilar to https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/issues/3211 on Lighthouse, https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-eth2/issues/4419 on Nimbus and https://github.com/Consensys/teku/issues/6576 on Teku, we should discuss different strategies for how we persist archive states. For Holesky, this will be useful to prevent storing unnecessary information as the network will start at 2x mainnet size.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
