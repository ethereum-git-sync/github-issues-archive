    "body": "fwiw, it doesn't look like lighthouse does it (source: https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/testnet-validator.html#step-5-start-lighthouse)\r\nMaybe it's good to keep `init` just if someone wants to have a fresh environment set up that they then want to configure themselves before actually running `beacon`.  If we were to do away with `init`, then useres would have to run the beacon node first if they wanted to tweak the config before running (without actually setting up the .<testnet> folder and beacon.config and all that by hand), which doesn't sound ideal for that scenario.  However, I think that when someone runs `beacon` it shouldn't be required to have to run `init` first.  \r\n\r\ntl;dr it seems to me like `init` should be optional, but not taken away.",
