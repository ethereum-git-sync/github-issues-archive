  "body": "### Describe the bug\n\nOn holesky it might happen that `getLiveness` request in doppelganger service throws the following error\r\n```\r\nNov-13 11:47:12.941[]                error: Error getting liveness data for epoch 10346 - Bad Request: Request epoch 10346 is more than one epoch before or after the current epoch 10348\r\nError: Bad Request: Request epoch 10346 is more than one epoch before or after the current epoch 10348\r\n    at DoppelgangerService.getLiveness (file:///usr/app/packages/validator/src/services/doppelgangerService.ts:178:9)\r\n    at processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:95:5)\r\n    at async Promise.all (index 0)\r\n    at DoppelgangerService.pollLiveness (file:///usr/app/packages/validator/src/services/doppelgangerService.ts:160:33)\r\n    at Clock.runAtMostEvery (file:///usr/app/packages/validator/src/util/clock.ts:96:7)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis happens due to the fact that the doppelganger detection is run at the end of the epoch (3/4 into the last slot)\r\nhttps://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/blob/698e6557e68f69a2b118401272650bdd66074e90/packages/validator/src/services/doppelgangerService.ts#L122-L124\r\n\r\nIt includes polling validator indices which might take up to 3 seconds (highly depends on host performance)\r\nhttps://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/blob/698e6557e68f69a2b118401272650bdd66074e90/packages/validator/src/services/doppelgangerService.ts#L143\r\n\r\ndue to the fact that the beacon node is extremly busy at the end of the epoch (epoch transition) and the `getStateValidators` request is really slow\r\nhttps://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/blob/698e6557e68f69a2b118401272650bdd66074e90/packages/validator/src/services/indices.ts#L129\r\n\r\nIn case this takes more than 3 seconds, the `currentEpoch` which is passed to `getLiveness` API is already the previous epoch and the previous epoch (`currentEpoch - 1`) is 2 epochs in the past. This request will cause the error on the beacon node because there is a strict check that ensures the API is only called for +/- 1 epoch.\r\nhttps://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/blob/698e6557e68f69a2b118401272650bdd66074e90/packages/beacon-node/src/api/impl/validator/index.ts#L1082-L1086\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nDoppelganger protection should consistently work on holesky.\r\n\r\nPossible solution could be to poll indices earlier or ideally the validators request should resolve much quicker (requires performance improvements in epoch transition)\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nRun beacon node and validator client with `--network holesky` flag and enable doppelganger protection (`--doppelgangerProtection`). It also requires that there a pending / undiscovered pubkeys / validators as otherwise the doppelganger serivce will not try to discover new indices.\n\n### Additional context\n\nDue to this issue it is currently not possible to enable doppelganger protection on the dappnode holesky package. This is not a huge issue at the moment since holesky is just a testnet but once mainnet has a similar validator count will see the same issues there.\n\n### Operating system\n\nLinux\n\n### Lodestar version or commit hash\n\nv1.12.0",
