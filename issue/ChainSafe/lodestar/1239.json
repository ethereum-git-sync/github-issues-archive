  "body": "> It would still be nice to use custom directory instead of default\r\n\r\nRight, we should definitely explain the `--root-dir` and other options in the docs.\r\nI think we could expand the docs to include something like \"Advanced configuration\", where we cover all of these options not directly related to running the lodestar instance.\r\nThis would be beyond a \"Testnet configuration\" page, which would likely also mention `--root-dir` as a way to partition data per-testnet.\r\nIn general tho, I think the docs should be geared to mainnet users so we should keep it simpler where we can. We might even mention that explicitly somewhere. \"These docs assume mainnet usage. For testnet use, see 'Testnet configuration'\" (or something to that effect).\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @wemeetagain in https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/pull/1231#issuecomment-664472715_",
