  "body": "### Problem description\n\nBeacon chain spec expects implementations to support yamux. \r\n\r\nYamux is a better multiplexer than yamux per-spec as it supports per stream back-pressure. However Javascript mplex implementation is more battle tested and has served us well, while yamux is new and may have bugs or performance issues\n\n### Solution description\n\n`@chainsafe/libp2p-yamux` is fully developed now, we should attempt to incorporate it by heavily testing it\r\n\r\n- See some testing notes in: https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/pull/4845\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
