There are several closed but also open issues regarding connections not being closed properly.\r\n- https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/issues/433\r\n- https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/issues/436\r\n\r\nThis comment https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/issues/436#issuecomment-432624680 summarizes open tasks but there was no progress in a while.\r\n\r\n### Operating system\r\n\r\nLinux\r\n\r\n### Lodestar version or commit hash\r\n\r\nec8153153c83d082cb89fca682d502e709e3f415",
