  "body": "# Issue\r\n`aggregateVote.numAggregateSig` currently incorrectly uses the length of `aggregate_sig` to get the number of aggregate signatures. \r\nhttps://github.com/ChainSafeSystems/lodestar_chain/blob/a270c7a577a3deda88f96cebb41bc3f173e26b1d/lodestar_chain/state/aggregateVote.js#L36-L38\r\n\r\n`aggregate_sig` is in fact always just the length of 2 so this fails.\r\n\r\n# Proposed Implementation\r\nYou can use the number of `1`s in the bitfield to get the length. If you need the length often, you might consider some sort of helper attribute that caches this results.",
