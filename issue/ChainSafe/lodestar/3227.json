This code is not tested e2e against many test vectors like the spec tests. Consider running spec tests of block verification against the block processor, not only the state transition itself.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nCatch bugs such as https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/pull/3226\r\n\r\n",
