This has lead to some invalidation of our assumptions on how CL <> EL interactions work.\r\nFor e.g. lodestar's fcU calls \"resets/reverts\" the connected EL's head to hundereds of blocks behind which caused some [eth1 tracker issues](https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/issues/3674).\r\n\r\nInvestigate the behavior of other CLs on restart and if possible mechanisms they use to achieve the same.\r\n",
