We could implement a workaround solution which would fix this for the case where we have the network in the main thread but this would just be temporary as the long-term plan is to move the network to a worker which requires to use a new registry.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can see we only have peer metrics in the network metrics\r\nhttps://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/blob/fbe9beb18d5bb43f0508fe3df97962acf2504f87/packages/beacon-node/src/network/core/metrics.ts#L6-L10\r\n\r\nNeed to find another solution on how we could get the peer count in the monitoring service, dynamic functions could be one way but getting it from metrics would be the preferred solution.",
