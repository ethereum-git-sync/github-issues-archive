While this has worked fine before currently Infura timeouts for all requests. The problem is that these states are really old and Infura places some limit on the credentials. I've rotated the credentials with a new account but it still timeouts.\r\n\r\nDepending on external services weakens our CI. This issue is blocking https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/pull/3995\r\n\r\n**Proposed solution**\r\n\r\nBuild generic infra to generate valid states and blocks on demand and cache them locally. We already have something like that for benchmarking but should be extended and persisted.",
