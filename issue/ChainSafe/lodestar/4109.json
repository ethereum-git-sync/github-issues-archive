Our eth1 deposit tracker assumes constant times of 14 seconds, and doesn't populate the blocks necessary latter for block production.\r\n\r\n```\r\nDB cache has\r\nblocks here\r\n=========|      we are querying blocks here\r\n    |    |    |xxxx|    |\r\nday 0    1    2    3   now\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nWhen computing which block to download too, it should be computed based on timestamp, not blockNumber. This way to cache will be populated up to where it's needed",
