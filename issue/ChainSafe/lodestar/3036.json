I always give the example that Geth uses the _\"Flow\"_ strategy and Parity ~~uses~~ used _\"Maturity.\"_ I'm personally a big fan of the latter.\r\n\r\nCurrent State of Lodestar https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/releases\r\n- [x] has development branches\r\n    - [x] `master` (pull requests default to `master`)\r\n- [x] has releases (23)\r\n    - [x] `v0.29.1` on :warning: `master`\r\n    - [x] `v0.29.0` on :warning: `master`\r\n    - [x] ...\r\n- [x] :warning: has release branches\r\n    - [x] :warning: no release branch for current track (0.29 ?)\r\n",
