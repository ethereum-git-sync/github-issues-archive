    "body": "Just looked at the incident on Jan 25/Jan 26:\r\n- It was caused by bad performance of beacon nodes\r\n- Also the rescue/fallback node was configured with `subscribe_all_subnets=false` at that time so we lacked some subnet peers on this node ( we only configured that to `true` after the incident): if `submitPoolSyncCommitteeSignatures` failed on main bn it could be failed in fallback/rescue node too since we lack subnet peers. Below metric was from the rescue/fallback node\r\n<img width=\"1306\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2023-02-20 at 10 31 33\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10568965/220003270-133a6c15-d9db-4e02-8cc9-b4083576c9ba.png\">\r\n\r\nThe log in this issue is only related to `SyncCommitteeContribution` (not SyncCommitteeMessage), although it's not the root cause of missed SyncCommitteeMessage it could improve the issue: vc as a validator can aggregate SyncCommitteeMessages and publish to the network itself\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how restaring vc fixed the issue but the rescue node was switched to `subscribe_all_subnets=true` around that time too",
