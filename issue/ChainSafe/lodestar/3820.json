Please describe.**\r\n\r\nReference Teku implementation: https://github.com/ConsenSys/teku/pull/4894\r\nReference Lighthouse implementation: https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/2924\r\n\r\nCurrently, there is no way for a user to set a specific fee-recipient address per configured validator. There will need to be a way for users, especially ones with multiple validators, to specifically set a custom address per validator configured.\r\n\r\nThe beacon-apis have an endpoint: https://github.com/ethereum/beacon-APIs/pull/178 to accept the fee-recipient of all the known validators to the BN. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nTeku and Lighthouse both have their own implementations merged already. We should determine which method is the better approach considering complexity and user experience, then implement into our own BN & VC.",
