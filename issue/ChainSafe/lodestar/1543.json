    "body": "@ChainSafe/eth2-0 We should probably discuss this. Queuing gossip blocks is a bit difficult as we would need to replay blocks trough gossip validation and manually emit is as gossipsub does.\r\n\r\nIt's quite awkward since we would need to either:\r\n- bind method to Gossip object and invoke like here:\r\nhttps://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/blob/master/packages/lodestar/src/network/gossip/gossip.ts#L219  \r\n\r\n- emit block event directly like here:\r\nhttps://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/blob/master/packages/lodestar/src/network/gossip/handlers/block.ts#L15\r\n\r\nSeems like first option is somewhat since we don't circumvent handleBlock method which could contain some logic in future.",
