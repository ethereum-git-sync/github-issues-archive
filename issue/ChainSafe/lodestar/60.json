Please describe.**\r\nBy creating the startup functionality we will be able to begin testing the whole system as the pieces come together.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nRealistically, some functionalities will need to be stubbed, as we are still having some type related issues (primarily bytes #59).\r\n\r\n**How to**\r\nI am working on creating a start function (i.e the main entry point for the beacon chain) that will add an event listener to the deposit contract on ETH1.0. I'll have to get the old logs from the contract, and the continue to look for the new contracts. When the `ChainStart` log is emitted then my function will need to execute the `get_initial_beacon_state` function (not implemented, but I will have it implemented for my PR). At this point we will have the base state for the beacon chain and to avoid submitting an extensive pr i will stop at this point.",
