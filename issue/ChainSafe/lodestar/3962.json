  "body": "Context: Dhruv from Obol network is trying to integrate lodestar validator. For this they are hooking it up to an infura BN (most likely lighthouse) which is giving the initialization error:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76567250/166183955-41ac3cc1-aec9-41fb-8b59-9126aa561382.png)\r\n\r\non suggesting to pass `--paramsFile ` to match the config, it still didn't work:\r\n> I tried overriding the config to match the with infura's response but as you can see in the above error screenshot, infura's response doesn't contain 2 fields: SHARDING_FORK_VERSION and SHARDING_FORK_EPOCH. \r\nFor these 2 fields I need to override them to undefined but that is not possible because lodestar expects strings from config file. So I got parsing error.\r\n\r\n>And for DEPOSIT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS I saw that lodestar converts this into byte array and then at the time of comparison it again converts it to hex string which eventually becomes what it is there in screenshot so overriding that is also not possible. \r\n\r\n\r\nExpectation: fix the config matching in the validator to make it interop with other BNs",
