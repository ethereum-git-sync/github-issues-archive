    "body": "Run down of events that can help with the tracking down the root cause:\r\n\r\nHere is the run down of events:\r\n\r\nEarlier on, after running the `release:create-rc` script, I attempted the `release:tag-rc`. The output from the terminal was:\r\n\r\n```\r\n➜  lodestar git:(rc/v0.40.0) yarn release:tag-rc 0.40.0 57d13e1\r\nyarn run v1.22.19\r\n$ node scripts/release/tag_rc.mjs 0.40.0 57d13e1\r\nChecking if branch rc/v0.40.0 exists in remote\r\nChecking if tag v0.40.0-rc.0 exists in remote\r\n\r\nTag: v0.40.0-rc.0\r\nSelected commit: 57d13e1d9d\r\n\r\ncommit 57d13e1d9d8f9cece6b3b11c1c9b61f98053535a\r\nAuthor: Lion - dapplion <35266934+dapplion@users.noreply.github.com>\r\nDate:   11 hours ago\r\n\r\n    Fix typo in publish-dev.yml (#4256)\r\n\r\n? Do you want to publish v0.40.0-rc.0 at commit 57d13e1d9d? Yes\r\n```\r\n\r\nA part of the CI failed as can be seen here: https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/runs/7240784623?check_suite_focus=true\r\n\r\nThis was due to the fact that the `57d13e1` commit was for the create-rc. So deleted the tags and ran it again but this time, using the `a171ba0e` from the rc branch that was created.\r\n\r\nThis was ran `10:27 pm`  I have the time, because I sent a message to Cayman, I was going to try it again. The output from the terminal was:\r\n\r\n```\r\n➜  lodestar git:(rc/v0.40.0) yarn release:tag-rc 0.40.0 a171ba0e\r\nyarn run v1.22.19\r\n$ node scripts/release/tag_rc.mjs 0.40.0 a171ba0e\r\nChecking if branch rc/v0.40.0 exists in remote\r\nChecking if tag v0.40.0-rc.0 exists in remote\r\n\r\nTag: v0.40.0-rc.0\r\nSelected commit: a171ba0e6c\r\n\r\ncommit a171ba0e6cc76b3774d06d96649e776652d0bedc\r\nAuthor: Dadepo Aderemi <dadepo@gmail.com>\r\nDate:   45 minutes ago\r\n\r\n    v0.40.0\r\n\r\n? Do you want to publish v0.40.0-rc.0 at commit a171ba0e6c? Yes\r\n✨  Done in 8.06s.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen later on, it was seen that at 10:28pm, the stable release job was triggered https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/actions/runs/2632158460",
