    "body": "1. You don't need need APIs, the existing ones used by regular blinded flow should apply. Check with @g11tech . Also feel free to reach out to Teku AFAIK they use this strategy internally.\r\n2. Yes you would need to cache the full payload internally\r\n3. Yes Fallback URLs will not work for an interrupted flow. This is already an existing problem for attestation -> aggregate, so it's okay. When using fallbacks, the validator sends data to all possible nodes, so there's no chance of data loss only loud errors",
