  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nCurrently, the pruning of the state caches is very basic, controlled by calling `cache.prune` on regular regular intervals, when the chain processes a checkpoint. This naive strategy leads to more memory use than is needed.\r\n\r\nWhen the chain is healthy, or when chain regen is low, we may need fewer states cached.\r\nWhen the chain is unhealthy, or when more states are being requested, we may need more states cached. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nImplement a chain-level state manager that more intelligently manages the state cache pruning.\r\nFirst steps would include mapping out a coherent strategy that would take into account both healthy and unhealthy chain conditions.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nMaintain status quo.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nSee #2152 #2153 \r\n",
