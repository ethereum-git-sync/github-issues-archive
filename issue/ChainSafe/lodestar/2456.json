In average it takes about 12 seconds but this snapshot it takes 4s. The cost comes from `computeSubnetForSlot()`\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2021-05-01 16-03-28](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35266934/116784908-0c6a2a80-aa97-11eb-8b97-be7406022e52.png)\r\n![Screenshot from 2021-05-01 16-05-46](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35266934/116784921-1b50dd00-aa97-11eb-92ae-b80ed315998a.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\n`prepareBeaconCommitteeSubnet` should almost be free since that information should already be cached in the epoch context.",
