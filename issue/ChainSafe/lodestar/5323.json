The errors you reported should be fixed now by https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/pull/5722 and https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/pull/5784 but those should not have caused actual issues (just noise). \r\n\r\nI am running Lodestar and Teku in a 1:1 setup which works great with the latest releases. Would be interesting to know if this issue is resolved by now. If you deploy from `unstable` branch the noisy eventstream errors should be gone too.",

    "body": "@nflaig yes I am still using Lodestar as a failover for some validators and as a primary for others as well. It is working for last month or so indeed so that is great. The behavior together with Teku only shows some errors that are maybe a bit overdone. The Teku dev told me the default behaviour is that the Teku-VC sends the attestations to the primary node plus all failover nodes to maximize the propogation. However this results in error messages on the Lodestar when the attestation has already been gossiped (see below). The behaviour in Nimbus which is a 2nd failover is different as this just blindly attests without the check that Lodestar seems to have.\r\n\r\nHowever this issue is can indeed be closed but wonder whether the below is still interesting to look into as this error look messy, maybe info would be better here.\r\n\r\njul 21 23:01:25 ssay-NUC8i5BEH lodestar[1557]: Jul-21 23:01:25.336[api]             error: Error on submitPoolAttestations [0] slot=6929105, index=40 code=ATTESTATION_ERROR_ATTESTATION_ALREADY_KNOWN, targetEpoch=216534, validatorIndex=XXXX",
