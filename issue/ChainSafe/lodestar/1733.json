Best practice is to import (from a trusted source) that validator's attestation history. See [EIP 3076](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/3076/files) for a standard slashing interchange format.\r\n> 4) Far future signing requests -- A validator client can be requested to sign a far into the future attestation, resulting in a valid non-slashable request. If the validator client signs this message, it will result in it blocking itself from attesting any other attestation until the beacon-chain reaches that far into the future epoch. This will result in an inactivity leak and potential ejection due to low balance. \r\nA validator client should prevent itself from signing such requests by: a) keeping a local time clock if possible and following best practices to stop time server attacks and b) refusing to sign, by default, any message that has a large (>6h) gap from the current slashing protection database indicated a time \"jump\" or a long offline event. The administrator can manually override this protection to restart the validator after a genuine long offline event.",
