Where should this function be used?\r\n\r\nDepending on the route we go next, we may not need to use this, its just nice to have.\r\n\r\nThe end goal is to have infrastructure in place to provide syncing by weak subjectivity checkpoint+state \"by default\" for our beacon node, similar to the experience we currently give for starting from genesis.\r\n\r\nImo we can break the problem down into a few parts: creating the ws state, distributing the ws state, loading the ws state.\r\n\r\nAs far as creating the state, we use something like https://github.com/adiasg/eth2-ws-provider (which just uses the standard API) or add a custom API endpoint to retrieve the weak subjectivity state.\r\n\r\nAs far as serving the state, it would be nice to use IPFS or similar to leverage existing ChainSafe Files tooling.\r\n\r\nAnd whatever the distribution, we will need to extend our CLI to do this fetch of the ws state on initial boot.\r\n\r\n",
