However, there is a benefit of detecting interop issues as early as possible, e.g. recent libp2p issue with LH dropping mplex.\r\n\r\nWe could also use a different strategy based on how stable the dev branch / latest image of each client we test against is. Another option would be to test against different versions, e.g. unstable and stable LH version, this would make it easier to figure out that the tests are failing due to some transient / untested bug on their unstable branch and not due to a change done in Lodestar.\r\n\r\nDue to the fact that devnets usually use unstable / dev versions I would rather tend towards testing against those in our CI.\r\n\r\nPrevious discussion on the topic [in discord](https://discord.com/channels/593655374469660673/605818244036821012/1141743814407618692).",
