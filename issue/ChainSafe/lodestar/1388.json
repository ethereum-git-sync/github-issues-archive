I changed that in regular sync v2.\r\nSo we have two options, either reset RoundRobinArray to return null if all peers are discarded or reduce maxAttempts here to this.getPeers().length x 2 (so we try each peer twice).\r\n\r\nif you have 10 peers and block doesn't exists this will surely make you banned from those 10 peers\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @mpetrunic in https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/pull/1378_",
