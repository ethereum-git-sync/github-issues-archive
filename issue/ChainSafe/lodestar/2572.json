The return types are typed as regular Javascript objects and unsuspecting users may encounter issues. This happens on the beacon.state routes (at least).\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nSince everything coming out of the Api impl isn't ever going to be hashed we should drop the trees. If someone **really** wants to consume tree backed objects they should connect directly the BeaconChain instance.",
