It's nice to have other logic to find subnet peers, but we also have equivalent logic in lodestar so will consider this if we missed attestations.\r\n\r\nWith v0.36.0 and a mainnet node of 8 connected validators, topic peers look nice so no motivation to work on that right now\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1265\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-05-12 at 13 18 56\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10568965/168004637-2aaec922-c41a-44e3-b82a-ca828013cf9d.png\">\r\n",
