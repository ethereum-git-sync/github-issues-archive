Also https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/issues/2839 prevents to know if fork choice is actually being run.\r\n\r\nThis issue causes a significant drop in proposer rewards since the head is always wrong.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nNode should track the correct head.\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce**\r\n\r\nRun node for a while, then query `/eth/v1/beacon/headers/head` and compare with a block explorer",
