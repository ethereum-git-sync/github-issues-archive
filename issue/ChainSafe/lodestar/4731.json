The beacon chain API spec says that I should be able to access an individual validator's state at /eth/v1/beacon/states/{state_id}/validators/{validator_id} . I've been specifically /eth/v1/beacon/states/head/validators/{validator_id}. I always get \"Validator not found\" error.  In closed issue 3852, the syntax is shown as /eth/v1/beacon/states/head/validators?id={validator_id}. Maybe there is something I don't understand about the API spec, but I did not think passing the validator ID as a query param was part of the spec. In any case, even when I call it using this syntax, I get {\"data\":[],\"execution_optimistic\":false} for any validator ID I try. Data is empty. Is there something I'm doing wrong? I can confirm that endpoint /eth/v1/beacon/states/head/validators without a validator ID at all does work correctly to return all validators, but I  am unable to query for just a single validator's state. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nEndpoint matches API spec and returns valid data",
