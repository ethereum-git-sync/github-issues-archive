  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nBLS verification is a bottleneck in state transition processing. We should support batch processing.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nBatch processing involves collecting all attestation (and optionally proposer) signatures from a single / multiple blocks, and verifying them all at once. The boolean result will show that either all signatures are valid, or at least one is invalid. In most cases, signatures will be valid, and this is a big performance win. \r\nIn initial sync, peers sending invalid messages should be quickly blacklisted. In gossip, peers gossiping invalid messages will quickly be pruned from the mesh.\r\n\r\nFor inspiration here is relevant lighthouse code: https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/master/beacon_node/beacon_chain/src/block_verification.rs#L299\r\n\r\nThey create a `Verifier` that can `includeAllSignatures` from a block, then finally `verify`.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nResearch post decsribing the algorithm: https://ethresear.ch/t/fast-verification-of-multiple-bls-signatures/5407\r\nprysm imlementation: https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/6479",
