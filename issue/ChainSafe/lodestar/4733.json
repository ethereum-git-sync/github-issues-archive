  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nFor light clients, we are experimenting with new ways to ensure we can enable light client sync in the most optimal way possible, with the best assurances of truth. Using https://github.com/lightclients/kevlar for optimistic syncing, we can easily ask for hashes of the sync committee to make comparisons amongst a set of provers. We would just need an easy way to get this information from clients like Lodestar to serve this data through an endpoint.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nTo help with the optimistic construction, it would be ideal to add an endpoint to fetch the hashes off the sync committee such as `getCommitteeHash` or `getOptimisticHash` with a route of something similar to `/eth/v1/beacon/light_client/committee_hash`. We should implement this in Lodestar, test it and then push upstream to include it in the beaconAPIs spec. \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nThis feature is to help with supporting better syncing methods for software such as Kevlar using the light client protocol.
