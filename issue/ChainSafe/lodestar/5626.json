  "body": "### Problem description\n\nIn order to better support the relayer community, our client would need to support block validation before publishing to mitigate validators sending signed, invalid blocks for equivocation attacks. \r\n\r\nIn addition, the need to diversify relayer setups for a more robust mev-boost infrastructure is critical as it encompasses [~90% of blocks published on mainnet today](https://mevboost.pics/).\n\n### Solution description\n\nFor this feature, we must:\r\n- Validate block first\r\n- Publish to p2p only if valid\r\n\r\nThis feature should be on a separate Lodestar fork or under a CLI flag for relayers to use. \n\n### Additional context\n\nThis was already implemented on Prysm and Lighthouse. PRs can be found here:\r\nhttps://github.com/realbigsean/lighthouse/tree/lighthouse-relay\r\nhttps://github.com/flashbots/prysm/tree/verify-before-broadcast-v4.0.4",
