  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nIt's frustrating when eg: Running the cli from `lodestar-cli`, after updating code in `lodestar`, we must run `yarn build` from the lodestar package, for `lodestar-cli` to pick up the changes.\r\n\r\nThe typescript source is not used by other downstream monorepo packages, only the transpiled javascript is used.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nMaybe we can have something along the lines of `babel --watch && tsc --watch` running in each monorepo package, which will pick up any typescript file changes and automatically update the transpiled JS. This way, we won't need to be constantly be manually re-building each package.\r\nIf we can package this into something that we can run via `lerna`, we can get auto-building for the whole monorepo at once, very nice.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nwrite a custom thing with https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar with a nice glob that targets only what we need\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nhttps://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-cli#compile-files\r\nhttps://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/configuring-watch.html\r\n",
