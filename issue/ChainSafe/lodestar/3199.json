I have put my findings in the linked Gists (if any).\r\n\r\n### Phase 0\r\n\r\n* `general/phase0/bls/` 60/60 (100%) ✅ \r\n* `general/phase0/ssz_generic/` 1795/1905 (94.2%, 110 [not covered](https://gist.github.com/q9f/3082ce2f694fe3050d42bc2f65c519a0))\r\n* `mainnet/phase0/` 712/712 (100%) ✅ \r\n* `minimal/phase0/` 3912/3919 (99.8%, _7 [pending](https://gist.github.com/q9f/509fd97eed9ba29d174dbff2cf9a0e55)_)\r\n\r\nI don't know what pending means in CI, they are implemented but not run? Or timeout?\r\n\r\n### Altair\r\n\r\n* `general/altair/bls/` 0/20 (0.0%, 20 [not covered](https://gist.github.com/q9f/7c504bad544ea47d524b10fb5a7d8dde))\r\n* `mainnet/altair/` 459/504 (90.7%, 45 [not covered](https://gist.github.com/q9f/5120b4f50062f852e95bc0e6fa205e4a))\r\n* `minimal/altair/` 3675/4784 (76.8%, _diff too large/unknown_)\r\n\r\nIt's not an easy process to create these diffs, so I did not look into the last large diff due to time constraints. Phase 0 and Mainnet should be prioritized though. Also the merge diffs are huge (obviously), so I didn't bother to list them.",

So I used a ruby script to parse the contents and generate the lists.\r\n\r\nAlso, I couldn't use the TypeScript utilities that are supposed to check test coverage. So, instead, I parsed the CI logs to get a clear image of what's being run. Also, here, it would be nice if I could figure out a way in the future, to access the list of covered tests more quickly in the future.",
