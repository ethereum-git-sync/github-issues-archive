    "body": "All of the libraries I found seem to want to run the node process directly and cannot be turned on and then off again programatically.  After a bit of googling I found [this blog](https://betterprogramming.pub/create-a-flame-graph-for-your-node-app-profiling-nodejs-app-e0a91e5ed585) and noted the flags.  I looked at the `Ox` code and found a few things to better understanding how that library works.\r\n\r\nIt looks like they are running the process [here](https://github.com/davidmarkclements/0x/blob/8d34f06bce33c287e6e50ee602ef4b1b55175101/platform/v8.js#L27) and [here](https://github.com/davidmarkclements/0x/blob/8d34f06bce33c287e6e50ee602ef4b1b55175101/platform/linux.js#L41) depending on if they are profiling v8 or linux.  \r\n\r\nFor v8 they are out-putting the isolate data to a log. Then then parse the data into `tick`s [here](https://github.com/davidmarkclements/0x/blob/8d34f06bce33c287e6e50ee602ef4b1b55175101/platform/v8.js#L128) to build the graph data.\r\n\r\nFor linux they are launching using a system level perf command and passing `--perf-basic-prof` and then turn the trace into `tick`s [here](https://github.com/davidmarkclements/0x/blob/8d34f06bce33c287e6e50ee602ef4b1b55175101/platform/linux.js#L105)\r\n\r\n~~Sadly in both situations they use a flag to output perf data.  I am doing a bit more digging to see how it is implemented to try and understand if/what the performance implications will be.~~\r\n\r\nThere are [4 perf flags](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/4166d40d0873b6d8a0c7291872c8d20dc680b1d7/doc/api/cli.md?plain=1#L1964-L1973) that are available and the [node flamegraph docs](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/diagnostics-flamegraph) talk about a few of the details.\r\n\r\nI am reading about the [Chrome Debugging Protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/debugger-protocol-viewer/v8/) docs that were referred to in the [debugger](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/debugging-getting-started) section of the node docs to see how the protocol works so we can potentially leverage the flag\r\n\r\nUpdated. ~~I am guessing there will be some degradation so it might not be ideal for prod but will add another comment below when I get further~~\r\n\r\nI researched the performance implications of the `--inspect` flag and there is none when a debugger is not attached.  However, when one is attached it is 100x to 300x according to [this thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45379080/does-the-node-inspect-flag-have-any-notable-performance-impact) on SO.\r\n\r\n[This post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59743800/is-it-a-good-idea-to-enable-inspect-for-nodejs-in-production-kubernetes) elaborates a bit on the security risks but it also mentions that debugging can be flipped on with `kill -usr1 ${PID}` but I have not tested.",

The speaker talks about `process._debugProcess(pid)` to turn on debugging from outside of a running node instance.  It is what node uses [under the hood](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/4166d40d0873b6d8a0c7291872c8d20dc680b1d7/lib/internal/debugger/inspect.js#L319) to turn on debugging incidentally. It and [_debugEnd](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/4166d40d0873b6d8a0c7291872c8d20dc680b1d7/lib/internal/bootstrap/switches/is_main_thread.js#L13) are available. \r\n\r\nThis is another highlight\r\nhttps://youtu.be/Xb_0awoShR8?t=682\r\n\r\nUpdated. The speaker talks about the core debugging protocol and using it for profiling.

    "body": "@dapplion I also found the reference that I mentioned on standup, it is a youtube video. It wasn't a blog is why I couldn't find with a google search.  It is a Netflix engineer talking about flame graphs on running node process in prod.\r\n\r\nThe speaker talks about the `--perf` flags mentioned above in [this video here](https://youtu.be/O1YP8QP9gLA?t=477) and in particular the usage for `--perf-basic-prof-only-functions` to generate the flamegraph. He mentions that it is very low impact on the running process.\r\n\r\nThey are using a linux library [perf](https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page) and describe how they implement [here](https://youtu.be/O1YP8QP9gLA?t=402).  It is the same library that `Ox` is using for linux.\r\n\r\nNetflix is using [brendangregg/FlameGraph](https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph) to generate the flamegraphs.  `Ox` is using a custom implementation that [renders](https://github.com/davidmarkclements/0x/blob/8d34f06bce33c287e6e50ee602ef4b1b55175101/lib/render.js) and bundles an html page that is [in source](https://github.com/davidmarkclements/0x/tree/8d34f06bce33c287e6e50ee602ef4b1b55175101/visualizer).\r\n\r\nAs a note there was some GREAT other stuff in that video about post mortem debugging with core-dumps that was very interesting.  The whole video is def worth watching.",
