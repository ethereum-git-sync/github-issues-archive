Re-downloading fixed this issue. This script seems to be the problem. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/blob/ea28e72fb27ba03ffa5fe7749e8dfd66c423856b/scripts/getGitData.js#L8\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://discord.com/channels/593655374469660673/593655641445367808/822147795581796433\r\n\r\n![unknown](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35266934/111701095-99845780-883a-11eb-9bad-dd8193bc5159.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is very useful for metrics to access git data, but maybe it should not stop the build, and be wrapped in a try-catch. Possible fixes:\r\n- Wrap in a try / catch, log error and continue build\r\n- Wrap in a try / catch, an stop build\r\n- Leave as is\r\n\r\nPossibly the cause of https://github.com/ChainSafe/libp2p-ts/issues/20\r\n",
