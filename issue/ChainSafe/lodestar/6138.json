  "body": "### Problem description\n\nOn the November 28, 2023 standup, it was made clear that one of the ways to ensure we consistently strive and achieve better performance is to focus on data gathering important metrics to make informed decisions. Similarly to the idea of #4724, there needs to be a curation of what these metrics are and have them centrally located in a dashboard for consistent monitoring.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Solution description\n\nTiming is very important to be successful in Ethereum consensus. Specifically this dashboard should include:\r\n- Timing production of a block and how quickly it is sent within 4 sec (builder + engine)\r\n- Time to receive, process and update head \r\n- P2P Gossip/verification/latency of blobs\r\n- Garbage collection \r\n\r\nWe should continue adding to this dashboard to better track how we are performing to the expectations of the spec so we can have an \"early detection system\" of where to target our efforts for better performance. Most importantly, this dashboard and the specific metrics within it, should function as a feedback loop for our continuous performance improvements.\n\n### Additional context\n\nhttps://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/wiki/Lodestar-Planning-&-Standup-Meetings#november-28-2023-planning-and-standup-meeting",
