Please describe.**\r\n\r\nNavigating the state transition package can be frustrating, and it can be confusing determining if/when an implementation is used in production or part of the naive suite. The naive/fast distinction is confusing. The naive code is not used or useful to us.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nRemove naive code entirely.\r\nIMO the naive code is a net detriment and not worth maintaining.\r\nTime spent making naive code more readable can be used making the fast code more readable (eg: with more significant code comments).\r\nAny important exported naive interfaces can be retained by wrapping the fast implementation, if exporting those interfaces is important.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nStatus quo\r\n\r\n",
