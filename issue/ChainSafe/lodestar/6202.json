As far as I know, `produceBlockV3` doesn't return any of the 4 headers in the spec.\r\n\r\nJust curious why you specifically mention `Eth-Consensus-Version`. Is it because blockdreamer doesn't read the other 3 headers, or is it simply because `Eth-Consensus-Version` is the first header it looks for?",
