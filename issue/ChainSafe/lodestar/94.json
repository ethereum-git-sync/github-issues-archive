    "body": "@tynes \r\nThanks for the heads up!\r\nI think we'd love to use native BigInts if possible, though it may take us a while to migrate in that direction. Some thoughts in no particular order:\r\n- Our version of typescript doesn't support native Bigints (we need to upgrade to 3.3)\r\n- We're thinking of using babel (and https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-syntax-bigint) to aid with building for non-BigInt-supporting environments\r\n- We may not need BigInts in most cases: https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/issues/626#issuecomment-466195391\r\n- We just had a team discussion today, some notes [here](https://gitter.im/chainsafe/lodestar?at=5c7432da00aa630d9a0eb5b8), and we decided to hold off on messing with our bigint implementation for now, at least until the spec settles down a bit more.\r\n- For bls signatures, we're leaning toward using https://github.com/herumi/mcl-wasm , which should take care of most of the heavy lifting using wasm, take a look at https://github.com/chainsafesystems/bls-js , should be really neat once it all works",
