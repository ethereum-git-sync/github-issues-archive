    "body": "Yeah, sync needs to probably subscribe on processedBlock event so it can figure out on which slot our head is.\r\n\r\nThat said, initial sync assumes that is syncs only one valid chain so it can do stuff like header chain validation and quick state transition. In regular sync we need to keep track of all different chain versions(in case of fork). I don't see a reason for regular sync not to fetch blocks by range if it figures that it has to sync multiple blocks. Not sure how to proceed we cannot do initial sync after finalized epoch as we don't know which chain is real. ",
