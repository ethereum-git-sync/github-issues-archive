The process is repeated after in loop.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2021-09-14 20-51-44](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35266934/133316975-86c82a13-5890-4b30-865b-4ee6f129c738.png)\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2021-09-14 20-52-02](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35266934/133316999-d16226cf-3378-43b9-9360-c489bdb552a9.png)\r\n\r\nThe memory happens consistenly when the node is ~230 slots away from the head (7-8 epochs)\r\n\r\n- The issue does **not** happen with using the flag `--weakSubjectivitySyncLatest`\r\n- The issue does happen without validators attached\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nNot OOM\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce**\r\n\r\nRun a node close to head and let it sync with validators attached",
