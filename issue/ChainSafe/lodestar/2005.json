I'm not sure if it's connected to the fact that both the validator and the beacon node were ran together, but the fact that other people have ran the beacon node without an OOM issue for quite some time (and that no one has really been running an active testnet validator alongside the beacon nod in lodestar, to my knowledge) gives me a hunch that it's connected to the validator.\r\n\r\nEDIT: this issue happens when running just the beacon node by itself and does not require the validator to be ran to replicate the issue.\r\n\r\nThis is what my heap space looked like in grafana (the big empty space is between when the crash happened and when I noticed the crash)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32028745/106190791-c1770900-616f-11eb-8d06-3fb91c296766.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nhere is my crash report:\r\nhttps://pastebin.com/WJCEe6R6\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "@tuyennhv , currently running the beacon node on the `tuyen/experiment-sync-runStateTransition` branch.  i'm still waiting to see what happens with regard to the heap space usage, but i'm noticing that when i try to run the validator on the same branch alongside the beacon node (once the beacon node is in regular sync), then the validator consistently does not publish it's attestations (according to beaconcha.in: https://pyrmont.beaconcha.in/validator/adb60c447b8b59bfa0df75b88bd9ee4bd393258f917ab54eee6520787f3346b6b36fab203cd45baf7d308576a067cb3e#attestations), even though I see in the attestations being made in the validator logs.  This has happened consistently for multiple epochs in a row, and actually, I haven't seen any published attestations on beaconcha.in since running on this branch.\r\n\r\nFor example here's some of the logs I see:\r\n```\r\n2021-02-02 21:53:43 []                 info: on new block epoch epoch=17249, validator=0xadb60c447b8b59bfa0df75b88bd9ee4bd393258f917ab54eee6520787f3346b6b36fab203cd45baf7d308576a067cb3e\r\n2021-02-02 21:57:07 []                 info: Handling attestation duty slot=551985, committee=27, validator=0xadb60c447b8b59bfa0df75b88bd9ee4bd393258f917ab54eee6520787f3346b6b36fab203cd45baf7d308576a067cb3e\r\n2021-02-02 21:57:11 []                 info: Signed new attestation block=0x18c153f031843f3e364de5a000927c93fe44ccc72b692ebe0ec5dfc4fd5a28d5, committeeIndex=27, slot=551985\r\n2021-02-02 21:57:11 []                 info: Published new attestation slot=551985, committee=27, attestation=0x26d09431e78cf7e0fedd9fa0adec32d430987f333bb94e7c323a28e651a8e90b, block=0x18c153f031843f3e364de5a000927c93fe44ccc72b692ebe0ec5dfc4fd5a28d5, validator=0xadb60c447b8b59bfa0df75b88bd9ee4bd393258f917ab54eee6520787f3346b6b36fab203cd45baf7d308576a067cb3e\r\n2021-02-02 21:57:15 []                 info: Aggregating attestations committeeIndex=27, slot=551985\r\n2021-02-02 21:57:16 []                 info: Published signed aggregate and proof committeeIndex=27, slot=551985\r\n```\r\n\r\nand yet, if you look at the beaconcha.in link I provided above, the validator apparently missed that epoch (17249).\r\n\r\nI tried to replicate this behavior on master and was not able to.  The validator is able to consistently attest and have said attestations show up in beaconcha.in on master.  So, something in that branch is making the validator (or perhaps the validator's interactions with the beacon node) act funny, it seems.\r\n\r\n",
