Please describe.**\r\n\r\nWhen running a beacon node with many validators (512) **28%** (13000 ms / 45000 ms) of total CPU time is spent in validateAggregateAttestation. This node runs all validators in the network, so this is not a realistic metric.\r\n\r\nHowever, `validateAggregateAttestation()` verifies three sets of signatures separately, which can be optimized.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2021-03-23 10-48-20](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35266934/112127378-ac45b600-8bc5-11eb-8cb3-608344cab4ae.png)\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nIf it use batch signature verification it could reduce the pairings needed from 3 * 2 to 3 + 1, -33% max time savings. Is it really necessary to know which of the signatures is wrong? Could we throw an generic error `AttestationErrorCode.INVALID_SIGNATURES` \r\n\r\n**Alternatives**\r\n\r\nWe could also consider to implementing some verification queue which could de-duplicate verification if that's shows to be an issue\r\n\r\n\r\n",
