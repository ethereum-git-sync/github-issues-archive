  "body": "### Problem description\n\nCurrently, we do not have an easy method for Infrastructure to setup bootnodes for our use. Our images do not support this functionality and there is nothing implemented to ensure we have the best security/networking practices similar to how other clients are enabling their own bootnodes on the network.\n\n### Solution description\n\nWe should investigate and implement a solution that will allow us to easily setup and run reliable bootnodes for the network. I imagine something as simple as `./lodestar bootnode {flags}` running our docker image. \r\n\r\nThis would allow Infrastructure and other community members to easily setup a bootnode for use with our discv5 implementation and allow us to fulfill our promise to the community by diversifying bootnode infrastructure for the network as mentioned here: https://ethresear.ch/t/execution-consensus-client-bootnodes/14588/42\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
