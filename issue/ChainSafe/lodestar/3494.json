  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/pull/3477\r\n\r\nIn #3477 we offset the sync period calculation by `ALTAIR_FORK_EPOCH` so that the first sync period starts at 0.\r\nThis is nice in some ways, as a light client could start syncing from period 0 thru N, but it also comes with a small bit of complexity.\r\n\r\nNow calculating the sync period requires a config, rather than just requiring the genesis time.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nRevert this offset. This would simplify calculating the sync period.\r\nThe difference is that the first available sync period would not be 0. And this is not an issue, since nothing relies on this assumption. The sync period is always calculated from a header slot or epoch.\r\n",
