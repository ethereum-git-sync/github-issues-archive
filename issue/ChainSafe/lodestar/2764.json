  "body": "Would it make sense to keep a reverse shuffled list to speed this even more?\r\n\r\nIf the shuffled array looks like `[3,0,2,1]` the reverse array would be `[1,3,2,0]`. Given a validator index you could get its postion in the shuffled array in O(1) time. From there with modulos you can figure out the slot, committee and index.\r\n\r\nWould that be worth it the extra memory? At 250_000 validators x 8 bytes = 2MB\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @dapplion in https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/issues/2717#issuecomment-869968368_",
