Please describe.**\r\nOne step towards having a good state cache pruning strategy is tracking the amount of forking that our node is experiencing.\r\nDuring low-forking situations, our cache may be much smaller. But during high-forking situations, we likely need to keep more states around.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nAs a first step, add metric(s) to track the amount of forking we're seeing.\r\nPossibly also metrics tracking the amount of state regen.\r\n\r\n",
