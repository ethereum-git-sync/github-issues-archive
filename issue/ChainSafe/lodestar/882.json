I'm always frustrated when [...]-->\r\n\r\nTraditionally Ethereum clients have exposed their APIs through JSON RPC, or perhaps REST. Though functional, there are some drawbacks to this approach. One of the main drawbacks IMO is requiring developers to learn yet another protocol for requests. Each application that exposes an API over http has different rules and syntax. GraphQL provides a solution to some of these drawbacks, mostly through its standard and flexible query language.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n<!--A clear and concise description of what you want to happen.-->\r\n\r\nLike Geth has done with their Ethereum client, I would love to see a GraphQL API exposed, along with the current REST API. I would be happy to consider doing this work myself.",
