    "body": "> Auth headers aren't part of the URL and need not be encoded\r\n\r\nThe problem is we are not setting these explicitly but as part of the URL. I wonder how other clients handle this but if you use a basic auth credentials (`username:password`) via browser it would certainly be URL encoded.\r\n\r\nBut I would agree we don't need to do that and align behavior with other clients. Also noticed it not URL encoding every character. e.g. `=` is encoded while `&` is not and `#` just throws an error..\r\n\r\n```node\r\n> new URL(\"http://user:passw=rd@localhost\")\r\nURL {\r\n  password: 'passw%3Drd',\r\n}\r\n\r\n> new URL(\"http://user:passw&rd@localhost\")\r\nURL {\r\n  password: 'passw&rd',\r\n}\r\n\r\n> new URL(\"http://user:passw#rd@localhost\")\r\nUncaught TypeError [ERR_INVALID_URL]: Invalid URL\r\n```\r\n\r\nI remember in the past that I had configured my password manager to only use URL safe characters for generation because various services had similar behavor (including browser)... this is bad should definitely not have any character restriction in passwords.",
