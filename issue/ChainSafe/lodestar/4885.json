A public ip is missing.\r\n\r\nNode can reach external network (ping outside works), and port is open.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nI should have a public ip on Multiaddrs variable.\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce**\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n",
