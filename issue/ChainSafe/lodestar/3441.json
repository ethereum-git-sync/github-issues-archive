This visualization gives the false impression that each dot represents a single instance of that metric (epoch transition time dot = 1 epoch transition).\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nAlways render charts as lines unless a dot chart will highly increase readability (REST API for example, lines are too much)",
