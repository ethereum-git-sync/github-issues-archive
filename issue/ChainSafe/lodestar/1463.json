Research if it's worth it to offload some ops to a worker thread.\nPros:\n - BLS is currently synchronous, so it can block and delay time-sensitive operations\n - Consider validating deposits beforehand in group and storing the result to be consumed by the state transition.\nCons:\n - State transition function would have to become async.\n - With native bindings, the improvements might be enough.",
