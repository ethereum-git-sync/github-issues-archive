  "body": "### Describe the bug\n\nUsers have reported Lodestar beacon nodes struggling to find peers on Chiado network. I have tested myself and also run into multiple times where the nodes stay longer than 10 minutes with 0 peers.\r\n\r\nI've tested locally running\r\n```\r\nDEBUG=discv5:* ./lodestar beacon --network chiado --rest --rest.address 0.0.0.0 --metrics --logLevel debug --eth1 false --execution.engineMock\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt enables discv5 logs and shows that discv5 is indeed working but not able to find suitable peers. Needs more investigation\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nFind many suitable peers within the first minute of running\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Operating system\n\nLinux\n\n### Lodestar version or commit hash\n\nLatest unstable ae478384890f9f2fcb7446b1860f84b3f3d5c5cf",
