    "body": "### Decisions from today's meeting\r\n\r\n- PR-5270 : Greg is in favor of closing this discussion as the EIP is already merged in the repo and have received a number. \r\n - PR- 6306 : No strong objection form the present participants. Discussed the format to add so we can capture the snapshot of YP.   @lightclient was unavailable to add input, but from the [comment here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/6306#issuecomment-1379068187), he may have divided opinion. So, if there isn't any strong objection, it can be merged.\r\n- PR-6269 : Does not specify design development, which is okay for an `Informational` EIP. Proposer should get more feedback.\r\n- PR-5703 : Present editors seems to be in agreement but decision will be pending @lightclient's thoughts on earlier concerns. Will be added to the next meeting. \r\n - [Open Issues](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues)\r\n   - Issue-6027: Greg is fine with Toggle switch. Can be closed. \r\n   - Issue-6131: Greg thinks it will be a good idea. Next steps- Make a PR to update EIP-1 & update EIP bot to add the check.  \r\nNext meeting - Feb 08, 2023 at 16:00 UTC.",
