Motivation section may include some reasons why someone should implement the EIP somewhere, and the security considerations may include gotchas to look out for, but I don't think EIPs are the right place to *argue* in favor/against an EIP.",

    "body": "@MicahZoltu \r\n> Should EIP discussion issues be closed when EIP is final? \r\n\r\nI am in favor of having EIP related discussion on the Fellowship of Ethereum Magician and NOT in the EIP repo issue or elsewhere. Encouraging discussions at EthMagician will eventually become a standard practice, which will provide the flexibility to keep a discussion open even after the EIP is Final and the Pull request is closed. \r\n\r\nHowever, for 'discussion issues' created so far, closing the issue should be helpful.\r\n\r\nFor some reason, if an author wants to keep the discussion open, he/she may open a discussion thread at Fellowship at Eth Magician and link it to the proposal.\r\n   \r\n\r\n",
