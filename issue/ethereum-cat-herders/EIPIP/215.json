  "body": "Requesting a review please of https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/6483\r\n\r\nThis includes several changes furthering the goal of making EIPs useful, and keeping the community together rather than immediately splitting off several EIP groups with their own independent leadership and processes.\r\n\r\n_(Note that maybe EIPs will be split out, and maybe that is a good thing. Or not. But this is PR addresses immediate problems.)_\r\n\r\n1. EIP website is focused on EIPs (currently it is focused on classifications and instructions, boring)\r\n2. The EIP website gets filters, which can quickly show you want you want to see\r\n3. RSS feeds are added, addressing a major concern people have about getting inundated with ERC notifications\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI am requesting please a review of this PR as a whole as-is without modification as to whether it is a net improvement and whether it should be merged now.\r\n\r\nRequesting this feedback on that PR as available---and then as necessary (if not merged) at the next EIPIP meeting.\r\n\r\nIf such consensus cannot be made to merge the PR as-is, I am alternatively requesting a review of the three specific initiatives above and a commitment to merge (with sufficient quorum/authority) if such a small refactoring of #6483 shall be made.\r\n",
