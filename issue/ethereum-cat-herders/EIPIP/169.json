    "body": "I guess we need to ask ourselves why we have authors and their GitHub or e-mail address. Author names are there for attribution, and we require a GitHub username for automated authentication. While we can perform manual authentication using e-mail, it really isn't a common practice (nor is it something I'd like to encourage.) You could argue that email addresses are there in case we need to contact an author, but generally speaking the `discussions-to` thread is better for that anyway. So we have communication and authentication.\r\n\r\nSo what benefits does adding an ENS name or Ethereum address bring?\r\n\r\nFor communication, they're pretty useless. There's no standard way of sending a message to an ENS/address, and while some solutions do exist, I don't think they're widespread enough to use in this process, and again, the `discussion-to` link is probably the best place to have discussions.\r\n\r\nWe could use an author's ENS/address for automated authentication, but as far as I know, there's no tooling to support signing a commit with an Ethereum private key. There's likely even less tooling to support signing a commit with an ENS name. I'd be much more excited about this ticket if someone could demo a signed commit we could use for authentication.\r\n\r\nIf we do want to add an authentication method that doesn't depend on GitHub, why not just make a `.pgp` folder containing public keys, and allow authors of the form `John Doe (6B00E477)` where `6B00E477` is the pgp key id?",

Author names are there for attribution, and we require a GitHub username for automated authentication. \r\n\r\nA data point of how EIP author address has been used: I have been using the email addresses on EIP to reach out to authors for questions, suggestions and invitation of peer reviews. \r\n\r\nENS name or mainnet address helps providing a native way to identify an author.  It also allow us to _depend less_ on Github account systems which is, for now, centralized. For example, author may authenticate and authorize their commit without requiring a github account. Currently it's still unlikely we move away completely from Github soon, but it's a step closer to a better future of EIP.\r\n\r\nWhile it seems slightly premature at this moment to advocate for using ENS to identify authors for now, I think there are benefits when ENS is mature (e.g. when adopted more widely). With the trend of account abtractions, it's possible in the future when everyone uses a smart contract as their wallet and social identity, they might be able to also specify communication channel in their ENS. such as ENS text entries or via something like https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5437\r\n\r\n> I support allowing ENS OR an Ethereum mainnet address. I would not support it if it was only ENS.\r\n\r\nI support either way or both. \r\n",
