Appreciate the feedback and let us know if you find anything else.\r\n\r\nWe'd love to onboard and support the EIP repos!  For now the primary use-case of GitPOAP is for recognizing community contributions to open source and allowing contributors to configure their profile/digital resume (ex https://www.gitpoap.io/p/gnidan.eth).  \r\n\r\nOver time as we build up this on-chain record of contribution, we aim to build even more useful coordination tooling, on-chain public goods funding, project & contributor discovery, etc.\r\n\r\nWe're also eager to hear from maintainers on what challenges you are facing and what we could possibly build to help.  Happy to answer any questions if you have them!",
