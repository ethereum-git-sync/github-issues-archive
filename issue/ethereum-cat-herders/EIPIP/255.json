Here is the description: [known problems of ERC-20](https://dexaran820.medium.com/known-problems-of-erc20-token-standard-e98887b9532c).\r\n\r\nThis leads to monetary losses in the Ethereum ecosystem, and at least $130,000,000 worth of tokens are lost due to this vulnerability today.\r\n\r\nI discovered this problem in 2017 and I reported it multiple times.\r\n\r\n- It caused people to lose [$13K when I first reported it](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/66gr2a/metropolis_and_erc23_request_for/).\r\n\r\n- Then it became [$16K when I reported it and had a discussion with Ethereum Foundation members](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/610#issuecomment-296711733).\r\n\r\n- Then it became [$1,000,0000 in 2018](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7mea1c/erc20_anniversary_new_ath_reached_1_000_000_lost/).\r\n\r\n- Then the author of ERC-20 standard stated he [doesn't want to use it in his new project](https://twitter.com/feindura/status/1676623784726470658) (probably because he knows about the problem of lost funds...).\r\n\r\n- And today [there are $130,000,000 lost](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/15hdz96/today_at_least_130m_worth_of_tokens_are_lost/) - my reddit post is censored and here is a copy https://gist.github.com/Dexaran/0b2df0a6ad9a2092fe0b768813669982\r\n\r\nEthereum Foundation didn't make any statement about this so far. This issue fits in \"critical severity security vulnerability\" according to OpenZeppelin bug bounty criteria https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/issues/4474\r\n\r\n## I think this is a precedent of \"Security Vulnerability Discovery in a 'final' EIP\"\r\n\r\n- Can we update ERC-20?\r\n- Can someone escalate it to Ethereum Foundation once again?\r\n- Can we assign a badge \"A vulnerability is discovered in this EIP\" to ERC-20 here https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20 ?\r\n\r\n## Other related publications\r\n\r\nHere is a security statement on ERC-20: https://callisto.network/erc-20-standard-callisto-network-security-department-statement/\r\n\r\nIt is considered a \"Vulnerability Disclosure\" by r/Cybersecurity: https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/15ejbjs/erc20_standard_callisto_security_department/\r\n\r\nIt is censored by r/ethereum with a reason \"It is not related to Ethereum ecosystem\": https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/15ej9zk/erc20_standard_callisto_security_department/\r\n\r\nYou can find a full history of all the related discussions under \"Events Timeline\" at ERC-223 page here: https://dexaran.github.io/erc223/",

If the problem becomes more publicly known, then more people will be able to avoid losing funds.\r\n\r\nAs the amount of funds lost due to this problem is at least $130M which exceeds the recent Curve hack twitce and there is no potential limit on how much damage it can cause in the future - I believe it is necessary to publicly highlight the problem.\r\n\r\nI think that:\r\n\r\n- a label must be placed on ERCP-20 here https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20\r\n- Ethereum Foundation must release their statement regarding this issue\r\n- Probably some statement regarding the $130M loss must be released - can these funds be recovered?

Right now. $130M worth already lost. Can you at least release a statement about it?\r\n3. May be they can do something really helpful to solve the problem of their users losing $130M? For example develop a better token standard? Or coordinate an ecosystem upgrade?\r\n4. Also what is going on with ethereum.org development? Read this comment thread https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org-website/issues/10854 I am developing a solution to this exact problem of financial losses of Ethereum users and my proposal gets removed from the documentation because the moderator had \"personal unexplainable feeling that I'm doing it wrong\" - is it how it is supposed to be?\r\n5. Can we recover the lost tokens with a hardfork? I think $130M loss is enough to start the recovery process especially given that this result was quite predictable and everyone knew about it.

It would be best if you're able to make it, but I'll mention it either way.\r\n\r\nI will try to assign my team member to this and let them represent me on a call.\r\n\r\n>>5. Can we recover the lost tokens with a hardfork? I think $130M loss is enough to start the recovery process especially given that this result was quite predictable and everyone knew about it. I personally highlighted this threat in 2017 here\r\n\r\n>This is something you could write an EIP for (see [EIP-779](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-779) for a somewhat outdated example.) You'd still need to raise support for the proposal on AllCoreDevs.\r\n\r\nCould you also escalate it to Ethereum Foundation if possible?\r\n\r\n",
