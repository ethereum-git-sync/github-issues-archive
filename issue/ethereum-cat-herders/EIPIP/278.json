    "body": "## Summary \r\n\r\n### 1. Discuss Open Issues/PRs, and other topics\r\n#### https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/7806\r\n- @Pandapip1 brought the item for discussion suggesting there isn't a process for `Superseding`.\r\n- @lightclient agreed it was a bit complicated in the past and is discontinued. And the PR should be closed. \r\n- PandaPip proposed if this can be allowed under \"Security consideration\"?\r\n- Matt found it generally reasonable. He also brought up the point of consideration for an author to add a status `Final-Deprecated`.\r\n- Pandpip: `Final-Withdrawn`\r\n- @xinbenlv  said that `Final-Superseded` will be good in the context of ERCs. \r\n- It's worth following the discussion on the recording.\r\n\r\n**Decision**\r\n- Panda will draft a PR to add a field \"Superseded by\" in the Preamble.\r\n- It will be discussed in the following meeting.\r\n- Keep the PR open. \r\n\r\n#### https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/7423\r\n- Approved by editors and merged. \r\n\r\n### Manual Merge\r\n\r\n#### https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/7505\r\n- Approved in the last meeting. \r\n- @lightclient wants to take another look before merging.\r\n- Panda (who missed the last meeting) also approved.\r\n\r\n#### https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/7506\r\n- Approved in earlier meetings. \r\n- Merged.\r\n\r\n ### 2. Discussion continued or updates from past meetings\r\n #### https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/7550\r\n **Call for Input**\r\n- The due date is Oct 6th, so we have some time for editors to respond to Call for Action. \r\n- PandaPip brought up #266 for discussion mentioning unavailability of an author may block decision-making. The way the current charter is set up, the involvement of every author is needed. He further proposed to have an \"Intermediate Editor\"?\r\n- agreeing to that @g11tech said getting feedback in the first week of Issues will be ideal to speed up the process.  \r\n- Without Axic voting, there is no way to have the first \"keeper of the consensus\".\r\n- Matt and other editors are respectful of Axic's interest to continue to contribute but there were discussion of having a \"special status editor\" or delegate vote. \r\n- It seems the proposal will not pass, no decision on the call, will be communicated at the next meeting. \r\n  \r\n\r\n#### Repo split - [EIP-7329](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7329)\r\n- PandaPip proposed meeting time as next Oct 11th at 1400 UTC. \r\n- May reach out to all editors async to plan the meeting given Sam is on vacation till 17th. \r\n- He further shared a \"last minute change\" to splitting the repo wrt \"EIP Type\". \r\n- Victor: Interface may go closer to ERC. Wondering about the placeholder for Interface and similar EIPs.\r\n- Matt: Interface and networking to be deprecated.\r\n- Gajinder: EIPs requiring hardfork will be `Core` and rest all not with Core EIPs. Also, decided to deprecate categories. \r\n- Panda: will update the related Call For Input Issue.\r\n- Danno - The Developer audience is more important to draw the line for EIPs categories. \r\n- The networking group works well with the Client dev group and should be excluded from the ERC group. \r\n- The subdomain erc.ethereum.org is ready. Just waiting to set up the correct files. \r\n- Panda wants to try to separate the repo. Matt is pretty against that but open to look into the Pull Request.\r\n- Worth following the discussion. \r\nWe ran out of time, the discussion will be continued on the Discord.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
