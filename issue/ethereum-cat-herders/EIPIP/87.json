Post-merge will core cover execution and consensus, or do we plan to categorize EIPs based on what they touch? ref: [Discord](https://discordapp.com/channels/595666850260713488/746566142700814426/895319748378779719)\r\n\r\n### 2. Remove updated from EIP-1 Ref: [Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/4384)\r\n\r\n### 3. Progress update on moving to `Stagnant` by bot. Ref: [eip-bot](https://github.com/ethereum/EIP-Bot)\r\n- Guidelines to change the status from \"Stagnant\" \r\n  - could it be the last status from which it moved to \"Stagnant\" or it has to be either \"Draft\" or \"Review\"? \r\n  - if the author makes a PR to change the status, would it require editors' permission?\r\n  - if moving the proposal is impossible for any reason. eg. [EIP-3403: Partial removal of refunds](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3403)\r\n  - if moving proposal is a necessity but EIP author(s) or champion isn't actively involved?\r\n\r\n### 4.. [EIPs Insight](https://hackmd.io/@poojaranjan/EthereumImprovementProposalsInsight/) - Monthly EIPs status reporting \r\n\r\n### 5. The future of \"EIP merge bot\" - Is it safe to turn it down? \r\n\r\n### 6. Admin access to EIP repo to EIP editors? \r\n\r\n### 7. Review action items from the [previous meetings](https://github.com/ethereum-cat-herders/EIPIP/blob/master/All%20EIPIP%20Meetings/Meeting%20041.md)\r\n- Updating the EIP editors list \r\n\r\n(Anything else, please add a comment)",
