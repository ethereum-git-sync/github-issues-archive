    "body": "## Summary \r\n\r\n### 1. Discuss Open Issues/PRs, and other topics\r\n\r\n#### https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/7549\r\n- Revaluate the proposal in the next meeting, if we want to do it\r\n- Simplify and get rid of the complexities which are there now.\r\n\r\n#### https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/7541\r\n\r\n- @shemnon has some concerns. According to him, it is great for history but wondering if it is put in as a part of the presented specification, as it might bend room for arguments.\r\n- @g11tech suggested the option of having a side pane to improve the EIP reading experience. \r\n- @xinbenlv suggested having a competing website and users may choose.\r\n- A/B testing was also proposed \r\n- Continue discussion on the Issue. \r\n\r\n#### Consider adopting a Community Specification License terms for the new ERC repo  ethereum/EIPs#7482\r\n- @SamWilsn was curious to understand the difference from the present license we have. \r\n- @bumblefudge shared about _Community Specification License_\r\n- It's a very lightweight IP protection. At the moment, CC0 does not protect against patents. \r\n- @shemnon suggested that we must get the opinion of lawyers.\r\n- Sam may talk to somebody at the EF.\r\n- Victor will also collect thoughts from ERC authors at AllERCDev meeting.\r\n\r\n#### https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/7554\r\n\r\n- @shemnon summarized the discussion point.\r\n- @Pandapip1 shared his objection at the very end of the discussion. It seems he is okay with the repo split but holds on to the website split. \r\n- @lightclient - We have already agreed upon the repository naming in earlier meetings. \r\n- Most of the editors on the call were in favor of having different rendering websites for EIPs and ERCs. The split will proceed as decided in the earlier EIPIP meeting.\r\n- It was suggested to have redirect canonical links for ERCs, if possible. \r\n- @bumblefudge offered to help if the redirects per-moved-spec are hard to implement in Jekyll\r\n- PR closed\r\n\r\n### Changes to Final proposals\r\n [Update EIP-721: Add ERC links ethereum/EIPs#7550](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/7550)\r\n- @SamWilsn reviewed the pull request. There could be a minor change but it seems acceptable. \r\n- @shemnon mentioned having a policy in place to update `Final` EIPs will be good to have. \r\n- It will be left open for the next 2 weeks, if no one blocks, it can be merged. \r\n\r\n### 2. Discussion continued or updates from past meetings\r\n #### EIP-ERC GitHub repositories\r\n- @SamWilsn ratified the decision-making process. \r\n- @xinbenlv is also in support of 5069. Most of the people were in support in the last meeting. \r\n- Sam nominated Gajinder for the “Keeper of Consensus”\r\nThe type of EIP will also be changed.\r\n-  Formal process for decision making\r\n  -  Post a “call for input” on EIPIP GitHub\r\n  - Post in channels frequented by EIPP editors\r\n  - 30 days after this is posted, the decision is made based on the input from all the editors.\r\n",
