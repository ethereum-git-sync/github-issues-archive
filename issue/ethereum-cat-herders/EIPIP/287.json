    "body": "Responding to the points @dexaran raised on their pull request:\r\n\r\n> The links are outdated significantly and the code is written in Solidity 0.4.x versions. [...]\r\n\r\nThe standard was written against solidity 0.4, and is specified in terms of that version. If solidity released a version 1.0 with a different calling convention, we wouldn't update ERC-20 to use that calling convention because that would invalidate all existing ERC-20 tokens.\r\n\r\nBy that logic, I don't believe that the age of the reference implementation is a good argument for removing it.\r\n\r\n> The content in the links is licensed under MIT while the EIP process requires that the content would be licensed under CC0.\r\n\r\nEIP-1 only requires that the EIP is CC0, and doesn't really specify whether assets are part of the EIP or are separate works. I usually operate under the policy that assets can be any license that doesn't impose too much on implementers. We have a [discussion thread](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/licences-for-assets-reference-implementations-in-eips/14329) open to come up with an official policy.\r\n\r\nAll that to say that if we wanted to move an MIT-licensed reference implementation into the EIPs repository, I wouldn't object.\r\n\r\nFurther, since we do allow linking to non-CC0 resources (eg. IETF RFCs, WHATWG specs, etc.), I don't believe the license is a sufficient argument for removing these links.\r\n\r\n> The developers of the initial reference implementation benefit from this commercially.\r\n\r\nThis is, at least somewhat, convincing. We should maintain credible neutrality as much as possible, and having a link to a particular external implementation directly in an EIP somewhat violates that principle, especially since we cannot update EIPs as new implementations are created.\r\n\r\nThat said, I think we need to balance this credible neutrality against our promise of immutability. ERC-20 is Final, and shouldn't be changed. Our policy on external links didn't exist when ERC-20 was written. Obviously if it were written today, ERC-20 wouldn't have those links.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI am going to have to **oppose** this decision, though I'm open to being convinced otherwise.",

Any particular implementation is not standard. So I see no reason to mislead potential implementers by providing them with an insanely outdated code. The EIP repo is supposed to **help** people to build useful things. And the presence of this links doesn't help in any sensible way and is potentially misleading from my point of view.\r\n\r\nI would also argue that solidity version bumps must be allowed even for \"final\" EIPs but this is not the topic of this PR.\r\n\r\n>having a link to a particular external implementation directly in an EIP somewhat violates that principle, especially since we cannot update EIPs as new implementations are created.\r\n\r\nYou also don't allow new EIPs to have links.\r\n\r\n- Two organizations githubs are listed in the EIP-20 \r\n- Nobody can be listed \"officially\" in EIP-20\r\n- Nobody can be listed \"officially\" in any new EIP\r\n\r\nIt looks like a serious endorsement (which again goes directly against [EIP-5069](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5069)) for any person who is not deeply involved in the EIP process. Other users certainly interpret it as an endorsement.\r\n\r\n![EIP-decide-winners](https://github.com/ethereum-cat-herders/EIPIP/assets/26142412/5cef3806-5c33-486b-8446-a58106b5b607)\r\n",

'Final means no more changes' - In Final, normative changes should be disallowed, and non-normative changes that result in a different interpretation are discouraged. Admittedly, the links to these implementations does result in a different interpretation - that those implementations are NOT somehow canonical.\r\n2. '@Dexaran has a conflict of interest' - Everyone knows he's the author of ERC-223, a competing standard. The governance system we've made makes decisions on the objective evidence provided and the subjective consensus of the editor group. @Dexaran is not a part of the editor group, so his bias has limited impact here. We shouldn't consider that he is biased against ERC-20, only what he has to say.\r\n\r\nNote: @Dexaran's gripe with ERC-20 is very much justified. **Nobody** should be arguing that the problem doesn't exist. If money is being lost, then there's a problem and the responsibility lies somewhere. I would argue ERC-223 is not the best way to solve the problem, because the responsibility lies with wallets not providing a good UX when submitting transactions, not with the token contracts themselves.",
