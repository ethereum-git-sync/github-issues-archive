    "body": "The extremely short version (from memory, so things may be out of order or just wrong):\r\n\r\n1. Pull request was opened by a bot waiting for number 5000. This was admitted by the EIP authors.\r\n2. I assigned the number 4998 instead, since we try and discourage number sniping.\r\n3. lightclient asked me in private if he could assign a different number.\r\n4. Pull request was merged as EIP-5000.\r\n5. Two other pull requests were opened, one to delete EIP-5000 and one to renumber it to EIP-5159.\r\n6. Argument among EIP Editors ensued.\r\n7. New decision making process ratified in [EIP-5069](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5069).\r\n8. https://github.com/ethereum-cat-herders/EIPIP/issues/274\r\n9. Deadline elapsed.\r\n10. As Keeper of Consensus, I determined the rough consensus to be \"don't renumber\", with:\r\n    - In favour of renumbering: myself, xinbenlv, and g11tech.\r\n        - it was number sniping.\r\n        - one of the EIP authors is an editor, and should've been held to a higher standard.\r\n        - [Broken Windows Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory).\r\n        - Unfair to authors who didn't snipe, and to authors who sniped and were manually reassigned.\r\n    - Opposed to renumbering: pandapip1, lightclient, gcolvin\r\n        - Wasn't technically against the rules in EIP-1 at the time.\r\n        - It's been so long it'll just cause more confusion now.",
