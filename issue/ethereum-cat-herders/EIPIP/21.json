    "body": "Unfortunately I can't make tomorrow's meeting, but a few comments related to the above points:\r\n\r\n2. Github allows a special type of contributor with \"[triage permissions](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization)\", meaning that they don't have write access to the repository, but can label issues and PRs. I think this could be a good on-ramp for contributors to become editors and would minimize the time editors need to click through PRs to see what their status is.\r\n\r\n3. * It would be good to agree on a specific naming convention for EIPs, since [official documents](https://eips.ethereum.org/) use several different formats (e.g. `EIP-1`, `EIP1`, `EIP 1`). There has been some discussion in these threads: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/2734, https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/2738, https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1464. I am in favor of using the hyphenated form.\r\n    * What are people's thoughts on increasing the strictness of the `eip_validator`? It seems like the quality of EIPs could be improved quite a bit if more checks occurred before merging. I've started work on a [new EIP validator](https://github.com/lightclient/eipv). I plan to make it much stricter than the existing validator and [more robust](https://gitter.im/ethereum/EIPs?at=5efa1dffe0e5673398e0b7d0).\r\n   * How can we funnel people working on similar EIPs together? For example, [EIP-2549](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/2579) is related to eth1.x and eth2 witnesses. Those groups may not be at the stage where they are ready to pursue and EIP, but it seems like this will end up being superseded by the eventual EIP from those groups. Funneling independent contributors to existing efforts is a [standard practice for RFC contributions](https://www.rfc-editor.org/about/independent/#:~:text=To%20post%20an%20Internet%2DDraft,%40rfc%2Deditor.org.).",
