    "body": "> Why is there a strict emphasis on immutability of the non-normative parts of the spec?\r\n\r\nThere are a couple reasons. First and foremost, we don't really define any sections as normative or non-normative officially. The whole EIP goes to final, so the whole EIP is immutable. We do have two specific exceptions to the immutability guarantee: errata and non-normative clarifications.\r\n\r\nThis change doesn't qualify as an errata, because the EIP as written was not _incorrect_ and this wasn't a mistake. This is wholly new information.\r\n\r\nThis also isn't a non-normative clarification. It isn't explaining something that was ambiguous in the original text, again, this is wholly new information.\r\n\r\n> I would argue that the Security Considerations section in particular should be allowed to evolve. Very often we only learn what can go wrong after specs are Final and deployed to production.\r\n\r\nWe absolutely need somewhere to put security considerations that appear after finalization. https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/7915 is probably the first of this kind.\r\n\r\nThe problem, as I see it, with doing security disclosures though the EIP process is that we must choose one of these policies:\r\n\r\n1. EIP Editors decide what is/isn't a factual vulnerability. Importantly, this requires EIP Editors become technical experts.\r\n2. We publish every vulnerability, factual or not.\r\n3. We publish no vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nOption 1 damages our credible neutrality. We could publish or withhold a change based on personal gain, instead of based on the facts. Out of options 2 and 3, I'd prefer 3.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBecause rules-as-written this is not an errata or clarification, and because I don't want EIP Editors embroiled in \"is it\" / \"is it not\" debates, I am going to have to **oppose** changing ERC-1271.",

[One of the] Author(s) of original EIP/ERC submits new informational EIP/ERC and adds a pointer to it from the frontmatter of their original EIP/ERC in the same PR, without otherwise changing one byte of final EIP/ERC. No editorial judgment on validity is implied or required.\r\n\r\nI know i'm simplifying a bit, but this seems like a good example of how something like 7915 combined with a new (optional) frontmatter variable could work.\r\n\r\nWould it help to open a PR on a new frontmatter field called `addendum` or `bis`?  This would basically be equivalent to W3C errata publications (which _do_ go through editorial review but not normative/technical review) and IETF \"bis\" (which is like an addendum, not limited to errata, that similarly goes through only-editorial review after a final draft).",

    "body": "@SamWilsn \r\n\r\n>The problem, as I see it, with doing security disclosures though the EIP process is that we must choose one of these policies:\r\n>1. EIP Editors decide what is/isn't a factual vulnerability. Importantly, this requires EIP Editors become technical experts.\r\n> 2. We publish every vulnerability, factual or not.\r\n> 3. We publish no vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nWe can create a **security guideline** as I've proposed above. In this case we only need to agree on what \"security vulnerability\" looks like only once and after that EIP editors can simply **benchmark proposals against the described rule set** (obviously we need to develop the rules with explicit explanations of how they apply and how a person can understand if some proposal satisfies the rule or not). It does require some degree of technical expertise but I think its a reasonable requirement for an EIP editor.\r\n\r\nAnyways if there is a vulnerability disclosure then someone is championing it - and therefore the burden of proving that some EIP violates some rule is placed on the champion of the disclosure.",
