    "body": "@SamWilsn\r\n\r\n>I am opposed to merging this pull request.\r\n>Please see https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/modification-of-eip-process-to-account-for-security-treatments/16265/8 for my reasoning.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the linked thread he said the following:\r\n\r\n>\"I object to including security considerations surfaced after a proposal becomes final within the body of the proposal itself. To be clear, I do believe that these security considerations should be published somewhere, just not within the EIP.\r\nMy objection stems from the question of who has the authority to determine if a security disclosure is worthy of publishing.\r\n\r\n\r\nI would like to note that this PR https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/7915 does not propose any changes to any EIP. It only creates a new informational EIP as it was suggested by the EIP editors before.\r\n\r\n### First, I would blame EIP editors for judging my proposal in the DRAFT status. \r\n\r\nAs I can read in the [EIP-1](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1#eip-editors) and [EIP-5069](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5069) you should:\r\n\r\n- Read the EIP to check if it is ready: sound and complete. The ideas must make technical sense, even if they don’t seem likely to get to final status.\r\n- The title should accurately describe the content.\r\n- Check the EIP for language (spelling, grammar, sentence structure, etc.), markup (GitHub flavored Markdown), code style\r\n\r\nAnd this is what you should not:\r\n\r\n![EIP5069](https://github.com/ethereum-cat-herders/EIPIP/assets/26142412/7dfdfb71-6d4c-4cb6-8e83-51de32375c53)\r\n\r\nI don't see any mentions of any reasons that would prevent me from creating a proposal that does make technical sense. I think that it can be accepted as DRAFT as soon as the language is correct. I would be fine with EIP editors merging it as DRAFT and expressing their concerns regarding the correctness of the proposal during the PEER REVIEW stage. I would be fine if the proposal never gets finalized until all the expressed concerns are resolved.\r\n\r\nHowever I would blame EIP editors for **\"deciding the winner\"** here. By not allowing me to publish sensitive info related to one of the proposals you are implying that the proposal is good - which in fact is not true because it caused [$90,000,000 to $200,000,000 millions of dollars financial damage](https://dexaran.github.io/erc20-losses) to our users.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you don't have a process or a security expert in your team  then it would be much better to let all the security-related proposals to get merged as DRAFTs and never let them past REVIEW in long term. Because if a security expert will once join your team and you will assign him to security-related EIPs and ERCs they will all be there in the DRAFT statuses.\r\n\r\n### Second, I encourage EIP editors to think about the mission here\r\n\r\nWe are not discussing a random proposal. **We are discussing a real problem.** A problem that damages people, endangers their wellbeing and may be even ruins lives.\r\n\r\n- This is how this people look and this is what they write: https://www.reddit.com/r/0xProject/comments/7lpc5n/ive_sent_my_tokens_to_the_zrx_smart_contract/\r\n- This is how this people look: https://twitter.com/Crypto_Plato/status/1303235432755294216\r\n- This is how this people look: https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/34559/i-accidentally-sent-a-token-to-a-token-contract-can-i-get-it-back\r\n\r\nThis problem can be solved technically. This has persisted for years because of everyone's reluctance to take responsibility for announcing it.\r\n\r\nImagine that you are a bank and you are using a database that contains a flaw that was discovered 6 years ago but nobody took responsibility of upgrading yours so you are still using it. As the result your customers lost $90,000,000 to software bugs but you decided to hide this fact. Does it look fair? Would you put your money in such bank? What will people think of it once it gets discovered?\r\n\r\n![EX26](https://github.com/ethereum-cat-herders/EIPIP/assets/26142412/6e98277f-ce3e-4cae-b522-2bee91d62534)\r\n\r\nHow do you \"foster transparency and ensure that valuable insights from past proposals are accessible\" if you silence a disclosure of a catastrophic problem that caused real financial damage that exceeds the scale of TheDAO hack?\r\n\r\nYou can probably call multiple reasons for simply ignoring the problem like \"we EIP editors don't want to decide XYZ\" but you know the problem is still there. It will not just disappear on its own, it will be there in 2024 if we don't make some steps to solve it now. And the first step that we can make is at least announce it.",
