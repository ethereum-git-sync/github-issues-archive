The upside is that everyone is happy and can choose which standard to implement. The downside is that now there are multiple competing standards.\r\n\r\nSo:\r\n- Inconsistencies are fine as long as they don't cause any contradictions\r\n- EIP-4907 will permanently have that inconsistency, but if new standards are proposed, you may feel free to choose whichever you prefer.\r\n- A new EIP that is more consistent with EIP-721 may be created. All EIPs are CC0-licenced, so new EIPs can contain any amount of content from other EIPs.",
