    "body": "I would like to propose that there is a discussion about constraining the EIP repository scope.  @poojaranjan just pointed out to me elsewhere that a recent EIPIP meeting resulted in the recommendation to use the EIPs repository as a storage vault for mainnet operations retrospectives, but to me that feels like pretty big scope creep, and somewhat contrary to the idea of getting Ethereum mainnet stuff out of the EIPs repository (like the hardfork meta EIP).\r\n\r\nI would like to see this repository be *just* standards, and anything else can live somewhere else.  EIP editors are all volunteer and already *way* overstretched with work.  I think we should be looking into how we can cut scope, not add scope.  An example of how we can cut scope would be to extract ERCs into a separate repository and get hardfork consensus process out of this repository.",

    "body": "I've spent some time reflecting on the discussion last meeting regarding the separation of the EIP process and the network upgrade process. I understand and agree with the desire to separate the two processes. I believe that the network upgrade consensus process requires different parties and must address different concerns than the finalization of specs. However, I disagree that the EIPs repository should not acknowledge the importance of an EIP landing on mainnet. It is valuable to look at an EIP and quickly determine if it is the current state-of-the-art (on mainnet). There is no reason to not mark mainnet EIPs as \"state-of-the-art\". If the network upgrade process is truly separate, then it is simply a bookkeeping task that the author / editors must undertake to update the metadata. With better tooling, it can even be automated. I urge us to take another look at the statuses and decide upon a name for a new status that denotes an EIP has been deployed to mainnet.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nOn another note, there are a lot of other aspects of the EIP process that can be improved. However, I believe that many of those will dissipate if we address the lack of ownership that currently exists in the process. While our protocol must be tustless and resistant to censorship, the default avenue in our standardization process does not necessarily need to embody those principles. Without any ownership in the process, there is little desire to improve it. It becomes a tragedy of the commons.\r\n\r\nI would like us to explore the idea of working groups. Essentially all standardization organizations have them--Ethereum shouldn't be special in this regard. We already have them informally. We should acknowledge them explicitly and give them ownership of their track (again, this is separate from network upgrade coordination). Editors can focus on generic EIP requirements and act as custodians of the repository, while working groups should help direct resources and ideas towards existing efforts. Working groups shouldn't be gatekeepers. They should have high level goals and help elevate new ideas and participants which align with their goals by connecting them to resources which can help them accomplish their goals. A quick sketch of a few working groups I envision:\r\n\r\n| What  | Who   | Goals   |\r\n|---|---|---|\r\n| Meta | This group + editors | Maintain EIP-1, facilitate work group processes, maintain and develop tools to improve the EIP process |\r\n| EVM | EVM devs  | Improve the EVM and study the effect of changes to it |\r\n| Clients | Core devs | Improve client design and development, reduce resources needed to operate clients |\r\n| Networking | devp2p devs | Improve the networking infrastructure of the Etheruem network |\r\n| ERC | Authors of existing ERCs, defi folks |  Design token standards and maintain interoperability across various standards |\r\n| RPC | web3 library maintainers / dapp devs | Improve the interface between application developers and clients |\r\n| Eth 1.x | The eth 1.x group | Research and propose the optimal path to transitioning eth1 to a more stateless network | \r\n| Eth 2.0 | The eth 2 research + client teams | Design and develop the Ethereum 2.0 protocol, propose and review changes needed in the eth1 protocol | \r\n| ... | ... | and more |\r\n\r\nI believe that establishing working groups will not only help relieve some of the duties of EIP editors, it will improve the quality of EIPs in the repository and increase the velocity of ideation and collaboration. If others believe that this would be valuable step to make, I would be happy to flesh it out more and shepherd its adoption.",

I only disagree that such things should live in the EIPs repository.\r\n\r\nI suspect this difference of opinion stems from a difference in belief in what the purpose of EIPs are.  If you believe that EIPs are specifically related to the chain known as Ethereum, then your stance has much more strength.  If you believe that EIPs are a place to standardize things which may be used on Ethereum, but may also be used on Ethereum Classic, or any other of the Ethereum-like chains then I think my stance is strengthened.\r\n\r\nI'm in the camp that the purpose of the EIPs repository should be to standardize things that make sense on any Ethereum-like chain, which includes Ethereum 1.x, Ethereum Classic, Ethereum 2.x, etc. and this means that sometimes stuff will be final without ever making it to Ethereum mainnet, but that doesn't mean it isn't state of the art.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that eventually Ethereum 1.x will diverge from Ethereum 2 and so \"state of the art\" will become pretty fuzzy even for Ethereum mainnet since there will, effectively, be two Ethereum mainnets.",
