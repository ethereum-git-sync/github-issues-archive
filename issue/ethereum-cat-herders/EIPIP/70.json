    "body": "(action items?) From previous meeting: \r\n\r\nMicah felt we should actively discourage claiming that draft-status EIPs are standards and the implementation of these drafts. Lightclient wasn't sure how this discouragement could occur, instead proposing work on the draft occurs as soon as possible. \r\nEdson Ayllon felt a (red) warning banner for unfinished / unaccepted ERCs could work. Micah was supportive. The hunt is on for someone who knows CSS/HTML to jump on the EIP repo. Alita Moore said it's something they could do. \r\n\r\nDiscussion arose as to whether William Schwab should become an ERC editor. He writes smart contracts and has been working with magicians. \r\n\r\nLightclient raised the idea of hosting 'consultation hours' where \"people could come...and they could just you know give a five minute pitch of their idea, and someone could stamp it like “this is not an ERC”\". Will Schwab provided some resistance to this idea, supposing there could be a wave of low-effort engagement. In the name of time this wasn't resolved. ",
