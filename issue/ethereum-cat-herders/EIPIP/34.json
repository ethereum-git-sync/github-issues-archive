    "body": "Hi @MicahZoltu, planning and specification work around the EIP had already started when I created the PR.\r\n\r\nThere has been a lot of work already done in the ERC (see [aragon/erc3k](https://github.com/aragon/erc3k)) and given that what you propose would be unprecedented, the ecosystem DAO working on the EIP has already acquired a domain name to host its documentation (https://erc3k.org), so we would not appreciate if this new policy gets applied for the first time retroactively.\r\n\r\nThe group believes that the memetic value of the 3000 number is important for an ERC that could have a lot of relevance if successful in adoption (perhaps even beyond Ethereum), that's why the PR got created when it did. This is not the first time this happens and I personally never had an issue when it has happened.\r\n\r\nWe have prioritized work on the code spec linked above (and also wrote a reference implementation to test it out) rather than writing the EIP text that would have massively changed as we iterated on it. Nevertheless, we were planning to publish our current draft later today.\r\n\r\nHappy to join and discuss it in the call if deemed necessary.",

Also, this wouldn't be the first time editors have blocked number squatting (happens when we come up on \"human-friendly numbers\").",
