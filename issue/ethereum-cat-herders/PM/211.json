    "body": "@poojaranjan it makes the most sense to me to put all engineering related tasks on my plate by adding them here. I may be too busy with other things to get to them quickly, so you can try and find people to do them. If those people don't / no one jumps on then I will _eventually_ get to it :) I have added on the website banner + marking EIPs as stale bot. I am just going to tackle things kind of in random orders, but if you want to have an agile style sprint kickoff / priority planning sessions biweekly / at the ECH meeting that would also be fine. This will also be helpful because it will let us easily hire on other people as they become available / necessary but I will nevertheless be working on it at all times.",

The pull request looks good to me. As soon as it is merged, will close the issue. \r\n\r\nI would appreciate tasks being managed in an orderly fashion. You may leave the tasks open for the community if you have bandwidth issues but feel free to move/add it to your list if there is no response till the time you're available to work on it and finish up in the respective month. \r\n\r\nI would hate to overwhelm you with tasks over your contract time, so an estimate on efforts will be helpful to put out a bounty on tasks to be completed sooner rather than later if there is an overflow of engineering tasks. \r\n\r\n",
