Submitted 4. **Done** \n\n<hr>\n\n__Work has been started__.\n\n\nThese users each claimed they can complete the work by 1 week ago.\nPlease review their action plans below:\n\n\n**1) [whiterabot17](https://gitcoin.co/whiterabot17) has applied to start work _(Funders only: [approve worker](https://gitcoin.co/issue/ethereum-cat-herders/PM/64/2955?mutate_worker_action=approve&worker=whiterabot17) | [reject worker](https://gitcoin.co/issue/ethereum-cat-herders/PM/64/2955?mutate_worker_action=reject&worker=whiterabot17))_.**\n\nStep 1. Review criteria\nStep 2. Communicate with developers on project about requirements.\nStep 3. Review similar hash algorithm precompile code\nStep 4. Code/Test\nStep 5. Repeat steps 1-4.\n**2) [madeoftin](https://gitcoin.co/madeoftin) has been approved to start work.**\n\nThe due date for Istanbul was last week so I reformatted and submitted the EIP. https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/2024\nCarterpy has also joined me on development. \n\nI can do the majority of the legwork in shepherding the EIP through the EIP process as well as be the point of contact for developers and the community.\n\nThe next steps are too:\n\n* Re-implement the existing code\n* Respond to the CoreDev feedback on design choices\n* Finalize the specification \n* Bench-marking gas costs\n* Second Client implementation\n* Testing\n\nI will continue to keep this moving forward until this EIP makes it into a Hardfork. There is still a chance it can make it into Istanbul as there is two months before the soft-deadline for client implementations.\n**3) [srcoughlin](https://gitcoin.co/srcoughlin) has applied to start work _(Funders only: [approve worker](https://gitcoin.co/issue/ethereum-cat-herders/PM/64/2955?mutate_worker_action=approve&worker=srcoughlin) | [reject worker](https://gitcoin.co/issue/ethereum-cat-herders/PM/64/2955?mutate_worker_action=reject&worker=srcoughlin))_.**\n\nI've followed the discussion on this in core devs meeting #62 and think I can champion this along.  It's going to need detailed performance metrics as the recently optimized EVM implementation already reduces the gas savings potential over when EIP 152 was originally created. This may also require consideration of heterogeneous computing optimizations.\nThis project can also act as a template for gas cost estimations and precompile savings estimations for other cryptographic hash functions.\n**4) [mhluongo](https://gitcoin.co/mhluongo) has applied to start work _(Funders only: [approve worker](https://gitcoin.co/issue/ethereum-cat-herders/PM/64/2955?mutate_worker_action=approve&worker=mhluongo) | [reject worker](https://gitcoin.co/issue/ethereum-cat-herders/PM/64/2955?mutate_worker_action=reject&worker=mhluongo))_.**\n\nWe're working through the F precompile EIP (https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/2129) as well as the get implementation (https://github.com/keep-network/go-ethereum/pull/4)\n**5) [prorokeskobar](https://gitcoin.co/prorokeskobar) has applied to start work _(Funders only: [approve worker](https://gitcoin.co/issue/ethereum-cat-herders/PM/64/2955?mutate_worker_action=approve&worker=prorokeskobar) | [reject worker](https://gitcoin.co/issue/ethereum-cat-herders/PM/64/2955?mutate_worker_action=reject&worker=prorokeskobar))_.**\n\nProvide an action plan and any initial questions you have for this ticket.\n\nLearn more [on the Gitcoin Issue Details page](https://gitcoin.co/issue/ethereum-cat-herders/PM/64/2955).\n\n",
