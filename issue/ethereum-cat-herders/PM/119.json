I've been on the run from the virus, busy with the technical details of ProgPoW, and trying to earn a living.)\r\n\r\nAs an EIP-1057 champion and Core Dev I was appalled to learn that what appeared to be an official recording of our decisions was not.  Including a clear decision to move forward with ProgPow.  We are fixing that.\r\n\r\nI'm also not alone in feeling overwhelmed by the disorganized lobbying on Twitter and elsewhere.  After nearly two years stakeholders have had ample opportunity to make their arguments heard on forums like the Magicians' thread for the EIP itself, but still the community feels they have not been listened to.\r\n\r\nI feel a real need to organize discussions that can elucidate WHY people hold the positions they do.  The community is too large and amorphous for votes and signals to mean much.  And the Core Devs can in the end only deal well with arguments of a more technical nature.\r\n\r\nIn this case the primary question is not \"ProgPow -- yes _or_ no?\" but \"ASIC- or GPU-secured network -- why _and_ why not?\"\r\n\r\n",

If there is time available I'd also like to discuss the potential of hosting VR meetups for cat-herders and the BUIDL network while we're all stuck at home. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, I'd like to offer a variety of educational resources for anyone who would find them beneficial; which isn't necessary as a talking point, as I could just put together a dropbox folder or something similar. That said, it could potentially be used to incentivize engagement and contribution as rewards if that would be of interest.\r\n",
