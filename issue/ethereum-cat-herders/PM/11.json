The request for a point person is because of this. The Cats (or point person) could have better prepared Hudson for the discussion.\r\n\r\nThere could have been a clearly defined set of talking points and things to agree on, yet Hudson was going on and on about ASICs, benchmarking and signals... all of which has been covered ad nauseam. Thankfully Danno mentioned the security aspect, which is really what we need whiteblock or whatever company for.\r\n\r\nThe analysis company hasn't been figured out yet either. Funding for Andrea and the analysis needs to be dealt with too. It isn't even clear if it'll happen in Istanbul or a separate fork based on what Alexey and Martin were saying.\r\n\r\nSo yea, keep this issue open please.",

Most people who participated have now moved on as they have done their part. Do we need to keep reminding people who voted in the earlier signaling to “keep shouting” as decisions will be revered based on “who shouts the loudest at the moment”?\r\n\r\nWe have asked for a clear roadmap to ProgPoW to be able to get miners to fund the audit. This happened on Friday, and I was confident based on the statements made then that we will get this funded. If ProgPoW implementation reverts back to “Fund the audit and we will see what the community sentiment is” contributing to the audit will seem like a waste of money to many.",
