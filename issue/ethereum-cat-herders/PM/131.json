    "body": "I think this falls under malaoch ECH funding, but I looked into the cost of a hackathon. Generally speaking, we could probably do one with ~50-100 people for 10-20k usd. I think there's no reason to do one with less people. The driving factor would be to foster interest in ethereum by inviting students. The greatest cost of an event is consistently travel, so it would be best to do it in a city like chicago, new york, or something similar.\n\n This event could focus around \"hacking\" and hacking eth smart contracts. \n\nWe could use such an event to market for more funding. So a person here that likes to take photos would be awesome for _propaganda_.\n\nThis would also be a good opportunity to gauge community interest in getting involved, and it can be marketed as underground.\n\nI'm (understandably) not privy to the financials, so without more details I don't know what's feasible. But generally, it would offer ECH insight into drive for involvement and the types of people wanting to get involved, advertisement for funding / notarity, and a fun time for us cat herders and the community at large.\n\nTo organize, I'd say it would take probably about 6-8 months. With slated event date of July 30th (when first block was mined) 2021. But of course the exact date is tertiary\n",

This can be done with [matrix bridges](https://matrix.org/bridges/) which used the open source [repo](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc).\n\nNotably, this would require a dedicated server (presumably a raspberry pi would do?), but do we have any other pre-dedicated servers or is anyone willing to host one with good uptime? I personally don't have this yet, not least of which because my living situation isn't stable yet (I'm a new grad).\n\nRegardless, I'm happy to setup a test system which is configured properly etc. And we can then figure out hosting later.",
