  "body": "dxDAO is launching in a few days and it's in a bootstrap period right now where you can stake ETH or other tokens to gain reputation when the system goes live. It's a pretty exciting DAO and I think we should study it and participate in it to learn from it. We currently have 29,000 DAI in our multisig. I propose that we stake it for 30 days to gain reputation points in the new DAO. Here are the concrete steps:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new Gnosis Safe account - I believe these can be shared among several people\r\n1. Transfer DAI from the multisig into it\r\n1. Use it to stake in dxDAO\r\n1. 30 days later, claim the tokens back\r\n\r\nThoughts?",

    "body": "> Where are the 29,000DAI from? The ProgPow audit?\r\n\r\nMost of it is, the rest is just the ordinary funds we collect via the Gitcoin subscription.\r\n\r\n> What is the goal of having the new Safe account? To create a proper ECH \"reputational\" account?\r\n\r\nYes, since reputation is tied to an account and cannot be transferred, we want it tied to an account that we can share, like the multisig. My understanding is that this is precisely what the Gnosis Safe is designed for.\r\n\r\n> Given the smart contract bug risk, does it make sense to only stake part of the funds?\r\n\r\nThis risk always exists. I think @Souptacular needs to weigh in on this.\r\n\r\n> Obviously, before taking such a decision, we should definitely air it on an ECH call. When is the deadline to stake on dxDAO?\r\n\r\nFor sure.

I think you may be misunderstanding dxDAO -- please take a look at its whitepaper here: https://github.com/gnosis/dx-daostack/blob/master/dxdao-whitepaper-v1.pdf. It's not a for-profit project and no \"interest\" is paid. Staking/locking funds does not pay any interest or tokens, it just gives you a share of (non-transferrable) \"reputation\" that lets you participate in the DAO. The Cat Herders has no interest in \"money-earning schemes.\"",
