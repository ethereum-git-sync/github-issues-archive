  "body": "The https://github.com/ethereum/pm repository has an \"Archive\" folder which I think we should use a bit more. Currently, the [Fee Market](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/tree/master/Fee-Market) and [ETH-1X](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/tree/master/ETH-1X) folders sit in the top repository. We should move these under \"Archive\" given that no more work is expected to happen on it. \r\n\r\nDoing this is very simple, but the more tedious part is taking time to verify that no links are broken in the repo when doing so. **Especially for the meeting notes.** The folder structure should look like this after the change (again, with all links verified to be working!): \r\n\r\n```\r\n/pm/All Core Devs Meetings \r\n/pm/Archive/EIPs Wiki\r\n/pm/Archive/Fee-Market\r\n/pm/Archive/ETH-1X\r\n/pm/Merge \r\n```\r\n\r\n",
