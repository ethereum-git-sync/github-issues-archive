  "body": "In Gitter:\r\n\r\n> @lrettig We are all drowning in too many channels and too much communication. I really cannot keep up with all of the dialog in this channel (or most other channels, for that matter)\r\n\r\nI personally think that everyone is in agreement on this and would love to work to help improve things. The community just needs some direction. Just having meetings isn't enough. There needs to be an overall process and flow. I'd argue to also reduce the number of channels.\r\n\r\nThis is an issue to better document the cat herders PM process (in no particular order):\r\n\r\n1. Define the flow necessary in order to better communicate effectively.\r\n1. Work to lower the information overload.\r\n1. Take ownership of the process.\r\n1. Own the flow of information.\r\n1. Provide guidance to new members.\r\n1. Lower barriers to entry.\r\n1. Reduce duplicated information.\r\n1. Define the members of the cats and their roles.\r\n1. Provide transparency.\r\n\r\nI'm sure there is more, but this is a few things that I see as necessary in a PM role. I'm also clearly not saying 'how' to do this, I will leave that up to the cat herders.",
