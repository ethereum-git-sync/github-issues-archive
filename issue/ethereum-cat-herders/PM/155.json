    "body": "Unvetica's responses to your queries @Souptacular \r\n\r\n**1. Does \"branding\" include a new logo/other assets?** \r\nThis is a great question. Yes, you can expect a logo. [I have attached a .PDF example](https://github.com/ethereum-cat-herders/PM/files/5837712/Unvetica.Design.Example.pdf) of what the ECH's can expect from us. This includes a main-logo design, in addition to a 'social media' version, fonts, colors, and alternative logo designs. You will have full ownership and rights to the works' produced by us. This includes minor revisions to the branding package we propose - but no major revisions (meaning entire new direction). \r\n\r\n\r\n**2. What is the server type we are getting for $25 a month?**\r\nUnvetica has a dedicated data center in Phoenix, AZ and two off-site locations in Washington State and Wisconsin for system redundancy and off-site backups. For the $25 a month ECH's would be given a dedicated server and staging area. Server uptime and maintenance is all done by us. \r\n\r\n\r\n**3. What is the format/process for posting new pages (Markdown, WYSIWYG, etc.)?**\r\nGreat question, we would actually implement a dual-system for this project. Meaning, we'd develop a fully custom WordPress-based administrative dashboard for the ECH's for non-technical users to use and maintain. This would mean that admins or other provisioned groups would have access to a WYSIWYG interface for creating pages, publishing blog posts, etc. Additionally, we'll configure this site so that it's tied into your GitHub organization. Meaning those more comfortable using CLI / GitHub can publish and manage aspects of content via PR.",

For front-end edits, that'll have to be completed via the WordPress Administrative GUI. The ECH team will be provided master administrative login credentials that will allow to add/edit/remove pages, posts, content, etc. I can also provide the ECH team SSH access to the server to directly edit core WordPress files if needed. I can provide either a single master login credentials or individual accounts, whatever is easiest.**\r\n\r\n> How easy difficult will it be for a core member of Cat Herder to do the small changes - like adding/removing a section?\r\n**This is a pretty easy task. The administrative backend is incredible intuitive and since WordPress is open source, it's incredibly well documented online as well. We (Unvetica) provide basic documentation as well on how to maintain the site. But the interface is literally a drag/drop style of managing components on pages/posts, with the ability to dive into the source code if needed.**\r\n\r\n> What would be the expected (avg.) cost per year for maintenance and hosting that would be in addition to the initial proposal of development of the page?\r\n**There is a $25 a month charge if you want us (unvetica) to host on our own servers and a $150 per month if you want us (unvetica) to maintain overall site support. This means things like WordPress updates/patching, security updates, plugin updates, backups, user management, etc.** \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I hope you have some visibility of the website page that Cat Herders are looking for. Do you think the month-to-month hosting charge ($25) can be avoided and we could use free hosting by GitHub as we have it now for our present website? \r\nRef: https://github.com/ethereum-cat-herders/ethereum-cat-herders.github.io",

The ECH's are more than welcome to find alternative solutions for hosting - however since I would be developing on top of a WordPress-based platform, whatever hosting provider you solicit will need to have some sort of database capabilities. I'm not sure if GitHub provides that type of functionality. \r\n\r\nI would recommend some sort of platform like [WPMU Dev](https://premium.wpmudev.org/) or GoDaddy, etc. ",

    "body": "Hi all, following on from the previous ECH call, there was an action to re-evaluate the proposed ECH website prototype/brief to see if there might be a need to change of tack given the decisions made re: ethereum.org website where ethereum.org is the primary source of truth, linking out to specialist resources where necessary... where does that leave the Cat Herders content? This is a decision for Cat Herders group to make, to ensure @michaelgiesen doesnt build things we wont ultimately need for the website.\r\n\r\nOn the ECH call, I think although we were all saying it differently, we were all in agreement that there is still space for the ECH website to cover the various areas ECH has interests in. These would be framed in the context of 'the ECH supports in this area, but before we just present you with a long list of links to various sources we'll tell you a bit about what this is, and what ECH does, so that you're not lost'. We would then link out appropriately to various resources that mostly exist off-site eg ethereum.org, github, youtube, medium, wherever.\r\n\r\nAnd in that way we can build a content proposition that is uniquely Cat Herders, but lets the canonical sources of the content do the heavy lifting off-site. @wschwab had some good thoughts on this specifically in the call notes. Do let me know if I've got that wrong :)\r\n\r\nTo this end I've quickly reviewed both the existing website and the prototype to see where there may be content gaps/issues... \r\n\r\nConclusion: I don't think there's anything significant that needs to be stripped out as a lot of the content on the ECH website already exists as an index of links... rather, the area to focus on would be on ensuring that for each key section (eg around EIPs, upgrades, dev meetings) we present the Cat Herders context up front, and then lead into the resource links straight after.\r\n\r\nSo as per @Souptacular 's suggestion, I've created the following [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kbU5FwPQLAT7TAuSKzVhuAwDcW_lBKpP0cyqVm7JbiQ/edit#) which lists out the content both on the current website and then the new website. The new website is based off of the existing prototype but also some slight refinements from me based on the conversations happening in the calls/discord. This obviously all up for feedback - I'm not assuming my suggestions are sacrosanct.\r\n\r\nIf we are ok with this as a structure, I believe this would then give @michaelgiesen sufficient steer to carry on with the work.\r\n\r\nThere would also be some decisions for Cat Herders to make around workflow (ie how specifically does content get approved/uploaded) and also the fine detail of content in each section, but those are in the future for now.",

    "body": "@michaelgiesen thanks for integrating the content with the ECH GitHub. \r\n\r\nOn review of the live website, it seems like there are issues with sync and some of the requested updates as listed [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kbU5FwPQLAT7TAuSKzVhuAwDcW_lBKpP0cyqVm7JbiQ/edit#) & [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DA69jNqli7a4g_hEih52xpA5SrhvR-CC81lXnG9lhxQ/edit#) are still outstanding.\r\n\r\nApart from this, we would need info on \r\n- User id & Pwd of the website to manage content (if needed). We'd also like to understand the process for future _Website Maintenance & Support_. eg.  what would be SLA for submission,  tracking & expected days of completion of requests.\r\n- Where and how to collect analytics. User id & Pwd to be shared with ECH members.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in one of the ECH calls, a meeting explaining how the website updating process would work will be appreciated. Please propose date(s) in the ECH Website channel to get this meeting organized sooner rather than later. Please feel free to reach me with any questions. Thanks!\r\n",
