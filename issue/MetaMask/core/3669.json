  "body": "We want to ensure that the packages we ship are as minimal as possible so that we don't unnecessarily bloat the apps that are using these packages.\r\n\r\nTo do this, we should track how large each package is when installed, and we should add a GitHub Action which automatically posts a comment on new PRs and reports the sizes of packages affected and a measure of how those sizes have changed (both using bytes and also percentages). We should store this information in artifacts which can later be read to produce an open source health dashboard of all of our libraries.\r\n\r\nThis means that before working on this ticket, we need to create an action that achieves the above goal. Ideally, we could find one that does this already without having to create one, though it's doubtful that it would write information to artifacts (but perhaps it could write that information to a JSON file instead).",
