It's not listed on that site yet, so I had to edit an existing method (easy), but then I get this error:\r\n\r\n>  \"The method 'eth_feeHistory' does not exist / is not available.\"\r\n\r\nI check through the code, and this seems to come [from rpc-cap](https://github.com/MetaMask/rpc-cap/blob/e4bca28d51a4a9f282b930a7797c3a5fddaeff5e/src/errors.ts#L26).\r\n\r\n I at first thought rpc-cap used to allow passthrough of \"non restricted methods\", but now I'm noticing [it checks against a safeMethods list](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/blob/af3c740b1b4e3cbaf78611b98c6af95f51bfcae2/app/scripts/controllers/permissions/index.js#L12).\r\n\r\nMaybe we should allow a \"passthrough mode\", so that unknown methods can be treated as safe. This can reduce the need to modify an enum every time our upstream provider adds a convenient method.\r\n\r\nAnyways, just opening this discussion before adding that method to that enums list :)",
