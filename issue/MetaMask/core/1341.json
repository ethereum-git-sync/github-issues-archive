  "body": "MMI supports message signing, which means there are a couple of deviations from the normal chain of events that occur in MetaMask.\r\n\r\n1. Messages can be signed several hours after they are approved depending on custody processes. To account for this, we propose a message status in addition to `approved`, `signed` called `inProgress` which unblocks the UI during this period. (#1339)\r\n2. Updates to messages in MMI come using custodian-internal identifiers, in addition to the metamaskId. We will add methods to set and retrieve this identifier. \r\n  a. A method to arbitrarily set metadata (#1364)\r\n  b. A method to return all messages (rather than querying by identifier, in the client we will pull all messages, and then do a client-side interrogation of their content to get messages by `custodyId`  (#1364)\r\n3. An event which is fired by the signature controller when a message ID is available, to allow certain MMI specific logic (adding message IDs to polling lists, and setting metadata (item 2a)  (#1364)\r\n4. A means to defer `setMessageStatusSigned` by the addition of a boolean property to `MessageParams`  (#1364)",
