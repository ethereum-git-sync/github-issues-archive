  "body": "A recent PR (#3624) fixed one state inconsistency but introduced another, because I hadn't considered that `updateExchangeRatesByChainId` could be called with token addresses that are _different_ from those tracked by the `TokensController`.\r\n\r\nIf there is an `updateExchangeRatesByChainId` call that omits some tokens tracked by the `TokensController`, it has the effect of erasing the exchange rates of the missing tokens from state.\r\n\r\nThe same problem applies if the `startPollingByNetworkClientId` method is used, as that method also accepts a custom list of token addresses and passes them on to `updateExchangeRatesByChainId`.\r\n",
