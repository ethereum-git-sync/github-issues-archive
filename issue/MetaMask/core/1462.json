  "body": "The provider configuration state is a duplication of the configuration of the current selected network (either built-in or custom). Rather than duplicate this information in state, we can track the current selected network with an ID instead.\r\n\r\nThis would make the state smaller, and would simplify the validation of this state.\r\n\r\nThe provider configuration state is used throughout the client repositories, but it can be easily recreated from an ID using a selector. We should consider adding a \"getSelectedNetworkConfig\" method to the controller to make referencing this state easier from the extension background as well (where we can't use selectors as easily).",
