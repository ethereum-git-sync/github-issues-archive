While changing this setting globally is a different issue, we should consider enabling it just for `controllers`. We should be using `any` as little as possible, because using it indicates that something is not typed properly, whether it is a dependency or our own code.\r\n\r\nEnabling this rule produces 335 violations across ~15 files.\r\n\r\nThis issue is partially blocked by #728.
