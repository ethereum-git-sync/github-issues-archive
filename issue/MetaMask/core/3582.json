  "body": "We have a couple of opportunities for optimizing the performance of vault encryption, specifically within the `EthKeyringController` and the `KeyringController` setup:\n\n#### 1. Improve Key Caching in EthKeyringController:\nThe `EthKeyringController` is currently set up to derive a new encryption key from the user's password for every keychain operation. This approach is inefficient as it unnecessarily repeats the key derivation process.\n\nWe should amend the `EthKeyringController` to prioritize the use of a cached encryption key rather than re-deriving it from the password. This would only apply in instances where the password is still in memory, and it would significantly reduce the processing time by avoiding redundant derivations.\n\n#### 2. Initialize `KeyringController` with Caching Enabled (in the extension):\nAs a separate but related improvement, when initializing `KeyringController` in the extension, we should enable the `cacheEncryptionKey` option by default (instead of MV3-only). This adjustment would ensure that the `KeyringController` itself utilizes the performance benefits of key caching.\n\n#### 3. Replace `updateVault` with `isVaultUpdated`:\nThe `EthKeyringController` currently uses the `updateVault` function from `browser-passworder` for a simple comparison with the existing vault, which leads to needless re-encryption.\n\nWe should export `isVaultUpdated` from `browser-passworder`, and use it in the `EthKeyringController`. This function would allow us to check if the vault is updated by analyzing its metadata, which is far more efficient than performing a full encryption operation.",
