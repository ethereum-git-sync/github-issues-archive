For instance, if the result is an integer, it converts it from hex format to a `BN` object.

    "body": "I agree that this issue and #852 are mutually exclusive. I made them both because I wasn't sure what our long-term strategy was at the time.\r\n\r\nNow that some time has passed, it seems like _this_ issue is definitely relevant: considering that you've recently forked all of the `ethjs-*` packages, it would seem that we at least want to keep using those packages, which would imply that we don't want to use the `eth-*` packages.\r\n\r\nAs for the issue you mentioned, however: _is_ it irrelevant? Perhaps not everyone would agree with the conclusion I gave — there are arguments to be made for _not_ using Ethers for everything — but I think everyone has admitted, or at least hinted, that we ought to use newer libraries, and it sounds like [you agree](https://consensys.slack.com/archives/G1L7H42BT/p1669931945294259?thread_ts=1669930826.083989&cid=G1L7H42BT). But perhaps that view has changed?",
