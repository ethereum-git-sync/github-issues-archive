  "body": "The TypeScript versions in `core` and `metamask-module-template` are approaching 4.9, which is when the `satisfies` operator keyword was introduced. \r\n\r\nThe `satisfies` operator is a more type-safe alternative to type annotation `val: T` and type assertion `val as T`. We should investigate opportunities to improve type safety by applying this feature.",
