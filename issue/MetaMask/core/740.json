  "body": "Metamask Mobile throws an exception on `wallet_switchEthereumChain` for Optimism and suggests adding the chain.  However NetworksChainId in NetworkControllers.ts inconsistently includes Optimism, which causes MetaMask Mobile to fail on`wallet_addEthereumChain`.  So it appears that there is currently no way to use Optimism from MetaMask mobile.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/blob/365191875a22ab5c94d81b464734e8adff7dbad3/src/network/NetworkController.ts#L23-L33\r\n\r\nEDIT: Note that MetaMask extension does not reference NetworkControllers in this way and does not suffer from this problem. (It is possible to add and switch to Optimism on desktop).",

    "body": "I looked in our company Slack and it looks like this is a known issue (as of a month ago). I was looking at NetworkController recently and noticed that `optimism` and `optimismTest` aren't valid subdomains on Infura. According to https://docs.infura.io/infura/networks/optimism/getting-started/send-request, it should be `optimism-mainnet` and `optimism-kovan`. It's possible this is why it's failing.",
