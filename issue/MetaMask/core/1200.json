  "body": "We should add support for the \"InfuraBlocked\" network status, and emit events when this status is set and unset. The extension already has this functionality.\r\n\r\nNote that this will not block Infura for users. This is helping us track when _Infura_ blocks a user, so that we can provide a nicer UX in that case.\r\n\r\nThis is part of [a larger effort to normalize the API of both network controllers](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/issues/971), to make them easier to merge.\r\n\r\n### **Definition of Done**\r\n- [ ] Whenever applies, any change unit tested, reviewed(approved) and documented(JSDOC at least)\r\n- [ ]  We have changelog entries for any related changes\r\n- [ ]  Any changed APIs have comprehensive inline documentation\r\n- [ ]  Any changed public APIs are well covered by unit tests\r\n\r\n**Other items**\r\n- [ ]  If a planning/research ticket, then the plan has been reviewed and approved by at least 1 team members",
