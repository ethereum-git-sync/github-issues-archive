  "body": "Today each network configuration represents a built-in RPC endpoint or a custom RPC endpoint. They are not grouped by chain, the same chain can appear multiple times.\r\n\r\nWe should instead group this configuration by chain, such that each chain has a single network configuration, with an array of one or more RPC endpoints. This would allow consolidating configuration/state that is related to the chain, not the RPC URL. This also unblocks some privacy enhancements for the clients.\r\n\r\nThe exact API changes we need to make here have not been determined yet.",
