  "body": "When calling `startPollingByNetworkClientId` in a controller that inherits from PollingController, it is possible to not pass any `options` or the wrong `options`, even if types are supplied for those `options` in that controller's `_executePoll`. Since `startPollingByNetworkClientId` is contained with PollingController, and PollingController has no awareness of what a subclass needs, all it can say is that the `options` are optional, and if they are supplied, they must be `Json`. The result of this is that if options are missing from `startPollingByNetworkClientId`, it can cause errors at runtime, which is not only undesirable because it goes against the purpose of using TypeScript, but also because it it is confusing to consumers.",
