  "body": "The `lookupNetwork` method of the network controller should include console warnings for all branches where we fail to connect to a network. This would be very useful when investigating bug reports.\r\n\r\nFailing to connect to a network is in a class of errors that is expected, but still noteworthy and potentially related to a bug. Console warnings are a good solution for these situations; they provide hints in the console for anyone investigating, and they show up in Sentry if a real error is thrown in the vicinity of the warning.\r\n\r\nRather than using `console.log` directly, we should consider updating the controller to accept a `loglevel` instance, so that we can use that to print console warnings while leaving the client in full control of whether these logs are enabled or not.",
