  "body": "The `test` function for the PhishingController was recently made async so that we can lazily update the configuration, rather than polling for updates on a set interval. This simplifies testing and MV3 compatibility. However it may cause a delay in how quickly MetaMask can respond to a blocked site by navigating away.\r\n\r\nWe should explore ways of speeding up this check, either at the product layer or here or both. For example, here we can check the configuration eagerly before getting the update, so that we only have a slow response time for newly blocked sites (at the expense of potentially blocking a recently-allowed site a single time).",
