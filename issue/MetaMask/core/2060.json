  "body": "As discussed with Mark/Elliot/Alex, we want to reduce our API surface by correctly marking methods that should be private as such. The TokenRatesController currently has methods that aren't marked as private because they are being tested/mocked in spec. This may require that these methods get refactored into a separate module that isn't exported. \n\nReview the current usage of TokenRatesController and update the methods that should be private.\n\nSee: https://github.com/MetaMask/core/pull/2015",
