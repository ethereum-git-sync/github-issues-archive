  "body": "We should delete the `isCustomNetwork` state, and replace the network controller `network` state with `networkStatus` state. \n\nThe new state would be set to an enum representing the current status of the network network that is currently active (either \"loading\" or \"active\", unless someone thinks of a better alternative than \"active\"). This could be called `networkStatus`. This preserves the \"loading\" state.\n\nThe provider config state can be used in place of the `isCustomNetwork` property.\n\nThis is part of [a larger effort to normalize the API of both network controllers](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/issues/971), to make them easier to merge.\n\nSee here for related work on the extension: https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/issues/16946",
