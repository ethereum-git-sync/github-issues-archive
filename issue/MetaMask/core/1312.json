  "body": "The network controller has a built-in \"localhost\" network that is unused today. It was originally copied from the extension, where there used to be a built-in localhost network for e2e testing.\r\n\r\nThe extension has since migrated to using custom RPC configuration for the localhost e2e tests instead, and mobile is doing the same. As such, there is no reason for us to have this as a built-in network anymore.\r\n\r\nThis is part of [a larger effort to normalize the API of both network controllers](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/issues/971), to make them easier to merge.",
