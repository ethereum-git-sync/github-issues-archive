  "body": "These controllers are similar but have separate implementations. We will need to dive into how they are used in the extension vs. mobile app to understand what a combined version should look like.\r\n\r\nWhile we are doing this, it may be worth it to complete the following items before completing the merge:\r\n\r\n- Extract any API interactions or complex utility functions\r\n- Refactor the `detectTokens` / `detectNewTokens` method (as it is quite complex): https://github.com/MetaMask/core/issues/1614\r\n- Write comprehensive unit tests: https://github.com/MetaMask/core/issues/1615\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there are patches in mobile around TokenDetectionController under `@metamask/assets-controllers`, and we will want to make sure those are integrated as well.",
