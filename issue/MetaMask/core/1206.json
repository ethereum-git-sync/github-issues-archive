  "body": "NetworkController's `lookupNetwork` method guards against multiple simultaneous calls by [using a mutex](https://github.com/MetaMask/core/blob/c8c9f389589522bc6a5147aad8679cddbd8f3381/packages/network-controller/src/NetworkController.ts#L430). According to Mark, this is detrimental and causes artificial slowdowns when switching networks rapidly on mobile. Instead of using a mutex, we can follow the extension here, which [prevents the state from being overwritten if the network has \r\n been switched after the HTTP requests complete](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/blob/39f6042e6541e1badb9ee08098e55ce1f3c2dbef/app/scripts/controllers/network/network-controller.ts#L654).\r\n\r\nNote that there are a fair amount of tests that we would want to copy over from the extension along with this change.",
