  "body": "Context\r\nToday MetaMask only allows the use of a single network at a time. This is very inconvenient for users that are interacting with multiple networks at the same time, as they are forced to frequently manually switch between them. Both client teams are interested in dropping the network switcher altogether, instead supporting simultaneous access to multiple networks.\r\nDevelopers that use our dapp API have a similar problem; they want to use multiple networks simultaneously from the same dapp. There are standardization efforts underway to support this, which we are involved with. Our dapp API and client teams are interested in pursuing this feature at the dapp API level.\r\nBoth of these initiatives are blocked by our network controller supporting multiple simultaneous network connections. That is the problem we aim to solve. We will add simultaneous multi-network support to the network controller, unblocking the multi-network support initiatives of the dapp API and client teams. \r\nThis objective is a continuation from Q1. We anticipate this to be completed early in the quarter, with the majority of work completed in Q1.\r\n\r\n### KR-1:   Complete the network controller migration\r\nThe network controller migration is a key milestone for multi-network support, which is a major priority across many MetaMask teams. This is also a blocker for the transaction controller migration. This work is nearly complete.\r\n",
