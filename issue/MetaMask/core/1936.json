  "body": "There are 514 violations when I remove the override that turns this rule off and run `yarn eslint . --cache --ext js,ts --quiet`.\r\n\r\nThere are four types of violations:\r\n\r\n- Enum members that should be `PascalCase`\r\n- Type parameters that should be more than one character\r\n- Property names that should be `camelCase`, `PascalCase` or `UPPER_CASE`\r\n- Variable names that should be `camelCase`, `PascalCase` or `UPPER_CASE`\r\n\r\nOther than variable names, these would cause backward-incompatible changes, so we may want to handle them by adding overrides at the violation site with a comment such as:\r\n\r\n``` typescript\r\n// This rule was added after this code was in place;\r\n// we are keeping this name for backward compatibility\r\n// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/naming-convention\r\n```",
