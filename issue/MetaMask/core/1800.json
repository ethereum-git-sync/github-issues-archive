  "body": "## Motivation\r\n\r\nWe need a standardized, automated way of porting tags for libraries migrated into `merged-packages/` that satisfies the following:\r\n\r\n1. Distinguishes between releases of the monorepo root vs. non-root subpackages by prepending a package name prefix to all tag names of libraries that are migrated into the monorepo. \r\n  - monorepo root release tags: `v<maj>.<min>.<patch>`\r\n  - non-root subpackage release tags: `@metamask/<package-name>@<maj>.<min>.<patch>`\r\n\r\n2. Ensures that tag diff links in the target package's CHANGELOG correctly point to valid tags in core after migration.\r\n  - e.g. `https://github.com/MetaMask/core/compare/@metamask/<package-name>@<maj>.<min>.<patch>...@metamask/<package-name>@<maj>.<min>.<patch>`\r\n\r\n## Considerations\r\n\r\n- If the target library was renamed at any point, the tag name prefixes should display the correct original package name that corresponds to the tag version.\r\n- The release commit hashes in the rewritten git history in core will not match the hashes for the tagged commits in the original repo.\r\n\r\n## Process\r\n\r\n1. Find the new hashes for the release commits from the migrated commit history of the target package directory in `merged-packages/`.\r\n2. Identify tags where the package was renamed.\r\n3. Map each version number and package name onto the corresponding release commit hash.\r\n4. Add the tags by running `git tag <tag-name> [commit-hash]` for each tag-commit pair with the correct package name prepended onto the tag name.\r\n\r\n## Blocked by\r\n- [x] https://github.com/MetaMask/core/issues/1795\r\n  - [x] https://github.com/MetaMask/auto-changelog/pull/157\r\n\r\n## References\r\n- See https://github.com/MetaMask/core/issues/1551#issuecomment-1745665740 for an outline of the migration process.\r\n- See https://github.com/MetaMask/core/issues/1079#issuecomment-1700126302 for instructions on migrating the git history of the original repo.
