An extra priority fee might help on high congested blocks, but zero-priority transactions can perfectly fill half-empty blocks. In other words, the _miner_ (or block proposer) still has other incentives to include them.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nIdeally, `calculateEstimatesForPriorityLevel` function should just proxy the values returned by the oracle without making further assumptions on the payload other than type compliance; and Metamask UI should not force users to provide a non-zero tip (at least not in custom RPC endpoints).",
