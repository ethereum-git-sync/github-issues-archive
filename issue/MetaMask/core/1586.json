  "body": "We should allow linking libraries during local development to allow for quick feedback loops when testing library changes in mobile or extension.\r\n\r\nToday this doesn't work because we use the `workspace:` protocol for inter-package dependencies, which isn't resolved until the package is published. Contributors are forced to use preview builds just to get builds to test with locally, or they have to build locally and awkwardly copy over the build files. Preview builds are great for testing changes in the client repositories in CI, but we shouldn't need to use them for local development.",
