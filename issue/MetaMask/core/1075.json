  "body": "It seems that the GitHub registry we have setup for the preview builds isn't mirroring packages from npm.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence, you may see installation failures non-preview `@metamask` packages when using an `.npmrc` file setup to point at the GitHub registry. I've found that I can get past the error by ensuring the non-preview packages are installed locally before putting the `.npmrc` file in-place. This is a viable workaround but it requires frequently adding and removing this file, which is rather inconvenient.",

After pointing Yarn to using `http://localhost:4873` instead of the Yarn registry, I kept getting an `ECONNREFUSED` error. I'll have to try something else, perhaps using the GitHub registry instead.",
