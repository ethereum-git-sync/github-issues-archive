  "body": "When adding a new package, a contributor can update the dependency graph in the README automatically by running `yarn generate-dependency-graph`. However, they must remember to update the flat list of packages above the graph, as this is not automatically updated. Ideally, they should not have to do this.\r\n\r\nWe have two ways to solve this:\r\n\r\n- rename the existing `generate-dependency-graph` to something else and update it to also update the flat list of packages\r\n- make a new script to update the flat list of packages, rename the package script that currently calls `./scripts/generate-dependency-graph.ts` to something else, and have it call both this script as well as `./scripts/generate-dependency-graph.ts`",
