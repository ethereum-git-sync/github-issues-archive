  "body": "### 1 | Objective: Reduce maintenance burden for core wallet functionality\n**Context**\nThere is a significant amount of functionality central to the wallet experience that is either duplicated across both the extension and mobile applications or is scattered across various repositories. This creates two problems. At the highest level, it reinforces separation between product teams and inhibits them from designing a cohesive experience across the two platforms. More specifically, it creates a maintenance burden for all parties involved, particularly the Shared Libraries team. By assembling pieces of core functionality into one repository, we will be able to develop tooling and automation that assists us in managing these pieces. This will eventually unlock innovation for all of MetaMask by enabling product teams to ship new features faster.\nThis effort has been underway for months, and will continue beyond Q3 2023.\n\n**_KR-2:   Migrate 15% of MetaMask libraries to core monorepo_**\nAccording to the tracking issue here, we have 24 libraries eligible for migration. We will choose a few that are relatively small in size and very closely match the standards that weâ€™ve established in the module template.",
