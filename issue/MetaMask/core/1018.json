  "body": "We should replace the network controller `provider` property with the `getProviderAndBlockTracker` method, similar to what the extension uses. This method would return a proxied provider and block tracker. These would both refer to the current selected network at all times, with controllers using network events to know when a network switch has happened.\r\n\r\nThis is part of [a larger effort to normalize the API of both network controllers](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/issues/971), to make them easier to merge.",
