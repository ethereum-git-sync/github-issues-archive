  "body": "Our newer controllers use a \"restricted controller messenger\" that has limited access to the global messenger, letting us track how controllers are related to each other and restrict access.\r\n\r\nThis restricted controller messenger was intended only to restrict access to _external_ events and actions, but unfortunately today it also restricts access to actions/evens from the same controller. This is inconvenient and serves no purpose. We should allow using actions and events from the same controller without requiring these actions/evens to be listed as \"allowed\" by the restricted controller.",
