  "body": "We should rename the `properties` state to `networkDetails`, to more closely align with the extension network controller. Of the two, `networkDetails` was chosen because it's more descriptive of the state contents. This state is a collection of properties about the network that we have discovered at runtime (i.e. they are not configured or statically set).\r\n\r\nThis is part of [a larger effort to normalize the API of both network controllers](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/issues/971), to make them easier to merge.",
