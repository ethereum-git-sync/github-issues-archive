This puts them at great risk of phishing sites.\r\n>\r\n> The Universal Token Router function arguments can act as a manifest for users when signing a transaction. With the support from wallets, users can see and review their expected token behavior instead of blindly trusting the application contracts and front-end code. Phishing sites will be much easier to detect and avoid for users.\r\n\r\nhttps://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6120",
