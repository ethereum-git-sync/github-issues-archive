  "body": "Our \"identity\" related state is spread out amongst many different places:\r\n* The KeyringController (`eth-keyring-controller`) holds references to the keyrings, and is responsible for the global lock/unlock and certain keyring interactions\r\n* The KeyringController wrapper class (i.e. [`KeyringController.ts`](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/blob/develop/src/keyring/KeyringController.ts), which is a wrapper around `eth-keyring-controller`) exposes methods for interacting with the underlying KeyringController, and for performing actions that affect identity-related state throughout many controllers\r\n  * Side-note: In the extension, the closest equivalent to this wrapper class is a collection of kerying-related methods that are directly in `metamask-controller.js`\r\n* The individual keyrings hold keyring-specific state, and expose certain keyring interactions to both the KeyringController and external callers\r\n* The PreferencesController holds a mapping of accounts to account names, which it calls an \"identity\"\r\n* The PrefrencesController holds the \"current selected address\"\r\n* The AccountTrackerController holds a mapping of \"identities\" to balances\r\n\r\nAt each of these layers, methods are exposed to directly interact with this data from anywhere else in our codebase, providing few protections against making changes that result in contradictions between these pieces of state.\r\n\r\nSo my questions are:\r\n* How should we divide these responsibilities? Does the current distribution of responsibilities make sense?\r\n* How can we ensure all of this state remains internally consistent?",
