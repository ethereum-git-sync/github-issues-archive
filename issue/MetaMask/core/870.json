  "body": "Currently we are validating passwords by calling `await KeyringController.submitPassword(credentials.password)` which is a heavy operation and is dramatically slowing down the UI. I see that base KeyringController has a [verifyPassword method](https://github.com/MetaMask/KeyringController/blob/520dad38bad52429bf997373d98e90d138d8ba7f/index.js#L189) that is not exposed by this wrapper. We could expose this method so we can check passwords without running a full update. ",
