  "body": "AddressBookController manages the set of addresses that users see in MetaMask, namely, a mapping of recipient addresses to their nicknames. As this mapping is kept per chain id, when you change the chain id of a network in your network, we have to update the AddressBookController state. This happens currently in PreferencesController, but as we are moving network management code out of PreferencesController and since it's not the responsibility of the PreferencesController to maintain address book state, this code really ought to live in AddressBookController.\r\n\r\nTo prepare for this, we need to:\r\n\r\n- Add `onNetworkStateChange` to AddressBookController\r\n- Add a new option (`syncWhenNetworkChanges`) which would be false by default (extension would set it to true, mobile wouldn't)\r\n- Copy code in extension's PreferencesController around updating address book (indirectly) to AddressBookController",
