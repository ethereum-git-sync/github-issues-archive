  "body": "`@metamask/controllers` uses the following packages which lack TypeScript types. Currently we are just stubbing the modules in `dependencies.d.ts`, but this ends up adding `any` to any objects that the modules export, and `any` trickles down to code which uses these modules. While we can work around this, it is very inconvenient and it would be easier to write types directly for these modules so that we can have proper types throughout the `controllers` codebase.\r\n\r\nNote that we can go further on this and replace the Ethereum utility packages with other packages that are already TypeScript-compatible (e.g. Ethers). However, that requires that we [improve the unit tests](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/issues/413) first. Backfilling the types is intended as a band-aid.\r\n\r\nThe list of modules listed in `dependencies.d.ts` are:\r\n\r\n- [x] @metamask/contract-metadata\r\n- [x] @metamask/metamask-eth-abis (this already has types, so we can remove this!)\r\n- [x] eth-ens-namehash\r\n- [x] eth-json-rpc-infura\r\n- [x] ~eth-keyring-controller~ (decided to skip this)\r\n- [x] eth-phishing-detect\r\n- [x] eth-query\r\n- [x] ethjs-provider-http\r\n- [x] ethjs-unit\r\n- [x] ~isomorphic-fetch~ (decided to skip this)\r\n- [x] ~single-call-balance-checker-abi~ (decided to skip this)\r\n- [x] ~web3-provider-engine~ (decided to skip this)",
