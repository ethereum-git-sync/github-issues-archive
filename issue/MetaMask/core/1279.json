  "body": "Today we have two types of networks in the network controller: built-in Infura networks, and networks that we keep track of with the `networkConfiguration` state (\"RPC\" type networks). This leads to much unnecessary complexity.\r\n\r\nWe should use network configuration for _all networks_, including Infura networks. This would greatly simplify the network controller API, and it would allow easier customization of which networks are built-in.\r\n\r\nTo make this change, we'd need to make a number of improvements to our network configuration so that we maintain the same level of support for our built-in Infura networks. Here are the missing features that I am aware of:\r\n\r\n- Custom retry error handling\r\n  The Infura networks use custom middleware that looks for Infura-specific errors, enabling more effective retry logic for Infura.\r\n- Country blocked error handling\r\n  The Infura networks have custom support for an error that indicates geoblocking. This isn't supported for other networks.\r\n- Secrets in RPC URLs\r\n  The Infura RPC URL we use has a secret embedded in the URL path. Our network configuration offers no way to obscure secrets in URL paths.\r\n- Custom headers\r\n  We set custom fetch headers on requests to the built-in Infura networks.\r\n ",
