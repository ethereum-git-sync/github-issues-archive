  "body": "The phishing controller state names are confusing at the moment, and they continue to use outdated terminology.\r\n\r\nThe phishing configuration lists still have some references to `whitelist` and `blacklist`, which are no longer used on the new configuration. We should update the default fallback configuration (or remove the fallback completely) so that these names are no longer referenced.\r\n\r\nThe local-only allowlist state is called `whitelist` as well, which makes it easily confused for the phishing configuration `allowlist` entries. We should rename it to something like `localAllowlist`, `safelist`, `safeExceptions`, etc. to make it more clear how it's different frrm the configuration.",
