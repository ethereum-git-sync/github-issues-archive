We will need to dive into how they are used in the extension vs. mobile app to understand what a combined version should look like.\r\n\r\nWhile we are doing this, we may need to:\r\n\r\n- Extract any API interactions or complex utility functions\r\n- Refactor to be more easily understood\r\n- Write comprehensive unit tests\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there are patches in mobile around AccountTrackerController under `@metamask/assets-controllers`, and we will want to make sure those are integrated as well.",
