  "body": "### 1 | Objective: Reduce maintenance burden for core wallet functionality\n**Context**\nThere is a significant amount of functionality central to the wallet experience that is either duplicated across both the extension and mobile applications or is scattered across various repositories. This creates two problems. At the highest level, it reinforces separation between product teams and inhibits them from designing a cohesive experience across the two platforms. More specifically, it creates a maintenance burden for all parties involved, particularly the Shared Libraries team. By assembling pieces of core functionality into one repository, we will be able to develop tooling and automation that assists us in managing these pieces. This will eventually unlock innovation for all of MetaMask by enabling product teams to ship new features faster.\nThis effort has been underway for months, and will continue beyond Q3 2023.\n\n**_KR-1:   Complete the keyring controller migration_**\nThe keyring controller manages keyrings, which are among the most security-critical parts of the application. The keyring management code has been very difficult to maintain and extend, and has been linked with many regressions. These maintenance challenges have also been an obstacle to further hardware wallet integrations. Consolidating these implementations would significantly improve the stability of our products, and would provide us with an opportunity to improve the API to better enable hardware wallet and snap integrations.\nWe began work on this in Q2 2023 and will be starting Q3 with this objective 65% complete.\n",
