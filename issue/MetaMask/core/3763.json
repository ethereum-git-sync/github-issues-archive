  "body": "Update the `QueuedRequestController` to batch requests by origin. When processing the next request in the queue, we should process all consecutive requests with the same origin together (as a batch). This will improve UX by allowing our pre-existing UI for request batches to work as it does today with the queued request feature disabled (for any requests in a batch, at least).\r\n\r\nWe're batching by origin for two reasons. Firstly, batching by origin ensures that confirmations from different origins are never displayed together. Showing confirmations from different sources together in the same batch might confuse users, which in turn might be abused by malicious actors. Second, we're doing this so that we can insert a network switch operation between batches, allowing us to support per-dapp selected networks.\r\n\r\nWe're preserving the order of RPC requests, to ensure that we don't introduce complications for use cases where order matters (e.g. with interactions between multiple dapps).\r\n\r\n",
