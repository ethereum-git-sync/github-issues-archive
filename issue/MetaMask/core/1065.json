    "body": "## eth_chainId\r\n\r\n#### Currently\r\n - On mobile, calls to eth_chainId are handled in RPCMethodMiddleware,  using the value from providerConfig\r\n - On extension, the network is not hit. When the provider type is infura, chainId is used from a constant. For custom providers, it uses the value from the providerConfig. For localhost, it would either be statically set to return 0x1337, or if you use _setProvider directly, it would be what ever chainId you passed in. \r\n \r\n #### After web3-provider-engine removal\r\n - If the provider type is infura, chainId is used from a constant. If provider type is localhost or rpc, chainId will be the value in the provider config. If you use setProviderType with providerType localhost (which doesn't allow setting chainId), chainId will be `0x0`.\r\n - If the chainId in providerConfig is alphanumeric, but not valid hex, it will now throw.\r\n - in mobile, this method is overridden anyways.\r\n\r\n## net_version\r\n\r\n#### Currently\r\n - On mobile, calls to net_version use a static result if they are included in the list of 'allNetworks' (mainnet, ropsten, kovan, rinkeby, goerli). Otherwise, they will hit the network to resolve this.\r\n - On extension. when the providerType is infura, net_version uses a static result. When its a custom rpc, the network is hit to fetch the value.\r\n \r\n #### After web3-provider-engine removal\r\n - when the providerType is infura, net_version uses a static result. When its a custom rpc, the network is hit to fetch the value.\r\n - in mobile, this method is overridden anyways, but the same check will happen twice.\r\n\r\n## BlockRef\r\n\r\n#### Currently\r\n - on mobile, block tags ('latest', 'pending', etc) are left as is\r\n - on extension, they are re-written based on the value held by the blockTracker\r\n\r\n#### After web3-provider-engine removal\r\n - blockrefs are re-written with the values from blockTracker.\r\n \r\n \r\n## Sanitization Middleware\r\n\r\n#### Currently\r\n  - on mobile, requests who have transaction-like or filter-like params have `0x` prefixes added if they are missing. We assume that the value is already hex, though. In practice, only eth_call seems to hit this middleware, since all the other methods are handled by earlier middleware\r\n   - on extension, no such behaviour exists.\r\n   \r\n#### After web3-provider-engine removal\r\n - network controller no longer handles this behaviour. If we want to preserve this functionality, we can merge https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-mobile/pull/6079\r\n \r\n ## NonceTracker\r\n\r\n#### Currently\r\n - on mobile, requests that impact the nonce for an address are updated and maintained inside of the noncetracker middleware. \r\n - on extension, we use a package called [nonce-tracker](https://github.com/MetaMask/nonce-tracker) in the transaction controller.\r\n \r\n #### After web3-provider-engine removal\r\n  - calls to getTransactionCount made to the provider are not handled by nonce-tracker.",

    "body": "@mcmire yes, thank you for pointing that out. #1147 will resolve the difference as it pertains to the transaction controller. More broadly speaking, other calls to eth_getTransactionCount that might exist (or received through dapp api) still wont be cached, though. I will update with the above considerations.\r\n\r\nedit: let me double check this...\r\n\r\ngetTransactionCount gets cached by [block cache middleware](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-json-rpc-middleware/blob/main/src/block-cache.ts#L67) from [with a strategy of 'Block'](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-json-rpc-middleware/blob/main/src/block-cache.ts#L67) - so it is cached, but not for long. web3-provider-engine actually uses the same block cache, so the behaviour doesnt change.\r\n\r\nedit again: I think cache is the wrong word to use. I should say, handled by the nonce-tracker middleware inside web3-provider-engine/zero.",
