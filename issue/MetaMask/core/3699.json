  "body": "The `KeyringController` currently depends upon four methods from the `PreferencesController` being passed in as constructor arguments. These methods are called to synchronize state, and to update preferences in response to certain keyring actions.\r\n\r\nEssentially those operations don't belong in the `KeyringController`. It's not responsible for the `PreferencesController` state, the `PreferencesController` is. Conventionally a controller manages its own state, and that's it. The conventional approach here would be to update the `PreferencesController` to listen for relevant keyring related events, and react to them as appropriate internally. This keeps responsibilities clearly delineated between each controller. Event-based syncing is also safer than active syncing, in that we don't have to be concerned about forgetting to sync when we need to.",
