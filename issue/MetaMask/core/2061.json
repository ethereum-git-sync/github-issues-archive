  "body": "## Motivation\r\n\r\nThe `BaseController`, `ControllerMessenger`, and `RestrictedControllerMessenger` classes outline the controller-messenger pattern that are implemented by all of our controllers. \r\n\r\nHowever, these classes are currently limited by unsafe typing and weak enforcement of best practices. A rigorous overhaul of the types and methods defined in `base-controller` will unlock type-safe feature development for all of our clients and services. \r\n\r\n## Tasks\r\n\r\n- Fix all `any` usage.\r\n  - `ActionConstraint`, `ExtractActionParameters`, `ExtractActionResponse`\r\n  - `SelectorFunction`, `EventSubscriptionMap`\r\n- Improve handling of namespaced type names. \r\n- `getState` action and `stateChange` event are defined in the base controller.\r\n- Enforce sound practices around action/event allow lists. \r\n  - All internal actions/events are available for usage without being specified in an allow list. \r\n  - Internal actions/events are not accepted into allow lists when a restricted controller-messenger is being initialized.",
