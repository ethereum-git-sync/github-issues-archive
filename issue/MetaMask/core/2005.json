  "body": "The network client is a bit too low-level to be used directly. When working with a network client, especially resolving a network client ID, you have to be aware that there are two types: an Infura network client and a custom network client. This bifurcation is necessary to have at some level because of the fact that we have two different middleware stacks (one designed for Infura RPC endpoints, one designed for everything else) and thus two kinds of network client configuration objects. However, if you just want to make a request to the network, you shouldn't have to care what kind of network it is, as we can expect that all networks feature the same JSON-RPC API. Also, if you want any information about the network, such as the native currency symbol or the nickname, you currently have to shoehorn extra properties into the network client configuration. This shouldn't be necessary, as the middleware doesn't care about them.\r\n\r\nConsumers — in particular the DevEx team, who are running into problems with the current design while implementing multichain initiatives — would have a better time if instead of using a network client, they used an abstraction on top of it. We could call it \"network\", and it would essentially be the same as a network client now, except that the network client interface would be abstract, and network configuration would be allowed to hold user-provided properties.\r\n\r\nThe devil is in the details, of course, so this ticket is dedicated to understanding whether this plan is really feasible or not, and if so, how much work it would create.\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\nThis is a list of changes we've had to make which solve immediate problems but are ultimately undesirable and which we aim to fix with this proposal. Please add to this list as you find more examples!\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/MetaMask/core/pull/2000/files#diff-02c32f437b122b5c71f0ac6bdf304cd22f6d4569c9c9b8ecbb711c11c98cd0d3R111\r\n- https://github.com/MetaMask/core/pull/1794",
