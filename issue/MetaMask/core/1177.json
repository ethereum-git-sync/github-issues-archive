We should ensure that all internal methods and properties are private, using the hash syntax rather than the `private` keyword.\r\n\r\nThis is part of [a larger effort to normalize the API of both network controllers](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/issues/971), to make them easier to merge.\r\n\r\nThe related extension issue is here: https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/issues/18588\r\n\r\n### **Definition of Done**\r\n- [ ] Whenever applies, any change unit tested, reviewed(approved) and documented(JSDOC at least)\r\n- [ ]  We have changelog entries for any related changes\r\n- [ ]  Any changed APIs have comprehensive inline documentation\r\n- [ ]  Any changed public APIs are well covered by unit tests\r\n\r\n**Other items**\r\n- [ ]  If a planning/research ticket, then the plan has been reviewed and approved by at least 1 team members\r\n",
