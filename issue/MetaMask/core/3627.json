  "body": "## Explanation\r\n\r\nEach `ComposableController` instance requires its own controller-messenger and allow list typing that is specific to the set of child controllers that are being composed.\r\n\r\nThis is new behavior that can't extend from the `BaseController`, as controller-messenger allow lists are generally defined for the controller class singleton, not controller instances.\r\n\r\nTo implement this, `ComposableController` and `ComposableControllerMessenger` need to be made polymorphic upon the `controllers` constructor property (list of child controllers to be composed). A starting point would be adding a generic parameter `ControllerList` to the `ComposableController` class:\r\n\r\n- `ControllerList` should be constrained, but not defined by the `ControllerInstance` type.\r\n- `ControllerList` should be used to define the return type of `flatState()` at the type level.\r\n- `ControllerList` should be used to derive the allow lists of `ComposableControllerMessenger`. \r\n  - The allow lists should at minimum include the `stateChange` events for child controllers that are used in the `#updateChildController()` method. \r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\n- See https://github.com/MetaMask/core/issues/2082",
