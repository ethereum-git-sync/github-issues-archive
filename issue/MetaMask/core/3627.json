  "body": "## Explanation\r\n\r\nCurrently, the allow lists of `ComposableControllerMessenger` are set to `string`, which is too permissive. Each `ComposableController` instance needs typing and allow lists that are specific to its set of input child controllers.\r\n\r\nHowever, there's no simple way to achieve this using `BaseController`, as controller-messenger allow lists are defined for the controller class singleton, not controller instances.\r\n\r\nInstead, `ComposableController` and `ComposableControllerMessenger` need to be made polymorphic upon the `controllers` constructor property, which represents the list of child controllers to be composed. \r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n- A generic parameter `ControllerList` (or maybe `ChildControllers`) needs to be added to the `ComposableController` class and `ComposableControllerMessenger` type.\r\n- `ControllerList` should be constrained, but not defined by the least supertype for all base-controller instances (currently `ControllerInstance`).\r\n- ~`ControllerList` should be used to derive the return type of `flatState()` at the type level.~\r\n- `ControllerList` should be used to derive the state type for `ComposableController` instances.\r\n- `ControllerList` should be used to derive the allow lists of `ComposableControllerMessenger`. \r\n  - The allow lists should at minimum include the `stateChange` events for all child controllers that are subscribed to in the `#updateChildController()` method. \r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\n- See https://github.com/MetaMask/core/pull/3590#discussion_r1414460107",
