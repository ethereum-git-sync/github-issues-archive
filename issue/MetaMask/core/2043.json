  "body": "Historically, the `KeyringController` and `EthKeyringController` were designed to cater to different clients, each with its own set of similar, yet not identical features, such as encryption mechanisms, supported keyrings, and business logic.\r\n\r\nOver recent quarters, we've undertaken a significant overhaul of the `KeyringController`'s API, enabling it to accommodate both sets of clients. As a result, the `EthKeyringController` has transitioned to a role where it operates as an internal component within the `KeyringController`.\r\n\r\nGiven the blurred lines of responsibility between the two controllers, and their shared management of the same state, it's becoming evident that the `EthKeyringController` functions more like an internal module of the `KeyringController`. It specifically manages certain aspects of the logic that the `KeyringController`'s API presents.\r\n\r\nWith this in mind, it seems possible (if not necessary) to consider the fusion of these two entities into a single, unified controller. This integrated controller would retain the `KeyringController`'s API and name, thereby allowing for a seamless transition for clients.\r\n\r\nSuch a consolidation would significantly streamline complexity and reduce the overhead associated with maintenance, simultaneously paving the way for more efficient and targeted future API enhancements (like, for example, the Keyring API consolidation).",
