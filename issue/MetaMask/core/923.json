  "body": "The PhishingController error handling for config updates has room for improvement. Currently config update failures are swallowed, so there is no opportunity for caller to discover this or retry. Some types of failure are not even logged.\r\n\r\nWe should ensure that config update failures are not suppressed with `updatePhishingLists` is called, so that the caller is aware when a failure has occurred. In any circumstance where it is necessary to suppress config update failures (e.g. in `test`), we should at least ensure the failure is logged, for debugging purposes.",
