  "body": "**Context**\r\nThe MetaMask team’s shared principles and practices are not well documented. Typically these practices are communicated informally in code reviews, Slack discussions, and team meetings. This process is very time consuming, both for those sharing our practices and those learning them. It also makes it difficult to maintain alignment as a team.\r\n\r\nWe will solve this problem by documenting our shared principles and practices, and by engaging the wider team in using and maintaining this documentation going forward. We aim to document everything that a new contributor would need to be effective, with the condition that we’re only focusing on topics relevant to the wider MetaMask team. This documentation does not need to be comprehensive for it to have a positive impact and drive engagement. We’ll be focusing primarily on well-established practices that already have a high degree of alignment, to maximize impact and minimize effort. Engaging the wider team in using and maintaining this documentation will reduce the barrier to achieving team alignment in the future, and will ensure the content remains up-to-date as our practices evolve. \r\n\r\n### KR-2:   Increase contributor documentation unique visitors to 30 per 2 weeks\r\nWe will measure the team's engagement with the documentation by tracking unique visitors. This will serve as a leading indicator of the documentation being used by the team regularly. GitHub has built-in analytics for this, showing unique visitors in the past two weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
