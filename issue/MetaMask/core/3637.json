  "body": "Recently the TokenRatesController had new methods added for updating and polling token rates for a specific chain, rather than the globally selected chain (in PR #2015).\r\n\r\nHowever these new methods also allowed updating/polling an arbitrary list of token addresses. This is in contrast to the old method and poller, which always used the token list from the TokensController.\r\n\r\nWhile we could imagine some utility from supporting custom addresses, we don't have an immediate use for this feature. It also made managing the state for the TokenRatesController much more complex, as now we have less of an idea what tokens to expect, and different token rates might be more up-to-date than others. Therefor we will be dropping this customization for now, and relying solely on the tokens from the TokensController for all token rate updates.",
