    "body": "Some guidance for whoever ends up picking this up:\r\n\r\nWe already have a script called `scripts/validate-changelog.sh` which uses `auto-changelog`'s `validate` command to ensure that the changelog for that package is well-formed. We could use `scripts/validate-changelog.sh` as a base to create a new script which updates the changelog instead of merely validating it (`auto-changelog` also has an `update` command we can use).\r\n\r\nOne thing to keep in mind, however, is that `scripts/validate-changelog.sh` has special behavior for release branches. In most cases, all of the sections in the changelog need to correspond to existing Git tags. A release branch is different, though, because the current version of the package (which has been bumped in that branch) isn't released yet, so we can't validate that it corresponds to a Git tag — but we do need to validate that there are no changes in the Unreleased section. So, in `scripts/validate-changelog.sh`, we need to know whether the current branch is a release branch so we can pass the `--rc` to `auto-changelog validate` and have the validation logic do the right thing. Since the script is run on CI, we get the name of the branch by reading the magic `GITHUB_REF` environment variable.\r\n\r\nIn this case, we'll want to pass `--rc` for a release branch when calling `auto-changelog update`, too. However, the new script we're adding isn't going to be running in CI, so we have to figure out a different way of checking the current branch. Once we do this, we might want to apply the same to `scripts/validate-changelog.sh`.",
