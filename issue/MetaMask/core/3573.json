    "body": "We discussed what the new price API would need in terms of batching, and decided upon a batch size of 100 for now. We'd also like to fetch these batches serially to avoid getting any closer to rate limits, as we'll be tailoring the rate limits specifically for the configured interval.\r\n\r\nThis means that the token updates will be slower for users with hundreds of tokens. We have some plans to mitigate that, which will need us to track additional state (the last updated time). The ticket #3594 tracks that, that can be out of scope for this issue.",
