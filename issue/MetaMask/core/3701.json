  "body": "Subscribers to the `stateChange` event for each controller will always fire today on the first state change, even if the change doesn't affect the selected value. This is because selectors don't yet consider the initial value when determining if there has been a change. The previous value also isn't correctly returned, it's set to `undefined` for the initial call instead.\r\n\r\nWe should ensure that event subscriptions that use a selector always compare against the correct previous value, and return the correct previous value when they do fire.\r\n\r\nThe issue #3649 is about addressing this problem in general, for the \"subscriber selector\" feature of the `ControllerMessenger`. This issue is meant to track this problem specifically in how it impacts the `${name}:stateChange` controller event that is part of `BaseControllerV2`.",
