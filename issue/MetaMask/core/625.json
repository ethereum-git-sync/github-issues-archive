  "body": "Our usage of CoinGecko should be extracted from the TokenRatesController and made into its own module. This module should be responsible for correctly formatting the request, and parsing the response and returning it in a sensible format.\r\n\r\nThis module should also handle any necessary validation, ensuring that an error is thrown if we don't get the information we want.\r\n\r\nIt should also be fully tested. And since it's no longer part of the TokenRatesController, we should remove any API-focused tests from the TokenRatesController test suite, and mock this new API module there instead of using network mocks.",
