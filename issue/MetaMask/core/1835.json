  "body": "## Explanation\r\n\r\nOnce a library has been migrated into the core monorepo, its original repo is archived and sunsetted. Before that happens, we want to preserve the issues and PRs that are in the original repo by transferring them into the monorepo. \r\n\r\nWe will explore and compare solutions (e.g. bash script, third-party tool, GitHub API or `gh`) for fetching the issues and pull requests and recreating them on the monorepo. \r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n- The solution must be easily reusable for any library migration.\r\n- We may want to ensure that there's some indication for future readers (e.g. prefix, non-user author) that the transferred issues/PRs were copied from another repo.\r\n\r\n## Resources\r\n- Third-party, open-source solution: https://github.com/NicholasBoll/github-migration\r\n- Challenges in automating the transfer process: https://github.com/michaelgwelch/migrate-issues",
