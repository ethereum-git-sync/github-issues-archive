  "body": "im using wagmi and providing chainId to the prepareSendTransaction method gives this exception. If i remove the chainId it works, but doesn't prompt me in the metamask app to change to the chain i want. For example i am testing with sepolia and in order to get transaction in sepolia i need to change it in the app. Previously there was a prompt to change based on the passed chainId in prepareSendTransaction. https://wagmi.sh/core/actions/prepareSendTransaction\r\n\r\nwhat am i supposed to do to get it to work ? I want prompt to change to the chain that i want",
