    "body": "I think this would be a great addition. I understand it may not technically be needed. \r\n\r\nHowever as we try to move dapps towards more traditional web users not having a \"log out\" like feature/feel could be a barrier to entry.  New users to the space may feel uneasy seeing that their wallet can be easily \"reconnected\" even tho they may have \"logged out\".  I have seen many dapps fake the log out experience which could damage the trust in MetaMask even tho it is not MetaMask fault.",

    "body": "Is it possible for MetaMask to throw an info box or warning stating \"User Logged out\" modal in the wallet UI? It could be a means of double assurance for the user. While it may show in the dapp's UI(which could be faked) The source of truth to look at would be the MM wallet. Very similar to how we disconnect and it shows that 'we're not connected to that site'. It could show a message stating 'you've been disconnected from this site: <insert site name>'. There could be a logout boolean endpoint that'll trigger the modal. I'm positive i'm over simplifying it ðŸ˜… . Just though I'd throw an idea out there.\r\n\r\nUpdate:\r\n\r\nJust realized this would be a perfect opportunity for snaps lol, hence it being under this repo ðŸ˜… ðŸ˜† . I'm looking into creating a snaps plugin right now. Will update ya'll if I can build out a PoC for this.",
