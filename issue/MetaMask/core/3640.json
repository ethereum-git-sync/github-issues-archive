  "body": "If the chain ID or ticker in the provider config changes, then they are stored in memory as the current chain ID and ticker, and the rates are re-fetched and categorized under either this new chain ID or ticker on the next poll iteration. However, when that happens, if for some reason the configuration for the network client that matched the previous values for chain ID and ticker does not reflect the new changes, then `contractExchangeRates` will be cleared. This happens because [`contractExchangeRates` is actually cleared before the rates are re-fetched](https://github.com/MetaMask/core/blob/aca89a43935047c73d0d293897030e0ef37de855/packages/assets-controllers/src/TokenRatesController.ts#L262), and then in order to update `contractExchangeRates` [we check to make sure that the currently set chain ID and ticker match the network client used to make the request](https://github.com/MetaMask/core/blob/aca89a43935047c73d0d293897030e0ef37de855/packages/assets-controllers/src/TokenRatesController.ts#L368-L372). Put more simply, though, it's a consequence of using provider config to read data about the network in one place and network client configuration in another.",

    "body": "I didn't describe the scenario better, so here's another way to put it:\r\n\r\n1. The controller is instantiated with an initial chain ID and ticker (which becomes the current chain ID and ticker).\r\n2. The client calls `startPollingByNetworkClientId` with a reference to a network client, and the controller starts polling a certain network.\r\n3. When the poll cycle starts, if the controller sees that the current chain ID and ticker  match the network client (by looking at the network client's configuration object), it updates `contractExchangeRates`. Okay, all good.\r\n4. Now the network controller state changes, and specifically, either the provider config chain ID or provider config ticker changes. The controller updates the current chain ID and ticker and clears `contractExchangeRates`.\r\n5. On the next polling cycle, the same check occurs as in step 3. But this time, since the current chain ID and ticker no longer match the network client, `contractExchangeRates` stays cleared.\r\n\r\nYet another way to say this is: As a client, if you're polling one network, and you change the globally selected network, and you're not polling on the new network, then you'll see an empty token list until you start polling that new network.\r\n\r\nAfter thinking about this some more, this seems expected.\r\n\r\nHowever, we should change the network controller state event listener to read from the currently selected network client configuration rather than the provider config.",
