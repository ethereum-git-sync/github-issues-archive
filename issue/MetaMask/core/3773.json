[boolean] (satisfaction)\r\nWe did a survey at the beginning of Q4 which resulted in 18 responses regarding contributor docs and a 22 Net Promoter Score. At the end of Q4 (while still collecting data) we had 19 responses but the Net Promoter Score decreased to -11. While the NPS decreased this could be a good sign as it indicates people have more thoroughly engaged with the content and have actual opinions now.\r\n",
