  "body": "Description:\r\nIn the create-network-client.ts file, the createInfuraMiddleware and createFetchMiddleware functions currently handle chainId differently. This inconsistency could lead to potential issues or confusion when integrating with different blockchain networks.\r\n\r\nSuggested Changes:\r\n\r\nAlign the handling of chainId in both middleware functions to use a uniform pattern for scaffolding out eth_chainId.\r\nEnsure that both middleware functions process chainId in a similar manner, enhancing consistency and predictability in network interactions.\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\n[createInfuraNetworkMiddleware Function](https://github.com/MetaMask/core/blob/main/packages/network-controller/src/create-network-client.ts#L120C30-L120C30) - Current implementation of chainId handling.\r\n[createCustomNetworkMiddleware Function](https://github.com/MetaMask/core/blob/main/packages/network-controller/src/create-network-client.ts#Ly) - Different approach to chainId handling.\r\nExpected Outcome:\r\nBy standardizing the chainId handling across both middleware functions, we can achieve a more consistent and reliable network management within the MetaMask infrastructure.",
