  "body": "Much of the core wallet functionality is managed by specific libraries known as “controllers”. We [previously designated](https://github.com/MetaMask/core/issues/700) the set of controllers used by the extension that were eligible for merging into the core monorepo. We will choose a few from this list that we are confident we can complete without a need to collaborate with any other team.\r\nIn order to fully complete this task, we may need to raise the code quality of these controllers by refactoring the existing code, simplifying the existing API, adding missing tests, improving the quality of existing tests, or adding missing documentation.\r\n\r\nControllers to be merged:\r\n\r\n- AccountTracker (core) / CachedBalances (extension) [there may be some overlap with accounts]\r\n- TokenBalances\r\n- TokenDetection (core) / DetectTokens (extension)\r\n- PermissionLog\r\n- ENS [stretch goal]\r\n  - [ ] https://github.com/MetaMask/core/issues/1605",
