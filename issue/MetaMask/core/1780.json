  "body": "### 2024/Q1/O1/KR1 Description:\r\nMVP Definition, POC and Technical Proposal\r\nDefine and plan MVP for MM Wallet Library. [boolean]\r\nMuch of the core wallet functionality is managed by specific libraries known as “controllers”. Most of these controllers now live in the core monorepo, but it is up to each client to wire them up in order to fully initialize the client. It is also up to each client to stay up to date on updates to each controller. To make this easier, we want to build a wallet library. There are a number of other reasons that such a library would be beneficial and since the majority of the pre-requisite work has been completed we’d like to begin planning what the next iteration would look like.\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of all benefits:\r\n\r\n- Improved developer experience for the client platform teams (e.g. easier to use, easier to audit, to update, etc.)\r\n- Additional platform capabilities (automatically get anonymized state, persisted state)\r\n- Reduced maintenance for DevEx team (shared RPC pipeline between clients)\r\n- Allows us to more easily write e2e tests and performance benchmarks, improving overall quality/stability and performance\r\n- Helps to establish clearer roles/responsibilities between Shared Libraries and other teams\r\n\r\n**Deliverables for this would be:**\r\n\r\n- Technical proposal written and passed (early Q1)\r\n- POC\r\n- MVP defined\r\n- Project plan / roadmap / strategy defined\r\n\r\n### 2023/Q4/O1/KR2 Description: \r\n5 libraries are migrated to core monorepo\r\nSome of the core wallet functionality is held in utility libraries. We https://github.com/MetaMask/core/issues/1079 the set of libraries that need to be migrated into the core monorepo.\r\n\r\nIn order to fully complete this task, we may need to raise the code quality of these libraries by converting the existing code to TypeScript, upgrading the minimum Node version, upgrading Yarn and Jest, upgrading our ESLint packages along with any configuration, upgrading other dependencies to their latest versions, and aligning the project to match our module template.\r\n\r\nSlated libraries for migration (we were able to start on these at the very end of Q3 so we will add a few more to this list to replace the ones we finish ahead of time):\r\n\r\n- [ ]  @metamask/utils\r\n- [x]  @metamask/json-rpc-engine\r\n- [x]  @metamask/eth-json-rpc-provider\r\n- [x]  @metamask/json-rpc-middleware-stream\r\n\r\n### 2023/Q4/O1/KR1 Description: \r\n5 extension controllers are merged into core monorepo \r\nMuch of the core wallet functionality is managed by specific libraries known as “controllers”. We [previously designated](https://github.com/MetaMask/core/issues/700) the set of controllers used by the extension that were eligible for merging into the core monorepo. We will choose a few from this list that we are confident we can complete without a need to collaborate with any other team.\r\nIn order to fully complete this task, we may need to raise the code quality of these controllers by refactoring the existing code, simplifying the existing API, adding missing tests, improving the quality of existing tests, or adding missing documentation.\r\n\r\nControllers to be merged:\r\n\r\n- AccountTracker (core) / CachedBalances (extension) [there may be some overlap with accounts]\r\n- TokenBalances\r\n- TokenDetection (core) / DetectTokens (extension)\r\n- PermissionLog\r\n- ENS [stretch goal]\r\n  - [ ] https://github.com/MetaMask/core/issues/1605",
