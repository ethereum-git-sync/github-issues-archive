  "body": "**2024/Q1/O1/KR1 Description:**\r\nMVP Definition, POC and Technical Proposal\r\nDefine and plan MVP for MM Wallet Library. [boolean]\r\nMuch of the core wallet functionality is managed by specific libraries known as “controllers”. Most of these controllers now live in the core monorepo, but it is up to each client to wire them up in order to fully initialize the client. It is also up to each client to stay up to date on updates to each controller. To make this easier, we want to build a wallet library. There are a number of other reasons that such a library would be beneficial and since the majority of the pre-requisite work has been completed we’d like to begin planning what the next iteration would look like.\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of all benefits:\r\n\r\n- Improved developer experience for the client platform teams (e.g. easier to use, easier to audit, to update, etc.)\r\n- Additional platform capabilities (automatically get anonymized state, persisted state)\r\n- Reduced maintenance for DevEx team (shared RPC pipeline between clients)\r\n- Allows us to more easily write e2e tests and performance benchmarks, improving overall quality/stability and performance\r\n- Helps to establish clearer roles/responsibilities between Shared Libraries and other teams\r\n\r\nDeliverables for this would be:\r\n\r\n- Technical proposal written and passed (early Q1)\r\n- POC\r\n- MVP defined\r\n- Project plan / roadmap / strategy defined",
