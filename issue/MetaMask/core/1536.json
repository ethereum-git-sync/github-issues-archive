  "body": "### 1 | Objective: Reduce maintenance burden for core wallet functionality\n**Context**\nThere is a significant amount of functionality central to the wallet experience that is either duplicated across both the extension and mobile applications or is scattered across various repositories. This creates two problems. At the highest level, it reinforces separation between product teams and inhibits them from designing a cohesive experience across the two platforms. More specifically, it creates a maintenance burden for all parties involved, particularly the Shared Libraries team. By assembling pieces of core functionality into one repository, we will be able to develop tooling and automation that assists us in managing these pieces. This will eventually unlock innovation for all of MetaMask by enabling product teams to ship new features faster.\nThis effort has been underway for months, and will continue beyond Q3 2023.\n\n**_KR-3:   Upgrade controller packages in mobile app to latest versions [boolean]_**\nThe mobile app has been using outdated versions of controller packages for several months. Bringing these packages up to date will make it far easier to complete migrations for the keyring, transaction, and other controllers.\n",
