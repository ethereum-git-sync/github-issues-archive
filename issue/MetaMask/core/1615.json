  "body": "Currently, the test coverage for TokenDetectionController is below 100%. At time of writing, the coverage of lines was: 98.07% (102/104).\r\n\r\nWe should check each part of the API to ensure that it is completely tested so that we can raise coverage to 100%.\r\n\r\nGoal is to have functionality covered (which could mean coverage is more than 100%). Think about are edge cases covered, is anything duplicative or un-necessary etc. Think about it from the point of view of whether a new contributor could use the tests as a guideline for what the controller does. \r\n\r\nFocus of this ticket should be the api changes and major gaps.",

    "body": "Merging `TokenDetectionController` with `DetectTokensController` has introduced new behaviors and branches. These are some new tests that will need to be added:\r\n\r\n- Correctly responds to `KeyringController:lock`, `KeyringController:unlock`, `AccountsController:selectedAccountChange`, `PreferencesController:stateChange` events.\r\n  - Resets polling interval to default value (3 minutes) when responding to these events.\r\n- Correctly responds to the `isUnlocked` property of keyring-controller being set to false when the controller is initialized. \r\n  - Specifically, passive auto token-detection in response to subscribe events is blocked.\r\n- Correctly pulls the `useTokenDetection` property using the `Preferences:getState` action when controller is initialized.\r\n  - Performs token detection on legacy token list if selected network is Mainnet even if token detection is disabled by preferences controller. \r\n- Does not detect tokens that are already in the tokens-controller `detectedTokens` list.\r\n- `trackMetaMetricsEvent` is called with the expected options object arguments.\r\n\r\nThe following are the recommended minimum target coverage thresholds, defined by the threshold values prior to the changes introduced by #3775.\r\n```\r\n      branches: 88.36,\r\n      functions: 97.08,\r\n      lines: 97.23,\r\n      statements: 97.28,\r\n```",
