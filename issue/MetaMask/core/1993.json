This means there is no stack trace and no contextual information which makes debugging quite difficult.\r\n\r\nWe can see in these two locations that the type of this \"error\" is `unknown`, which should never be thrown directly:\r\nhttps://github.com/MetaMask/json-rpc-engine/blob/bece020a9d515e1714ffa3e6ac36c534e33ddfe5/src/JsonRpcEngine.ts#L361\r\nhttps://github.com/MetaMask/json-rpc-engine/blob/bece020a9d515e1714ffa3e6ac36c534e33ddfe5/src/JsonRpcEngine.ts#L396\r\n\r\nA potentially bigger issue, and maybe the source of the problem, is that this code isn't properly rejecting on failure, it is instead returning a successfully resolved async function with an error result rather than rejecting, so I don't think we won't benefit from proper stack traces even if we had an error:\r\nhttps://github.com/MetaMask/json-rpc-engine/blob/bece020a9d515e1714ffa3e6ac36c534e33ddfe5/src/JsonRpcEngine.ts#L404\r\n\r\nI think this is the source of the issue, note that it is just calling `end` with `JsonRpcResponse.error`.  It isn't including any additional context like the original request (which would be immensely valuable for troubleshooting) or a stack trace which (if async/await is used properly) would provide a potentially useful call stack.\r\nhttps://github.com/MetaMask/json-rpc-engine/blob/bece020a9d515e1714ffa3e6ac36c534e33ddfe5/src/JsonRpcEngine.ts#L401\r\n\r\nThis is along the lines of what *should* be returned:\r\nhttps://github.com/MetaMask/json-rpc-engine/blob/bece020a9d515e1714ffa3e6ac36c534e33ddfe5/src/JsonRpcEngine.ts#L415-L423",
