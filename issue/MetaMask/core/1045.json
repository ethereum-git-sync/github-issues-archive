    "body": "At the moment, we construct the network client on-demand when switching to a network. In order to return a collection of network clients for each configured network, we'll need to start creating them ahead of time instead.\r\n\r\nWe still want the behavior to be functionally identical for mobile and extension for now though, meaning that we'll have to ensure that constructing the network clients ahead of time has no side-effects. We can continue to perform certain initialization actions upon switch or upon first use of a client, similar to how we do today (e.g. send `net_version` to verify that we can connect to the network, check EIP1559 compatibility, etc.).",
