  "body": "The extension version of NetworkController uses a hexadecimal number formatted as a `0x`-prefixed string to represent the chain ID (both in the [provider configuration](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/blob/5892acab81ea4a19cf2ab987320b497fa81b7e36/app/scripts/controllers/network/network-controller.ts#L179) and [network configuration](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/blob/5892acab81ea4a19cf2ab987320b497fa81b7e36/app/scripts/controllers/network/network-controller.ts#L240) objects). However, this version uses a decimal number stored in a string for chain ID. In order to merge the two network controllers, we ought to decide on one format.\r\n\r\nWe had a discussion on Slack a while back (search the extension channel around 1/23) about which format to use:\r\n\r\n- The main argument for using an `0x`-prefixed hex number is that it removes ambiguity when looking at the number in code.\r\n- The main argument for using decimals is that it's easier for developers to read and work with, and that resources you might find on the internet (e.g. Chainlist) or even APIs (e.g. Coingecko) tend to use base 10 instead of base 16.\r\n\r\nTo satisfy both of these concerns, we could ostensibly use a decimal number for chain ID but then convert it to a hex number. This would be most apparent in the `NetworksChainId` enum, which we could redefine like this:\r\n\r\n``` typescript\r\nexport const NETWORK_CHAIN_IDS = {\r\n  mainnet: toHex('1'),\r\n  goerli: toHex('5'),\r\n  sepolia: toHex('11155111'),\r\n};\r\n\r\ntype NetworkChainId = typeof NETWORK_CHAIN_IDS[keyof typeof NETWORK_CHAIN_IDS];\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe will have to work through all of the places that refer to chain ID and convert them appropriately.\r\n\r\nOne thing to note is that the `chainId` property of the NetworkConfiguration type is enforced to be a `0x`-prefixed hex string, but the `chainId` property of ProviderConfig is not. This should fix a bug that currently exists where `setActiveNetwork` and `setProviderType` actually have inconsistent behavior, where `setProviderType` writes a non-prefixed hex string to `providerConfig` while `setActiveNetwork` writes a prefixed hex string.",

    "body": "Upon re-reviewing this, it is likely that 4 is too high, however, I assigned this number due to uncertainty and time. If you search the `core` repo there are a ton of instances of `chainId`, and I'm not sure what places are assuming a hex string vs. a decimal string. It may take some time to work through all of those instances, although we may discover repeating patterns after looking at it. So this may end up being a 3 in the end, but I still wanted to account for that uncertainty.",
