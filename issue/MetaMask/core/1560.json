  "body": "              1. networkDetails is where status and networkID should have been put in the first place. The contents of details (just the EIPS key) could be moved into the root of networksMetadata - this would make a lot more sense for this data structure. Since we are already touching this stuff in this PR, I think its reasonable to include this change as part of this PR, and Ill update it today accordingly.\r\n\r\n2. networkID was ignored here as it will be removed in a later / seperate PR.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @BelfordZ in https://github.com/MetaMask/core/pull/1559#discussion_r1276486306_\r\n            ",
