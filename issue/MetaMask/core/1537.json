  "body": "### 2 | Objective: Improve quality of life for core monorepo collaborators\n**Context**\nAs a team that serves other teams within MetaMask, we want other teams to feel confident in using the infrastructure, processes, and tools we’ve created around the monorepo. This way they are able to not only achieve their own objectives by shipping features, but also help the organization by expanding the size of the shared codebase. If it turns out that this is not easy to do, then we will use a portion of this quarter to make improvements to the monorepo.\n\n**_KR-1:   Other teams are 20% more confident in working with the core monorepo_**\nThe core monorepo has existed for around 8 months, and while we’ve observed how people use it, we don’t know how people feel about it. Our hypothesis is that there are some rough edges we can polish in order to remove obstacles that might deter people with less time or expertise from contributing to the monorepo, but we need to confirm this.\nWe will start by releasing a survey at the beginning of Q3 which aims to measure the current confidence level of engineers and gather any feedback they might have. We will use this feedback to make improvements to our process, then release another survey at the end of the quarter to measure the impact.\n",
