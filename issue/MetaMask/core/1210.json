  "body": "The extension version of NetworkController [emits the `networkWillChange` controller event before making any state changes](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/blob/5892acab81ea4a19cf2ab987320b497fa81b7e36/app/scripts/controllers/network/network-controller.ts#L887) and [emits `networkDidChange` after updating the provider and capturing details about the network](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/blob/5892acab81ea4a19cf2ab987320b497fa81b7e36/app/scripts/controllers/network/network-controller.ts#L892). So that it's easier to merge the two network controllers, we should update the `#refreshNetwork` method (which is equivalent to `#switchNetwork` on the extension side) to emit these events.\n\nNote that we will want to make sure to copy any tests from the extension that involve these events. There are a lot of them, so this may take some time.",
