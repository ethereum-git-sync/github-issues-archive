    "body": "## Migration Checklist\r\n\r\n### Epic A: Preparation in source repo\r\n\r\n#### 1. Align TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier dependency versions and configurations with the core monorepo.\r\n- [x] https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-json-rpc-provider/pull/28\r\n  - [x] If migration target is ahead of core in dependency versions, consider updating core dependencies first.\r\n  - [x] Resolve all resulting issues.\r\n#### 2. Add any missing files required in subpackages of the core monorepo (e.g. LICENSE).\r\n- [x] https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-json-rpc-provider/pull/24\r\n#### 3. Create a new release of the migration target from the source repo\r\n- [x] https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-json-rpc-provider/pull/29\r\n- All subsequent releases of migration target will be partial releases made from the core monorepo.\r\n#### 4. Add migration notice to README\r\n- [x] https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-json-rpc-provider/pull/38\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\n### Epic B: Staging from `merged-packages/`\r\n#### 0. Move the migration target into a temporary directory in core (`merged-packages/`).\r\n- [x] https://github.com/MetaMask/core/pull/1755\r\n  - [x] Follow these instructions to ensure that the original git history remains fully intact after the transfer: https://github.com/MetaMask/core/issues/1079#issuecomment-1700126302.\r\n  - [x] MUST NOT rebase the `migrate-<package-name>` branch. \r\n  - [ ] Ensure that superfluous merge commits don't pollute the history. If necessary, replace the PR branch with a cleaned-up post-migration commit history by rerunning the git history migration steps before merging the PR.\r\n    - For context: https://github.com/MetaMask/core/pull/1804#issuecomment-1771445829\r\n  - [x] Contact admins to temporarily enable merge commits into main.\r\n  - [x] Merge PR **without squashing** to preserve the migrated git commit history.\r\n\r\n#### 1. Remove files and directories that will be replaced by files in the monorepo root.\r\n- [x] https://github.com/MetaMask/core/pull/1764\r\n  - [x] **Remove**: `.github/`, `.git*`, `scripts/`, `.depcheckrc.json`, `.yarn/`, `.yarnrc.yml`, `yarn.lock`, `.editorconfig`, `.eslint*`, `.prettier*`, `.nvm*`.\r\n  - [x] **Keep**: `src/`, `tests/`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `LICENSE`, `package.json`, `README.md`, `jest.config.js`, `tsconfig*.json`, `typedoc.json`. \r\n  \r\n#### 2. Replace config files.\r\n- [x] https://github.com/MetaMask/core/pull/1765\r\n  - [x] Update `tsconfig*.json`, `typedoc.json`, `jest.config.js` to extend from corresponding files in root. Copy contents of corresponding files in other non-root packages.\r\n  - [x] Keep TypeScript compiler flags. \r\n  - [x] Add tsconfig reference paths for non-root packages that are upstream dependencies of the migration target.\r\n  - [x] Keep Jest coverage threshold values. \r\n  - [x] Add `deepmerge` as a devDependency.\r\n  \r\n#### 3. Align dependencies with monorepo.\r\n- [x] https://github.com/MetaMask/core/pull/1766\r\n  - [x] Remove redundant dependencies that are already listed in the root package.json.\r\n  - [x] Bump remaining dependency versions so that they align with other non-root packages.\r\n  \r\n#### 4. Add exception for non-MIT license.\r\n- [x] https://github.com/MetaMask/core/pull/1767\r\n  - [x] If migration target uses a non-MIT license, add exception entries in the root `constraints.pro` file.  \r\n  - [x] Make sure the new rule doesn't break any of the existing package.json files by running `yarn constraints`.\r\n\r\n#### 5. Update README\r\n- [x] Update contents of migration target's README to reflect new status as a non-root package in the monorepo.\r\n\r\n#### 6. Port tags \r\n- [x] See: https://github.com/MetaMask/core/issues/1800\r\n  - [x] Port the tags locally with the correct package name prefixes.\r\n  - [x] Push the ported tags to a testing fork of the core monorepo.\r\n  - [x] Verify that the tag diff links in CHANGELOG are working.\r\n  - [x] The diff between last tag before migration and first one after will always include the entire history of the monorepo.\r\n      - TODO: The correct diff can be derived using `git log --ancestry-path`. If GitHub starts supporting compare links that use `--ancestry-path`, the broken diff link in the changelog should be fixed.\r\n  - [x] Push the ported tags to the core repo.\r\n  - [x] Verify that the tag diff links in CHANGELOG are working.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\n### Epic C: Integration into `packages/`\r\n- [x] https://github.com/MetaMask/core/pull/1738\r\n\r\n#### 1. The big leap\r\n- [x] **Move migration target from `merged-packages/` to `packages/`.**\r\n- [x] Run `yarn install` in the root directory.\r\n- [x] Check that all tests are passing in migration target by running `yarn workspace @metamask/<package-name> test`.\r\n\r\n#### 2. Update downstream repos\r\n- [x] Add tsconfig reference paths for migration target in downstream packages and root.\r\n- [x] Bump migration target version in downstream packages and root.\r\n  - Notes on why this version bump needs to happen as part of this PR (import module shadowing): https://github.com/MetaMask/core/pull/1738#discussion_r1357554901\r\n\r\n#### 3. Linter fixes\r\n- [x] Apply yarn constraints fixes to migration target package.json file: `yarn constraints --fix` (run twice).\r\n- [x] Identify validator fixes for CHANGELOG using `yarn workspace @metamask/<package-name> changelog:validate` and apply the diffs. \r\n\r\n#### 4. Resolve or TODO downstream errors\r\n- If introducing the migration target breaks any downstream repos:\r\n  - [x] Resolve simple errors\r\n  - [x] Mark and ignore complex/blocked errors using `@ts-expect-error TODO:` annotations. \r\n- [x] Create a separate issue for resolving the marked errors as soon as the migration is completed.\r\n  - https://github.com/MetaMask/core/issues/1823\r\n\r\n#### 5. Finalize merge\r\n- [x] Check that all tests are passing in all subpackages of core and CI.\r\n- [x] Merge `packages/<package-name>` directory into core main branch.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\n### Epic D: Final steps\r\n\r\n### Source repo\r\n\r\n- [ ] Transfer branches/issues/PRs from the source repo into the core monorepo.\r\n  - [ ] Blocked by #1835 \r\n- [ ] Leave a note in the source repo's README announcing the migration and pointing to core.\r\n- [ ] Sunset GitHub Pages docs and leave link pointing to migrated docs in core.\r\n- [ ] Archive the source repo to prevent any changes from being pushed to it going forward.\r\n\r\n### Core\r\n\r\n- [x] Add migration target to README dependency graph using the `generate-dependency-graph` build script.\r\n- [x] Record any changes made to monorepo packages during the migration process in their respective CHANGELOGs.\r\n- [x] List the migrated package as an **ADDED** change in the root CHANGELOG.\r\n- [ ] Fix downstream errors that were marked with `@ts-expect-error TODO:` during the migration process.\r\n",
