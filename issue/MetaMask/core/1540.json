  "body": "### 3 | Objective: Establish standards for shared libraries repositories\n**Context**\nThe shared principles and practices that we use to develop, maintain, and release our shared libraries are not well documented. This knowledge is scattered across GitHub pull requests, Slack discussions, notes from team meetings, and other ad-hoc documents. This creates an unpleasant onboarding experience for new contributors, and it costs time for established  contributors in needing to explain mechanics or produce rationales for past decisions. In addition, a lack of written guidance opens the door for other teams outside of our own to make changes to the repositories under our purview which are out of alignment with the standards that we follow, which creates more work for us later by increasing our technical debt. Monitoring every pull request to ensure that it conforms to our standards is impractical, as it takes time away from our goals and promotes an undesirable culture of gatekeeping.\nWe will solve these problems by documenting the principles and practices that our team follows and communicating them as the need arises.\n\n**_KR-1:   30% of the suggestions we make on pull requests to shared libraries from outside our team reference the contributor documentation_**\nIn a previous quarter, we outlined a list of topics that we felt would be sufficient for a new Shared Libraries engineer to be effective. From this list will prioritize a subset that we feel will assist engineers outside of the team to contribute to our repositories in a way that does not incur greater tech debt.",
