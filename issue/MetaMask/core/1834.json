  "body": "## Overview\n\nAs part of Shared Libraries Q3/Q4 OKRs, the team would like to document a process guide for migrating libraries into this monorepo. \n\nThis entails two tasks:\n\n1. The process needs fine-tuning. During the course of migration efforts utilizing the initial instructions (https://github.com/MetaMask/core/issues/1079#issuecomment-1700126302), several blockers, points of caution, and gaps were identified. These issues need to be resolved and the solutions documented. \n\n2. The lessons and solutions from the initial migrations need to be compiled into a step-by-step guide that is granular and streamlined enough to be easily followed by the team (and potentially external contributors) to migrate any library into the core monorepo without significant adjustments or delays. \n\n## Tasks\n\n### 1. Fill in the blanks\n\n- [x] Implement script for prepending package names when porting release tags : https://github.com/MetaMask/core/issues/1800.\n- [x] Modify `auto-changelog` validator to handle inconsistent package-name prefixes in the ported tags of renamed packages: https://github.com/MetaMask/core/issues/1795.\n- [x] **WONTFIX**: The entire commit history of the core repo is included in all diffs between migrated commits and commits made after the target package's git history is merged into the monorepo.\n- [x] Solution for migrating issues and PRs from the original repo into the monorepo: https://github.com/MetaMask/core/issues/1835\n- [ ] Add option in `create-release-branch` tool to specify the last release tag name for a given subpackage: https://github.com/MetaMask/create-release-branch/issues/105\n- [x] Enable `autochange-log` validator to handle manually created tags (for release commits that were untagged in the original repo): https://github.com/MetaMask/core/pull/2008\n- [ ] Enable GH Pages workflows for publishing docs in core monorepo so that existing docs from migration target can be published under `core/` namespace: https://github.com/MetaMask/core/issues/1845\n\n### 2. Documentation\n\n- [x] Break down each step into granular, orthogonal PR groupings and define the best order for executing these tasks: https://github.com/MetaMask/core/issues/1551#issuecomment-1745665740.\n- [x] Compile a comprehensive, standardized process guide: https://github.com/MetaMask/core/issues/1832.",
