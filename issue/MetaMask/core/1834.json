  "body": "## Overview\r\n\r\nAs part of Shared Libraries Q3/Q4 OKRs, the team would like to document a process guide for migrating libraries into this monorepo. \r\n\r\nThis entails two tasks:\r\n\r\n1. The process needs fine-tuning. During the course of migration efforts utilizing the initial instructions (https://github.com/MetaMask/core/issues/1079#issuecomment-1700126302), several blockers, points of caution, and gaps were identified. These issues need to be resolved and the solutions documented. \r\n\r\n2. The lessons and solutions from the initial migrations need to be compiled into a step-by-step guide that is granular and streamlined enough to be easily followed by the team (and potentially external contributors) to migrate any library into the core monorepo without significant adjustments or delays. \r\n\r\n## Tasks\r\n\r\n### 1. Fine-tuning\r\n\r\n- [ ] Implement script for porting release tags with package-name prefixes: https://github.com/MetaMask/core/issues/1800.\r\n- [ ] Modify `auto-changelog` validator to handle inconsistent package-name prefixes in the ported tags of renamed packages: https://github.com/MetaMask/core/issues/1795.\r\n- [x] **WONTFIX**: The entire commit history of the core repo is included in all diffs between migrated commits and commits made after the target package's git history is merged into the monorepo.\r\n- [ ] Solution for migrating issues and PRs from the original repo into the monorepo: https://github.com/MetaMask/core/issues/1835\r\n\r\n### 2. Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] Document all steps in the process and define the best order and grouping for executing these tasks: https://github.com/MetaMask/core/issues/1551#issuecomment-1745665740.\r\n- [ ] Compile a comprehensive, standardized process guide: https://github.com/MetaMask/core/issues/1832.",
