  "body": "`@metamask/controller-utils` relies on `eth-query`, but this package has no type definitions. We've backfilled the type definitions for this package, but they are private to this repo. This means that it's impossible to use the current version of `@metamask/controller-utils` in another project (like Snaps). We should fork `eth-query` and publish a new version that contains the same type definitions as here.",
