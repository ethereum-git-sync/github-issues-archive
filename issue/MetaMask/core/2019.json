  "body": "There is currently no easy way for a controller to access the user-provided metadata for a known network (nickname, ticker, etc.). If it's for a custom network, then it can use a messenger to get the set of network configurations from the network controller, then look up a network configuration that matches the same information. If it's for an Infura network, then it can use the `BUILT_IN_NETWORKS` constant (or other constants).\r\n\r\nWe can hide this inconvenience by creating a `getNetworkConfiguration` method and action that other controllers can then call directly.",
