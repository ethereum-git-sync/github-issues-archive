  "body": "**Context**\r\nThe MetaMask extension and mobile applications each maintain separate implementations for most core wallet functionality. These separate implementations are an enormous maintenance burden, and an obstacle to building a more cohesive UX between all clients. By eliminating this duplication we can dramatically decrease the maintenance burden of the client teams and reduce the costs of future integrations.\r\nThis effort has been underway for months, and will continue beyond Q1. Progress towards the first milestone (shared controllers) is tracked [here](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/issues/700). The most substantial tasks in that milestone are the network, transaction, and keyring controller migrations. In the previous two quarters, we completed most of the network controller migration. Last quarter we also worked on the keyring controller migration, completing initial TypeScript migrations and planning tasks.\r\n\r\n### KR-1:   Complete the keyring controller migration\r\nThe keyring controller manages keyrings, which are among the most security-critical parts of the application. The keyring management code has been very difficult to maintain and extend, and has been linked with many regressions. These maintenance challenges have also been an obstacle to further hardware wallet integrations. Consolidating these implementations would significantly improve the stability of our products, and would provide us with an opportunity to improve the API to better enable hardware wallet and snap integrations.\r\n\r\n",
