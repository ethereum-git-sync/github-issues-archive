  "body": "# üêû Bug Report\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen importing new additional accounts to a directory with an existing wallet, the CLI will ask for a \"New Wallet Password\" in certain cases. \r\n\r\nIf the ```--wallet-dir``` argument is passed directly as an argument to the import command, the CLI will correctly ask you for your existing wallet password, since a wallet exists already in that dir. \r\n\r\nIf you do not pass the ```--wallet-dir``` argument, but instead respond to the subsequent \"Enter a wallet directory\" prompt with a directory that has an existing wallet, it asks for a \"New Wallet Password\" and makes user enter twice and adhere to pwd reqs, instead of just asking for existing \"Wallet Password\". If this \"New Wallet Password\" is different from the existing one, there will be a FATAL error. The existing password must be entered into both New Password and Confirm New Password prompts for it to work.\r\n\r\nExpectation is that the CLI asks for existing wallet password in both of the above cases.\r\n\r\n### Has this worked before in a previous version?\r\n\r\nUnknown. Have not used previous versions.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nSetup:\r\n\r\n1. Create wallet with keys in some directory, e.g. /walletDir and give it a password e.g. walletPwd\r\n2. Add additional keys (new accounts) to key directory, and then proceed as below:\r\n\r\nScenario A (correct)\r\n\r\n```bazel run //validator:validator -- accounts import --pyrmont --keys-dir={path to keys} --wallet-dir /walletDir```\r\n\r\nScenario B (unexpected)\r\n\r\n```\r\nbazel run //validator:validator -- accounts import --pyrmont --keys-dir={path to keys}\r\n\r\n>>Enter A Wallet Directory\r\n>>/walletDir\r\n\r\n>>New Password (expected prompt for existing wallet password)\r\n>>Confirm New Password (must enter old existing password in both of these fields)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Operating System: Ubuntu**\r\n\r\n\r\n**What version of Prysm are you running? (Which release)**\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n  <code>\r\nv1.0.0-beta.3\r\n  </code>\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nThis isn't a critical issue, but more of a UX item that can be misleading. \r\n\r\n",
