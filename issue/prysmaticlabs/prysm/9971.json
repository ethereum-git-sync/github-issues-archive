  "body": "# ðŸš€ Feature Request\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, Prysm supports triggering database backups via an HTTP webhook documented [here](https://docs.prylabs.network/docs/prysm-usage/database-backups).  The way it works is as follows:\r\n\r\nThe user has to add the following flags to their beacon node and/or validator:\r\n\r\n- `--enable-db-backup-webhook`: Serve an http server to initiate database backups. The handler is served on the beacon node's monitoring host and port. Default endpoint is `http://127.0.0.1:8080/db/backup` if the flag is enabled.\r\n- `--db-backup-output-dir`: Folder path to where backups will be output to, such as `/path/to/mybackups`. If the directory exists, make sure the permissions for that directory is `0700`.\r\n\r\nThe beacon node will expose an HTTP endpoint `http://monitoringhost:monitoringport/db/backup`, which is `http://127.0.0.1:8080/db/backup` by default. Then, the user can hit this endpoint via HTTP, and a backup will initiate which will be output to the `--db-backup-output-dir` path.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nAs Prysm's validator also supports a [web interface](https://docs.prylabs.network/docs/prysm-usage/web-interface), we should be able to trigger these backups from the web UI, and ideally give feedback to the user that a backup has been trigger and that the backup has completed. To do this, we would need the following components:\r\n\r\nCreate the following gRPC API endpoints to trigger a backup\r\n- In the validator client: add `TriggerValidatorDBBackup` and `TriggerBeaconDBBackup` endpoints to trigger the actual backup process. Also, we might want a `ValidatorDBBackupHistory` and a `BeaconDBBackupHistory` which can check all triggered backups and their status (whether or not they have completed)\r\n- Add the ability to check for status of backups. Today, the backup webhook doesn't return anything to the user aside from a status 200 if the trigger was successful. We might want to also return a backup ID, which can be used to check if the backup has completed later (useful for displaying to a user). We also want a way to read a history of triggered backups and their status.\r\n",
