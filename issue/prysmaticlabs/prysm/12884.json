  "body": "In the fork choice spec test, it uses *tick* to set the internal time of Prysm. However, Pyrsm’s Tick function resets the genesis time to now()-tick and adjusts the slot to the appropriate value. Therefore, now() is taken as time.Now(), which represents the real time and changes with the program’s flow. This results in a potential unintended slot change during a test (e.g., when tick=(ticks_in_new_slot - 1)), which may or may not affect the forkchoice decision and non-deterministically lead to a different result (PASS/FAIL), which does not happen in other clients like Lighthouse, Teku, or Nimbus.\r\n\r\nFor example, when ```steps.yaml``` defined as below, and attestations were \r\n\r\n```\r\n- {tick: 0}\r\n- {tick: 12}\r\n   # block_0xAAA was proposed\r\n- {tick: 24}\r\n   # block_0xBBB was proposed\r\n- {tick: 36}\r\n   # block_0xCCC was proposed\r\n- {tick: 48}\r\n   # block_0xDDD was proposed\r\n- {tick: 59}\r\n- {block: block_0xAAA}   # Receive all blocks right before next slot\r\n- {block: block_0xBBB}\r\n- {block: block_0xCCC}\r\n- {block: block_0xDDD}\r\n- {attestation: attestation_0x000}   # Assume attestations are from future (from right next slot)\r\n- {attestation: attestation_0x111}   \r\n- {attestation: attestation_0x222}\r\n- {attestation: attestation_0x333}\r\n- {attestation: attestation_0x444}\r\n- {attestation: attestation_0x555}\r\n- {tick: 60}\r\n…\r\n```\r\n**Expect:** All attestations from 0x000 to 0x555 will be rejected (due to ```onAttestation``` itself is stateless in spec test)\r\n**Result**: Sometimes, some of attestations are accepted and affect to weight (due to time passed, became next slot)\r\n\r\n\r\nReference:\r\nIn [here](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/develop/testing/spectest/shared/common/forkchoice/builder.go#L40) and [here](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/develop/time/utils.go#L19) ```onTick``` is technically implemented according to the specs, but in fact when ```prysmTime.Now()``` is called it shows the real current time, which will change as time goes. This doesn’t happen in Teku, Nimbus or Lighthouse\r\n",
