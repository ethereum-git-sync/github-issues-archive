This technique will VASTLY improve installation by creating the beacon chain systemd service and reduce the technical barrier to staking.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nThe current prysm.sh update method is fine for a beta client, but mainnet software requires mainnet solutions.\r\n",

Looks like all this work has been completed in https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/8872 by @aliask , yet there is still no PPA that enables users to just `apt install` these packages and take advantage of these convenient configuration files.\r\n\r\nCan we have the prysm team setup an official PPA to make the distribution of these packages easier on users?",
