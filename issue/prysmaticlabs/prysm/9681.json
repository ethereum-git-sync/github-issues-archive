Indeed, we use buildkite for our continuous integration pipeline and require many bazel operations to pass before a PR can merge. \r\n\r\nBuildkite does support reading the pipeline steps from the repository, so that is something we could do. I'll look into this topic next week, after v2 is released. ",
