After a while, I had to reinstall it and I encountered such a problem in the beacon client.\r\n\r\n[2022-12-12 15:38:21] ERROR p2p: Failed to find peers error=unable to find requisite number of peers for topic /eth2/4a26c58b/beacon_attestation_20/ssz_snappy - only 0 out of 1 peers were able to be found\r\n[2022-12-12 15:38:21]  WARN p2p: Attestation is too old to broadcast, discarding it.
