  "body": "Proto.clone is an extremely expensive method that we have taken great lengths to avoid in some recent refactors. However, a quick grep in Prysm shows it still being used significantly for various reasons, especially in certain helper functions and cached values in the beacon chain. Now, we have a bunch of custom copy functions in `beacon-chain/state/getters.go` that we can use instead of an expensive, generic, proto.Clone call.\r\n\r\nThis is a tracking issue for us to use the custom copy functions from `beacon-chain/state/getters.go` instead of proto.Clone throughout the repo.",
