This is a UX concern because users will need to regenerate the deposit data, but do not need to create a new account.~\r\n- ~if we know the transaction will fail, by reading the current deposit root in the smart contract, do not prompt the user to spend gas on such a transaction~\r\n- ~if the transaction does fail, we should communicate this better to the user. Currently, it appears to have worked when the transaction was actually reverted.~\r\n\r\nStill investigating...",
