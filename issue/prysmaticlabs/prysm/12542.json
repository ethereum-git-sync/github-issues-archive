  "body": "# 💎 Issue\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\nA Prysm validator node which runs with the `--enable-db-backup-webhook` flag exposes a GET /db/backup monitoring API endpoint that saves a backup of the node database onto the disk. \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis is a risky way to backup our databases as a validator node could be saving attestation/proposal records at that point of time and the backup would be inconsistent with the current state of the validator. Also due to continuous nature of  attestations/proposals, its very possible that by the next slot the database backup is already outdated and shouldn't be used. We should remove the ability to backup validator databases via a http request as it is possible for malicious actors to also spam the endpoint via a server side request forgery vulnerability. \r\n\r\nHowever due to the fact that this is a breaking change, we can't do this until a new major version of prysm is released. \r\n\r\nAudit Finding: TOB-PRYSM-9",
