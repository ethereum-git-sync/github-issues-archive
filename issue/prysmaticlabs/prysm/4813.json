  "body": "Using the ```initial-sync-cache-state``` flags leads to  OOMs when syncing blocks in a period without finality. This is as we cache the relevant fields of each state in a slot. Without finality there is no pruning of states, so all these fields are kept on the heap and leads to the heap size quickly ballooning.\r\n\r\nA solution for this would be to handle periods without finality properly and not keep all states in memory.",
