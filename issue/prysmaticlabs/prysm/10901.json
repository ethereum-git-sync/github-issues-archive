  "body": "In several areas of our code we use `[]byte` for roots when `[32]byte` would be more efficient. The main reason for this is protobuf support. Forkchoice uses internally `[32]byte` and in the interface with blockchain package it needs to convert from `[]byte`. This issue should be marked as solved when all calls from the blockchain package to save/read checkpoints to/from db are switched to use `[32]byte` so as to avoid copying a checkpoint from a BeaconState.
