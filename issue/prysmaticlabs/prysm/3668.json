The processing time of a block containing 65536 votes split between 256 attestations\r\n\r\nThe obvious barrier to this test is the state setup.\r\n\r\nGenerating a state with 65536 deposits is expensive so we should consider a precomputed / pregenerated state on disk with keys to load. Additionally, some tests may want to precompute their setup data and store that on disk so the test isn't a extra burden to run in CI. \r\n\r\nGeneral requirements:\r\n- [ ] Precompute 65536 or more BLS keys (using the deterministic algorithm)\r\n- [x] Precompute genesis state with 65536 validators (using keys from above)\r\n\r\nSpecific requirements:\r\n- [x] Precompute a block with 65536 votes split between 128 attestations\r\n- [x] Write a test that processes that block (to prevent code rot in the next step)\r\n- [x] Write a benchmark that uses the inner logic of the test above to determine expected processing time\r\n- [ ] Write second set of a test / bench with 65536 votes split between 256 attestations.\r\n\r\nThe latter scenario may be more difficult because MAX_ATTESTATIONS is a [hardcoded parameter](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/8ece8fb44bfc24fee83bfc4539fa5d9aaa12e215/proto/eth/v1alpha1/beacon_block.proto#L49) in `ssz-max` in protobuf definitions.",
