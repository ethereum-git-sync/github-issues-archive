  "body": "# ðŸ’Ž Issue\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nCurrently a lot of our tests utilize the `time` package and  its related objects such as `ticker`. We use timing based checks extensively in a lot of our tests, unfortunately the improper usage of them has led to many flaky tests. If the current time is withing the boundary of a second, this can lead to inconsistent results. The reason for this is that certain checks/conditions are triggered once the current unix cutoff time increases by 1 second. This holds true for any usage of `time.Now()` along with `time.Ticker()` .  \r\n\r\nSome tests that fail due to this:\r\n`TestWaitForSlotTwoThird_WaitCorrectly` \r\n`TestStreamDuties_OK`\r\n`TestStreamDuties_OK_ChainReorg`\r\n\r\nThe solution would be to refactor tests so that the execution of these tests will not be affected by whatever the current time is. \r\n\r\ncc @maxkaneco",
