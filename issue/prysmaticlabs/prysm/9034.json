If it seems viable to cross compile for s390x, then we could add this to our list of supported architectures in the future. However, this feature would rely heavily on external contributors as the core team has limited bandwidth to support this functionality in the near future. ",

I understand it'll be slow, but I want to get a rough idea of order of magnitude perf degradation in the absence of optimized BLST. We'll be pursuing that path in parallel, but wanted to get a functional build working on the platform.",

    "body": "@e-desouza https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/8710 removed the alternative library for BLS. You could revert this PR and continue to use Herumi's BLS library, which may or may not support s390x. It also has some architecture specific functionality so it may not satisfy your use case.  At one point, we used https://github.com/phoreproject/bls as a pure go bls implementation. I am not sure if it is up to spec anymore, but you could consider forking prysm and adding this as an alternative bls implementation. If spec tests pass, then you should be good to go.",
