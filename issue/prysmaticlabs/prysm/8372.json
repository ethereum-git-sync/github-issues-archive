    "body": "@skillful-alex - The option of looking up beaconcha.in or beaconscan.com for that matter is that you need to hover with your mouse over every day, _memorize_ the 8 digits after the 0.0 (since you can't copy a tool tip) and _type that manually_ in to a spreadsheet. \r\nIf you have several validators, thats a really annoying and unreliable process. \r\n\r\nDo you know any way of extracting that from the html page somehow?\r\nI have also made the request to the Beaconcha.in guys to have an 'export' button above the daily income chart, but not clear when that will be available, and I know Rotki are planning to role out their solution at some point. Either way, always best to have the output directly from the source (the actual validator client) - less room for error.\r\n\r\nRe your second point - I don't think the tax authorities care if you report based on UTC or UTC+whatever, as long as all income is accounted for on a daily basis. Actually, some tax advisers say weekly might be fine, but no one really knows yet and they can make up the rules as they go, so 'daily' makes sense as the most granular report they could ever require.",
