  "body": "Hi all,\r\n\r\nCurrently our powchain service reads all historical logs from the deposit contract from ETH1.0. As the contract grows even more, we should be persisting the last requested block number for logs to disk in the powchain service to avoid looping through all of these logs every time the node is launched. a PR for this would store the last requested ETH1.0 block number for log fetching in BoltDB. Next time the node spins up, we can request logs started from this block number + 1. Thanks @nisdas for bringing this up.",
