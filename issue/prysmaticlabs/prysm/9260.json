Some changes introduced\r\nin #9072 have unfortunately broken the usage of it. \r\n\r\n### Has this worked before in a previous version?\r\n\r\nYes before this PR:\r\n#9072  \r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n```\r\nprysm.bat beacon-chain\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Error\r\n\r\n```\r\nC:\\Prysm>prysm.bat beacon-chain --datadir=C:\\prysm --http-web3provider=xxxxx\r\nA subdirectory or file C:\\Prysm\\dist already exists.\r\nLatest prysm release is v1.4.2.\r\nUsing prysm version v1.4.2.\r\n( was unexpected at this time.\r\nC:\\Prysm>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Operating System:**\r\n\r\nWindows\r\n\r\n**What version of Prysm are you running? (Which release)**\r\n\r\nv1.4.1 ( This is also observed on v1.4.2).\r\n\r\n## Workaround\r\nFor any other windows users running into this issue, the workaround is to use the bat script from here:\r\nhttps://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/fc898d541fdc13faf5be5221833f9a8e904538ee/prysm.bat\r\n\r\nThis will work the same way as before.\r\n\r\n",
