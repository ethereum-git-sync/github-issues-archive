The validator has a `--beacon-rpc-provider` flag, which is a comma-separated value of beacon node endpoints, passed to grpc Dial. As part of service construction, we can parse this value to see if it contains multiple endpoints, in which case `sync_eth2_fallback_configured` should be true. We would also like to determine if we have been able to connect to this endpoint to determine the value for `sync_eth2_fallback_connected`.\r\n\r\nre `sync_eth2_fallback_connected`, the spirit of the client-stats spec is likely to detect when we have failed over to the non \"primary\" node. In our case, grpc will create a load balancer to send requests to all configured nodes, so we need to decide how to interpret this metric, considering that users may expect a true value to mean that something has gone wrong with the primary. \r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nAdd `sync_eth2_fallback_configured` to validator metrics. Also ideally add `sync_eth2_fallback_connected` after clarifying how it should work.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered",
