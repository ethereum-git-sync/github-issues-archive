I don't understand what this means, because on this code path the Lighthouse VC is definitely hitting the `/eth/v2/beacon/blocks` endpoint. Is this the result of a misconfiguration where the Prysm BN wants to use a builder, and therefore can't build local blocks? Or is this likely related to the recent Geth block-building bug?\n\n### Has this worked before in a previous version?\n\n_No response_\n\n### ðŸ”¬ Minimal Reproduction\n\n_No response_\n\n### Error\n\n_No response_\n\n### Platform(s)\n\n_No response_\n\n### What version of Prysm are you running?
