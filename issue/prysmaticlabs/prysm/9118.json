However, we have removed the ability to recover validator databases from a backup due to some fundamental issues. Are you still in need of this? As an alternative, you could turn off your validator for a while (at least several epochs) and then start again from a fresh database without much risk at the moment. Please let me know if you want to discuss this further in our Discord https://discord.gg/ctcNp6PU",
