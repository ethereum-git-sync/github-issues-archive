  "body": "# üêû Bug Report\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe prysm client occasionally misses attestations for slots due to grpc deadline for making the attestations passing before it's able to make the attestations.  It errors out with `Could not request attestation to sign at slot` when it does this.\r\n\r\nAs the number of keys that the validator client is attesting for goes up, the probability of this happening also seems to rise, since the deadline is fixed at 12 seconds for retrieving proposals and attestations and the amount of work to do appears to linearly scale with the amount of keys attesting.  Resource usage for the validator and for the beacon chain remain fairly low (compared to the available resources), so it doesn't seem to be a resource starvation issue.\r\n\r\n### Has this worked before in a previous version?\r\n\r\nThis behavior has been observed in previous versions, but it was only recently that it became apparent it was directly related to the number of attesting validators.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nThe beacon chain and validator are run separately from each other, with the validator talking to a remote keymanager.\r\n\r\nBeacon chain\r\n```\r\nbeacon-chain\r\n  --accept-terms-of-use\r\n  --datadir /data\r\n  --rpc-host 0.0.0.0\r\n  --rpc-port 4000\r\n  --grpc-gateway-host 0.0.0.0\r\n  --grpc-gateway-port 4001\r\n  --block-batch-limit=512\r\n  --tls-cert certfile.crt\r\n  --tls-key keyfile.crt\r\n  --http-web3provider=$WEB3_PROVIDER\r\n```\r\n\r\nValidator\r\n```\r\nvalidator \r\n  --accept-terms-of-use\r\n  --wallet-dir=/home/prysm/\r\n  --beacon-rpc-provider $BEACON_DNS:4000\r\n  --tls-cert certfile.crt\r\n  --verbosity debug\r\n  --wallet-password-file file.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe validator is also running using a remote keymanager.\r\n\r\n## üî• Error\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\ntime=\"2020-12-07 15:57:11\" level=debug msg=\"Set deadline for proposals and attestations\" deadline=2020-12-07 15:57:23 +0000 UTC prefix=validator slot=TARGET_SLOT\r\ntime=\"2020-12-07 15:57:13\" level=debug msg=\"gRPC request finished.\" backend=[] duration=1.864267969s method=\"/ethereum.eth.v1alpha1.BeaconNodeValidator/GetDuties\"\r\ntime=\"2020-12-07 15:57:13\" level=info msg=\"Attestation schedule\" attesters=2 prefix=validator pubKeys=[0xKEY1 0xKEY2] slot=TARGET_SLOT\r\n...\r\ntime=\"2020-12-07 15:57:13\" level=info msg=\"Attestation schedule\" attesters=... prefix=validator pubKeys=[...] slot=...\r\ntime=\"2020-12-07 15:57:13\" level=info msg=\"Attestation schedule\" attesters=... prefix=validator pubKeys=[...] slot=...\r\ntime=\"2020-12-07 15:57:13\" level=info msg=\"Attestation schedule\" attesters=... prefix=validator pubKeys=[...] slot=...\r\ntime=\"2020-12-07 15:57:13\" level=info msg=\"Attestation schedule\" attesters=... prefix=validator pubKeys=[...] slot=...\r\ntime=\"2020-12-07 15:57:20\" level=debug msg=\"gRPC request finished.\" backend=[] duration=88.037671ms method=\"/ethereum.eth.v1alpha1.BeaconNodeValidator/GetDuties\"\r\ntime=\"2020-12-07 15:57:20\" level=debug msg=\"gRPC request finished.\" backend=[] duration=624.1¬µs method=\"/ethereum.eth.v1alpha1.BeaconNodeValidator/DomainData\"\r\ntime=\"2020-12-07 15:57:26\" level=debug msg=\"gRPC request finished.\" backend=[] duration=895.563¬µs method=\"/ethereum.eth.v1alpha1.BeaconNodeValidator/SubscribeCommitteeSubnets\"\r\ntime=\"2020-12-07 15:57:26\" level=debug msg=\"gRPC request finished.\" backend=[] duration=38.785¬µs method=\"/ethereum.eth.v1alpha1.BeaconNodeValidator/GetAttestationData\"\r\ntime=\"2020-12-07 15:57:26\" level=error msg=\"Could not request attestation to sign at slot\" error=\"rpc error: code = DeadlineExceeded desc = context deadline exceeded\" prefix=validator pubKey=0xKEY1 slot=TARGET_SLOT\r\ntime=\"2020-12-07 15:57:26\" level=debug msg=\"gRPC request finished.\" backend=[] duration=42.394¬µs method=\"/ethereum.eth.v1alpha1.BeaconNodeValidator/GetAttestationData\"\r\ntime=\"2020-12-07 15:57:26\" level=error msg=\"Could not request attestation to sign at slot\" error=\"rpc error: code = DeadlineExceeded desc = context deadline exceeded\" prefix=validator pubKey=0xKEY2 slot=TARGET_SLOT\r\ntime=\"2020-12-07 15:57:26\" level=error msg=\"Could not sign slot: rpc error: code = DeadlineExceeded desc = context deadline exceeded\" prefix=validator\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Operating System:**\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n  <code>\r\nUbuntu 18.04\r\n  </code>\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n**What version of Prysm are you running?

I'm also thinking that #8023 might not have resolved your issue, based on the logs provided in the original issue. \r\n\r\nSomething seems off about the timestamps in the logs.
