I was getting errors for blocks that were well into the past so I think the beacon is incorrectly identifying blocks as being in the future.\r\nIt could be that the beacon is getting the time from the wrong place due to the following:\r\n- The stdout timestamps are one hour behind.\r\n- Here in the UK we are in daylight saving and clocks have been put forward one hour.\r\n- My system is clock is synced via windows and correctly set to daylight saving time.",

I think the daylight saving may or may not be causing a problem so let's ignore in the meantime.\r\n\r\nWhat I can tell you is that that using https://www.timeanddate.com/ I can see that my system time is within a second of the real time and time.is says my time is exact So I don't understand why the beacon is seeing a 12 second difference.  My system has spare CPU, memory and network resource so it shouldn't be a resource bottleneck.  \r\n\r\nIt could well be something not right with my system, it's running the latest version of windows 10.  \r\n\r\nI don't know enough to understand how the beacon processes blocks and what you mean by the difference in slots is 20?

So if you get these blocks, unless\r\nyou see this happening very often you shouldnt have to worry. When I say difference in slots I am mostly referring to block time, here.

If a block arrives _before_ our determined slot start time, it is considered \"from the future\" and should not be processed. \r\n\r\nThere is a small acceptance/tolerance for blocks that arrive early, but a block that arrives 12 seconds early is not acceptable. \r\n\r\nThe root of the problem is either:\r\n- Your system time is skewed (this is obvious if you see this warning very often)\r\n- The block producer's clock was off and they produced the block too early (if you see a 1 off warning, this is more likely).",
