Etherscan seems to experience the same issue. I believe that the prometheus metrics are accurate while the API reported values are higher than they should be. Perhaps not capturing the entire validator set for participation consideration?\r\n\r\nAdding to v0.12 restart milestone as this should be addressed prior to any testnet restart. \r\n\r\n",

I cross checked the implementations between metrics, rpc server side implementation and client side implementation, and they all seem correct.\r\n\r\nThe next thing to check is when client calls `GetValidatorParticipation(epoch uint64)` and what epoch does it pass in.  For the metrics, it captures right before processing of the first epoch slot, and it captures the participation of previous epoch. Example, before when processing slot 128, it captures participations of slot 64 -> slot 96",

I noticed that the graphs on beaconcha.in have been resolved since Danny's comment. Was there a potential issue in Prysm's endpoints that you noticed?",
