  "body": "Hi all,\r\n\r\nAs part of the [Ruby Release one-pager](https://docs.google.com/document/d/125ajrN-0cKGwAMlv_bi02MKzGUxMDC_TeDvHCpqAKAs/edit#), we discussed introducing a third actor in addition to Proposers and Notaries. We refer to this actor as a **Simulator** and will be one of the three options for launching the sharding client. \r\n\r\nFor the Ruby Release, If a node joins as a simulator, its only responsibility will be to **generate random transactions at various intervals and broadcast them to peers in the network**.\r\n\r\nWork on this generator has already been done via #171, and we would want its core logic to live in the `simulator` package as a goroutine that the **Simulator** actor runs in its main event loop. Currently, this generation of transactions is done as a service in a sharding node, but we want it to be a standalone actor (a standalone sharding client) that can be launched via a CLI flag similar to how we call `geth sharding --actor notary` or `geth sharding --actor proposer`.\r\n\r\nAssigning provisionally to @terenc3t.\r\n",
