  "body": "Possibly a bug with finding subnet peers, looking for clarification.\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\nJust browsing code, and noticed that [`connectWithPeer`](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/7a96412ef2fddd7aa03a2f2841a892c30d00034f/beacon-chain/p2p/service.go#L405) just returns nil without doing anything when the peer is bad. Although this seems like reasonable behavior, the callers expect a connection.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe [`FindPeersWithSubnet`](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/18b3203f31eb8e453bb13bff18a9a9e6e6cb64fa/beacon-chain/p2p/subnets.go#L24) function expects the `connectWithPeer` to actually connect, and sets `exists` to true, even though there won't be a connection to a bad peer.\r\n\r\n",
