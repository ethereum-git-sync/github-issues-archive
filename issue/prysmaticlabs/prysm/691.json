  "body": "Hi all,\r\n\r\nCurrently, we get a bug in travis related to the use of protobufs in the shared/p2p package as seen [here](https://travis-ci.org/prysmaticlabs/prysm/jobs/444511336). @prestonvanloon suggested disabling global proto imports but it looks like some refactoring will need to be done to get the shared/p2p/service_test.go disabled tests to pass once again. Opening this as a tracking issue.",
