(as one may import launchpad keys).  During interaction w/ the program, create the wallet [direct] with Password A and in default dir\r\n2) accounts-v2 list   ---> works as expected\r\n3) wallet-v2 create HD (DERIVED) type wallet in default directory w/ Password B\r\n----After this point, behavior is as if Direct (pass A) wallet no longer exists\r\n4) accounts-v2 create --> Input Password A (direct pass) -> Fail w/ \"Could not create new account: wrong wallet password entered\"\r\n5) try 4 again with Password B (derived) --> success\r\n6) accounts-v2 list, fails with A, good with B but only show's B (HD) account, no mention of Direct account\r\n7) run the validator, only password B works (A fails w/ \"could not read keymanager for wallet: could not initialize derived keymanager: could not decrypt seed configuration with password: invalid checksum\").\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nSee above\r\n\r\n### Has this worked before in a previous version?\r\n\r\nComplex set of steps, unclear what variety may have worked before.  Sorry\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nSee above\r\n\r\n## üî• Error\r\n\r\nSee above\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\nUbuntu VM running Docker\r\n\r\n**What version of Prysm are you running?
