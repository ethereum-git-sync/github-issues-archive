  "body": "From antithesis\r\n```\r\nIn a recent dencun-devnet-8 experiment we found that with `GetPayloadV3` nethermind provides an invalid block (I think it becomes invalid because of a reorg). Nethermind then seals a new block, however the invalid block that was sealed previously is provided by GetPayloadV3 and not the most recently sealed block. The prysm beacon node then broadcasts the invalid block before validating it. \r\n\r\nThis seems very odd to me.\r\n\r\n```",
