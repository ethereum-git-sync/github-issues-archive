  "body": "Currently we run into an issue when syncing when if a node does not have a parent block when processing, it will fail and its chain will never advance. Instead, we should request parent blocks from peers. @nisdas outlined the following as a solution:\r\n\r\n- Request for block by hash, \r\n- Once we receive it we check again for its parent, we can recursively do this until maybe a limit of 10 blocks or something.\r\n- If we have like 10 blocks missing that means something is deeply wrong,\r\n- Have an in-memory map of blocks similar to initial-sync\r\n- We can use that to store any blocks that cannot be processed yet \r\n- Add in a new field in the regular sync struct, currentHead \r\n- using this we can pre-check received blocks, if the block is more than 1 slot ahead then we keep it in the map, we can keep requesting for parent blocks until we get one that has is 1 slot ahead from the currentHead",

    "body": "This actually isn't implemented recursively. Here are my notes:\r\n\r\nIn the case that we receive a block where we haven’t see the parent yet, we put this block into a map. As soon as it’s parent comes in, we process both blocks. One potential issue is that if we haven’t seen the block of the parent’s parent, then we could be creating issues. \r\n\r\nGiven the example below. We have a blockchain from A as the genesis to D as the head of the chain as we know it. Someone on the network sends us a block H which has a parent G. We haven’t seen G yet so we put H in the map. When someone sends us G, we process both blocks whether or not we have a connecting chain between D and G. In this scenario we are missing blocks E & F. \r\n\r\n![graphviz (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7246818/54698752-37d36a80-4b06-11e9-9d1c-316569ad085a.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nUnsure about the current side effects of this potential issue, but it likely would lead to the receiving beacon node fail to advance their state be requesting parent blocks from the network. The appropriate action would be to recursively process new blocks in the following logic:\r\n\r\n![graphviz (5)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7246818/54698765-3d30b500-4b06-11e9-8c0a-38d05f8d94a7.png)\r\n",
