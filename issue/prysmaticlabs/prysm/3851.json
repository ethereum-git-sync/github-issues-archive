  "body": "Following on #3849, @paulhauner brought up an interesting case where in the case of a changed fork version in the case of hardforks, this would lead to valid deposits being rejected. Due to failing signature verification. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/9bf55e53e70bfda50cc82ef460a1470d89b90e54/beacon-chain/core/blocks/block_operations.go#L966-L972. \r\n\r\nAlthough currently for our testnet we only stick to one fork version, in mainnet the fork version would be incremented each time there is a hardfork. \r\n\r\nThis would be problematic in the case of processing deposit logs from the eth1chain. For example when processing a deposit log whose deposit references a fork version of \r\n```go\r\n[]byte{0,0,0,0}\r\n```\r\nbut the current fork version in the state would be \r\n```go\r\n[]byte{0,0,0,1}\r\n```\r\nSo using the current fork version, signature verification of the deposit would fail. We would need to find a way to co-ordinate processing of deposit logs according to the appropriate fork version. This issue is part of a bigger conversation of how to co-ordinate hard forks in prysm.

    "body": "below is the spec's definition of `get_domain`.\r\n```py\r\ndef get_domain(state: BeaconState,\r\n               domain_type: int,\r\n               message_epoch: Epoch=None) -> int:\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    Return the signature domain (fork version concatenated with domain type) of a message.\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    epoch = get_current_epoch(state) if message_epoch is None else message_epoch\r\n    fork_version = state.fork.previous_version if epoch < state.fork.epoch else state.fork.current_version\r\n```\r\nA different fork version in the state will lead to a different domain, which when verifying a signature for a deposit( which was made with an old fork version) will lead to the verification failing. \r\n\r\nSo when starting up the beacon node, and processing all the deposit logs from the deposit contract, we have to take into mind what the fork version was in the state when the deposit was made, otherwise that deposit will fail verification. \r\n\r\nThis isnt so much of an issue with the spec, more of how we currently process deposits. When processing a deposit log, we extract the deposit data convert it into a deposit object and then run it through `ProcessDeposit` https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/9bf55e53e70bfda50cc82ef460a1470d89b90e54/beacon-chain/core/blocks/block_operations.go#L957 . If it passes the processing we then can proceed with keeping the deposit in our `pending_deposits` pool , from which proposers can then package them into blocks. ",
