  "body": "Currently, we're unable to build for other OS / architecture whenever the binary target depends on a cgo library. This includes any dependency on go-ethereum in the beacon-chain and potentially a future BLS library. \r\n\r\nTo reproduce the issue, try building the beacon chain with a different toolchain specified. \r\n\r\nBuilding in on linux targeting windows:\r\n```\r\nbazel build --platforms=@io_bazel_rules_go//go/toolchain:windows_amd64 //beacon-chain\r\n```\r\n\r\nBuilding on linux amd64 targeting arm64. \r\n```\r\nbazel build --platforms=@io_bazel_rules_go//go/toolchain:linux_arm64 //beacon-chain\r\n```\r\n\r\nImportant caveats:\r\n- We're using a [fork of go-ethereum](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/bazel-go-ethereum) which has the generated BUILD files to support bazel.\r\n- Removing cgo dependencies are not an option as we expect to have more cgo dependencies in the future. Pure go builds would be nice and we'd have support for windows / ARM from linux today if that were the case!\r\n- We must support linux -> [darwin_amd64, arm64, windows_amd64] targets. When you're writing cc toolchains, adding Mac OS as the host is optional, but appreciated (expect a bounty tip if Mac OS as host is supported!). \r\n- This is a pretty involved task. If you are up to taking it on, you'll be mostly on your own to figure it out. Good luck :)\r\n\r\nThese blocked issues may have some additional context from previous attempts to resolve this.\r\n\r\nBlocking #654\r\nBlocking #2546 ",

The net result should be that any host execution with x86_64 architecture should be able to cross compile for windows_x86-64 and linux_arm64 targets.\n**2) [thecydonian](https://gitcoin.co/thecydonian) has applied to start work _(Funders only: [approve worker](https://gitcoin.co/issue/prysmaticlabs/prysm/2849/3206?mutate_worker_action=approve&worker=thecydonian) | [reject worker](https://gitcoin.co/issue/prysmaticlabs/prysm/2849/3206?mutate_worker_action=reject&worker=thecydonian))_.**\n\nI will first familiarize myself with the existing code, then I will research solutions to the problem. This seems potentially challenging, but I am willing to take it on, and I will not give up easily. If I am able to solve this, I will be sure to do so for MacOS as well.\n\nI will make sure to keep you consistantly updated on my progress, and should be able to make signifigant progress over the weekend.\n\nIn the unlikely case that I do fail at fixing this issue. I will produce a write up with everything I found out while trying to do this bounty.

    "body": "Update: @SuburbanDad's PR meets all of the requirements of the bounty. In PR review, I asked if we could make use of bazel's remote build execution and/or docker sandbox. Over a few days of offline discussion, @SuburbanDad and I were able to connect the plumbing from PR #4945 into the bazel RBE and bazel docker sandbox functionality for cross compile.\r\n\r\nSo far, we are able to cross compile and confirm the following:\r\n\r\n| target  | linux_amd64 | linux_arm64 | osx_amd64 | windows_amd64 |\r\n|----------|-------------------|------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|\r\n| `//beacon-chain` | :heavy_check_mark:  docker-sandbox and RBE, libkafka supported locally only | :heavy_check_mark:  docker-sandbox and RBE, no libkafka support | :heavy_check_mark:  docker-sandbox, no libkafka support | :heavy_check_mark:  docker-sandbox, no libkafka support |\r\n| `//validator`| :heavy_check_mark:  docker-sandbox and RBE | :heavy_check_mark: docker-sandbox and RBE | :heavy_check_mark:  docker-sandbox | :x:  Doesn't work. #5008 |\r\n\r\n@SuburbanDad and I will work together to merge our changes into PR #4945 by the end of the week.This will enable us to leverage RBE in our continuous integration and more importantly provide signed executable binaries for each tagged release of Prysm's beacon-node and validator targets. :tada: ",
