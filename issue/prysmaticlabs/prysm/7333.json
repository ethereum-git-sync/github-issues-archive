Being able to easily \"lock it down\" inside a container to those paths it needs would be a boon to security.\r\n\r\n## What is AppArmor?\r\n\r\nSee https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/apparmor/ . AppArmor security profiles define what can and cannot be done inside a container, specific to the application running within. The profile is loaded for the container by docker. AppArmor helps secure applications against threats.\r\n\r\n## For good\r\n\r\nContainerization is more than a consistent build environment: Done right, it can be a security boon. Help me build secure-by-default containers by providing an AppArmor profile for your application.\r\n\r\n## Bonus credit\r\n\r\nDo beacon, validator and slasher need different things from the OS? If so, custom AppArmor profiles for each one could even be a thing. But, start with one profile for all three.",
