  "body": "# ðŸš€ Feature Request\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nPlease add a `--mainnet` flag to Prysm beacon and validator (and slasher).\r\n\r\nRationale: I am using docker tooling that uses `--${NETWORK}` to work with mainnet as well as test nets. This tooling will be easier if it works the same way for main as well as test, without needing to special-case Prysm. \r\n\r\n`mainnet` is used by eth2.0-deposit-cli as the string to indicate main net, and hopefully other clients will adopt that string for their `--network` options. \r\n",

    "body": "After discussion on Discord, rationale for this change: Not having the flag makes my tooling more difficult, having it makes it easier.\r\n\r\nWithout the flag works, it's just extra steps. So instead of NETWORK= and then either medalla or mainnet, I'll need to duplicate prysm-base and have a prysm-base-main and prysm-base-test yml, because the docker-compose entrypoint right now assumes it can specify ${NETWORK}.\r\n\r\nI can work around it. I'd love it if I didn't have to.\r\n",
