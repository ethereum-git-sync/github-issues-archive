Run the beacon node with \"only\" the http parameter. That is causing the above (looping) error. Adding the ws-parameter is not possible. Nethermind does not support websocket subscriptions. So activating parameter --web3provider (ws) gives the following error messages (both in Nethermind and in beacon-node):\r\n![2020-05-12_11-35-23](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28559038/81674116-fcec6e80-944c-11ea-8af8-f133092fdaa5.png)\r\n\r\nSo leaving the ws-parameter out:\r\n-local_node=>http \r\n-goerli.prylabs.net=>ws \r\nThis is causing the RPC loops.\r\nFrom a user perspective: there is no error/warning message in the beacon that setting only one parameter is actually not possible.\r\n\r\n<!--Please let us know how we can reproduce this issue.

    "body": "For context, my recommendation to not use `eth_subscribe` comes from the fact that its design makes it susceptible to unrecoverable faults.  Augur ran into a ton of trouble with this during its development and I eventually wrote https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-blockstream/ for them to deal with it, which doesn't use `eth_subscribe` at all.\r\n\r\nThe short version of the problem is that if you assume the backend node can disappear at any moment (and then come back later, or you get load balanced to a different node), you cannot rely on witnessing every block/log addition and removal necessary to correctly maintain whatever client-side chain state you are maintaining.  The library linked above solves this by maintaining a some number of blocks in-memory client-side, and making sure that it always has a clear chain forward and backwards (during a reorg) before notifying the client of an addition/removal.  If you just use `eth_subscribe` to get your block/log notifications, you may miss an addition, or miss a removal, which can lead to client-side sync issues.\r\n\r\nI don't know anything about this project, but I *do* recommend against anyone using `eth_subscribe` for anything other than toy projects.  For real stuff you really need chain history to be reconciled within the app's failure domain, or you need a much more robust system for maintaining synchronization with a backing node than `eth_subscribe` offers.\r\n\r\nFWIW: This came up because Augur used Infura as its backend early on and when you talk to Infura you aren't talking to a single Ethereum node, you are talking to a load balancer that is backed by many nodes.  These nodes *may* be out of sync with each other, which makes the \"missed notification\" problem actually pretty common.  However, even if you are using a single backing Ethereum node, the missed notifications can occur if that node has an outage (even a very brief one).",

    "body": "Looking at our code and what we have in our `powchain` package, it might not be too much work to sunset websockets and `eth_subscribe` from our codebase. We only have 1 method that uses it. Although whether we choose to use a subscription based method or instead a polling approach, both methods will require us to have some sort of client synchronization logic on our end to handle missing blocks and logs we receive from the eth1 chain along with any accompanying re-orgs.\r\n\r\nWhat we have now is a bit handwavy, where we basically look at the current head block , and request all logs from `Head - N` . This is usually fine if `N` is a large enough number as goerli rarely ever has deep re-rorgs and it is even more unlikely on the mainchain. Although the spec does do the same thing, one of my goals this quarter was to have something more robust for reconcilling the eth1 state of our deposit contract. We do try request any missing blocks and logs in the event they are missing, however dealing with eth1 re-orgs is a bit more difficult. This change could be bundled into it, and I do not think it would be too much extra work.\r\n\r\n@prysmaticlabs/core-team what do you guys think ?",
