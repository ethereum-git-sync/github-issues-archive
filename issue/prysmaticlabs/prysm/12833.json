Please launch one to follow the chain! `\r\n\r\nafter that, I created my config file for Beacon chain and created the genesis file using this command:\r\n> ./prysmctl testnet generate-genesis --num-validators=1 --output-ssz=genesis.ssz --chain-config-file=config.yml --override-eth1data=true\r\n\r\nthen I ran my beacon chain and validator chain. becon chain is connected with validator and poa chain for some reason i am getting this error on my beacon chain logs\r\n`[2023-08-31 15:11:37]  WARN rpc/validator: Not connected to ETH1. Cannot determine validator ETH1 deposit block number`\r\n\r\none more thing to add i couldn't understand where the public keys are coming when i run the command:\r\n> ./validator --datadir=validatordata --accept-terms-of-use --interop-num-validators=1 --interop-start-index=0 --force-clear-db --chain-config-file=config.yml --config-file=config.yml\r\n\r\nis it like randomly creating those public keys?",
