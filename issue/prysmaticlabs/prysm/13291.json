Is there any reason for such high resource consumption?\r\n\r\n### Has this worked before in a previous version?\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### ðŸ”¬ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Error\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Platform(s)\r\n\r\nMac (Apple Silicon)\r\n\r\n### What version of Prysm are you running?
