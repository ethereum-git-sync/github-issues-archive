  "body": "Your `go.mod` file has 3 `replace` statements (https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/develop/go.mod#L261). These are kind of no-nos as they are ignored by downstream packages depending on prysm. In downstream cases, Go will just ignore them and us whatever's in the main `require` section. IMHO you should fix this since building prysm and depending on it will build differently.\r\n\r\nThat said, this issue is actually about a worse thing, the version of `github.com/MariusVanDerWijden/tx-fuzz` was replaced to `v0.0.0-00010101000000-000000000000` when adding the replace for it (https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/develop/go.mod#L8). This means that all downstream packages will ignore the `replace` and will try to pull `v0.0.0-00010101000000-000000000000` and fail.\r\n\r\nYou can see that currently on the `methodical-ssz` package if you were to list the deps:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ go list -m -json -mod=mod all\r\ngo: github.com/MariusVanDerWijden/tx-fuzz@v0.0.0-00010101000000-000000000000: invalid version: unknown revision 000000000000\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe best option would be to get rid of replace statements altogether in the repo. If that's not viable, please restore the proper existing version of Marius' tx-fuzz instread of this placeholder 0 version.",
