    "body": "Hey @dnkolegov ,\r\n\r\nthe latter method expects a decompressed public key, and given that we perform key validation during decompression we do not repeat it again. \r\nhttps://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/develop/shared/bls/blst/public_key.go#L100\r\n\r\nCurrently there is only 1 method through which decompression and validation is performed:\r\nhttps://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/develop/shared/bls/blst/public_key.go#L29\r\n\r\nSo any `PublicKey` object being used has also been validated beforehand. For what its worth the latter method is \r\nonly used in a test over here:\r\nhttps://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/develop/shared/bls/blst/public_key_test.go#L75\r\n",
