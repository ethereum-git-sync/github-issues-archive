Post release, we received multiple reports the outbound traffic **quadrupled** in certain situations for nodes then we root caused down to to the large increases in `attestion_aggregate_proof` re-propagation\r\n\r\nWorth noting that Prysm may be the only client with re-propagation enabled, some other clients implementations are still in PR mode: [lighthouse's pr](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/2750)\r\n\r\nOpening this PR to document further findings, resolutions... etc\r\n\r\n",
