  "body": "# 🐞 Bug Report\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAbout a week ago I started having trouble keeping my beacon-chain running reliably. Nothing appreciable has changed on my end since the issue started occurring, but if https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/issues/9070 is related then perhaps it is a recent regression in prysm.\r\n\r\nI've tried disabling Windows Defender entirely as well as restarting my machine.\r\n\r\n### Has this worked before in a previous version?\r\n\r\nI've been running two nodes since genesis without issue. I was not having issues with 1.3.10\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n\r\n` ./prysm beacon-chain --http-web3provider=http://127.0.0.1:8545/`\r\n` ./prysm validator --wallet-dir=C:\\Users\\MeoMedia\\Desktop\\ethereum\\wallets\\prysm-wallet-v2`\r\n\r\n*wait a few hours* and when I check powershell everything has crashed.\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Error\r\n\r\nHere's what I see in powershell. It continues on for quite some time, but a brief scan didn't seem like the additional info was relevant. If there's a log file on my machine I'm not sure where to find it just yet.\r\n\r\nhttps://pastebin.com/hesC9vgG\r\n\r\n**Updated**\r\nhttps://controlc.com/8dcff677\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\nI'm running Windows 10 x64 on a fully up-to-date machine. 2tb nvme SSD which isn't under load. 20GB ram, using about 70% of it. 1080ti not under load.\r\n\r\n**What version of Prysm are you running? (Which release)**\r\n\r\nPS C:\\Users\\MeoMedia\\desktop\\ethereum\\prysm> ./prysm beacon-chain --version\r\nA subdirectory or file C:\\Users\\MeoMedia\\Desktop\\ethereum\\prysm\\dist already exists.\r\nLatest prysm release is v1.3.11.\r\nUsing prysm version v1.3.11.\r\n'Beacon' is not recognized as an internal or external command,\r\noperable program or batch file.\r\nWARN GPG verification is not natively available on Windows.\r\nWARN Skipping integrity verification of downloaded binary\r\nVerifying binary authenticity with SHA256 Hash.\r\nSHA256 Hash Match\r\nStarting Prysm beacon-chain --version\r\nbeacon-chain version Prysm/v1.3.11/9fd5575f65ae6f238462ead00ce4f0b16cd0370c. Built at: 2021-06-16 16:24:20+00:00\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant (validator index / public key)?**\r\n\r\nhttps://beaconscan.com/main/validator/0x8bfd0c40f3fcbc57a690893ddbf82de1100413df89a702057050cd8ef55ad07ce7104caa63877d59088e33aeb3494bac",

I restart it, and now it's been running smooth for over a day. Yesterday had perfect uptime for the first time in 30 days. no change on my part beyond installing latest and turning everything off/on once more. Windows Defender is off via reg edit still.",

    "body": "@rauljordan Yup. I haven't been actively debugging it, though. Last weekend I worked up the motivation to make another attempt. I wiped the folder I was using for storage of data, created a new folder, installed the latest prysm + geth, did a full redownload of blockchain data, and issue continues to repro. I don't have windows firewall or defender enabled.\r\n\r\nhttps://beaconscan.com/main/validator/0x8bfd0c40f3fcbc57a690893ddbf82de1100413df89a702057050cd8ef55ad07ce7104caa63877d59088e33aeb3494bac\r\n\r\nYou can see the days I made an attempt at getting it running again. It runs fine for almost a full day before it starts timing out. Then if I stop/start the prysm services - it'll work again for a day before beginning to time out.\r\n\r\nMy next debugging attempt will be one which eliminates my current ISP from the equation by running things through AWS. I suspect that will work fine but won't offer up any information as to what has happened with my local machine.",
