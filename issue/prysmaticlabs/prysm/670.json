  "body": "Instead of constructing the new state at the end of the function, we should create a copy of the state at the top of the function. The advantage is that we're free to modify the new object in place, which should be easier to maintain.\r\n\r\nWhen creating a copy, we don't have to create a deep copy of the entire state. For example, we don't have to deep copy `CrystallizedState.ShardAndCommitteesForSlots` because we don't ever edit it in place. On the other hand, we need to copy `ActiveState.RecentBlockHashes` because we'll want to edit it in place.",
