  "body": "### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nWe observed a case where the `suggested-fee-recipient` on BN /default `fee-recipient` on VC is not always taken into account at the time a beacon is restarted.\r\n\r\n### Has this worked before in a previous version?\r\n\r\nUnsure as this happens at a high scale/low occurence, it may have been present in previous versions.\r\n\r\n### ðŸ”¬ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nThe timeline is as follows:\r\n\r\n- VC is configured with an external builder and has a default `fee-recipient` set (non-null address)\r\n- corresponding BN is restarted with a non-null `suggested-fee-recipient`\r\n- VC registers to the beacon, for some reason the external builder errors so that VC/BN have to fallback to local block building\r\n- one of the validator key of the VC has to propose a block during the epoch the BN restart happens\r\n- it proposes a block with `0x000.000` as a fee-recipient\r\n\r\n#### Logs\r\n\r\nValidator (v4.0):\r\n\r\n```\r\n2024-01-11 22:46:14.923\t\r\ntime=\"2024-01-11 22:46:14\" level=info msg=\"Submitted new block\" blockRoot=0x6efd618dddbb fork=capella gasUtilized=0.9979254666666667 graffiti=\"...\" numAttestations=128 numDeposits=0 parentHash=0x2a26d72119c0 payloadHash=0x64bb1d5637a6 prefix=validator pubKey=0xae675c466327 slot=759231 txCount=33 withdrawalCount=16\r\n```\r\n\r\nBeacon (v4.2):\r\n\r\n```\r\ntime=\"2024-01-11 22:46:14\" level=info msg=\"Begin building block\" prefix=\"rpc/validator\" sinceSlotStartTime=2.308701105s slot=759231\r\ntime=\"2024-01-11 22:46:14\" level=warning msg=\"could not find tracked proposer index\" headRoot=0xacbe38c88a5f2b3607326b372317ce98ed6b431dfcfc635c3855a67f325b71f7 slot=759231 validatorIndex=560809\r\ntime=\"2024-01-11 22:46:14\" level=info msg=\"Finished building block\" prefix=\"rpc/validator\" sinceSlotStartTime=2.494683942s slot=759231 validator=560809\r\n```\r\n\r\nLooking at the code around the `could not find tracked proposer index` warning, I guess some internal cache with the validator configuration is not filled at this stage (maybe it depends on the validator having attested before?), so it defaults to a default struct with a zeroed fee-recipient.\r\n\r\n```\r\nval, tracked := vs.TrackedValidatorsCache.Validator(vIdx)\r\n        if !tracked {\r\n                logrus.WithFields(logFields).Warn(\"could not find tracked proposer index\")\r\n        }\r\n\r\n[...]\r\n\r\n                attr, err = payloadattribute.New(&enginev1.PayloadAttributesV2{\r\n                        Timestamp:             uint64(t.Unix()),\r\n                        PrevRandao:            random,\r\n                        SuggestedFeeRecipient: val.FeeRecipient[:],\r\n                        Withdrawals:           withdrawals,\r\n                })\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Error\r\n\r\nThis leads to proposing a block with a null fee-recipient, example of such a block: https://holesky.beaconcha.in/slot/759231\r\n\r\n### Platform(s)\r\n\r\nLinux (x86)\r\n\r\n### What version of Prysm are you running? (Which release)\r\n\r\nv4.2.0\r\n\r\n### Anything else relevant (validator index / public key)?\r\n\r\nThis happened twice during a restart of about 100K validators on holesky, so fairly confident I can narrow it a bit more if needed.",
