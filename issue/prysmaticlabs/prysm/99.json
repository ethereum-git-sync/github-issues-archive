  "body": "Hey all,\r\n\r\nTo proceed with the shard local state storage, I am creating this issue and a PR shortly to include a Shard interface/struct in our client package. This interface will have a lot of useful receiver methods for checking availability, interfacing with the shardDB backend, and fetching collations/headers from within a certain shard.\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n\r\nThis was worked on in Py-EVM https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/pull/570 and would also serve as a useful wrapper class to thin out the code we would otherwise have to write for notaries/proposers.\r\n\r\nIMO we need this in order to proceed, as the next steps would be to define the shardDB as perhaps a sparse merkle tree wrapped around levelDB or badgerDB.\r\n\r\nThis is being worked on in #100.",
