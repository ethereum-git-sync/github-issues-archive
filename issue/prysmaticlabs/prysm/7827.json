    "body": "Hey @prestonvanloon . This limit was put in place because certain queries can return huge amounts of data which caused instability both in our backend systems and also would force the client to deal with a huge chunk of data returned in the response. The JSON-RPC API doesn't prevent someone from asking for every event from the genesis block to the latest block which would timeout or error. Since there is no pagination in the JSON-RPC spec, our recommendation has been for devs to iterate over block ranges when requesting log data that exceeds the 10k limit. Some client libraries handle this for the user already.\r\n\r\nTechnically the ethereum clients don't limit response size like this, but we believe that they should. Some malformed getLogs queries can impact the stability of the node.",
