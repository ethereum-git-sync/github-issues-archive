  "body": "During updates to v0.11 branch, we decided to revert a few feature PRs to facilitate merging #5127 into master. This PR is tracking reintroduction of the feature, improvements, and updates from @mcdee.\r\n\r\n- [ ] #5260 \r\n- [ ] #5236 \r\n- [ ] #4984\r\n- [ ] #5249 \r\n\r\nI'll own this as a high priority item this week and work with @mcdee to ensure these changes land in master. There was some [offline discussion about rationale](https://discordapp.com/channels/476244492043812875/483017808658169866/699518531863052288) behind the reversions and ultimately we want to accept these features while unblocking everyone in development.\r\n\r\nOne of the key things that was pointed out that there exists a reimplementation of several Prysm / eth2 methods in [github.com/wealdtech/go-eth2-types](https://github.com/wealdtech/go-eth2-types) due to the organization and dependencies of a large project like Prysm. We've also heard from other downstream users (#5130) that Prysm is difficult to build upon due to it's project structure and use of patches, particularly related to ethereumapis. Given that github.com/prysmaticlabs/ethereumapis is unlikely to be [accepted as a canonical source for ethereum API definitions](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/ethereumapis/issues/91), we should reconsider our patch approach and general avoidance on ssz specific information in ethereum APIs. \r\n\r\nLastly, I would like to reevaluate Prysm's dependency management to leverage go modules to Prysm more available to downstream users. I'll follow up with a design proposal for reorganizing Prysm, its dependencies, and certain helpful types for downstream users.",

Easiest thing to do here is to open a new PR that has both sets of changes, I think.
