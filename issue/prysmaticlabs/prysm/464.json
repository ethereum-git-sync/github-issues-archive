  "body": "Hi all,\r\n\r\nCurrently, a beacon node streams the latest canonical block to gRPC validator clients each time the updateHead function runs successfully. That is, gRPC `stream.Send` is called once the fork choice rule is successfully applied and a new canonical head is determined.\r\n\r\n### What Is Wrong\r\n\r\nIf the chain is beginning however, there is no fork choice rule to apply and no way that validator clients can get the canonical head/state streamed to them. Additionally, if a validator does not connect to a node exactly when a cycle transition or head update event occurs, it will not receive the information it needs to begin acting as a proposer or attester.\r\n\r\n### How To Fix\r\n\r\nA solution is for validators upon first connecting to a beacon node to request the canonical block/state from the beacon node. From here, the validator will determine when it is its turn to propose or attest to blocks in the current cycle. Once this initial run is complete, the validator can just spin up a regular routine that receives streamed canonical blocks from the beacon node as it currently does.\r\n\r\n",
