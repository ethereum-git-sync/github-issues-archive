    "body": "With the merging of the two states, we can simplify a lot of the things in our implementation. Now  block processing only affects certain parts of the state, and with this would be a good time to also consider @rawfalafel proposal to merge in the casper package. \r\n\r\nAlthough if we do go down that path, I would rather `casper` and `state` be in their own package, the types package is meant to be a wrapper for our proto objects. Do not know if it is the best idea to bring in all the casper logic into the package. The `state` object and the casper package, will be tightly interwined, so it might be the best idea to bring them together into one package.\r\n\r\nAnother thing this would simplify would be our blockchain service routine, instead of updating both active and crystallized we can just do it with one state, it simplifies state transitions also where we had transitions for both active and crystallized and now it can be done with one go. \r\n\r\nAgree, on having a pure beacon-chain implementation without bringing in any other assumptions\r\n ",
