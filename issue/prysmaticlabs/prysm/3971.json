  "body": "Currently, `GetValidatorParticipation` in our beacon chain node API tries to calculate validator participation off of the current head state. This is improper because the head state is constantly changing, and any data regarding participation that is calculated on a changing state is useless.\r\n\r\nThis is a tracking issue to ensure this endpoint is modified to calculate participation from the previous epoch, rather than the current head. This will make the validator participation API fit its purpose in a much more useful and reliable manner. ",
