  "body": "The current validator design is rather simple for a single private key: the validator requests assignments, waits for slot to perform task, then performs the appropriate task. In order to optimize resources for a testnet deployment, we could enable a validator to perform tasks for multiple signing keys.\r\n\r\n## proto/beacon/rpc/v1/services.proto\r\n\r\nThe validator RPC service must be updated to support assignment requests for multiple public keys.\r\n\r\n```protobuf\r\n\r\n service ValidatorService {\r\n     rpc WaitForActivation(ValidatorActivationRequest) returns (stream ValidatorActivationResponse);\r\n     rpc ValidatorIndex(ValidatorIndexRequest) returns (ValidatorIndexResponse);\r\n-    rpc CommitteeAssignment(ValidatorEpochAssignmentsRequest) returns (CommitteeAssignmentResponse);\r\n+    rpc CommitteeAssignment(CommitteeAssignmentsRequest) returns (CommitteeAssignmentResponse);\r\n     rpc ValidatorStatus(ValidatorIndexRequest) returns (ValidatorStatusResponse);\r\n }\r\n\r\n-message ValidatorEpochAssignmentsRequest {\r\n+message CommitteeAssignmentRequest {\r\n    uint64 epoch_start = 1;\r\n-    bytes public_key = 2;\r\n+    repeated bytes public_key = 2;\r\n}\r\n\r\nmessage CommitteeAssignmentResponse {\r\n-    repeated uint64 committee = 1;\r\n-    uint64 shard = 2;\r\n-    uint64 slot = 3;\r\n-    bool is_proposer = 4;\r\n+    repeated CommitteeAssignment assignment = 1;\r\n+\r\n+    message CommitteeAssignment {\r\n+      repeated uint64 committee = 1;\r\n+      uint64 shard = 2;\r\n+      uint64 slot = 3;\r\n+      bool is_proposer = 4;\r\n+      bytes public_key = 5;\r\n+      ValidatorStatus status = 6;\r\n+   }\r\n }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample request:\r\n```pbtxt\r\nepoch_start: 960\r\npublic_key: pk1\r\npublic_key: pk2\r\npublic_key: pk3\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample response\r\n```pbtxt\r\nassignment {\r\n  committee: 16\r\n  committee: 17\r\n  shard: 143\r\n  slot: 963\r\n  is_proposer: true\r\n  public_key: pk1\r\n  status: ACTIVE\r\n}\r\nassignment {\r\n   public_key: pk2\r\n   status: PENDING_ACTIVE \r\n}\r\nassignment {\r\n   public_key: pk3\r\n   status: UNKNOWN\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe key differences here are that we also return some information about the status of the validator since they may be in different states. The validator should remove any validator key, from future requests, with status `EXITED` or `EXITED_SLASHED`. \r\n\r\n## validator/accounts/account.go & shared/keystore/keystore.go\r\n\r\nThe current implementation is that the accounts directory consists of a single set of validator keys (signing key and withdrawal key). We need to adapt new scheme where there may exist multiple key pairs. The most basic scheme would be to have some keystore directory where each valid file present in the directory acts as a signing key or withdrawal key. \r\n\r\nThe changes required here are \r\n- Creating a new account should allow multiple accounts\r\n- Keystore should provide list of keys where the validator key filename is abstracted or not known by the service requesting the key. ([link](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/d1b664852f90e968a557ef8fce2b43ce79313741/validator/client/service.go#L45) to current behavior)\r\n\r\n## validator/client/service.go\r\n\r\nThe validator service should use all keys provided by the keystore instead of a single key. This set of keys will be used to request assignments and perform behavior.\r\n\r\n## validator/client/validator.go -- WaitForActivation\r\n\r\nThis method should send a list of public keys where the server will return an activation stream event when any of the keys are activated. This provides a nice user experience when none of the keys have been activated; we wouldn't want to be requesting assignments where the validator client appears to be doing something but it is really waiting for activation. \r\n\r\n```protobuf\r\nmessage ValidatorActivationRequest {\r\n-    bytes pubkey = 1;\r\n+    repeated bytes public_key = 1;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince the response is a no-op for the validator (other than logging for user), we could emit an empty message as a signal that _some_ validator in the list has been activated OR return a list of public_key that we know are activated. \r\n\r\n```protobuf\r\nmessage ValidatorActivationResponse {\r\n-    ethereum.beacon.p2p.v1.Validator validator = 1;\r\n+    repeated bytes activated_public_key = 1;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## validator/client/validator.go -- UpdateAssignments\r\n\r\nThe [validator.assignment](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/d1b664852f90e968a557ef8fce2b43ce79313741/validator/client/validator.go#L32) should be changed from a single assignment to a list of assignments for the given epoch. Only active assignments should be assigned to this assignments list. \r\n\r\n## validator/client/runner.go \r\n\r\nWith a multiple key design, the first difference in the runner is a change in the validator interface for `RoleAt`, `AttestToBlockHead` and `ProposeBlock`. \r\n\r\n```go\r\ntype Validator interface {\r\n\tDone()\r\n\tWaitForChainStart(ctx context.Context) error\r\n\tWaitForActivation(ctx context.Context) error\r\n\tNextSlot() <-chan uint64\r\n\tUpdateAssignments(ctx context.Context, slot uint64) error\r\n-\tRoleAt(slot uint64) pb.ValidatorRole\r\n+\tRolesAt(slot uint64) map[uint64]pb.ValidatorRole // validatorIndex -> role\r\n-\tAttestToBlockHead(ctx context.Context, slot uint64)\r\n+\tAttestToBlockHead(ctx context.Context, validatorIndex uint64, slot uint64)\r\n-\tProposeBlock(ctx context.Context, slot uint64)\r\n+\tProposeBlock(ctx context.Context, validatorIndex uint64, slot uint64)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen the main routine of the runner is essentially the same.\r\n\r\n```go\r\nfor vIdx, role := range roles {\r\n  // same behavior, with additional validator index argument to attest/propose \r\n  // proposing/attesting should be done in a separate goroutine so not to block performing work\r\n  // for other validator indices\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nGiven that `RolesAt` returns a map instead of a Role enum value, we can return an empty map when there are no assignments and provide a better user message. \r\n\r\n```go\r\nif len(roles) == 0 {\r\n  log.WithField(\"slot\", slot - params.BeaconConfig().GenesisSlot).Info(\"No assignments, doing nothing\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is much better than the [UNKNOWN enum log](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/d1b664852f90e968a557ef8fce2b43ce79313741/validator/client/runner.go#L72-L75), which really shouldn't be exposed to the user. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Working on this in parallel\r\n\r\nI envision this work being broken up into the following PRs\r\n\r\n- [x] Update RPC proto definitions, implement server side and client side to perform the same behavior. I.e. the client should only accept the first response in a list of assignments\r\n- [x] Update validator accounts creation and keystore to support multiple keys\r\n- [ ] Update the validator client to perform the new behavior with multiple roles\r\n\r\nThe first two tasks can be worked independently, while the third task connects it all together.
