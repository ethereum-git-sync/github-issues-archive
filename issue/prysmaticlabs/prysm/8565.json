However, the official specification https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/weak-subjectivity.md lists that even for over 1 million validators, 3532 epochs is a safe weak subjectivity period. As such, we are OK to reduce this. \r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nTo create a helper which can compute or return the safe weak subjectivity period given a number of validators, such that the code adapts dynamically to a growing number of validators in eth2. This helper will be used to determine the length of epochs we need to keep track of for slashing protection, for db pruning in slasher's database, and used in initial sync for \"weak-subjectivity sync\"\r\n\r\nThis values can be retrieved from our config from some lookup table that is safe for a given number of validators.",
