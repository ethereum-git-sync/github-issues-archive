For example a `kill -HUP teku` would trigger a reload of their key directory, this can be used to add validators on the fly. We already do this in prysm, but perhaps the same technique can be adapted to this issue:\r\n\r\n- We identify the CLI flags that are succeptible to change without restarting the node\r\n- We trigger a re-read from the configuration yaml in case we catch a `HUP`",
