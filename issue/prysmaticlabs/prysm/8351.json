    "body": "Hi @ahadda5, a suggested approach would be to add a `MaskCredentials(url string) string` function inside of `shared/logutil` in Prysm. It should indeed work using strings.Replace. I think we can mask everything after the https://host:port combination, so you should still see `https://mainnet.infura.io/xxxx` or Alchemy. There is no need to e2e test this, unit tests will suffice. It should error if the input string is not a URL.",

If you can point me somewhere please.\r\n\r\nMy request is around basic-auth credentials - provided in front of the URL.  There may be other use-cases (infura?) where it makes sense to mask other sensitive things.\r\n\r\nI haven't looked, but if the client connection to the beacon node is logged, that would also apply here (they're provided as `--grpc-headers`, so probly not a concern)",
