As our implementation grows our initial sync will become more complicated as we start to factor in security concerns, etc . Also the initial sync and regular sync use different methods and fields. \r\n\r\nA pr for this will create a separate struct/service for initial sync and regular sync and also will ensure that only one service will be run at a time. Ex: If the node has no stored state, then the initial sync is run. During that period regular sync is on 'pause' , when initial sync is done, the regular sync resumes. \r\n",
