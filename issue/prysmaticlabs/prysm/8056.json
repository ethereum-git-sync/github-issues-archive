A prometheus metric might not be a bad idea too.\r\n\r\nI think it'll make for better ability to time upgrade and minor restarts, without losing on valuable profits, in particular proposing a block.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nAt the moment there are no alternative, and a simple upgrade restart, or a config change, can cost you your spot at proposing a block and enjoy the greater financial incentives it brings with it.\r\n",

    "body": "I would like this to be reverted. My reasons for this are twofold. On the one hand because this adds one extra message per slot `No duty until next epoch`  and `Next duty`  which makes 1) harder to read the log if you are looking for information and 2) requires space to keep these extra message every 12 second. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand this information is already included in the logs that prysm has by default at level info: The attestation and proposal roles are scheduled and logged every 6.4 minutes in the validator logs (e.g. `Attestation schedule`) and this includes the precise slot when your validator will be attesting/proposing. And the current slot is being logged every slot by the beacon `Synced new block`, contains epoch, slot and the position of the slot in the epoch. This is all that a user needs to know where he/she stands and when he/she will be attesting. \r\n\r\nI think that the benefits of this PR are minimal compared to the above problems. ",

    "body": "> I would like this to be reverted. My reasons for this are twofold. On the one hand because this adds one extra message per slot `No duty until next epoch` and `Next duty` which makes 1) harder to read the log if you are looking for information and 2) requires space to keep these extra message every 12 second.\r\n> \r\n> On the other hand this information is already included in the logs that prysm has by default at level info: The attestation and proposal roles are scheduled and logged every 6.4 minutes in the validator logs (e.g. `Attestation schedule`) and this includes the precise slot when your validator will be attesting/proposing. And the current slot is being logged every slot by the beacon `Synced new block`, contains epoch, slot and the position of the slot in the epoch. This is all that a user needs to know where he/she stands and when he/she will be attesting.\r\n> \r\n> I think that the benefits of this PR are minimal compared to the above problems.\r\n\r\n@danielschonfeld any input to this?",

In such cases, the next duty line, summarizing when you're supposed to work again, regardless of which validator it is, comes in very handy.\r\n\r\nHaving all that raised for discussion.  Perhaps there is room to make this logging facility a flag, and having it turned ``off`` by default.  \r\n\r\nAlso, if it is determined that this logging is verbose and pointless.
