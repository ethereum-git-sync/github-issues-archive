  "body": "In the minimal sharding protocol, we have 2 different types of actors: notaries and proposers. \r\n\r\n- Notaries are in charge of the voting/consensus layer of deciding on canonical collations and are also responsible for data availability checking. \r\n- Proposers are in charge of listening for incoming transactions over p2p, packaging them into collation bodies and broadcasting their respective headers to the Sharding Manager Contract\r\n\r\nWe posit that in our implementation, users would benefit from a third actor that we call an **observer**. If a user starts a sharding client without specifying a notary or proposer service, geth will simply start an **observer** service that hooks into the shardp2p network and is able to listen for events occurring throughout the network. This will be useful for nice logging and visualizations of what is occurring in the sharded system.\r\n\r\nWe have created an `observer` subpackage in our `sharding` package but have not yet defined exactly what it should do for our Ruby release. Starting this issue for anyone interested to take hold of a potential design.\r\n\r\nTeam, help me do a better job at scoping this issue into more tangible action items.",
