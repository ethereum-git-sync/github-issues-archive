This causes confusion on naming conventions for future types.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe naming of block signing types in prysm are by fork( i.e. block_v2 for altair, and block_v3 for bellatrix) and should either be changed to include the fork name ( i.e. block_altair, block_bellatrix) or follow the naming convention from [web3signer](https://docs.web3signer.consensys.net/en/latest/)\r\n",
