  "body": "I'd like to start an a discussion for the following. In Collation structure, we have`body` and `transactions` fields. \r\n```go\r\n// Collation base struct.\r\ntype Collation struct {\r\n\theader *CollationHeader\r\n\t// body represents the serialized blob of a collation's transactions.\r\n\t// this is a read-only property.\r\n\tbody []byte\r\n\t// transactions serves as a useful slice to store deserialized chunks from the\r\n\t// collation's body. Every time this transactions slice is updated, the serialized\r\n\t// body would need to be recalculated. This will be a useful property for proposers\r\n\t// in our system.\r\n\ttransactions []*types.Transaction\r\n}\r\n```\r\n`body` stores chunks from serialized `transactions`. Once we serialize `transactions` into chunks and store chunks into `body`, should we store the `transactions` into the collation along side with `body`?  \r\n```go\r\ncollation := sharding.NewCollation(header, serializedTxs, txs)\r\n//or \r\ncollation := sharding.NewCollation(header, serializedTxs, nil)\r\n```\r\nThe downside is the duplication of transactions in memory footprint, but might be worth it if we are going to be serializing/deserializing very frequently",
