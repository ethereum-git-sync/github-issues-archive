  "body": "# ðŸ’Ž Issue\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\nCurrently Prysm only supports forking till Altair for our E2E. To fork at the merge/bellatrix fork, our E2E runner needs to be configured so as to allow this happen. The requirements to enable this in our e2e will be stated out below. \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n-  Add support for bellatrix fork epoch being set.\r\n-  Add multiple geth nodes as part of our execution node set. In our e2e runner we only currently have 1 geth node which also \r\nmines by itself. In order to potentially support multiple beacon nodes, we will need to have their corresponding execution counterparts also running.\r\n- Add a transaction creater which will generate transactions to be included in our execution payload. This seems like a good candidate: https://github.com/MariusVanDerWijden/tx-fuzz\r\n- Add new evaluators to test for all the new merge related items. Ex: Execution Payloads, Correctly Transitioning to merge fork, etc \r\n- Add ability to test for optimistic sync. Potentially add in a separate node runner set (prysm + geth) , which will try to optimistically sync. \r\n- Add ability for us to bring this into our multiclient e2e too. However this will require our fetched LH binary to fully support any merge related work. \r\n ",
