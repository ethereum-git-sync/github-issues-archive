One of the reasons of this difference is that `coinbase` was renamed to `fee_recipient` in this [PR](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/2728).\r\n\r\nMoreover, there are other differences, prysm/spec.\r\n* `coinbase`/`fee_recipient`\r\n* `receipt_root`/`receipts_root`\r\n* `random`/`prev_randao`\r\n\r\n### Has this worked before in a previous version?\r\nNA\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\nNA\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî• Error\r\nNA\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Operating System:**\r\nNA\r\n\r\n**What version of Prysm are you running?
