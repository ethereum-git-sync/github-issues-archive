Like below timeline. [ref](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethstaker/comments/136cz6j/comment/jir6uh8/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\r\n```\r\n1. t = 0 ms: New slot begins.\r\n2. t > 2000 ms < 3000 ms: Validator makes getHeader call to all relays.\r\n3. t > 3000 ms < 4000 ms: Validator's getHeader call to bloXroute times out after 950 ms, validator picks best bid from others, Aestus wins.\r\n4. t = 4000 ms: Cutoff time, relay will no longer accept getPayload calls past this point.\r\n5. t = 4401 ms: Blinded block is ready and signed, validator sends getPayload call to Aestus, Aestus receives it and rejects it as too late (past the cutoff).\r\n6. t = 5368 ms: After 4 more retries, the validator mev-boost client gives up. As it has already signed one block, it doesn't want to risk a slashing by signing a second block, so resigns itself to missing the slot.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis issue is particularly noticeable in the following environments:\r\n- A single validator-client is performing many validator duties\r\n- web3signer is used instead of a local signer\r\n\r\nCurrently, within the `RolesAt` function, `isAggregator` is called by simple for looping for all validator public keys.\r\nThis function includes the process of `AGGREGATION_SLOT` signing internally, which seems to be the main bottleneck of the `RolesAt` function when using web3signer.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/f4681fde1946a86c5d33c389564241c7ca0e9c2f/validator/client/validator.go#L777-L783\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️ If you have a solution in mind, please describe it. --> \r\n\r\nOne possible soultion is to use goroutines for each validator for paralleizing `RolesAt` function.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️ Have you considered any alternative solutions or workarounds? --> \r\n",
