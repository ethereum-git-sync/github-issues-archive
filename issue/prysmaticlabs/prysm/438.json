  "body": "Similar to #437, this task is to add tracing to Prysm, starting with P2P messages.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/opentracing/opentracing-go\r\nhttps://www.jaegertracing.io/\r\n\r\nThe ideal use case is to trace a P2P request from start to finish to determine where bottlenecks might be. Imagine that a request for a block body took 4 seconds from receiving the request to the reply. A tracing framework would be able to help us understand where the slowdown might be.\r\n\r\nSome of the requirements to close this issue:\r\n- [x] Brief design as a comment in this issue.\r\n- [x] An easily reusable p2p middleware adapter to trace incoming and outgoing p2p messages\r\n- [x] Add flag to disable tracing `--disable-tracing`.\r\n\r\nIf there are more requirements discovered in the design, please add them to the issue in a comment or editing this description.",

    "body": "Hi @mkosowsk, I'm still working out the details but here is the approach I've mapped out so far:\r\n- After a brief discussion with @prestonvanloon on Discord I propose that we use OpenCensus+Jaeger for trace collection in place of OpenTracing+Jaeger. OpenCensus provides support for Go 1.11's execution tracer which gives us better insight in Go's runtime events (GC, scheduling, etc) and how they impact our requests.\r\n- Implement execution tracing within a node for a breakdown on how a request's processing time is spent (for example, the effect of an expensive crypto operation or DB access). This will involve defining [regions](https://godoc.org/runtime/trace#Region) and [tasks](https://godoc.org/runtime/trace#Task) around these operations in the code base.\r\n- Implement distributed tracing for p2p messages. This trace would show us the flow of messages between nodes within the system — I'm still investigating how to achieve this with libp2p as the transport. These traces could be hard to read for things like floodsub and incomplete as we can only obtain them from peers that have tracing enabled and our Jaeger instance can reach. I will try to use the adapter introduced in #421 to implement this.\r\n- Integrate with Jaeger for visualization, document, and provide examples.",
