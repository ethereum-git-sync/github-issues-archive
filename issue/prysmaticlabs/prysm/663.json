  "body": "A few of the functions in the casper package modify balances or change state directly instead of returning the object when the function is called. This will lead to inconsistent state being persisted if the node shuts down abruptly during a state transition. A PR for this would make the functions pure and lead it to return the object.\r\n\r\nFor Example:\r\n\r\nThe `ApplyCrosslinkRewardsAndPenalties` function in the casper package is not pure and modifies the validator balances directly instead of returning them. This would lead to balances being in an inconsistent state if `updateHead` fails after `newStateRecalc` has been run. \r\n\r\nSolutions to this would be to deep copy the whole of the crystallized state at the start of `newStateRecalc` or only modify the crystallized state at the end of the method.
