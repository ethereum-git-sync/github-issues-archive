This setting allows users to dynamically change whether they want to use the builder setting or not. some users mention that despite updating the file to have enabled as false, the validator client was still trying to register the validator.\r\nThere is no concrete evidence of this yet but warrants investigation.\r\n\r\n\r\nreferences from discord.\r\nUser:mxs#5437\r\n\r\n> we have a set of keys relying on the default config, builder set to false, and other keys with specific overrides, where we also set everything to false, and we saw the issue on both sets of keys\r\n\r\n> we are trying to on top of it make the beacon point to a non-existing MEV boost, with the rationale it could fallback if it can;; t reach it\r\n\r\nUser:ArchiFleKs#7852\r\n\r\n> Thanks, we seems (not definitly sure) to have mitigate our issue (with @mxs ) by re-enabling mev boost and using a dummy URL to trigger fallback tto local building. Proposed 2 blocks but haven't seen the stack trace since\r\n\r\nUser: Karmastic#1266\r\n\r\ndespite updating the proposer settings file it seemed that the builder settings were still calling the validator registration\r\n",
