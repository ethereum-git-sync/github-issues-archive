  "body": "`release` would be a more clear and welcoming name for the current `master` branch.\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\nCurrently our default branch is named `develop`. We maintain a branch representing the latest stable release called `master`. The git-using community has generally moved away from using the term `master` for the default branch, preferring `main` as a more neutral name with less baggage. Even before that shift occurred, `master` tended to mean something more like our current develop branch, ie the default branch in git, so using `master` as the release branch is 1) out of step with modern norms 2) confusing in the context of standard git branch naming.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe biggest implication of this change is that anyone who has built automation that specifically references the `master` branch will need to make updates. We will need to update our release runbooks and/or automation. So the first step is to make sure this proposal is visible to any downstream users of the prysm git repo. We should communicate to any such users that using semver release tags should be preferred as a more predictable and stable way to interact with our repository.",
