Im running my beacon with --p2p-host-dns=xxx\r\nThe host-dns instantly resolves to the new ip.\r\n\r\nHowever after this ip-change, my peers drop to only a few (<5) and the beacon does not recover from the change anymore back to the expected max-peer value (=30).\r\n\r\nWhat is somewhat strange that the peer drop does not happen every day, although the ip address changes every day. On Sept 6,7 and 9 the reset did not cause a drop in peers.\r\nThe only way to recover is to restart the beacon.\r\nBelow is a Grafana picture from the last 7 days. On most days I have to restart.\r\nToday I have not restarted yet. Therefore current peer count is still 3.\r\nSo last 3 days it happened every day.\r\n\r\n![2020-09-12_14-21-35](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28559038/92995375-53ed7780-f503-11ea-8c0b-63f61b62527a.png)\r\n\r\nHaving only very few peers left after the IP-reset obviously has a very bad impact on the validator performance of the validators using this beacon.\r\n\r\n### Has this worked before in a previous version?\r\nI have no exact information, but I think it was ok in the past (before discV5), so before medalla.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\nRun beacon with parameter `--p2p-host-dns` and change/reset the IP address the beacon is using, more commonly called having a \"dynamic IP\"\r\n\r\n## üî• Error\r\nPeer drops to only a few\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n<!-- If the issue is accompanied by an error, please share the error logs with us below.

It drops its peers, but after that its discovery gets it back to where it was. Im expecting the same behaviour from my beacon.\r\n![2020-09-12_14-29-13](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28559038/92995481-61573180-f504-11ea-8fc5-a170d5e4453d.png)\r\n\r\nDetailed trace logs regarding this issue already have been sent to @nisdas\r\n",

What is happening here is that the user is losing their inbound connections when the IP changes. There really isn't much we can do about it from the code perspective as far as I can tell. \r\n\r\nWith regards to geth node, what flags are you using? Are you advertising the DNS address? I suspect that you temporarily lose all of your geth peers and then reconnect to them in the same manner you would if you lost your internet access temporarily (which might happen every time you have an IP switch from your ISP).

Outbound connections should still very much be possible, I have been meaning to dig into this but I have been occupied with other things(sorry !). I will ping you in discord to debug this further this week @handelaar2 .

    "body": "Still an issue for me with the extra step that I am using a vpn with port forwarding. VPN connection is re-established after disconnection. So public IP for the p2p network may stay the same or may change when ip-reset on my network. Over the last days I kept the same vpn server ip. Sometimes Prysm goes into deadlock, sometimes everything works out fine. Geth has absolutely no problem to reconnect. Prysm reconnects to peers relatively fast (75) but it keeps saying\r\n\r\n`Failed to find peers\" error=\"failed to find peers for subnet`\r\n\r\nNo syncing, nothing else.\r\n\r\np2p_topic_peer_count looks also perfectly fine. I am subscripted to all subnets and I am have peer connections for every attestation committee, beacon_block etc",

    "body": "@Phistr90 Not sure if I understand. You write \"Prysm goes into deadlock\" but also \" Prysm reconnects to peers relatively fast\". The specific error you mention is already being worked with #8048. This issue I raised (now closed) was about peer_count going to almost zero and stay there (so not being able to discover new peers). This is different from finding no peers for a specific subnet. \r\nI think you need to clarify here: \"no peers at all\" or \"no peers for subnet\"",
