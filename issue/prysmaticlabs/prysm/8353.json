  "body": "# ðŸš€ Feature Request\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nImprove profitability of attestations selected by proposer.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nCurrently, proposer sorts attestations by number of bits they have and selects top `n` attestations:\r\nhttps://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/e677b19d3198a9f1371cc4ced8cd9cecc0208c17/beacon-chain/rpc/validator/proposer_utils.go#L31-L43\r\n\r\nThis works ok, but can, **theoretically**, lead to sub-optimal results (not most profitable set of bits selected). With max-cover algorithm (we have existing implementation of it), we can do better.\r\n\r\nHere is an example:\r\n- Consider attestations\r\n  - att1: `0x11000011`\r\n  - att2: `0x11001000`\r\n  - att3: `0x00001100`\r\n- Suppose we need to select only two attestations (assuming that their slot/epoch is equal, so we can rely on bit count only). \r\n- Max-cover will greedily select att1+att3: `0x11000011`, `0x00001100` (for the total coverage of `0x11001111` = 6 bits):\r\n  -  max-cover selects the most profitable att (which is att1),\r\n  -  then selects the next most profitable, *but taking into account only bits it doesn't know about*.\r\n- The current routine will end up selecting att1+att2: `0x11000011`, `0x11001000` (for total coverage of `0x11001011` = 5 bits):\r\n  - since att1 and att2 have 4 and 3 bits totally, in sorted list they will be preferred.",
