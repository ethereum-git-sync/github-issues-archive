  "body": "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI am currently in the end phases of deployed validator on Prater Testnet. My Geth node is completely synced and the beacon-chain finished syncing this morning, but when I go to start the validator I get a fatal error: \r\n\r\nlevel = error msg = \"The genesis validators root received from the beacon node does not match what is in your validator database. This could indicate that this is a database meant for another network\" \r\n\r\nlevel = fatal msg = Could not determine if beacon chain started: genesis validators root from beacon node (0x043db0d9a83813551ee2f33450d23797757d430911a9320530ad8a0eabc43efb) does not match root saved in validator db (0x77346b6c77f7e79723ad000eef295c882f670449ea7544fcc10d6ad66925195b)\r\n\r\nI've tried searching through documentation for a solution with no luck. I would try clearing the database and syncing again but the process took nearly 3 days. ",
