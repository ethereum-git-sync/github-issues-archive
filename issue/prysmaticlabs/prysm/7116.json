    "body": "wait, should it include orphaned blocks? I would expect the endpoint to be for on-chain participation\r\n\r\nThe issue here is that at the end of epoch `N`, participation was pretty low _because_ there were a number of orphaned blocks. But by the end of epoch `N+1`, participation was reasonable high because the attestations got filled in in slightly \"late\" blocks. Because the finality and reward calculations for epoch `N` happen at epoch `N+1`, it seems reasonable to count activity in epoch `N+1` as well\r\n\r\nA side note: what does `globalParticipationRate` mean here? The granularity of seeing head vs target vs source has been really useful when following lighthouse metrics as each \"participation rate\" has it's own meaning about network performance. For example for beaconcha.in's \"epoch\" view, it seems natural to use on-chain correct \"target\" participation because that is the cleanest signal of finality health per-epoch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[lighthouse endpoint if interested to check it out](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/http/consensus.html#consensusglobal_votes)",
