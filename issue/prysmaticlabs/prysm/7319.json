  "body": "# ðŸš€ Feature Request\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nReferring to #5450\r\n\r\nAfter startup Validator should display information about the wallet and/or accounts it read from the wallet, independent from the deposit status.\r\nRight now Validator just sits there, waiting to connect to Beacon-Chain or waiting for it to sync to the chain head before you get any information about your validator accounts. \r\n\r\nThis becomes more obvious pre-genesis:\r\n```\r\ntime=\"2020-09-23 07:44:20\" level=warning msg=\"Running Node on Spadina Testnet\" prefix=flags\r\ntime=\"2020-09-23 07:44:21\" level=info msg=\"Checking DB\" databasePath=\"/data/wallet/derived\" prefix=node\r\ntime=\"2020-09-23 07:44:21\" level=info msg=\"Starting validator node\" prefix=node version=\"Prysm/v1.0.0-alpha.26/1ce7cd5f50134e6cd272f47b302e53723c43d1e3. Built at: 2020-09-23 07:35:06+00:00\"\r\ntime=\"2020-09-23 07:44:21\" level=info msg=\"Starting gRPC gateway\" address=\"127.0.0.1:7500\" prefix=gateway\r\ntime=\"2020-09-23 07:44:21\" level=info msg=\"gRPC server listening on address\" address=\"127.0.0.1:7000\" prefix=rpc\r\ntime=\"2020-09-23 07:44:21\" level=warning msg=\"You are using an insecure gRPC connection. If you are running your beacon node and validator on the same machines, you can ignore this message. If you want to know how to enable secure connections, see: https://docs.prylabs.network/docs/prysm-usage/secure-grpc\" prefix=validator\r\ntime=\"2020-09-23 07:44:21\" level=info msg=\"Waiting for beacon chain start log from the ETH 1.0 deposit contract\" prefix=validator\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the given output I have no idea if it was even able to read all the keys I have in my wallet. Or if it even tried to decode the wallet.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nAt startup it should print out information about the given wallet and/or accounts, like\r\n```\r\nDecoded [HD|Non-HD|...] wallet: /data/wallet\r\nRead validator key 0 publicKey=...\r\n```\r\n\r\n",
