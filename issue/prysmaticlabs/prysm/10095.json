There are many areas of code that can/should be benchmarked. This issue will grow accordingly we find more items to cover\r\n\r\n## Benchmarks\r\n\r\n- [ ] Full state transition (inner slot)\r\n- [ ] Epoch transition\r\n- [ ] Beacon Block verification\r\n- [ ] SSZ objects (un)marshalling\r\n- [ ] SSZ objects htr computation\r\n- [ ] Block batch syncing\r\n- [ ] State retrieval from DB\r\n\r\n## Todo\r\n\r\nThink about possible P2P/gossiping benchmarks\r\n\r\nThis issue should be closed after all of the above tasks are complete.\r\n",
