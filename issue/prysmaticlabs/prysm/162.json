  "body": "Currently notary has no way to deregister and receive fund back using command line. I'd like to see this working for our Ruby release and to demo. \r\n\r\nThe workflow for Notary:\r\n1. notary register to notary pool with deposit\r\n2. notary gets elected, vote on some collation headers\r\n3. notary deregister, wait lockup period to end\r\n4. notary fall back to observer role\r\n5. lock up period ends, notary receives funds\r\n\r\nFor this PR, we care steps 3 - 5, and can split up the tasks as following:\r\n- Implement new cli flag for notary to deregister/withdraw\r\n- When shardNode gets cli flag, Notary service's `Stop()` function gets called\r\n- Start Observer service\r\n\r\n",
