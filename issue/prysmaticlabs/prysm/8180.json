I'm not familiar with Linux but I think this link could help you to set the appropriate permissions on that file if needed: https://chmodcommand.com/chmod-0600/\r\n\r\nCurrently there's a bug on Windows related to this (https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/issues/7898), but I believe Linux is not affected.",
