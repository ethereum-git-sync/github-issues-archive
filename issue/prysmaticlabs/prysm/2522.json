Please add them to the list as we gather more feedbacks.\r\n\r\n- [ ] beacon node doesn't touch keys, we should make them separate dirs (beacon node and validator) in instruction\r\n- [ ] for activation status, waiting for deposit to be included by validator, it would be great to better define what \"it'll take a while\" means time wise\r\n- [ ] For testnet site instructions, use a docker volume for the key storage instead of something under /tmp/ ? since that is flushed on reboot\r\n- [ ] Validator metrics are inaccurately logged, when you have a pending validator along with another active validator in the client. the balance deviation is shown as -50% .",
