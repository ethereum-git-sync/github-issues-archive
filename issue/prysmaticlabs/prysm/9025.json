  "body": "# üêû Bug Report\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen eth1 network stalls (see goerli), the `/healthz` endpoint starts to return an error.\r\n```\r\n*powchain.Service: ERROR, eth1 node is still syncing\r\n```\r\n\r\nMany deployments consider `/healthz` as an indicator on whether or not a Prysm node could serve traffic. However, a Prysm node could actually serve traffic when eth1 is stalled. The risk in mainnet is that if eth1 mainnet ever stalled entirely, then we could see many eth2 prysm validators stop participating entirely. \r\n\r\nIf there was some way to understand whether or not eth1 is stalled or if the eth1 node is out of sync, then we could simply report an error only on the latter. However, there may still be a risk here if many nodes suddenly consider themselves out of sync on mainnet. \r\n\r\nSuggestion: Return error when eth1 is out of sync AND prysm does not have a genesis state. Additionally, surface some kind of notification to the user that their eth1 client is out of sync / syncing and proposals may fail to include deposits as a result. \r\n\r\n### Has this worked before in a previous version?\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nHave an eth1 endpoint that stops advancing. \r\n\r\n## üî• Error\r\n\r\n<pre><code>*powchain.Service: ERROR, eth1 node is still syncing</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Operating System:**\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n  <code>\r\nAll\r\n  </code>\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n**What version of Prysm are you running? (Which release)**\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n  <code>\r\nv1.3.10\r\n  </code>\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant (validator index / public key)?**\r\n\r\n",
