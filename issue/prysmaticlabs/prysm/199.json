  "body": "Hi all,\r\n\r\nCurrently, we simulate requests from a `simulator` service that runs when a node runs as a Proposer. This service simulates incoming notary requests for collation bodies where the current node has to fetch the relevant information from persistent storage and respond accordingly. This is because we do not have the ability to communicate remotely across nodes until the first version of shardp2p is rolled out, which will be ready soon.\r\n\r\n**Instead**, we will generate requests for collation bodies from within the `notary` package as part of a notary's workflow when being selected on a shard. The **notary** should issue requests for collation bodies during this time **instead** of the simulator package doing so.\r\n",
