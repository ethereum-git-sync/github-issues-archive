Then I tried a different password that met all of the requirements, but only `_` was used as a special character...and I got the similar but different information message.\r\n\r\nIf specific characters are disallowed it should be stated, and the requirements and limitations should be stated explicitly before even prompting for a password.\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\nMessing around with `ethdo` validator key imports",
