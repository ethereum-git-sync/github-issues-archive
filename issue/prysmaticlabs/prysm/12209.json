  "body": "I'm trying to follow this guide for setting up the execution address on my testnet validator in Prater/Goerli: https://docs.prylabs.network/docs/wallet/withdraw-validator\r\n\r\nWhen I run prysmctl with the following command: `./prysmctl validator withdraw --beacon-node-host=http://localhost:3500 --path=./staking_deposit-cli/bls_to_execution_changes/bls_to_execution_change-1680129667.json` (plus the confirm flags)\r\n\r\nI get the following response:\r\n```\r\nFATA[0002] Could not set withdrawal addresses            error=\"setting withdrawals using the BLStoExecutionChange endpoint is only available after the Capella/Shanghai hard fork.\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nI understand this is not available on mainnet yet, but shouldn't this work on goerli? I'm connecting to a beacon node which is running on prater, also the bls change json file has a `\"network_name\": \"goerli\",` at some point. I've also tried adding flags to this command line like `--prater` `--goerli` `--network=goerli` but no luck.",
