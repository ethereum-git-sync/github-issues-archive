  "body": "Validators fetching assignments every epoch is ideal for a healthy network, however if there is a reorg that is more than one epoch deep then the previously fetched assignments are likely invalid. \r\n\r\nThe suggested design here is a reorg notification stream that validator clients can subscribe to and fetch new assignments. This stream is should be very lightweight and simply notify the subscriber that there has been a reorg in general. This should not be specific to the subscriber (do not recalculate assignments for the subscriber in this stream).\r\n\r\n- Validator client subscribes to stream\r\n- Server notifies subscribers that there has been a reorg (specifically a deep reorg)\r\n- Validator immediately fetches new assignments ",
