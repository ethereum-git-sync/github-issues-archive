  "body": "We should remove the Pending Blob Sidecar Cache. This cache is used when a blob is received without an associated parent block. Unfortunately, the cache is vulnerable to DOS attacks due to lax validation protocols, including the absence of a proposer ID and signature and blob index checks. Even though the Pending Blob Sidecar Cache has a TTL of one slot, it still poses a security risk. The downside of not having this cache is that a blob will have to request its parent block again, a process we already use today, thus saving bandwidth.\r\n\r\nGiven that the Pending Blob Sidecar Cache is minimal and mainly occurs when syncing to the head of the chain, removing it seems more prudent. This change would prevent potential attacks without sacrificing much in the way of functionality. Instead, we could rely solely on RPC requests.",
