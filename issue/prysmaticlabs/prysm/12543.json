This leads to unhandled errors in our tests, which could potentially hide relevant test failures. \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWe will need to fix our `ineffassign` analyzer [here](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/tree/develop/tools/analyzers/ineffassign) to be able to run on test code. Currently this is not the case.\r\n\r\nAudit Finding: TOB-PRYSM-1\r\n",
