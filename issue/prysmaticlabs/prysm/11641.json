  "body": "# ðŸš€ Feature Request\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe `validator` CLI allows generating an ND wallet but only allows importing accounts into it.  It would be useful to be able to generate an account (BLS key for Validator) non-interactively from the CLI.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nCurrently we use `ethdo` for this but would like to eliminate that dependency for our key generation. Ethdo uses the `herumi/bls` package to accomplish this; prysm already includes this package as well for its BLS support, but does not expose a mechanism for creating a new key.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nThere are other tools we could use to do this but we want to use one of the clients we currently support to reduce external dependencies.  Lighthouse only supports generating HD wallets and accounts non-interactively and we would like to keep using ND wallets. We have not approached the lighthouse team but will do so if we cannot get support added to prysm.\r\n",

    "body": "> On key generation in prysm itself, it will be unlikely that we will be adding it in at the current stage. Pre- beacon-chain launch, we made the decision not to have prysm generate keys/wallets but instead only be able to import/recover. Users would use the staking cli to generate new keys and prysm would then import those. On keeping the dependency chain minimal, underneath Prysm depends on quite a few wealdtech/attestant libraries to handle the respective wallets. So underneath Prysm would still use wealdtech/attestant libraries to generate new keys if we were ever to have the feature \r\n-nishant\r\n\r\nwe can keep this one open to continue the discussion here.\r\n\r\n",
