Many users were confused/unaware if there was any progress made due to the lack of information. \r\n\r\nIn addition, it would be good to have some explanation of the errors, perhaps written up in docs, in order for users to have an understanding of what's occurring, e.g context deadline exceeded, failed to retrieve pre state, requesting parent block etc etc\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nTo include these messages in the beacon node as info e.g. forks detected etc etc..\r\nTo include some of the common errors observed during non-finality in docs. \r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nAlternatively, a doc explaining the mechanisms of fork resolution during period of non-finality would suffice?",
