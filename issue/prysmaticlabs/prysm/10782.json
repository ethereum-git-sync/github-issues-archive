  "body": "When the beacon node receives an INVALID reply for an optimistically synced branch, the node removes those nodes from forkchoice. This however may revert the last finalized and justified node even though these may not be invalid. Consider the following situation\r\n```\r\n   Epoch 10    |   Epoch 11    |   Epoch 12    |   Epoch 13    |   Epoch 14\r\n               |               |               |               |\r\n  A <- B <- C <- D < .........<- E <-. .......<- F <- ........<- G <- H\r\n```\r\nEpoch 10 is finalized and 11 is justified, epoch 12 does not justify during its time.  When we sync block `E` in Epoch 12 this block will have \r\n```\r\nE.justified_checkpoint = { Epoch: 11, Root: D.root }\r\nE.finalized_checkpoint = { Epoch: 10, Root: A.root }\r\n```\r\nAt the beginning of epoch 13, block `F`  has enough votes to justify 12(E) and finalize 11 (D).  When we sync block `G` our Forkchoice Store has\r\n```\r\nstore.justified_checkpoint = { Epoch: 12, Root: E.root }\r\nstore.finalized_checkpoint = { Epoch: 11, Root: D.root }\r\n```\r\nNow suppose that the whole sequence `F<- ... <- H`  was synced optimistically, the EL returns `INVALID` when we sync `H` and `LVH` for block `E`. The node should revert to `E` as head, but  this is not possible since it has contradicting justification information between the block and the store. ",
