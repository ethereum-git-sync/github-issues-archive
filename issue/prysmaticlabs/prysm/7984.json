This has been evidenced by significant user reports of errors and overall complexity when adding features.\r\n\r\nInstead, we should consolidate all of the backends into a single /api proxy endpoint, and the validator client should handle fetching all the data the UI requests, including logs which today are done via _yet another_ backend http://localhost:8080/logs.
