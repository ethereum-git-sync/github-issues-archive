  "body": "# üêû Bug Report\r\n\r\nIf you have an HD-type wallet with accounts in it and try to back them up using accounts-v2 backup, the program execution will make it seem that all is going well (no errors, exits without issue) but there is no actual backup created.\r\n\r\nI suspect it is related to:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/b928e9531c6b5b7ad4b8548404fd3e0867966d56/validator/accounts/v2/accounts_backup.go#L107-L117\r\n\r\nthis return nil at line 116.  Of note the containing function returns in this manner:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/b928e9531c6b5b7ad4b8548404fd3e0867966d56/validator/accounts/v2/accounts_backup.go#L122\r\n\r\nAnd because of the earlier return nil, Derived type accounts will not written to storage.\r\n\r\nI believe the test that currently exists does not test Derived type accounts.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nSee above\r\n\r\n### Has this worked before in a previous version?\r\n\r\nHave not used this functionality before.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nSee above\r\n\r\n## üî• Error\r\n\r\nSee above\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\nUbuntu VM running Docker\r\n\r\n**What version of Prysm are you running? (Which release)**\r\n\r\nCurrent master\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant (validator index / public key)?**\r\nNo\r\n",
