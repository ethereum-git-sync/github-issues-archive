    "body": "> Can we walk the expected fields and fill them with zero values if they are nil when encoding/decoding?\r\n\r\nSay we are encoding a `*uint8` pointer. We need to differentiate between a nil pointer and a pointer that points to a zero value `uint8`. The encoding of zero value `uint8` is `0x00`, and the encoding for zero value `uint16` is `0x0000`, etc.. It's tricky to design the encoding output for nil pointer: If we want to decode a `*uint8` with input of `0x00`, should we decode it into a pointer that points to a zero-value `uint8`, or should we decode it into a nil pointer?\r\n\r\nIf we make an assumption that we will only use pointer for list and struct, we can solve the problem because no list or struct will have encoding like `0x00`, `0x0000`, `0x00000000`, etc. However, we are bringing customized encoding that's not mentioned in the spec. This will bring issue for cross-client communication.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental reason for this issue is that the spec never thought of the case for pointer. The spec presumably treats pointer the same as reference.\r\n\r\nI would suggest doing the following to unblock our development:\r\n- Assume we don't use pointer for primitive data type (uintX, bool, etc.) for the data type we want to encode\r\n- Use `0x00` as a semi-magic-number for nil pointer\r\n\r\nThen add a todo item when we need to seriously deal with cross-client communication.",
