We usually set new features to be \"opt-in\" before they are \"opt-out\" but we really wanted to make accounts v2 the canonical account management as it is compatible with the EIP-2335 standard for account storage which is what all of the eth2 clients are targeting. We wanted this in before Medalla, but we should have considered the migration path.\r\n\r\nLet me see if there is any tooling that would help you convert your existing keystores to a keystore that is compatible with accounts v2. Would that solve your use case or is there some reason to stay with accounts v1? ",

    "body": "@prestonvanloon \r\n\r\nI probably have a few different answers to this:\r\n\r\n1. Long term, I probably don't care too much which tools I am using for deposits. For mainnet I won't be making a thousand deposits that I need to script out. The launchpad will probably be sufficient.\r\n\r\n1. However, I do not like that my withdrawal key and my validator keys are under the same mnemonic. Seems like a decent sized security oversight to me. If I ever have to restore my validator keys with my mnemonic, it seems that would put my withdrawal key at risk of being discovered. I'd rather my withdrawal mnemonic be locked up somewhere I don't even need to pull it out unless I actually intend to withdraw.\r\n\r\n1. Short term answer is that I already made my deposits using ethdo/ethereal before accounts v2 was released, and I'd rather not waste those deposits. Trying to restore from the mnemonic I already have using the new tools seems like more effort than I want to put into it. Seems like I'd have to write another script to automate much of that, given that I have different passphrases for each account.\r\n\r\nSo... unless someone can convince me otherwise, I think using the same mnemonic for my withdrawal key and validator key seems like a security risk. And I may continue to look into options that allow me to separate the two. Other than that, I don't have a long-term need to use ethdo/ethereal.",

It is [EIP-2334](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2334) to do this. However, you have options not to use the hierarchical keystore. You can use the non-HD wallet.\r\n```\r\n? Select a type of wallet: \r\n    HD Wallet (Recommended)\r\n  ‚ñ∏ Non-HD Wallet (Most Basic)\r\n    Remote Signing Wallet (Advanced)\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Sounds good, I was thinking of writing a tool to migrate from accounts v1 to accounts v2.\r\n\r\nI'm going to raise this issue again with other eth2 teams. Thanks! ",
