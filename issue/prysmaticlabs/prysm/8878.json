None the less I don't know if the bug is with geth or prysm, but it seems like all is working properly on geth and i even curled manually to make sure I get a 200 response with the proper data i expected.\r\n\r\n### Has this worked before in a previous version?\r\n\r\nHard to tell\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nAgain hard to tell\r\n\r\n## üî• Error\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\nlevel=error msg=\"Unable to process past headers 502 Bad Gateway\" prefix=powchain\r\n</code></pre>\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Operating System:**\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n  <code> \r\n    Ubuntu 20.04 for both geth and prysm\r\n  </code>\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n**What version of Prysm are you running?
