I got confused for a second because the spec only talks about a minimum deposit, not a maximum deposit.\r\n\r\nIt's a bit strange, because for example if you'd like to start staking with 33 ETH, you have two ways to achieve this:\r\n\r\n1. First deposit 1 ETH, then deposit 32ETH.\r\n2. First deposit 32 ETH, then deposit 1 ETH.\r\n\r\nWhile a bit cumbersome it's pretty minor and unlike what I initially thought, you cannot deposit more than `MAX_DEPOSIT_AMOUNT`. I'll ignore the fact that depositing 16 ETH twice does not trigger a full deposit, as the spec does not indicate it should be either.",

    "body": "The spec says that you can deposit an amount bigger than 32 ETH and it'll count as a full deposit. The Prysm implementation simply does not allow a deposit bigger than 32 ETH. So what I thought was the issue as noted in the title, turns out to actually be a deviation from the spec.\r\n\r\nOne solution would be to simply update the deposit contract with the latest version that can be found at https://github.com/ethereum/deposit_contract/blob/master/deposit_contract/contracts/validator_registration.v.py",
