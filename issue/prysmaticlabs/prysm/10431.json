  "body": "Hi!\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm running prysm on a vmware workstation UBUNTU 20.04 machine.\r\n\r\nAfter my computer crashed, my beacon node doesn't start. It displays an error message: ERROR main: Runtime panic: invalid freelist page: 1834112, page type is leaf.\r\n\r\nI have a copy of the database extracted some epochs before the crash, so it would be not a big deal to restore the database if a re-install is needed.\r\n\r\nAny idea what's going on? How can I remove and install prysm again?\r\n\r\nThanks!",
