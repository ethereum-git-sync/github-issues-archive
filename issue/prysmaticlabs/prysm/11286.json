I don't usually keep it up 100% of the time, I usually just stop geth and prysm just so that 1) it doesn't use much of my Internet 2) I can test how it syncs back after being down.\r\n\r\nI've done this up and down cycles for a while, the setup merged and moved to PoS when that happened, I kept it up for a couple of days, then stopped it. I started everything again after a week or so, but now it doesn't seem to be syncing back again like it used to.\r\n\r\n### Has this worked before in a previous version?\r\n\r\nYes, although I don't think it's version related, more like a pre/post merge thing.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n* Have a Geth/Prysm beacon pair running fine, merged using PoS\r\n* Stop the services and let a few days go by\r\n* Start everything back up, now it's not syncing\r\n\r\n## üî• Error\r\n\r\nThis is what's been logging for a few hours now:\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\nbeacon-testnet_1     | time=\"2022-08-22 15:29:54\" level=info msg=\"Processing block batch of size 41 starting from  0xde547ff2... 3639936/3722849 -
