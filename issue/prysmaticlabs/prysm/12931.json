  "body": "I follow this link and put my multinode ( 3 nodes ) to run with success.\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.prylabs.network/docs/advanced/proof-of-stake-devnet\r\n\r\nNow I have 3 Consensus, 3 Validators and 3 GEth running and synced.\r\n\r\nBut ...\r\n\r\nI have a question about this piece of text:\r\n\r\n\r\n> The file above sets up the genesis configuration for go-ethereum, which seeds certain accounts with an ETH balance and deploys a validator deposit contract at address 0x4242424242424242424242424242424242424242 which is used for new validators to deposit 32 ETH and join the proof-of-stake chain. The account that we are running go-ethereum with, 0x123463a4b065722e99115d6c222f267d9cabb524, will have an ETH balance you can use to submit transactions on your devnet.\r\n\r\n\r\nI know in the actual blockchain any validator need to send 32 ETH to be part of the consensus network.\r\n\r\nBut in this specific case, I have 3 nodes and no need to send any ETH to the  ```0x4242424242424242424242424242424242424242``` address and my private network is ( seems to be ) running fine. \r\n\r\nMy question is : In case of this specific tutorial, must I send 32 ETH to be part of validation process? The tutorial created 64 validators in just one node... so I think I have 64 * 3 validators???? Is this correct? \r\n\r\nIf so, in real world would I need to send 32 * 64 * 3 ETH to the  ```0x4242424242424242424242424242424242424242```  address ??\r\n\r\nIf I want to mimic the actual Ethereum network and sell ETH to my new validators... what do I need to do? ? Or what THEY need to do?\r\n\r\nCan this link help in some way?\r\nhttps://notes.ethereum.org/@parithosh/SJmzY4I5t\r\n\r\n\r\n",
