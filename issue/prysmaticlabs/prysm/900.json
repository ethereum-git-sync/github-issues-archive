  "body": "Currently both the `Sync` and `InitialSync` services both respond to requests and process blocks in the same goroutine. This brings up an attack vector , where a malicious node can potentially basically DOS another node by overloading that node with requests which would prevent the node from block processing and advancing their local chain in the `SyncService` or saving blocks in `InitialSyncService`. \r\n\r\nOne way to mitigate this is to split the main goroutine into two separate routines, where one would be in-charge of block processing and the other would be respond to block requests. This would be similar to how it is currently carried out in the `blockchain` service where one routine handles, block processing and the other routine actually updates head, applies fork-choice rule etc to the local chain. \r\n\r\nThis issue is also tangentially related to #898.",
