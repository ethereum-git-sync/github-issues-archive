  "body": "Hi all,\r\n\r\nCurrently, validator does not attempt to restart its main workflow if it disconnects from a running beacon node. Thus, the beacon node sleeping can lead to issues similar to what Danny encountered in #622. If gRPC disconnects or we encounter some sort of fatal error, the validator should attempt to reset and start again from scratch as if it just connected to a beacon node. A PR for this would resolve the problem and work correctly at runtime.\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Can you elaborate more on how to reproduce this issue? \r\n\r\nI think gRPC will attempt to reconnect automatically unless the server explicitly states that it is shutting down. https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/blob/8d75951f9be037a31565f412b01a632032fc4a5a/clientconn.go#L1174\r\n\r\nSee onGoAway (when the server goes away and the client attempts to reconnect): https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/blob/8d75951f9be037a31565f412b01a632032fc4a5a/clientconn.go#L1059\r\n\r\nThe caveat is that we don't use a context with a timeout to dial the server and this is the case for our code since we are not using DialContext, but Dial (which uses context.Background()). \r\n\r\nIn fact, looking at #622, it was the Beacon chain node that crashed and you can see the validator attempt to reconnect. The relevant logging is:\r\n```\r\n[2018-10-03 16:52:12] ERROR beacon: Could not receive latest attestation from stream: rpc error: code = Unavailable desc = transport is closing\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis means the server is offline on the reconnection attempt.",
