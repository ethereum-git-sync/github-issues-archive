This port should be configurable via flag `--monitoring-port`.\r\n- [ ] Add flag to disable metrics monitoring `--disable-monitoring`.\r\n\r\nIf there are more requirements discovered in the design, please add them to the issue in a comment or editing this description.

In fact, the author that added EnableTracingFlag originally had the inverse logic and I asked them to deviate (I wasn't aware that it would cause an inconsistency). \r\n\r\nLet's make these consistent and enable both by default.

    "body": "@prestonvanloon I am with some doubts about how we will disable the metrics and I want to discuss this with you.\r\nI think in two/three ways:\r\n\r\n1. The metrics types used by the Prometheus client are very performant and shouldn't harm the performance of the application. considering these we can use the metric types inside the services without any if or guard to validate the flag. In case of the metrics are disable we just don't register them and don't start the HTTP server. \r\n2. Use a generic library with the PrometheusAdapter and a NoOperationAdapter.\r\n3. I didn't like this alternative but, we can build a wrapper for the Prometheus metric system and handle in a single place the metric disabled.\r\n\r\nI am really ok with the first option, all the metrics are built with atomic operations and are really fast.

    "body": "Thanks for investigating these options. I agree that it may not be worth the work at the moment to support a flag. As long as we are not expensively updating metrics then it should be OK.\r\n\r\nWe should be able to profile this at a later time and determine if we need to disable. \r\n\r\nFollowing the pattern of You Ain't Gonna Need It, let's omit the flag for this for now. It wasn't as straightforward as tracing where tracing provides a no-op and we already know tracing can be expensive.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
