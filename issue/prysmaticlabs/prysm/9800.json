  "body": "# ðŸ’Ž Issue\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\nCurrently in mainnet,the validator set in our beacon state has been constantly growing. This has been putting more pressure on block proposers to optimally pack in attestations into blocks. A side effect of more validators in the network is the fact that attestations from relevant committees are less optimally aggregated. Subnets become noisier with the larger amount of messages passing through in gossip.\r\n \r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis issue is to track improvements for our attestation packing and aggregation in general. This [post](https://ethresear.ch/t/attestation-aggregation-heuristics/7265/10) from victor is a good primer on how attestation aggregation can be modeled as. However attestation aggregation is only one side of the coin, the other more important issue to think of is on how to efficiently pack in all these aggregates into blocks. With the network growing, disjoint attestation aggregates become more common. Due to this, you have more space in blocks being taken up by these aggregates. Adding onto that, certain blocks have redundant attestations included in them which have already been 'seen', so they serve no purpose.  The above are a few issues that can be tackled(along with any other relevant ones). ",
