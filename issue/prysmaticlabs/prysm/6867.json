Everything was working as it should and the validator showed it was activated and waiting for the beacon chain to start on genesis, and it was showing that it has to attest on slot 18. On genesis the beacon chain started and when it passed slot 18, I went to look at the validator and it didn't get an attestation. There is no error in the journalctl logs either. This same thing happened to me on genesis in the onyx testnet. I had my systemd service files ready, on genesis the beaconchain was doing what it should, but the validator wasn't and I wasn't getting attestations. I missed a lot of attestations before I stopped the validator service file and started it again. As soon as I did that it started attesting. Today, when I saw that I missed the attestation at slot 18 in epoch 0 I immediately stopped the validator service file and started it again. Then it started attesting. \r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> \r\n\r\n### Has this worked before in a previous version?\r\nThis same thing happened on the onyx testnet. Except I missed a lot of attestations, because I didn't stop and start the validator service file immediately after a missed attestation like I did today.\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> \r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease let us know how we can reproduce this issue.
