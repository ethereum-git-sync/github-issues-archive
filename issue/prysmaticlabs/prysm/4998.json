One would be to have a file instead of supplying the data directly on the command line, for example: `--keymanageropts=~/opts.json` and then have a file at `~/opts.json` that contained:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"path\": \"/the/actual/path\",\r\n  \"passphrase\": \"changeme\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis has the benefit of not making your passphrase visible to anyone with access to the server.\r\n\r\nAlternatively you can avoid using single quotes altogether and escape the double quotes that are present in the JSON, for example ` --keymanageropts=\"{\\\"path\\\":\\\"${HOME}/prysm-keys/\\\",\\\"passphrase\\\":\\\"changeme\\\"}\" `\r\n\r\n(Note use of $HOME rather than ~; ~ is not expanded anywhere inside quotes)",
