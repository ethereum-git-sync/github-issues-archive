I have a grafana chart that shows validator_count for both \"exiting\" and \"active\" validators. I expected the exiting value with jump up to 1100 immediately, showing that the exit queue is now 1100 validators larger. This is exactly what happened.\r\n\r\nHowever, I expected the active validators value to decrease by only 4 validators per epoch. Instead, the active validators count dropped by 1100 almost immediately.\r\n\r\nThis may be a misunderstanding on my part about how active validators should be calculated, but my assumption is that the 1100 validators are active until they reach the front of the queue are are inactivated 4 at a time. (Or whatever the precise rate is.)\r\n\r\nInstead, it almost looks like the active validator count simply subtracts the exiting value.\r\n\r\nIt is possible this is as-designed, but I would think the active count should show actual current active validators, in which case I assume this is wrong.\r\n\r\n### Has this worked before in a previous version?\r\n\r\nUnknown. I was not monitoring these values closely when I was running a previous version.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nSubmit a number of exits larger than the number that can exit in a single epoch. See active validator count reduce by the full number instead of the number actually exiting in an epoch.\r\n\r\n## üî• Error\r\n\r\nSee my chart below. Note that my chart shows exits as negative, intentionally, as a way of showing that the number of validators is being reduced by that amount. Nevertheless, note also that when my exiting value goes to -1100, the validator count drops by 1100 almost precisely in lock-step with the exiting number. Active validators is in brown and exiting is in yellow.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54516310/88547227-a9fd6e80-cfda-11ea-831a-2678f60efafa.png)\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Operating System:**\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n  <code>\r\nUbuntu 20.04 LTS\r\n  </code>\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n**What version of Prysm are you running?
