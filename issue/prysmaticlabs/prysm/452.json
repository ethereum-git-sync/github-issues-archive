  "body": "Hi all,\r\n\r\nAs part of Eth 2.0 we require validators to communicate with each other on their assigned shard in order to exchange information about attestations. Specifically, we want proposers to receive attestation fields from attesters in a certain shard in order to package that data up into a block to be sent to a beacon node for processing. Workflow is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Proposer packages up basic info into a tentative block\r\n2. Proposer broadcasts the tentative block to other validators in the shard (to attesters).\r\n3. Attesters vote on the tentative block, then they broadcast their attestations to the proposer that sent them the tentative block.\r\n4. Proposer packages those attestations into a request to be sent to a full beacon node via gRPC which will then be transformed into a beacon block by the node.\r\n\r\nFor this, we need to implement proto p2p messages and interactions between validators.",
