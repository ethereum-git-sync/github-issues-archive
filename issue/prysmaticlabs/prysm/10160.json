For example, choosing a destination that expressly accepts test requests, increasing delay between test run iterations, increasing dial-timeout, or try UDP port 53 (dns). ",

    "body": "Very appreciated, thanks! I think I have the `TestVerifyConnectivity` changes for a unit test. I *borrowed* most of the the code from the [dial_test.go in the standard lib's net package](https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/master:src/net/dial_test.go) and realized when looking there that they distinguish between **available-external-network** (and \"local\") for the test environment. That made me wonder whether `TestVerifyConnectivity` is meant to exercise the `net.Dial()` because it shouldn't be necessary to test that `net.Dial()` works. It made me think that the purpose of the test is really to verify/prove that a log entry is generated under the right circumstances (unreachable addresses). This seems reasonable because when I looked for where it is called, it is to do quick \"health check\" on \r\nthe Host-Address config param (line#266 in service.go). And I think the [param option is the p2p-host-IP](https://docs.prylabs.network/docs/prysm-usage/parameters):\r\n\r\n> --p2p-host-ip value     The IP address advertised by libp2p. This may be used to advertise an external IP.\r\n\r\n I need to confirm whether is correct. At the same time, I'll try to understand the second failing test (Discovery-Attempts one).\r\n\r\n[utils_test.go.txt](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/files/8439761/utils_test.go.txt)",
