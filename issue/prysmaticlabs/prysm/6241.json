  "body": "ðŸ’Ž Issue\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\nI have built a ready to use grafana dashboard for the prysm community, and therefore I need it to be robust. With the Onyx testnet, I just found out that the validator metric `validator_balance` has changed for a shorter pubkey instead of the full one\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23481418/84585973-6fb68400-ae15-11ea-97d9-c164713c0dce.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nHere you can see that the pubkey in `validator_balance` and `validator_statuses` aren't the same anymore, but it was on topaz.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nMy issue now, is that I was assuming that those pubkeys returned for all the validator metric are the same. This mean that I can filter on multiple metric on the pubkeys.\r\n\r\nFor example, the total earning panel include this `count(validator_balance > 16 and validator_statuses == 3)`\r\nThere I can make sure that a very recently ACTIVATED (status 3) will be counted for the total earning only when it got his balance, because there is a small delay between the 2 metrics to show up.\r\n\r\nAlso I tried to change the value of the pubkey in this formula, but it doesn't work, so there is no work around on my end.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nI don't mind pubkey to be shorter than before, but I would expect at least to get the same pubkey for each metric, so I can apply filters on multiple metrics",
