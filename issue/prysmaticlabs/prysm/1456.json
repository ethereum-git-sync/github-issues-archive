  "body": "We need a way to listen for a validator being activated in the validator client after the chain has started. This only applies for validators which have issued deposits into the deposit contract after ChainStart. \r\n\r\nAccording to the validator specification doc [here](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/master/specs/validator/0_beacon-chain-validator.md#becoming-a-validator):\r\n\r\n> Deposits cannot be processed into the beacon chain until the eth1.0 block in which they were deposited or any of its descendants is added to the beacon chain state.eth1_data. This takes a minimum of ETH1_FOLLOW_DISTANCE eth1.0 blocks (~4 hours) plus ETH1_DATA_VOTING_PERIOD epochs (~1.7 hours). Once the requisite eth1.0 data is added, the deposit will normally be added to a beacon chain block and processed into the state.validator_registry within an epoch or two. The validator is then in a queue to be activated.\r\n\r\n",
