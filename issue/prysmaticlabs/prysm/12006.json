  "body": "# ðŸš€ Feature Request\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, monitoring locally-attached validators with the validator monitor on the BN requires us to know the indices of the validators in advance and pass them in as command line arguments with `--monitor-indices` according to [https://docs.prylabs.network/docs/prysm-usage/individual-validator-monitoring](https://docs.prylabs.network/docs/prysm-usage/individual-validator-monitoring). If you don't know the indices of your own validators, you don't seem to be able to use the validator monitor.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nI would like to have an `auto` option for this, which automatically tracks validators attached to any VCs tied to the BN without me needing to know the index in advance.\r\n\r\nFor context, I'm working on a unified Grafana dashboard that provides a standard view for Rocket Pool node operators regardless of their client choice. Lighthouse and Nimbus offer this feature so users can track their own node's inclusion distances, and I'd like Prysm to have it too. \r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nI don't have any good alternatives for this feature.\r\n",
