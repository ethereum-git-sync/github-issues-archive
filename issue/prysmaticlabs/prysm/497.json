  "body": "We would like to start enforcing the format of `TODO(1234)` for TODOs in our code where 1234 represents the github issue associated with that task.\r\n\r\nThe requirements for this issue are to add a script to travis that will complain if there are any issues incorrectly formatted. See [scripts/check_gazelle.sh](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/master/scripts/check_gazelle.sh) for inspiration. \r\n\r\nA prerequesite to submitting a fix for this issue would be that all of the TODOs are correctly formatted. Creating issues for the existing TODOs should be done by the original code owner (see git blame). The assignee of this issue should ping original owners to create issues for the respective TODOs. \r\n\r\nI've written a quick regex and there are many TODOs that need an issue or need to be deleted.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngrep -PinH '(?<!context\\.)todo(?!\\(#{0,1}\\d+\\))' **/*.go\r\n```\r\n```\r\nbeacon-chain/blockchain/core.go:224:    // TODO: Insert recent block hash.\r\nbeacon-chain/blockchain/core.go:261:    // TODO: Validate last justified block hash matches in the crystallizedState.\r\nbeacon-chain/blockchain/core.go:275:    // TODO: Generate validators aggregated pub key.\r\nbeacon-chain/blockchain/core.go:295:    // TODO: Verify msgHash against aggregated pub key and aggregated signature.\r\nbeacon-chain/blockchain/core.go:365:    // TODO: ShardAndCommitteesForSlots will return default value because the spec for dynasty transition is not finalized.\r\nbeacon-chain/blockchain/core.go:452:    // TODO: Full rewards and penalties design is not finalized according to the spec.\r\nbeacon-chain/blockchain/core.go:468:            Validators:                 rewardedValidators, // TODO: Stub.
