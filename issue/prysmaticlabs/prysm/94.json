  "body": "The goal of this potential project is to create a web front-end that visualizes a sharded Ethereum blockchain network. Could be built as an extension to [ethstats](https://ethstats.net) or as its own, independent interface.\r\n\r\n**Requirements / Acceptance Criteria**\r\n- Ability to inspect transaction load on n number of shards\r\n- Ability to visualize cross-shard interactions\r\n- Ability to see number of nodes and distribution of nodes across shards\r\n- See collations happening in each period for each shard\r\n- Ability to inspect the size of canonical shard chains\r\n\r\n**Cool to Have**\r\n- Some way of visualizing the actual p2p network topology\r\n\r\n**Alternative** \r\n\r\nCreate a command line tool to visualize a sharded network. Can be baked into a sharding client implementation and could be a combination of ASCII art and text to visualize the different information pertaining to each shard.\r\n\r\nThis is a long, multi-step project, so at this point we are only looking for a design spec with possible visuals of how the front-end would look or how ethstats can be extended to accommodate these requirements.\r\n\r\nThe necessary reading to understand the context of the requirements and basic terms around sharding can be found in our project's [README](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/geth-sharding/blob/master/sharding/README.md). Many sections, however, are deprecated while a minimal sharding protocol is still being researched.\r\n\r\nWe see this as a good first bounty for Prysmatic Labs.\r\n",

So being able to not just pick a block and see how many shards it has, but see a range of blocks where there was X number of shards, then the next range where the number of shards increased, and so on. But I suggest not implementing that visualization until we have a better idea of shard numbers and dynamics. For each shard you could have a visualization of a [sparse binary Merkle tree](https://ethresear.ch/t/data-availability-proof-friendly-state-tree-transitions/1453/6?u=jamesray1), and maybe stats like ETH Gas station (although that could be done by an external provider, like ETH Gas Station) e.g. on gas burners and a tx pool.\r\n\r\nAlso see this, it has a visualization of network topology across  shards and within shards: https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/991021062811930624.",

Bob wants is thinking about deploying a new contract that he expects to have high traffic. Bob wants a shard with mostly non-full collations so he can take advantage of lower gas fees. How can your design accomplish this?\r\n\r\n2. Alice is a user of Cryptokitties. She wants to explore the cross-shard transactions in the shard the Cryptokitties contract lives in. What are some ways she can achieve this?\r\n\r\n3. Bob is interested in seeing the performance of the Sharding Manager Contract's functions on the main chain. He should be able to visualize the load on this contract via the shard dashboard and see which shards have the most function calls to this contract.\r\n\r\n4. Alice wants to check how much storage it would require to download canonical shard chains. How can she visualize how big the state of the shards is? Keep in mind each collation is 1 Mb in size.\r\n\r\n5. Bob is interested in exploring the security of the sharded system against attacks. He wants to see how much ETH is staked into the Sharding Manager Contract on the main chain and how much of this ETH is staked by notaries participating on a particular shard. What could be a good way to visualize this?",

The shard listing can have an option to sort by \"Transactions / Blocks\" for each shard which defines the proportion of txns that shard processed in the last `n` blocks.\r\n\r\n2. She can figure out which shard the contract lives in by going to its address page. Then she may click on the shard and see a list of all collations for that shard. Each collation displays how many cross-shard transactions it has. (Also by looking at the graph on the shard page)\r\n\r\n3. Not entirely sure how to show that. Could they just look at the contract address and see all inbound transactions from the different shards? Ideas would be appreciated for this!\r\n\r\n4. She can look at the total number of collations for a shard (on the shards listing page) and translate that number directly into the number of Mb that shard takes up.\r\n\r\n5.
