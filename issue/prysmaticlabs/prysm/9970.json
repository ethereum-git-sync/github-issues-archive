From a user's perspective running Prysm with normal settings, they would see something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[2021-12-01 22:18:03] INFO: Checking DB...\r\n```\r\nand nothing for minutes or even half an hour as we've heard in reports. We should add regular info logs to this to explain what is going on underneath the hood or even suggest adding a progress bar if the situation warrants it. @nisdas can probably add more color as to what is happening underneath the hood and how we can add more info about it.\r\n",
