  "body": "# üêû Bug Report\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAt the end of epoch `E` (ie after applying the block at the final slot of E), committee data are computed computed and cached for the epochs `E+1` and `E+2`. As part of the computation we also cache shuffled and sorted validator indices for `E+1` & `E+2`, which are used when computing the proposer index during those epochs. There are several code paths that trigger this computation - usually it happens when `ActiveValidatorIndices is called`. However when a node starts up during E2E after deposits have been processed, and gets up to speed via initial-sync, typically the timing will be such that `handleEpochBoundary` will be first to update the cache. While the requested epoch from `handleEpochBoundary` is `E+1`, process_slots has not yet been run, so the state given to the computation is still in epoch `E`. This causes a problem because in E2E we use `MAX_SEED_LOOKAHEAD == 1`, and since validators become eligible for activation at epoch E + MAX_SEED_LOOKAHEAD + 1 (ie E+2), it is possible that validators that are not eligible for activation at the epoch E, *will* be eligible at epoch E + 2, potentially resulting in a different list of validators. This is not a problem in mainnet, because `MAX_SEED_LOOKAHEAD` is 4, so the list can be computed further in advance.\r\n\r\n### Has this worked before in a previous version?\r\n\r\nno\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nThis is tricky to reproduce. The easiest way is to modify the minimal E2E test - make sure that TestSync is true, and extend the number of epochs. Around slot 78 there should be a proposer index mismatch. This PR was created to demonstrate the issue:\r\nhttps://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/10637\r\n\r\n## üî• Error\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\nprysm buildkite E2E",
