  "body": "Hi all,\r\n\r\nWe are currently planning on using [go-bls](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/go-bls) for our BLS-12-381 signature aggregation library to use throughout our repository. There has been some discussion on creating a pure Go implementation of the system as that would bring a massive benefit to our client and to the general public. Specifically, we wouldn't be relying on CGo bindings, no underlying C dependencies to install on specific machine architectures, and we would have an easier time testing and attracting open source contributors.\r\n\r\nWe are requesting a bounty for this problem for someone to implement this in a separate repository, as this implementation would be incredibly beneficial beyond just for Prysm.",
