While it is fine at the current moment, having a subgroup check on our pubkeys /signatures would be important. This is especially relevant for our pubkeys as we do cache them, so performing the check before hand is important. Verifying the subgroup of signatures would have to be bench marked carefully as it can have an effect on signature verification performance across the node. \r\n\r\n",
