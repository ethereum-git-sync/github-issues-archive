  "body": "The ActiveValidatorIndices function is supposed to return the indices of the currently active validators.\r\nBut when appending to the indices array it appends the index of the validator in the array returned by `activeIndicesCache.ActiveIndicesInEpoch(epoch)` and not the actual index of the validator.\r\n\r\nSee:\r\nhttps://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/0326be86b5781b8e9d40d8f003d28a895e71203f/beacon-chain/core/helpers/validators.go#L82-L86\r\n\r\nThat is why a validator with an index greater than the number of active validators will never get any slot proposal or attestation assignments.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the type `v1alpha1.Validator` that is returned by `activeIndicesCache.ActiveIndicesInEpoch(epoch)` also does not contain the validator index.",
