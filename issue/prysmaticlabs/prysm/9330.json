  "body": "# üöÄ Feature Request\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nOur newly optimized slasher in #8331 runs after initial sync to build up a history of data for attesters and proposers. That is, slasher is able to detect anything that conflicts against the history it has accumulated over time.\r\n\r\nThe downside is that if slasher does not have a recorded history for a certain validator event, it will not be able to detect a slashable event. For example, if a validator submits an attestation at at epoch `N`, then a slasher begins synchronizing a node after that point, then at some epoch `N + k`, that same validator commits a slashable offense, slasher will **NOT** be able to catch the offense.\r\n\r\nTo solve this problem, we have two potential solutions:\r\n\r\n(1) We run slasher during chain initial sync, or\r\n(2) We perform a ‚Äúbackfilling‚Äù routine to populate slasher‚Äôs history after initial sync is complete\r\n\r\nWe consider (1) unfeasible due to the performance impact it has on a node. To do (2), there are very important challenges to solve to ensure it is also feasible.\r\n\r\nA comprehensive document of the backfilling problem and algorithm can be found [here](https://hackmd.io/@prysmaticlabs/slasher-backfilling-challenges). The backfilling algorithm described in the design document was implemented in #9211, but as it was a naive approach, performance was too slow to even complete the processing of a single batch.\r\n\r\nWe consider this feature important but not critical to complete right now. As such, we are opening up to any external contributors interested in an extra challenge.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nNot backfilling at all is an option, but we argue that is it important for correctness' sake to have a slasher implementation that can detect historical slashable events.",
