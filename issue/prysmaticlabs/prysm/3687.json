  "body": "This is a follow-up to #3147. The only item we are missing is to implement Noise Handshakes for the mainnet functionality of the beacon chain. \r\n\r\nFrom the networking spec:\r\n\r\n#### Mainnet\r\n\r\n[Noise Framework](http://www.noiseprotocol.org/) handshakes will be used for mainnet. libp2p Noise support [is in the process of being standardized](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/issues/195) in the libp2p project.\r\n\r\nNoise support will presumably include IX, IK, and XX handshake patterns, and may rely on Curve25519 keys, ChaCha20 and Poly1305 ciphers, and SHA-256 as a hash function. These aspects are being actively debated in the referenced issue (Eth 2.0 implementers are welcome to comment and contribute to the discussion).\r\n\r\n### Why are we using Noise/TLS 1.3 for mainnet?\r\n\r\nCopied from the Noise Protocol Framework [website](http://www.noiseprotocol.org):\r\n\r\n> Noise is a framework for building crypto protocols. Noise protocols support mutual and optional authentication, identity hiding, forward secrecy, zero round-trip encryption, and other advanced features.\r\n\r\nNoise in itself does not specify a single handshake procedure, but provides a framework to build secure handshakes based on Diffie-Hellman key agreement with a variety of tradeoffs and guarantees.\r\n\r\nNoise handshakes are lightweight and simple to understand, and are used in major cryptographic-centric projects like WireGuard, I2P, and Lightning. [Various](https://www.wireguard.com/papers/kobeissi-bhargavan-noise-explorer-2018.pdf) [studies](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/436.pdf) have assessed the stated security goals of several Noise handshakes with positive results.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, TLS 1.3 is the newest, simplified iteration of TLS. Old, insecure, obsolete ciphers and algorithms have been removed, adopting Ed25519 as the sole ECDH key agreement function. Handshakes are faster, 1-RTT data is supported, and session resumption is a reality, amongst other features.\r\n\r\n*Note*: [TLS 1.3 is a prerequisite of the QUIC transport](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-quic-transport-22#section-7), although an experiment exists to integrate Noise as the QUIC crypto layer: [nQUIC](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/028).\r\n",
