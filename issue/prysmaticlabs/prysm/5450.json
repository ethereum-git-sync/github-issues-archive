    "body": "1. First of all, let's look at the problem. Validators can be active _before_ the genesis time if they deposited pre-genesis. Say that genesis is tomorrow at midnight, the problem is if you're running a validator, you dont get any logs or feedback that you are ready once that time tomorrow comes.\r\n2. Then, I would look at the lifecycle of a validator: what does a validator do when it starts up? It follows these steps: https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/9e6b6bc0094c2bd9d3f15336f67886b9c692899e/validator/client/runner.go#L48.  Seems like it waits for genesis, then waits for activation. Once it receives a genesis time, it waits to see if the validator is active. What we can do is check if the validator is part of the genesis state and perhaps include that as part of the API response necessary.\r\n3. Then, we verify what happens today to see where we could add this log:\r\nI have this script to be able to run a local node for basic testing: https://gist.github.com/rauljordan/50302db7bb175c713d004cec8be601ea. You can make it so the genesis time is in the future and observe what the validator client logs. We want to make those logs more informative if a validator is active and prepared for genesis. \r\n4. Before writing any code, write up a brief design doc about how you plan on tackling this feature in a detailed manner. This way, we can give you feedback as a team before you begin coding in case you need to change your course. \r\n5. Write tests to ensure the feature works as expected.",
