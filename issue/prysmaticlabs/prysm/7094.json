  "body": "# üêû Bug Report\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThere's a bug in number of tests that use the following construct:\r\n```golang\r\n\tif _, err := foo.bar(); err != nil && !strings.Contains(err.Error(), wanted) {\r\n\t\tt.Errorf(\"Expected error %v, received %v\", wanted, err)\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\nThe problem with that code is that in order to make sure that we do not get segfault (when `err = nil`), `err != nil` check is added, but then this test (when generally used to check for a given error) can pass when no error is returned (that's the initial purpose of test is ignored)!\r\n\r\n### Code example\r\nhttps://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/5d0f6c5b1666ce78ba0ef9172594752d82e103b5/beacon-chain/rpc/beacon/assignments_test.go#L88-L120\r\n\r\nThe `TestServer_ListAssignments_Pagination_InputOutOfRange` obviously is there to check that out of range error is returned, on `bs.ListValidatorAssignments()` call with incorrect parameters. This test passes at the moment, yet the value returned from `bs.ListValidatorAssignments()` is not expected error, it is `nil` - so, test's purpose is defeated (it was written to assert that we have a given error in certain conditions, and now w/o that error test still passes).\r\n\r\n### Tests affected\r\n- `TestServer_ListValidatorBalances_PaginationOutOfRange`\r\n- `TestServer_ListAssignments_Pagination_InputOutOfRange`\r\n- `TestGetDuties_NextEpoch_CantFindValidatorIdx`\r\n- `TestServer_ListAttestations_Genesis`\r\n- `TestServer_GetValidatorParticipation_DoesntExist`\r\n(there are probably more of them)\r\n\r\n### Proposed resolution\r\nThose tests need to be either fixed or removed, currently they do not test what they are supposed to test.\r\n",
