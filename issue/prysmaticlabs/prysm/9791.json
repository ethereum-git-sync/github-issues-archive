The `validationReject` we are getting is because there is an error in `decodePubsubMessage`.\r\n\r\n### Has this worked before in a previous version?\r\n\r\nSame from the beginning i think\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nRun the test case in debug mode and you will see why it sends a `validationReject`.\r\n\r\n## üî• Error\r\nNo Error is displayed\r\n\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant (validator index / public key)?**\r\n\r\nIn develop, there is an error code that is send  back from `validateBeaconBlockPubSub` along with the libp2p error, we can use that to check if this fails for the right reason.\r\n",
