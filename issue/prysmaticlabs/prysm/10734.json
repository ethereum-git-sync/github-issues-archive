  "body": "Currently package store tracks almost the same information that `Forkchoice.Store` does. This is a bad separation of concerns as ultimately forkchoice needs to have accurate justification and finalization information and it should be tracked by itself, duplicating (and therefore deprecating) package `store`. Currently prysm feeds the right justification and finalization information from package `store` into `forkchoice` by passing it on each call to `Forkchoice.Head()`. With #10702 this will no longer be the case and we will only update forkchoice when needed (that is when we import blocks and/or a new epoch is started). The current design is bug prone in that both the `store` package and the `forkchoice` package may have differing views of the justification status, leading to prysm not being able to import blocks.\r\n\r\nCurrently package `store` is responsible for tracking the *best justified checkpoint* and updating the justified checkpoint to match it when needed. This issue should be marked as solved when this mechanism is moved to the `forkchoice` package and then package `store` is deprecated. \r\n\r\n- [x] Let forkchoice track and use its own justification checkpoints to decide head. \r\n- [x] Let forkchoice update its own justification checkpoints and track best justified checkpoint.\r\n- [ ] Let blockchain package use forkchoice to track justification and finalization checkpoints.
