The reason this happens is due to the following code:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/ac60ff2bc2f0971bfe8084b5387bac420594d9b2/validator/client/validator.go#L244\r\n\r\nWe open a gRPC stream once with a set of keys the validator client was started with. We watch over this stream until we receive notification of activation, then those keys are ready to go. With dynamic key reloading, we are not resetting this stream, so we never find out if the keys are activated.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nSuggested approach: reset the WaitForActivation stream on notification of new keys being imported at runtime to include those in the request. Thanks @tsudmi \r\n",
