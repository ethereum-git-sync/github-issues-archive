Many users are reporting that they can't decrypt their keys, likely due to stray keystrokes or right click pastes at this point.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nImprove the UX for providing interactive password and require confirmation of the provided password to ensure it was entered correctly.\r\n",
