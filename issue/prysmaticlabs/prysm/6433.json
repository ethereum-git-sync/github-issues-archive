  "body": "# ðŸš€ Feature Request\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nTo monitor the services the `beacon-chain` already supplies a number of json-rpc but `slasher` doesn't have any kind of health check endpoints yet.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nSimilar to `beacon-chain` implementing a simple json-rpc should do the trick, stating the slasher's connectivity to a beacon chain and availability for validators' submits. This can be as simple as https://api.prylabs.net/#/Node/GetSyncStatus\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nThe working alternative right now is to just check if the service ports of `slasher` are open for requests. But this has some obvious downsides:\r\n- another service could listen to this port\r\n- no information on service's status",
