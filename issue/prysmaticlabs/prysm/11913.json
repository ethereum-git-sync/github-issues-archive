I'm looking for ways to improve this value.\r\nAnd around 2-3 days I get 1 missed attestation. \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nSome information on the setup:\r\nExecution client: `Geth 1.10.26`\r\nConsensus client: `Prysm 3.2.0`\r\nEnvironment: `AWS + Kubernetes`\r\nTime synchronization: `chrony`\r\nNumber of active peers: `~75+`\r\n\r\nMain suspect so far - is block arrival latency.\r\nAccording to `block_arrival_latency_milliseconds_bucket` I have ~8.5% of blocks arriving with 4s+ delay.\r\nReferring to this topic https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/issues/5665 I understand that this value should be lower, but I don't understand how I can improve the situation. \r\nIf I enable `attest-timely` feature I start seeing a lot of missed attestations ~ 5-10 missed attestations per day.  \r\n\r\nI would appreciate any guidance or suggestions.\r\nThanks.\r\n",
