  "body": "Forgive me but I'm trying hard to find the documentations for the REST API ...\r\n\r\nI open a request for a feature that already implemented #12760 because I couldn't found it.\r\n\r\nAnd even that response was not clear enough to me ( something like \"the endpoint is like this bro..\" but knowing the address is not enough. I need all paramenter, formats addresses etc...\r\n\r\nLike this https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interacting-with-geth/rpc/ns-admin. A very good example.\r\n\r\nOr even this ( that I don't know what exactly is : that say \"Beacon-API\" but from Ethereum? ) https://ethereum.github.io/beacon-APIs/#/ \r\n\r\nSo... ok... the address is ```/prysm/node/trusted_peers``` and now ? What I must pass? Is it POST? GET? Is the query parameter JSON? XML:? \r\n\r\nThis page is even more confusing:\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.prylabs.network/docs/how-prysm-works/prysm-public-api\r\n\r\nThe ```/p2p``` endpoint? where is it documented?\r\nIs there more endpoints from ```/prysm/``` ? \r\nWhy ```/p2p```is not under ```/prysm/``` like ```/node``` is ?\r\n\r\n",
