We should add a deprecation notice to these old api methods in code so that it is obvious to both core developers and external consumers of the prysm API that some methods are not to be used anymore. \r\nEx:\r\nhttps://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/develop/beacon-chain/rpc/prysm/v1alpha1/beacon/blocks.go#L42 is an outdated api method when \r\nhttps://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/develop/beacon-chain/rpc/prysm/v1alpha1/beacon/blocks.go#L67 should be used instead.\r\n\r\nThis can represented both in our proto schema files along with the implementation of the api method. \r\n",
