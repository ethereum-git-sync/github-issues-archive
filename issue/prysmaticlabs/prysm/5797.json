It may be helpful to add in a check for this info by default, and then to introduce a new flag to bypass the check for people who are tinkering with unsupported configurations.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nExample error messages:\r\n```\r\nERROR: System does not meet the minimum Operating System requirement, use --bypass-os-check to skip this check. (expected Mac OS X 10.14+, found 10.13) \r\nERROR: System does not meet software pre-requisites, use --bypass-prereq-check to skip this check. (Homebrew not found).\r\n```\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nDocs have all the info, but people don't RTFM.  Current error messages / stack dumps are quite scary.",

This is only needed when system is run with `prysm.sh` though (and is already handled by the script itself).\r\n\r\nI believe, we should keep scope simple and focused, that's:\r\n  - start with OS/arch check only\r\n  - not sure if we even need that separate disable check flag i.e. emitting warning when minimum requirements are not met should be enough (no need to stop the system, and then not to stop it when \"disable check\" flag is provided). User will have more feedback of what's going on, and that should be it.",
