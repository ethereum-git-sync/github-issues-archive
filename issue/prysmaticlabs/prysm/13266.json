  "body": "# ðŸš€ Feature Request\r\n\r\nIn some non-validating situations it would be handy to be able to run reprysm without a companion execution client. For example in dev, or when spinning up a client for analytics or API related purposes.\r\n\r\nNimbus has this feature (behind the `--no-el` flag). \r\n\r\nWould there be interest in a PR to do this? I have prototyped this in Prysm and would likely be up to work on it a bit further and submit as a PR - *if* this is a feature that would be accepted in the client.",
