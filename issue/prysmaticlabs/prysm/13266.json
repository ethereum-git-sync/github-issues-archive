For example in dev, or when spinning up a client for analytics or API related purposes.\r\n\r\nNimbus has this feature (behind the `--no-el` flag). \r\n\r\nWould there be interest in a PR to do this? I have prototyped this in Prysm and would likely be up to work on it a bit further and submit as a PR - *if* this is a feature that would be accepted in the client.",

These happen when the EL performs some basic checks (like the validity of the BlockHash and the such) but does not have enough information to verify the execution status. This happens for example when the EL is still syncing and doesn't have the full state or optionally when importing non-canonical blocks. \r\n\r\nSome clients (AFAIK Nimbus supports this) perform the blockhash check and therefore allows a CL client to run without an EL to track the head.
