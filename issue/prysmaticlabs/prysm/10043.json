  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nStakeWise runs oracles that periodically sync balances from the beacon chain. Previously we were running them only with Prysm beacon nodes, but now we are planning to use also Lighthouse and Teku.\r\nFor some reason, Teku and Lighthouse return the same value, but Prysm returns a different one for the same finalized epoch.\r\n\r\nThe latest measurement:\r\n\r\nfinalized epoch: `87819`\r\nactivated validators: `911`\r\ntotal rewards (Lighthouse, Teku): `1285.825380501 ETH`\r\ntotal rewards (Prysm): `1285.825369063 ETH`\r\n\r\nAll the clients are running the latest versions and beacon nodes are queried using the ETH2 Standard API:\r\n\r\nFor checking whether the epoch is finalized, we use `/eth/v1/beacon/states/{state_id}/finality_checkpoints`.\r\nFor fetching validator balances we use: `/eth/v1/beacon/states/{state_id}/validators?id={'&id='.join(public_keys)`",
