Many keys inside the same validator client or many validator clients each running one key or a few keys? There is one confirmation step for all keys combined.\r\n\r\nAs in having 32 ETH * 20 validators running on Prysm, on the same machine. \r\nSo I assume this would be _\"Many keys inside the same validator client\"_ :] Thats what I meant at least.\r\n\r\nSo basically **one command** to request exit for all validators at the same time. _Maximum_ a yes/no question but perhaps not even that. The ones who looks up and executes this command surely knows he is about to exit all validators wether its 1 x 32ETH or 500 x 32ETH instantly.\r\n\r\nMe myself will need the exit to be as easy as possible in case a family member for eg. need to exit on my behalf and dont feel comfy submitting commands in the terminal... Or have a cronjob that will exit in case i dont login into my server in a specific amount of time. So in that case it wont be slashing and slashing. A good feature imo :)",

    "body": "rajkat on #General @ Prysm discord:\r\n\r\n> Does anyone know how the withdrawal from withdrawal address will work when enabled?  At that time, do we have to exit the validators? That's kind of difficult in case a family member or someone else has to do on your behalf.  I think the ideal solution would be to allow withdrawing the entire balance of the validator from the withdrawal address and when the balance falls below the 16 eth, the validator automatically exits. Does anyone have insights into this or can we have the core eth2 wallet team implement such a feature. Basically for someone to withdraw who is not techie enough, it should be as simple as logging with ledger or trezor with their eth2 app on their device and executing a withdraw transaction. A lot of things regarding funds safety are so scary with today's implementation of eth2 wallet system and also discouraging for many. Lot of forethought has to be given into this in order not to screw up things.\r\n> \r\n> If such a system is implemented, then @makultar concern about auto exit is also solved at a much higher level\r\n\r\nValid input. The value of 1 validator keeps increasing and increasing. Exiting should be possible in various ways. Last thing I want if I get injured/put in coma/die is that no family member can submit a simple exit command as agreed to get all investments/savings..",
