  "body": "# ðŸ’Ž Issue\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nThe objective of this issue is to define a clear path for Prysm to implement an optimized implementation of slasher based on our design document [here](https://hackmd.io/@Yl0VNGYRR6aeDrHHQNhuaA/rkvKcTNJO). Our current slasher is untenable and has been unmaintained for a while. To support the growing numbers of validators and create a future-proof solution, we need to redesign it from the ground up.\r\n\r\nThis issue tracks the completion of the different steps required to make this happen.\r\n\r\n## Foundations\r\n\r\n- [x] Define a slasher as a beacon node service, subscribing to an event feed of indexed attestations #8335\r\n- [x] Define the configuration parameters for the slasher service, with comprehensive comments and package level godocs #8335\r\n- [x] Define a `Chunker` interface and structs which meet the interface for MinSpans and MaxSpans #8350 \r\n- [x] Define the necessary DB schema and methods  #8342 \r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\n- [x] Implement the `Chunker` interface for min spans #8350 \r\n- [x] Implement the `Chunker` interface for max spans #8358 \r\n- [x] Implement the ingestion and preprocessing of indexed attestations from an event feed\r\n- [x] Implement a mock indexed attestation generator for testing\r\n- [x] Implement the detection process for incoming batches of attestations using the chunker interface for min and max spans'\r\n- [x] Implement double vote detection\r\n- [x] Implement double proposal detection\r\n- [x] Implement ability to defer valid attestations from the future for future processing\r\n- [x] Implement pruning for old attestation records\r\n- [x] Implement compression for chunks on disk\r\n- [x] Integrate slasher into the beacon node runtime, ensuring the beacon node sends it signed indexed attestations and signed beacon blocks (WIP)\r\n- [x] Implement the slasher gRPC endpoints\r\n- [x] Remove the old slasher codebase\r\n- [x] Create documentation for how to run slasher\r\n\r\n## Tests & Benchmarks\r\n\r\n- [x] Implement comprehensive integration tests and unit tests for the feature\r\n- [x] Run simulations for N validators, M epochs, with different frequencies of received indexed attestations and observe performance both on CPU, memory, and disk I/O\r\n- [x] Integrate the slasher simulator into e2e\r\n- [x] Run in Pyrmont, measure baseline CPU and RAM use and disk space usage\r\n- [x] Create manifests to run slasher in k8s\r\n- [x] Announce by next release that within a few releases, we will be deprecating and removing the old slasher from the codebase\r\n- [x] Ensure remote slashing protection works in the Prater testnet\r\n- [x] Ensure DB use is reasonable on mainnet and in testnets  \r\n",
