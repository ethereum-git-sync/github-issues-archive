  "body": "# üêû Bug Report\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nExternal Slashing Protection may not be working in v1.0.5. \r\n\r\nI realised my validator had an outage of approx 5 hours (my fault for not checking my alerting and assuming it self healed. Rather than wait for my geth node to resync, I bumped my version to v1.0.5 so I could make use of the `fallback-web3provider` and point it at my infura account. Everything looked fine on the beacon node + slasher but my validator was not submitting attestations because the slasher was not confirming that they were safe. \r\n\r\nMitigated by downgrading back to v1.0.4\r\n\r\n### Has this worked before in a previous version?\r\n\r\nYes, I have been running a slasher as external slashing protection through all of the 1.0 releases. \r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease let us know how we can reproduce this issue. Include the exact method you used to run Prysm along with any flags used in your beacon chain and/or validator. Make sure you don't upload any confidential files or private keys.\r\n-->\r\nRun a dockerised beacon + validator + slasher with external slashing protection on. Flags used:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Slashing protection from the accompanying slasher\r\nenable-external-slasher-protection: yes\r\nenable-local-protection: yes\r\nslasher-rpc-provider: slasher:5000\r\n```\r\n\r\n## üî• Error\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n\r\ntime=\"2021-01-05 15:55:03\" level=error msg=\"External slashing attestation protection returned an error: rpc error: code = InvalidArgument desc = nil signature provided\"\r\ntime=\"2021-01-05 15:55:03\" level=error msg=\"Failed attestation slashing protection check\" error=\"external slasher service detected a submitted slashable attestation\" prefix=validator pubKey=0x****** slot=253173\r\n\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Operating System:**\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n  <code>\r\n    Ubuntu 20.04 with Docker 19.03.11\r\n  </code>\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n**What version of Prysm are you running?
