  "body": "Currently the validator has [multiple processes](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/master/validator/client/runner.go#L46) it runs before performing validator duties, these include: [`WaitForChainStart`](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/0fff07a93b3d742ec8b3e35f41ca04ca01522990/beacon-chain/rpc/validator/server.go#L153), [`WaitForSync`](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/0fff07a93b3d742ec8b3e35f41ca04ca01522990/validator/client/validator.go#L162) and [`WaitForActivation`](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/master/beacon-chain/rpc/validator/server.go#L75).\r\n\r\n`WaitForSync` and `WaitForActivation` both currently ping once for information, and after that they run every 6 seconds to check for the information the validator client needs. If the beacon node is not ready to return the information asked for at the time of request, the validator receives another response every 6 seconds after.\r\n\r\nOne issue discovered and explained to @rauljordan is that the first request of `WaitForSync` and `WaitForActivation` both fail initially after chain start, and fallback to the 6 second delay.\r\n\r\nThe validator should not use `WaitForChainStart` and `WaitForSync` for notification on when it should act if the beacon chain node is not ready yet by the time, we should instead use [`StateFeed.Initialized`](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/0fff07a93b3d742ec8b3e35f41ca04ca01522990/beacon-chain/blockchain/service.go#L192) or a new `StateFeed.Synced` for tracking when the beacon node is ready to communicate with the validator client.\r\n",
