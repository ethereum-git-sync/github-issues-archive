    "body": "I was looking at this yesterday as part of the validator clean-ups.  From what I can tell the situation is a little weird:\r\n\r\n  - the validator defaults to a non-secure connection\r\n  - the validator will create a secure connection if the `--tls-cert` parameter is applied.  This parameter expects a CA root certificate for the CA that signed the beacon node's certificate\r\n\r\nThis is somewhat non-standard.  A more common way of doing things would be:\r\n\r\n  - the validator has a `--tls` parameter that sets up a secure connection between the validator and beacon node\r\n  - the `--tls-cert` parameter is optional for beacon nodes that have certificates signed by CAs that are not well-known\r\n\r\nIt may also be possible to attempt a TLS connection first and downgrade to an insecure connection if that fails, although this isn't something I've tried before so not sure how grpc will take it.  I'll see if I can play around with this at the weekend to work out if we need code/parameter changes, what they are, and give some kind of write-up for secure beacon<->validator communications.",
