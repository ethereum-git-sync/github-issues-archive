  "body": "@protolambda has brought to light some problems with our current gossip sub usage. Currently we have two main problems with how we use it. \r\n\r\n1) Excessive Broadcasting \r\nWe currently manually re-broadcast each message we receive; however the gossipsub router does this internally too over here. https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-pubsub/blob/7e5b02f152ae2dd8bceb897affe7ef57cb3c6b4e/pubsub.go#L761 \r\nSo messages are being propagated twice, leading to message amplification occurring. This has been the cause of high average message counts.\r\n\r\n2) Validation is separate from the gossipsub callback. We do message validation in our pipeline, not involving the gossipsub service of this. This leads to both good/bad messages being relayed to other peers. So whatever validation we do only affects the messages that we manually broadcast. We will need to add in the gossipsub validator to validate messages from specific topics\r\n\r\nRelated to #4218\r\n\r\n",
