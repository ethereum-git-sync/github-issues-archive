  "body": "# ðŸ’Ž Issue\r\n\r\nExisting `v1alpha1` API does not have any integration tests.\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\nA bug was introduced into Prysm APIs after updating grpc-gateway from `v1` to `v2`. The fix was applied in https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/grpc-gateway/pull/7, but it should have been caught sooner - right after the breaking change. The main reason why this was not the case is that we only have unit tests for the APIs. These tests check our grpc code only, not touching the grpc-gateway layer. \r\n\r\nWe should provide a set of integration tests that make HTTP calls to the gateway, possibly against a mock grpc server, and verify the responses. Such tests can be ran as part of our existing test suite, as a separate CI step, and/or be included in e2e tests. The e2e part would probably consist of a real server instead of a mock. This will ensure that any similar future issues are caught as early as possible.\r\n\r\nWe can firstly create something for the ongoing `v1` APIs and then port the solution to `v1alpha1`.\r\n",
