  "body": "# 🐞 Bug Report\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nPrysm doesn't properly validate `RANDOM PACKET` before replying with `WHOAREYOU`.  Per the discv5 protocol a `RANDOM_PACKET` is sent to initiate a handshake and the receiving node replies with `WHOAREYOU`.  The `RANDOM_PACKET` should have the following layout:\r\n\r\n> tag -> 32 bytes \r\n> auth-tag -> 12 bytes (RLP format)\r\n> random_data -> 44+ bytes\r\n\r\nThere are two issues\r\n\r\n1) Prysm will reply to undersized `RANDOM PACKETS`.\r\n\r\nThe Discv5 rationale document specifically mentions that the `RANDOM PACKET` size should be > `WHOAREYOU` to ensure that an attack using the `RANDOM PACKET` format will require more bandwidth for the attacker.  Prysm will reply to `RANDOM PACKETS` as small as 46 bytes - in other words, the `random_data` field does not seem to be required in this implementation.  88 bytes + 2 bytes for RLP length prefix should be the minimum acceptable size.\r\n\r\n2) Prysm does not properly validate the RLP in the `auth-tag` field.  \r\n\r\nAccording to the RLP specification, this field should be prepended with `8c` followed by 12 bytes.  \r\n\r\nThe following is screenshot showing Prysm's reply to a malformed `RANDOM PACKET` that is undersized AND has invalid RLP encoding:\r\n\r\nInvalid `RANDOM PACKET`:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5555162/91204493-cbc93e80-e6c9-11ea-9555-2c713d86a0e5.png)\r\n\r\nPrysm's `WHOAREYOU` response:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5555162/91204533-db488780-e6c9-11ea-8b68-5f97bcf11d67.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor fun 🤥, I looked into the discovery implementation that Prysm uses at `github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/p2p/discover` it looks like a packet is recieved, then [decode()](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/p2p/discover/v5_encoding.go#L420) is called in then [handlePacket()](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/p2p/discover/v5_udp.go#L620) method of v5_udp.go.  The next line contains this code: \r\n\r\n```go\r\n\tif err != nil {\r\n\t\tt.log.Debug(\"Bad discv5 packet\", \"id\", fromID, \"addr\", addr, \"err\", err)\r\n\t\treturn err\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nA packet with a 0 byte payload will trigger the condition above with this message:\r\n\r\n```\r\nDEBUG[08-13|00:48:42.764] Bad discv5 packet                        id=677557726689c257 addr=192.168.1.100:2376  err=\"packet too short\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nA packet with a 0 bytes < payload <= 32 bytes will trigger the condition above with this message:\r\n\r\n```\r\nDEBUG[08-13|00:50:12.904] Bad discv5 packet                        id=677557726689c257 addr=192.168.1.100:2376  err=EOF\r\n```\r\n\r\nA packet with a 33 bytes <= payload <= 45 bytes will work for a few seconds before it stops responding with a `WHOAREYOU`.  However, other packets with a 45 bytes < payload < (65535 - headers) bytes will work indefinitely:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTRACE[08-13|00:39:52.0022] << UNKNOWN/v5                            id=677557726689c257 addr=192.168.1.100:5243\r\nTRACE[08-13|00:39:52.0022] >> WHOAREYOU/v5                          id=677557726689c257 addr=192.168.1.100:5243\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe what happens that the message is classified as `unknownV5` [here](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/p2p/discover/v5_encoding.go#L467) and ultimately results in the `WHOAREYOU` response sent [here](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/54add4255064f722b33fe1c13e46db0b875fe325/p2p/discover/v5_udp.go#L680). \r\n\r\n> Disclaimer: I just eyeballed the code so a more thorough investigation is needed\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nYou can recreate the issue by using this command to send a malformed message to Prysm:\r\n\r\n`> hping3 -d 46 --fast --udp -p [PORT] [IP]`\r\n\r\n",
