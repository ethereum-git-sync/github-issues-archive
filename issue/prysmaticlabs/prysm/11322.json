    "body": "Hi heeckhau,  thanks for reporting this and reminding me to add a note on our documents. you are correct currently we don't have the feature to support persistence after restart via updates from the webUI. We can keep this issue open in the meantime to track this feature as I begin work on this.\r\n\r\nto get around this I recommend using the --proposer-settings-file providing a config of the updated values, if you use this file it will persist on update. you can read more about this flag [ here ](https://docs.prylabs.network/docs/execution-node/fee-recipient)\r\n\r\nin terms of the separate validator.db I believe the correct one is the one in the direct folder and not the one outside of the direct folder as you are using locally imported keys.\r\n",

It is based on the KeyManager API, so I can avoid as much Prysm/Teku-specific code as possible.\r\nI'll work around this for now, and mark it as a future simplification.\r\n\r\nDoes the persistence limitation also apply to importing keys with the Keymanager API?",

    "body": "@jwhelan72 the setting is scheduled every epoch so it does try to persist after setting + the 1 epoch. could you let me know what happened in your case?\r\nwhat I suspect could be happening is that a suggested fee recipient flag is used on startup, user sets the fee recipient on UI, then the UI restarts with the same suggested fee recipient flag overriding the UI's value. If the suggested fee recipient flag was removed on the restart it won't cache it on the beacon node again.\r\n\r\ninstead simply don't start the validator client with the suggested fee recipient or proposer settings, and instead set it on the beacon node. next set the value on the UI, wait for 1 epoch and the values should persist.\r\n\r\nplease confirm if this is the case I'll close the issue again",
