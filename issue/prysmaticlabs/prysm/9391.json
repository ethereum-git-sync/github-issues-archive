However the main issue is that it doesn't appropriately filter only for active connections. \r\n\r\nRunning with a dynamic network key and having multiple restarts makes it possible to mark a valid IP as invalid. This is inaccurate and overly strict. \r\n\r\nThe correct solution would be to apply this filter to only active connections and to disregard dead/inactive connections. However, this also needs to be tempered with not making the ip limiter totally ineffective as the node still needs to have a way to observe clustering of nodes by IP and to appropriately score them.
