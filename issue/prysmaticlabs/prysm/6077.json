However our previous version was v0.2.1, while https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-kad-dht/releases/tag/v0.3.0 was a breaking release. And every release after that was also a breaking change. We ultimately updated to v0.8.1, which had many breaking changes along the way. Updating our local nodes to use this, was breaking compatibility with our current kad-dht bootnode.\r\n\r\nAlso discvoveryV5 does not work well with our cluster nodes, they were unable to peer with external  peers and only were able to peer with local nodes. \r\n\r\nAlso related #5864 .
