  "body": "Currently each peer has their peer id as the primary basis for their node identity in our peer store. With the testnet restart to v0.11.1 coming up we will need to update it to include ENRs as being the primary basis for node identities.  Due to discovery now being primarily based on discoveryV5 instead of libp2p's kademlia dht, this change will be required. \r\n\r\nThings needed to be added to the `peerStatus` struct would be the peer's ENR and peer's metadata . Using the metadata sequence number we can validate whether attestation subnets are old/current. This issue is to track the resolution of the above.",
