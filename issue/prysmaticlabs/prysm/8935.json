  "body": "# üêû Bug Report\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAs reported by Sigma Prime, discovered via their https://github.com/sigp/beacon-fuzz tool, code generated by fastssz does not check that the beginning of the variable-size value offsets comes after the fixed size reason, leaving the unmarshaler open to unmarshaling corrupt data. A malformed or malicious encoded ssz value could use this mechanism to introduce corrupt data to prysm beacon nodes.\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> Yes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was: ....\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nA repro of the bug with unit test and fixture can be found in this pull request to fix the same issue in the ethereumapis repo: https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/ethereumapis/pull/243",
