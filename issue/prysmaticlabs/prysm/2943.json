  "body": "With all the important remianing items having been merged in to `spec-v0.6` branch, it is finally ready to be reviewed and merged. This issue will track whatever tasks that we will need to perform:\r\n\r\n- [x] Runtime Fixes. With the large velocity of changes that have occured over the past few months our runtime is broken. The goal is to get runtime working again and to have a beacon node run for at least a 100 slots from genesis.\r\n- [x] Mock out Genesis Trigger. With the genesis event being triggered by the node instead of the\r\nchainstart log from the deposit contract. We can mock it out during runtime for easier startup for testing.\r\n- [x] Clean Up unused/redundant tests, methods. This would involve looking through all the changes in the spec-v0.6 branch and compare that to our current codebase for code that is \r\noutdated.\r\n- [x] Improve code coverage across the repo, especially in the core, blockchain, sync package. Since these are critical to the functioning of our node, we should be testing all possible code \r\npaths.\r\n- [x] Begin refactor of db package, once this `spec-v0.6` is merged into master. We can start with\r\ncleaning up our db package and abstracting it better",
