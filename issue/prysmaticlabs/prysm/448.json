  "body": "Hi all,\r\n\r\nWe currently have an observer mode when running a beacon node by default, which means a node that does not interact with validators in order to advance the canonical chain, but instead just listens on the p2p network and performs block sync. We have yet to clearly define all of the roles of an observer node throughout our system and how important they are for the future. Opening this issue for visibility and discussion.",
