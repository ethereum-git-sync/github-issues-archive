This crystallized state file would solely handle the basic helper methods for it. Anymore logic pertaining to Casper would be taken out and shifted over",

Adding in the other stuff makes a lot of the tests hard to carry out and isolate bugs. One example is #572. We dont have to take out everything related to casper but stuff like rewards and penalties . \r\n\r\nIf you notice new state recalc is hard to test because there are so many moving parts to it. The conditions for state recalc, applying rewards/penalties imo should be in casper not crystallized state",
