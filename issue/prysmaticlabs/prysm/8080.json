    "body": "To Add On To This: \r\n\r\nAlternatively other than NTP/Roughtime, this is a protocol native method of determining the global beacon clock time and how far a local node deviates from it. Some important points to note:\r\n\r\n- Validators are only expected to be synced 12 seconds within each other.\r\n- This should instead only log a warning if there is a large difference between the global beacon clock and the local node's clock.\r\n- Any time measurement must only be taken from validated and processed blocks.( This is to prevent some external peer from sending junk) and influencing the calculated global 'clock' time. \r\n- `OnBlock` will most likely have to be modified to account to calculate this. \r\n- The relevant `processing` time will have to be accounted for when measuring for each reading.
