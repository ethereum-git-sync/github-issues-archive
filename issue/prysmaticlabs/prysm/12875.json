This is especially concerning for endpoints like the beacon API. \r\n\r\n**Details:**\r\n\r\n1. **Canonical Check**: Before serving blobs upon request, the server should verify if the blob is canonical. If it's canonical, it can serve right away.\r\n\r\n2. **Blob-Only Requests**: There are instances where blobs may be requested without their associated blocks. In such cases, the node should validate blobs are valid before responding to the peer.",
