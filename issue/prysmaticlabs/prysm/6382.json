It can be used when some program cannot be told to close its logfile and thus might continue writing (appending) to the previous log file forever. Note that there is a very small time slice between copying the file and truncating it, so some logging data might be lost. When this option is used, the create option will have no effect, as the old log file stays in place.\r\n\r\nI must admit, I have not tried using logrotate in practice. \r\nAt Prylabs, we use a fluentd daemon to stream logs to elasticsearch and write logs to tmpfs.
