This is a cosmetic issue only, 0e4cb68249892daa9e142ae6033da202c7fb01bb is the correct commit and that is what your log is indicating so you're running the correct code for alpha.16. \r\n\r\nI accidentally stamped the binary with the wrong git tag and DAppNode picked up the incorrectly stamped binaries before I could fix it.\r\n\r\ncc: @eduadiez \r\n\r\nEdu, if you could reupload the binary assets to DAppNode, then that would be great! The files here https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/releases/tag/v1.0.0-alpha.16 and the ones hosted at https://prysmaticlabs.com/releases have the correctly stamped binary for alpha.16.",
