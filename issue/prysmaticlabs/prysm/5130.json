    "body": "@prestonvanloon @rauljordan \r\n\r\n- I use Bazel \r\n- My particular case was building a remote wallet that connects to the validator, serves pub keys and signs. The remote wallet has the responsibility to prevent itself signing a slashable request. He gets BeaconBlockHeader/ AttestationData and needs to locally serialise them. Thats where the patch issue comes into play as we need the ssz tags to be equal, they will be equal if I apply the patch as well on a remote wallet (which is a different project)\r\nIt might cause other issues but that's where I encountered it.",
