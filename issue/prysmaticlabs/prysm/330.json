  "body": "In the current implementation, the p2p service connects to peers and subscribes to certain message topics. These message topics expect a specific protobuf message, although the peer could send anything into the topic.\r\n\r\nThe task is to add some validation that the received message on a topic is indeed the expected protobuf message type. If not, ignore the message (don't propagate it to feed subscribers). \r\nA simple implementation will disconnect the peer and add them to a blacklist if they are sending unexpected messages that cannot be deserialized.
