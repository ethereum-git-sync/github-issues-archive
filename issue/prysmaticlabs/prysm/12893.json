Subsequent attempts to revert using initial syncing have been unsuccessful. The associated error message is:\r\n```\r\nCould not process batch blocks due to missing parent\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n1. What causes the node to revert to initial syncing from its normal mode?\r\n2. Why is the node unable to successfully return to its previous state?\r\n3. Is the blob sidecar implicated in this behavior?",
