    "body": "Hey! Thanks for filing this. We resolved a few issues with sync today and you should be able sync and participate as a validator now. Your previous validator was ejected for not participating (at no fault of your own) so you'll need to create a new one. Follow the instructions on https://prylabs.net/participate to join as a new validator and be sure to follow step one to get the latest docker images. \r\n\r\nI'll close this for now, but feel free to open it up if you still have issues. Thanks!",
