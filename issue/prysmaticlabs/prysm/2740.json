Trees are also good but may not be memory efficient and could be  demanding.\r\n\r\nI am thinking that Bloom filters are what you need here. They are for membership related tasks. \r\nA Bloom filter is a data structure designed to tell you, rapidly and memory-efficiently, whether an element is present in a set. However it is a probabilistic data structure. A Bloom filter with m bits and k hashing functions, both insertion and membership testing are O(k). This is a great win and it decouple the set size from computation speed.\r\nhttps://llimllib.github.io/bloomfilter-tutorial/",
