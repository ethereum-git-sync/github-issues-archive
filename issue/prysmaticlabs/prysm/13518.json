I checked the node's account it's still has same balance before running validators.\r\nIf the settings for testnet doesn't need a deposit for staking, how to edit that settings to \"need to stake 32eth for running 1 validator\"?\r\n### Background\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Context and background information on the discussion...\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n",
