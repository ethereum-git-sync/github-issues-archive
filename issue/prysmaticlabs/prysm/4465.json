It appears that this is because it is not taking genesis time in to account, so calculating slots from current time rather than genesis (when genesis > now).  Also unsure it's taking in to account any current queue.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I don't have time to fix this one at current, so leaving it here as an issue.",
