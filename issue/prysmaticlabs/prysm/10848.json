  "body": "# üêû Bug Report\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen a prysm node is started up without a weak subjectivity checkpoint, the following log message is emited:\r\n```\r\n[2022-06-08 12:17:33]  INFO blockchain: No checkpoint for syncing provided, node will begin syncing from genesis. Checkpoint Sync is an optional feature that allows your node to sync from a more recent checkpoint, which enhances the security of your local beacon node and the broader network. See https://docs.prylabs.network/docs/next/prysm-usage/checkpoint-sync/ to learn how to configure Checkpoint Sync.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is a vestige of a previous iteration of checkpoint sync where weak subjectivity checkpoints were used. The bit about syncing from genesis is misleading, and the rest of it is worded too strongly - we shouldn't complain about weak subjectivity checkpoints not being specified when checkpoint sync doesn't really support them due to lacking a backfill capability.\r\n\r\n### Has this worked before in a previous version?\r\n\r\nwhile this log made a little more sense in the old model of checkpoint sync, it was never accurate to say the lack of a ws checkpoint would cause the node to sync from genesis.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n```\r\nbazel run //cmd/beacon-chain -- \\\r\n--prater \\\r\n--datadir=/var/lib/prysm/prater/checkpoint-sync \\\r\n--checkpoint-sync-url=http://localhost:3500 \\\r\n--genesis-beacon-api-url=http://localhost:3500 \\\r\n--enable-debug-rpc-endpoints \\\r\n--grpc-max-msg-size=55568081 \\\r\n--http-web3provider=http://localhost:8545 \\\r\n--monitoring-port=8081 \\\r\n--p2p-tcp-port=13001 \\\r\n--p2p-udp-port=12001 \\\r\n--pprofport=6061 \\\r\n--grpc-gateway-port=3501 \\\r\n--rpc-port=4001 \\\r\n--genesis-state /var/lib/prysm/prater/genesis.ssz \\\r\n--accept-terms-of-use\r\n```\r\n\r\n## üî• Error\r\n\r\nsee log message in issue description.\r\n\r\n**What version of Prysm are you running? (Which release)**\r\n\r\n`v2.1.3-rc.3`\r\n",
