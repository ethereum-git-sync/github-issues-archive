As a input data I have used real headers from eth1x mainnet (in RLP format) to provide a byte source as realistic as possible.\r\n\r\nThis is the benchmark for the compression of one header:\r\n\r\n```\r\nBenchmarkCompressOne/Snappy-8         5000000\t       312 ns/op\t       0 B/op\r\nBenchmarkCompressOne/GoZstd-8         200000\t      8506 ns/op\t       0 B/op\r\nBenchmarkCompressOne/Zstd-8           100000\t     17868 ns/op\t       0 B/op\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is the benchmark for the decompression of the same header:\r\n\r\n```\r\npkg: github.com/ferranbt/compression-test\r\nBenchmarkDecompressOne/Snappy-8       10000000\t       188 ns/op\t       0 B/op\r\nBenchmarkDecompressOne/GoZstd-8       5000000\t       355 ns/op\t       0 B/op\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have used a couple of Go memory tricks to 'avoid' memory allocation during the execution, that explains the 0 B/op during the benchmark.\r\n\r\nSnappy seem to outperform the other two. It may be because the snappy implementation includes assembly primitives and the others don't.\r\n\r\nThe compression ratio is:\r\n```\r\nzstd: 58.652254%\r\ngozstd: 55.766619%\r\nsnappy: 58.773186%\r\n```\r\n\r\n",
