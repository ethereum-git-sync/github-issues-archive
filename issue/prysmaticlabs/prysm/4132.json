  "body": "All of our RPC endpoints should return an error if the node is performing chain sync, otherwise, the returned data may be inaccurate or wrong to users and people building on our API such as block explorers. We should return `status.Error(codes.Unavailable, \"Node is currently syncing to head\")` if the node is syncing. \r\n\r\nWe currently do this for a few critical endpoints such as retrieving assignments [here](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/26da7c41143bd81d6af43089876dd9b683ff7245/beacon-chain/rpc/validator/assignments.go#L22) using an interface provided to the RPC servers called `SyncChecker`. We should extend this to all endpoints, ideally via some rule that applies to all so there won't be a need to copy paste the conditional everywhere.",
