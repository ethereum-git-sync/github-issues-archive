The genesis validators will reestablish the connection and continue running normally, but the new validator nodes will be stuck in the `unknown` state. It could be that they went successfully through the activation process, but the validator client fails to fetch the new state. This happens to me not the first time, wrote about it on discord some time ago.\r\n\r\n @rauljordan  I've pulled the latest docker images yesterday for both validator and beacon chain.",

Built at: 2019-11-19 19:37:43+00:00\r\n```\r\n@prestonvanloon the commit is after `13207a9`.\r\n\r\nFor protos, I use [python grpc](https://grpc.io/docs/quickstart/python/). The example compile command is the following:\r\n```\r\npython -m grpc_tools.protoc -I. -I$HOME/googleapis --python_out=. --grpc_python_out=. ./eth/v1alpha1/validator.proto\r\n```\r\nI haven't pulled new images since then. I will try to do that during the week and see whether I can still reproduce that.\r\n\r\n",
