It served us as a good term to differentiate us from the work happening in Eth1 coredev. However, as Ethereum is now moving toward the merge, Eth2 is a very dangerous term to continue using. We put users at greater risk of scam, confusion, and possibly criticism at how the proof of stake merge is handled.  \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWe propose that Prysmatic Labs as a client team takes a strong initiative to eliminate the term Eth2 from our lexicon, starting from our repository. It seems like a large endeavor, but should not really take too long if we are careful. We also need to amend any documentation, websites, and more aside from our codebase.\r\n",
