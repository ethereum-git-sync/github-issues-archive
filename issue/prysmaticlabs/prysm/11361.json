  "body": "# ðŸ’Ž Issue\r\n\r\n### Background\r\nWhen prysm is run without a weak subjectivity checkpoint specified, it currently prints a very ominous warning:\r\n`--weak-subjectivity-checkpoint not provided. Prysm recommends providing a weak subjectivity checkpoint for nodes synced from genesis, or manual verification of block and state roots for checkpoint sync nodes.`\r\n\r\nThis is causing users some angst, so we want to dial it down.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWe can just say:\r\n`--weak-subjectivity-checkpoint not provided.`\r\n\r\nIdeally we'd also link to documentation explaining the concept and how to obtain a weak subjectivity checkpoint from a beacon api.
