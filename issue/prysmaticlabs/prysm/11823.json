  "body": "We are expanding from #11579. Here we open up another set of todos for tracking the next phase for features around EIP4844 that Prysm should support\r\n\r\nBeacon-API\r\n- [x] Add `getBlobsSideCar` endpoint https://github.com/ethereum/beacon-APIs/pull/286\r\n\r\nValidator / Proposer RPC\r\n- [ ] Builder API support. The validator should be able to outsource block construction similar to today, where block construction also encompasses blob construction.\r\n\r\nCrypto library / KZG verifications \r\n- [ ] We should understand the geth internals. Are we happy with using whatever geth is using? Exploring tradeoffs may be worthwhile\r\n- [ ] Should we define trusted setup parameters within prysm, that way we can load the parameters and pass to the kzg library instead of trusting kzg library for *everything*\r\n\r\nSync\r\n- [x] Fix `beacon_block_and_blobs_sidecar_by_root`. Prysm node can't request `beacon_block_and_blobs_sidecar_by_root` from another Prsym node due to error `Stream reset`.  Fixed in https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/11621/commits/ec72575fc9d27eafe70b01d88476bd7930659b0e\r\n- [ ] Can sync blobs up to data availability period when using weak subjectivity sync. Backwards block sync may be required\r\n- [ ] Review peer scoring and rate limiting for serving blobs\r\n\r\nDatabase\r\n- [ ] If the blob is empty (ie zeros), don't write it to DB or cache\r\n- [ ] Is the current scheme good enough for empty blobs and pruning blobs?\r\n- [ ] CLI parameter to let Prysm use a different data directory for blobs. Blobs should have a low disk read-write access requirement so that HDD may be used. Migration tools too?\r\n\r\nPrysm internal\r\n- [x] Rename everything eip4844 to deneb ðŸ¦¢ \r\n- [ ] Better handling for zero blob sidecar. We shouldn't have to store it, and we shouldn't have to respond it upon request. That said, we should have a quick lookup to know if a slot has block with zero kzg commitment without having to unmarshal the block\r\n- [ ] Blind block handling for eip4844 block. Make sure nothing breaks for blob\r\n\r\nTooling\r\n- [ ] Extend prysmctl to download and upload blobs\r\n\r\nE2E test\r\n- [ ] Extend e2e test to EIP4844 behavior. Can submit and download blobs\r\n",
