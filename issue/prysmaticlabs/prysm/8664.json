  "body": "# ðŸ’Ž Issue\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\nWe have been working towards revamping our Prysm web UI to version 1, which comes with a lot more useful features and user experience improvements for the usability of Prysm. Based on user research and aligned with the direction of Prysm as an eth2 client that encourages a good user experience, we are redefining the purpose of our web UI.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the web UI is to be an **alternative to the CLI to manage Prysm and run validators**. It is **not** meant to be a block explorer by any means. This means we should stick to showing users information about their validators, their processes instead of showing greater information about the state of the network. We want to delegate this info as much as possible to block explorers. The web UI is meant to be **functional**. That is, we want easy access to the key actions a user can take and the key data a user wants to see right away.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish this, more work needs to be done in the frontend as it involves design work as well. However, there is important backend work to be done.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Wallet recover requests should add in a `language: string` property which allows users to pick a bip39 standard language for recovering their wallet from a mnemonic\r\n- [x] Add back the delete accounts RPC endpoints, previously reverted from Prysm\r\n- [x] Add an accounts voluntary-exit endpoint `/v2/validator/accounts/voluntary-exit`\r\n- [x] Add slashing protection import/export endpoints `/v2/validator/slashing-protection/import` and `export`\r\n- [x] Embed the built web UI using go1.16 file embed features\r\n\r\nThe required request types for these items above can be found [here](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm-web-ui/blob/2190e45f1ce4ce1613073d8eb198f19b702bc6e2/src/app/proto/validator/accounts/v2/web_api.ts#L219)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Starting with the Wallet recover request, \r\n\r\n- is it safe to say that the RecoverWallet  func needs to validate the new property input against the go-bip39 wordlists?  (although looking at go-bip39 it is not clear how you can generate Mnemonics with a language input, i'm chasing that..) \r\n- Also  If that new parameter (flag) is not specified is it defaulted to 'English'?\r\n- We are only concerned with recovery here, so we should not care about expanding on prysm Mnemonics validation to match bip39 specifications(every supported language has a word set) ?
