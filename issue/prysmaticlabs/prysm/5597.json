    "body": "Yes, basically instead of `--graffiti` we could have a `--graffiti-script` tag, that calls the specified script. E.g. ``--graffiti-script=\"echo -n protolambda\"`. And maybe provide it data through stdin. E.g. current slot, validator pubkey of proposer, encoded block body, or things like that.\r\nOthers can then also hook it up with their more advanced graffiti tooling, e.g. call a remote webserver for a new graffiti tag to use.\r\n\r\nAlso, it may be good to call this in advance of proposing the block, to not delay it too much. (A simple subprocess echo call is fine, a webserver request not so much)\r\n",
