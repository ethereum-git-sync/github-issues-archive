  "body": "# üêû Bug Report\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nCurrently when running a prysm node with nethermind, there are certain situations that trigger the beacon node to make very large amounts of `eth_blockNumber` requests(rather than batching it as expected). This would indicate that there maybe certain edge cases being hit which were not observed with geth. \r\n\r\nMaking large amounts of single block/log requests would indicate that the node infact has not synced with the historical headers/ logs. We only batch headers/logs when syncing, the fact that single requests are made indicates that the node thinks it is synced. However this indicates that it might not be the case when running with nethermind and therefore warrants investigation.   \r\n\r\n### Has this worked before in a previous version?\r\nN.A\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nRun the beacon node with `--pyrmont` with a synced nethermind goerli node providing the relevant \r\neth1 data. \r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Operating System:**\r\n\r\nWindows\r\n\r\n**What version of Prysm are you running? (Which release)**\r\n\r\nv1.05",

In order to investigate, will have to spin up a windows machine to dig deeper into it.",
