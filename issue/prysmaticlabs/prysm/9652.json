  "body": "# üêû Bug Report\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen specifying content type via an Accept header as `application/octet-stream`, instead of receiving the requested block as an ssz-encoded value, the following error is observed. Note that w/o an accept header or by specifying `application/json`, a correct json encoded payload is returned. So the issue seems to be with the handling of requests for ssz encoded values.\r\n\r\n### Has this worked before in a previous version?\r\n\r\nYes, this worked before I rebased my branch to pull in the changes to merge API serving on ports 3500/3501.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n`curl -H \"Accept: application/octet-stream\" -i -X GET http://127.0.0.1:3500/eth/v2/beacon/blocks/0x6639eb3e2077f42fc8833ede7f46f96ee81027c0bc5e3907d1a72ce29a9ad7cd`\r\n\r\n## üî• Error\r\n\r\n<pre><code>:\r\n\r\n{\"message\":\"could not unmarshal error: invalid character 'p' after top-level value\",\"code\":500}\r\n\r\n</code></pre>",
