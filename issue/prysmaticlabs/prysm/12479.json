I've successfully staked on three machines with 4 cores and 8GB of memory, all running Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS, and the network is currently producing blocks.\r\n### Description\r\nI've noticed some communication issues between my validator node and the beacon chain node.\r\nthat pic is validator log\r\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/assets/104292973/136e0b4b-42fd-43a1-a0fe-173133767bb9\">\r\n\r\nthat pic is beacon-chain log\r\n<img width=\"1520\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/assets/104292973/dd68e18b-a821-4fef-81dd-864db26cf08c\">\r\n\r\nThese issues have led to constant chain reorganizations. According to the logs, my guess is that the validator's proposal time exceeded the slot time window, causing it to miss out. However, I'm not entirely certain if this is the root cause. If it is, can you please let me know what the normal duration for a proposal to be submitted is? If not, I would greatly appreciate any assistance in troubleshooting this issue.",
