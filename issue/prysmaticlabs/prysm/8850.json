Currently the slasher is implemented as a separate process, so we don't have a good way to track this. But once https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/issues/8331 is merged, we will be able to add this to our payload.\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️--> A clear and concise description of the problem or missing capability...\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nOnce validator has been merged into beacon node, expose a prometheus metric to represent whether the slasher is active. Scrape this metric and use it to create the appropriate value for `slasher_active` in the client-stats payload.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️--> Have you considered any alternative solutions or workarounds?\r\n",
