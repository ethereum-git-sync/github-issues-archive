  "body": "Every epoch, Validators call the [CommitteeAssignment](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/master/beacon-chain/core/helpers/committee.go#L380) function to learn what their assignments are for the epoch requested. The problem currently is that the beacon node does all the computations for each individual validator rather than creating a cache to store all the assignments.\r\n\r\nThe function loops through all the committees for each slot every time it is called and checks for the requested validators index, which is incredibly inefficient. This can be improved by possibly creating an assignment map cache at the start of an epoch, and referring to that instead when the validator requests it.\r\n\r\n",
