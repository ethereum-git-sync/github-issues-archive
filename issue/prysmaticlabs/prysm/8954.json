  "body": "# ðŸ’Ž Issue\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\nCurrently for any epoch that we want to access, there are 2 methods:\r\n- Regenerate the State In Memory\r\n- Retrieve the Historical State From the DB.\r\n\r\nThe first method adds in additional work for the CPU, as state regeneration requires replaying all state transitions. While the latter requires increased size of the db. For any consumer requiring quick and efficient state lookups, they will always use the latter method as it is much faster. However doing so comes at an increased cost to the database size. This issue is to track improvements we can make for historical state persistence.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAny state saved, is saved in its entirety, which is 40 mb. Doing this for every epoch can lead to a very large db size for any user whom requires archival access. While snappy compression can bring this down to 14mb, this is still a very large amount to save per state. For 40,000 epochs this can go up to 400gb which is not sustainable. There are some points we can tackle to bring this size by orders of magnitude. \r\n\r\n### Potential Solutions\r\n\r\n- Have an anchor state to compare any future state with. Using this differential we can simply apply the diff over the anchor state to get the desired state. The size of the byte differential between states will be orders of magnitudes lower. Simply saving this would be more efficient to the db size.\r\n\r\n- Represent the State as trie in the db rather than a large binary blob. This could potentially reduce unnecessary persistence of the whole state for every epoch. However each epoch transition touches a lot of the big arrays in the state, so the benefit of doing this maybe limited/negligible. \r\n",
