At a minimum, Prysm's e2e tests should include the reference implementation in end to end testing to ensure there is no breakage between releases.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\n- Include remote signer component to some, but not all, of the validator components in e2e tests\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nNone\r\n",
