This can lead to situations where the block either never arrives or is invalid upon arrival, yet the blob sidecar remains saved in the DB.\r\n\r\n**Proposed Solutions:**\r\n1. Prune blob sidecar if it's older than the finalized epoch and has no associated block.\r\n2. Prune blob sidecar is not part of the canonical chain if it's older than the finalized epoch and its associated block.\r\n3. Prune blob sidecar if its associated block transitions from an optimistic status to an invalid status. (Note: This behavior might already be implemented)",
