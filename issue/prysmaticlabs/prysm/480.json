    "body": "I would like to hear more about how we can leverage modules in this project.\r\n\r\nFor the time being, we are supporting building via native go tooling and building via bazel. Occasionally, we have pain in our continuous integration linter since it fetches dependencies at HEAD and there are often breaking changes.\r\n\r\nIf we can easily peg specific versions of modules to make building by go easier then I would happily support that effort.
