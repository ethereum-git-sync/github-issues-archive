Currently, our API Middleware/ gRPC gateway setup doesn't allow us to return custom codes for successes (so only 200 ok) \r\n\r\nthese are the [current mappings](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/blob/22a95e12d5f30a61979d8b1c12d4d319232b2ac9/runtime/errors.go#L36)\r\nIdeally, we would like a way to override this for more custom codes such as 202 on our API returns. \r\n\r\nsome examples where this is used.\r\n\r\n1. [keymanager api set fee recipient](https://github.com/ethereum/keymanager-APIs/blob/master/apis/fee_recipient.yaml)\r\n2. [blinded_block](https://ethereum.github.io/beacon-APIs/?urls.primaryName=dev#/Beacon/publishBlindedBlock)\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nwe should provide a way to customize a new gRPC option for custom returns\r\nhttps://grpc-ecosystem.github.io/grpc-gateway/docs/mapping/customizing_your_gateway/#controlling-http-response-status-codes\r\n",
