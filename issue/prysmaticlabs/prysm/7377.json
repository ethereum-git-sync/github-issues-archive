    "body": "From the logs above it looks like the query is within the path `/home/me/.cache/bazel/_bazel_me/`, i.e. it's an issue with the relationship of bazel vs my system. I'm personally not familiar with Bazel as I'd tyically use gnu `make` in its place. With `make`, if a package is missing in my system I can fetch and install the package in a way tailored to my system. Being that Bazel works within that cache in  `/home/me/.cache/bazel/_bazel_me/`, I'd have to find the way Bazel wants that cached. I don't think I'm going to put more work into learning the ways of Bazel. But maybe this open issue could help others. ",
