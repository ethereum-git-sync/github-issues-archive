  "body": "Hello. I'm trying to sync prysm to a state where I can issue validator queries (getProposerDuties) for each epoch. The block range I'm interested in is all blocks starting at the merge, basically I want to be able to query the validator for every block since the merge.\r\n\r\nSo my idea was to do one full sync, export the block corresponding to the merge and then do a second sync using --checkpoint-block from that block.\r\n\r\nI'm now running prysm sync with \"--slots-per-archive-point=32\" for the first sync. The sync is insanely slow and the database grows a lot. After two days I am currently at endSlot=2309023, with the database having a size of 963G already.\r\n\r\nIs there a better way to achieve what I need? Thanks!",
