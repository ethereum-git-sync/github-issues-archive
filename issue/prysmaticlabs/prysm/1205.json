  "body": "As part of #1183, all services should maintain a Status method that will return an error if there is any unhealthy status to report. This task requires some creative thinking to evaluate a definition of a healthy service. It is possible that a service can always be healthy and in that case we would simply remove the TODO and update the godoc to explain why the service is always healthy.\r\n\r\nService definition: beacon-chain/rpc/service.go\r\n\r\nWhat makes this service healthy or unhealthy?\r\n\r\nIdeas:\r\n- If any of its dependent services are unhealthy, report unhealthy\r\n- If the grpcService is not listening for traffic (this failure just logs an error, and the process continues)",
