  "body": "Hi all,\r\n\r\nOur current block tree RPC endpoint [here](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/632f6797cd41d212cdbb5f588835943e079da84b/beacon-chain/rpc/beacon_server.go#L285) returns a giant list of all the blocks from the last justified slot to the current, canonical slot. It is quite inefficient to fetch and to serve to clients. Additionally, we should specify request parameters to fetch the blocks within a range of slots.\r\n\r\nAnother useful feature would be to expose a separate endpoint for attestation targets and vote counts. One can compute the vote counts on a tree with the method as we currently do in our beacon_server.go in our RPC folder:\r\n\r\n```go\r\n\tfor _, kid := range fullBlockTree {\r\n\t\tif ctx.Err() != nil {\r\n\t\t\treturn nil, ctx.Err()\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\tvotes, err := blockchain.VoteCount(kid, justifiedState, attestationTargets, bs.beaconDB)\r\n\t\tif err != nil {\r\n\t\t\treturn nil, err\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\tblockRoot, err := hashutil.HashBeaconBlock(kid)\r\n\t\tif err != nil {\r\n\t\t\treturn nil, err\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\ttree = append(tree, &pb.BlockTreeResponse_TreeNode{\r\n\t\t\tBlockRoot: blockRoot[:],\r\n\t\t\tBlock:     kid,\r\n\t\t\tVotes:     uint64(votes),\r\n\t\t})\r\n\t}\r\n```",

    "body": "Hi Guys,\r\n\r\nI'm trying to figure out which new APIs we can offer to 3rd party actors that want to query the beacon-chain service. Still learning , hope to have something within a few days. \r\nIn any case - I can see the potential for a heavy load of data that's queries and then returned to the client. In many enterprise systems - the transaction related functionality is separated from reporting functionality to minimize the effect that reporting requests have on the transaction related operational capability. \r\n\r\nSince there is no separation between transactional and reporting services -it looks to me that querying the tree might have similar consequences here. Regardless of how clients can query the beacon-chain service - I would recommend that **any** function that's used to query the tree will support paging to reduce amount of data retrieved and returned to the client.\r\nYour thoughts?",
