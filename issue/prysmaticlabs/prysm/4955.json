    "body": "We can't easily change the keystore format to have multiple passwords at this point, as it would break others' installations.  Probably best to do as @superphiz suggests and warn for any keys we cannot decode, but continue rather than exit.  I'll code something up to this effect.\r\n\r\nThe long-term solution is to move to the `wallet` keystore, which supports multiple passphrases.  I'll think of the best way to move ahead with a migration plan.",
