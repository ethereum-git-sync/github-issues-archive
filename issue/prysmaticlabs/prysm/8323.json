The majority of the times(if not all) this can be attributed to improper lock usage.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nIn the current form of how our current static analyzers are currently structured, we can have a similar one to prevent developers from inadvertently introducing recursive read locking/locking. Given that this is a deadlock condition that can eventually grind down our core beacon/validator processes to a halt, it is important to have a better way to detect errors such as these. \r\n\r\nBy parsing the AST of the respective files in the repository, we can determine where mutex locks are being improperly applied and remedy them. \r\n\r\nFor an example which illustrates this problem: \r\n#8314 \r\n#8321 \r\n#7905\r\n\r\nSome examples of analyzers currently being applied in Prysm:\r\nhttps://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/tree/develop/tools/analyzers\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nAs far as I am aware there have been no external static linting tools/ analyzer to check for improper lock usage.",
