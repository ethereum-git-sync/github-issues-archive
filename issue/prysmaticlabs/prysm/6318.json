  "body": "# ðŸš€ Feature Request\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIt is very useful for the purposes of debugging to have a record of the average latency of any peer responses that we have received from our scheduled pings. \r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nFor each ping message we send out, we can record the time taken for the peer to respond and then measure moving average of all response times. This allows us to determine the relative quality of a peer depending upon the latency of its responses. \r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nPrometheus Metrics could also be used for this, but given that libp2p already has a metrics handler/method for this purpose it would be better to go with it.\r\n\r\nRelated to #6304 ",
