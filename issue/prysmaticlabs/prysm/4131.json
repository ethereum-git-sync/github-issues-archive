  "body": "Hi all,\r\n\r\nCurrently for our API and canonical types used in Prysm we are now using https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/ethereumapis. However, that repo is meant to be more of a reference for anyone looking to find an eth2 API and have an understanding of its schema.  In reality, we need to add a few modifications for it to be usable in Prysm, such as adding struct tags to the generated protobufs for SSZ and other changes.\r\n\r\nTo do this, we were able to apply patch rules using bazel in the `third_party` directory of Prysm. This allows us to tell bazel to modify certain lines of ethereumapis to include stuff we need so it is usable in Prysm. As such, any future changes to ethereumapis will need to be reflected in the patch file in the `third_party` directory. This is an issue to track adding a comprehensive README to that directory explaining why it is needed as well as how to update its contents correctly.",
