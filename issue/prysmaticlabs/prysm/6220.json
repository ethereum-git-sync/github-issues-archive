  "body": "### Background\r\n\r\nValidator accounts management is the weakest part of our codebase as it stands today, providing very little in terms of UX, security, and documentation necessary for production. Among some of the questions we receive on a frequent basis are:\r\n\r\n- How can I move around my validator to a different computer? Is there something I need to do to move my withdrawal key to cold storage?\r\n- I had an account on a different computer I want to move to this computer, but the account had a different password\r\n- How can I list my public keys / private keys?\r\n- How can I regenerate my deposit data for my validator?\r\n- What is the keymanager? What are keymanageropts? What are all these flags? There is no documentation for any of this\r\n- Is there documentation for accounts management? How can I provide a remote signer?\r\n\r\n## TODOs\r\n\r\n### General\r\n\r\n- [x] Split accounts v1/ and v2/ code into separate packages\r\n- [x] Define and implement `prysm validator accounts-v2` commands: `new, list, import, export`\r\n- [x] Ensure all commands work in both interactive vs. non-interactive\r\n- [x] Define and implement `prysm validator wallet-v2` commands `create, edit-config`\r\n- [x] Integrate into validator runtime\r\n- [x] Add comprehensive accounts-v2 documentation to https://docs.prylabs.network\r\n- [x] Support altona key creation with feature flags\r\n\r\n### Direct Keymanager (Non-HD)\r\n\r\n- [x] Fully implement with proper tests and godocs\r\n- [x] Print withdrawal keys to stdout instead of persisting them\r\n- [x] Sanitize and enforce secure passwords\r\n- [x] Allow for regeneration of deposit data\r\n- [x] Allow adding validator keys while validator client is running #5202\r\n\r\n### Remote Keymanager\r\n\r\n- [x] Implement a reference example using gRPC: see [prysmaticlabs/remote-signer](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/remote-signer)\r\n- [x] Implement in Prysm, allowing for initialization of a new remote keymanager by passing in required options such as a grpc remote address and TLS cert paths\r\n- [x] Add comprehensive tests and godocs\r\n\r\n### Derived Keymanager (HD hierarchical deterministic)\r\n- [x] Implement according to [EIP-2333](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2333)",

    "body": "One of our contributors, @rkapka, mentioned all of these useful points:\r\n\r\n> I have been thinking what other operations might be useful apart from merging ans splitting and here are my proposals:\r\n\r\n- Export - the user specifies a source directory, a target directory and a list of public keys k_1..k_n whose data should be exported from the source directory's database. A new database containing the exported data is created in the target directory.\r\n- Question: Should the exported data be removed from the source database? Maybe add a boolean flag to control this?\r\n- Import - the user specifies a source directory and a target directory. All data from the source database is copied to the target database.\r\n- Move - the user specifies a source directory, a target directory and a list of public keys k_1..k_n whose data should be moved from the source directory's database to the target directory's database.\r\n- Question: Should the moved data be removed from the source database? Maybe add a boolean flag to control this?\r\n- Split (k_1..k_n) - splitting currently creates one database for each source database's key. Add a flag that allows to specify keys whose data should be split from the rest. As a result, two new databases are created: one with data for keys k_1..k_n and one with data for the rest of the keys. The source database stays untouched (this behaviour will be consistent with the \"regular\" split).\r\n- Question: Splitting one database into N databases will be tedious in case N is not a very small number. The keys could be passed in a more complicated manner, e.g. [k_1..k_n],[k_x..k_y]. As an example, passing [k1,k2],[k3,k4,k5] would create three databases:\r\ndata for k1 and k2\r\ndata for k3, k4 and k5\r\ndata for the rest of keys (if there are any left)\r\n- Export could be achieved using Move by creating a new database if the target directory does not contain one. Import could be achieved using Move by moving all keys over to the target database if no keys have been provided. I am wondering if it is better to have multiple operations, each doing their own thing, or a single powerful operation. Or maybe both?\r\n\r\n",
