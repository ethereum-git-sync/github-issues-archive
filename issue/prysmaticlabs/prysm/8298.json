We believe it's an issue with how Prysm believes deposits should exist in blocks is causing state root failures as Prysm has a different idea of block poststate from other clients\r\n\r\nThe issue seems to go back to normal after a certain amount of time if no deposits are seen, but will manifest itself every eth1 voting period (around every 4 hours), which is giving  us breathing room to identify and resolve the problem",
