Due to the recent AWS outage, its important to have multiple endpoint support just incase if the primary ETH1 fails, beacon node will then fallback to the secondary URL. Then if the primary endpoint recovers then start to switch from secondary to primary\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nModify the beacon node code to accept multiple endpoints, and if the first URL fails, fallback to the second one.. Maintain a polling call to all endpoints for health checks. If they are healthy then recover to the first URL.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nAs of now this is handled outside the application level which can be on NGINX / proxies. But its best to move this to application code.\r\n",
