This is a tracking issue for any desired changes from the team and the community.\r\n\r\n### Ideas\r\n\r\n- [x] Deprecate the `--http-web3provider` flag to something more idiomatic. This will be the most important flag for the merge, as running an execution node is a requirement when participating in the Ethereum network\r\n- [x] Delete all currently deprecated flags\r\n- [x] Rename import paths to /v3/ to help with Go downstream imports\r\n- [ ] Rename all the fork-related protobufs from V1, V2, V3 to phase0, altair, bellatrix (relevant to the signing request protobufs)\r\n",

    "body": "> * [ ]  Validator client: Support REST connection to consensus client. This would allow the Prysm validator client to be used in setups that use a diverse set of consensus clients, with the validator client having a list of three or more different consensus clients in its configuration.\r\n\r\nHi @yorickdowne , this task involves implementing a new validator client software entirely from scratch, completely different than the one we use today. We estimate this task would take at least half a year including testing and confidence boosting, as the Prysm validator client has been in production for years and is one of the riskiest pieces of our codebase. Having a brand new one incurs a lot of risk on stakers if not tested thoroughly. We have ruled this out in the short term, as it is unreasonable given our other priorities such as the merge and sharding",
