That day everything went fine and my effectiveness went up back to perfect. I also tried the web interface via ssh port forwarding and it looks great. But 2h ago, all the validators went offline for about 1h. I restarted both services, the validator and the beaconchain and now they are back online. I haven't had any problems with offline going clients before.\r\n\r\nWhen the validator were offline, I checked the web interface and there weren't any logs for the validator available, just the empty window.\r\n\r\nThe Server was online all the time. Now the validators are back for one our without any warnings. Seems on discord more people have the problem with 1.1.0\r\nI used Somers Guide  on Medium to set up everything. Would a rollback to 1.0.5 be the same update procedure like this:\r\n<img width=\"758\" alt=\"update process\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7690840/106874032-65633600-66d5-11eb-8ca0-0218f19a66b4.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there a way to use the default Prysm.sh commands from the documentation even though I used his tutorial?\r\nhttps://someresat.medium.com/guide-to-staking-on-ethereum-2-0-ubuntu-prysm-56f681646f74\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Has this worked before in a previous version?\r\n\r\n<!-- Did this behavior use to work in the previous version? -->\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> Yes, the previous version in which this bug was not present was:  v.1.0.5 \r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease let us know how we can reproduce this issue.
