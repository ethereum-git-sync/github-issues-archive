  "body": "# ðŸš€ Feature Request\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nUsers are accustomed to prysm tolerating one-time flags being present across restarts, like the location of the genesis state, only used during db initialization on the first run of prysm. Currently the checkpoint sync flags -- `--checkpoint-sync-url` and `--genesis-beacon-api-url` -- will cause the checkpoint sync block+state to be downloaded and set as most recently finalized on every restart. This is going to cause a mess in the database, particularly when we implement backfill. \r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nIgnore these flags at startup if the database has already been initialized.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\n- expand our mechanism of tracking gaps in chain history to allow checkpoint sync to fast-forward to the given block. this would be advantageous in that a node that has been offline could get up to speed faster. downside would that flags could become out of date, pointing to a file or URI that is no longer present.\r\n- log an error and exit\r\n\r\nboth of these ideas cause different behavior than our other one-time flags, so may contradict user expectations.",
