  "body": "Typically engine API has backward compatibiliy. The issue Deneb e2e test is facing now is due same version by adding a new argument (NewPayloadV3 + eip4788). If Prysm uses NewPayloadV3 with eip4788 and geth doesnt. Prysm won’t be able to interop with geth. Currently geth only has eip4788 on lightclient’s devnet8 branch. This is only needed for deneb e2e tests.\r\nTo move forward, e2e changes will remain in a separate branch. All the other bigger refactors to block processing, sync, etc can be transformed into `develop`. Typically in every fork, e2e changes are always the last to be in anyway",
