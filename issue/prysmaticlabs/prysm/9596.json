  "body": "# üêû Bug Report\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n**Problem statement:** my node is missing attestations on a regular basis. Approx. every 2 days one of my validators misses an attestation. \r\n\r\nI did not had these issues in the past and it got worse with the latest update to 1.4.4 to which I updated September 2nd. I only had 3 missed attestations in August, but already 7 in September and there is still half a month to go... \r\n\r\nI checked with the existing issues but can't see that those are related. For example, I am running on a dedicated host with 4 Ryzen CPUs and see no CPU spikes. Total CPU utilization is always below 10%. On my node, I am running the beacon-node and 2 validators. Nothing more. \r\n\r\nI also checked if it might be related to time sync issues, but my NTP is running fine and I don't see a problem there either. \r\n\r\nI also reduced the amount of peers connected, but nothing changed. \r\n\r\n**Parameters:**\r\nbeacon-chain.yaml\r\n```datadir: /home/xxx/prysm/data\r\naccept-terms-of-use: true\r\nlog-file: /home/xxx/prysm/logs/beaconchain.log\r\nhttp-web3provider: https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/xxxxx\r\np2p-host-ip: \"xxxx\"\r\n#p2p-max-peers: 70\r\nfallback-web3provider: \r\n  - https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/xxx\r\n```\r\nvalidator.yaml\r\n```log-file: /home/xxx/prysm/logs/validator.log\r\nwallet-password-file: /home/xxx/prysm/walletpassword\r\ngraffiti: \"xxx\"\r\nenable-duty-count-down: true\r\n```\r\n\r\n## üî• Error\r\n\r\nI can see these error types, where \"Could not submit...\" is the most frequent (the other one only appeared once)\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n[2021-09-02 15:07:23] ERROR validator: Could not request attestation to sign at slot error=rpc error: code = DeadlineExceeded desc = context deadline exceeded pubKey=0x994d552b4f80 slot=1980334\r\n\r\n[2021-09-09 16:21:07] ERROR validator: Could not submit attestation to beacon node error=rpc error: code = DeadlineExceeded desc = context deadline exceeded pubKey=0x994d552b4f80 slot=2031102\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Operating System:**\r\n**Host:**\r\n- dedicated root VM with 4 CPUs (non-shared) and \r\n- 16 GB RAM\r\n- Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS with latest updates\r\n\r\n**What version of Prysm are you running?
