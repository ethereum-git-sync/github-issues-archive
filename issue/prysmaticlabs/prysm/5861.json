Someone had an issue that could be resolved by implementing a command that allows changing the validator's password. I believe it should be easy to implement - in fact the code in the linked PR already does this at some point. I am happy to submit another PR if this functionality would be useful.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nCreate a command `validator accounts change-password` that asks for the old password and for a new password. As a result the key files are encrypted with the new password.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nA workaround will be possible by using the `validator accounts merge` command from the linked PR, The user could move the key files to some other directory and merge them back to the desired directory, changing the password in the meantime. A true workaround :wink:",

These doubts boil down to me not understanding the difference between validators/accounts and how they are exactly related to key files.\r\n\r\nFor example, if there are two pairs of key files in one directory, how can the user specify which pair they want to encrypt using a different password? Should the user provide the name of any one of the files from a pair? Or maybe some kind of an account/validator ID?\r\n\r\nI mentioned my lack of knowledge on Discord: https://discordapp.com/channels/476244492043812875/667763844365680650/710607681949401119",
