  "body": "# üêû Bug Report\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nHi, I can't upgrade my validators as version `v1.0.0-alpha.25` introduced a breaking change of moving `validator.db` from `data` directory to the `wallet` directory. In the Kubernetes environment where these two directories are separated (one is mounted as `rw` and is PV and another is mounted as `ro` and is Kubernetes secret), there is no way to combine those two under the same path.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a way to separate `validator.db` and `wallet` directories.\r\n\r\n### Has this worked before in a previous version?\r\n\r\nYes, it has stopped working after introducing the following change: https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/7176\r\n",
