We pick a number randomly from 1 to max\r\n// uint64 and then multiply the signature by it. We continue doing this for all signatures and its respective pubkeys.\r\n```\r\nAt the same time, 0s are possible in Read() function. If the PRNG behaves correctly, the chance of this happening is negligible, but as a defense-in-depth measure, we would recommend enforcing a non-zeroness check.\r\n",
