  "body": "# üêû Bug Report\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe finalized-checkpoint in the genesis state has a zeroed root, so the Status should have a zeroed root too. However, Prysm used the actual block-root, equal to the head, and seems to ban others with a different finalized root. Lighthouse correctly follows the spec, but gets banned by the Prysm nodes because of this.\r\n\r\n### Has this worked before in a previous version?\r\n\r\nI was aware of the wrong root, but not the banning, and thought it was a non-issue first. But @paulhauner brought the banning to my attention, and it might have gone unnoticed with Schlesi luanch, since the genesis was so fast/small. After first finalized epoch however, it should start working.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nSee lighthouse and prysm status messages on Witti testnet.\r\n\r\n## üî• Error\r\n\r\nPeerstore dump of lighthouse where you can clearly see the status of each prysm peer:\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/protolambda/905d8223f28f8f9dd3c3d5fd211bb41c\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\nRunning `:witti` docker image, and lighthouse with PR 1201 merged in (more lenient ENRs)\r\n\r\n`gcr.io/prysmaticlabs/prysm/beacon-chain   witti               b958a7f62bbe `\r\n",
