  "body": "When starting a beacon-node, prysm replays all blocks starting from the finalized node up to the latest known head from the database, repopulating its fork-choice. Prysm assigns as `justified_checkpoint`  the last known justified checkpoint of the branch, which may not coincide with the actual justified checkpoint of the node.\r\n\r\nConsider the scneario:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  Epoch N-1   |    Epoch N       |   Epoch N+1\r\n              |                  |\r\nA <- B <- C <-  D <- E <- F <- G <- H <- I <- J <- K\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt the start of epoch N, epoch N-1 has not been justified, block D has enough votes to justify A, and at the start of epoch N+1 block H will have A as `H.justified_checkpoint` while block D will have a lower justified checkpoint in epoch N-2. \r\n\r\nIf the node operator decides to restart the beacon, block D will be sent to forkchoice having A and thus epoch N-1 as justified. In normal circumstances this would not affect operations since the head is a descendant of D. However, after Bellatrix, the whole chain `E <- ... <- K` may have been synced optimistically, and be actually invalid. In this case the beacon node will have to revert to `D` as head, but this is impossible, since `D` post-state justified point is in epoch N-2 and forkchoice believes it should be N-1, therefore deadlocking the node. \r\n\r\nThis issue requires some design decisions. Teku saves the justified checkpoint of every non-finalized block to dbase and prunes it after finalization.",
