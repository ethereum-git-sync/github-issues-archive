  "body": "# ðŸš€ Feature Request\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, a versioned docker tag and a `latest` tag exist, where `latest` tracks development on `master`.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these two, a `stable` tag would be useful, that tracks latest release. This makes docker tooling easier,\r\nas there's no need to change configuration files with a new release.\r\n\r\nI have no opinion on the exact name of such a tag. There might be a `release-1.x` as well or instead, to go with semantic versioning and avoid pulling in breaking changes, similar to how geth has `stable` and `release-1.9`.\r\n",
