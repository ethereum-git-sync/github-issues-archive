(Which release)**\r\n\r\n3.1.1\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant (validator index / public key)?**\r\n\r\nThere seems to be a similar issue that was raised couple of years ago.\r\nhttps://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/issues/5830\r\n\r\nIt seems that during keys addition process WEB UI will spawn multiple validate processes on the backend in parallel. \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31506341/194041185-981b1ba0-9ea8-401e-930a-7e0ebeee5851.png)\r\n\r\nThis results in significant spikes on the validator side. \r\n\r\nExample: adding 20 keys: (5+ GB spike)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31506341/194041531-ab0f76f4-36bc-46ac-b996-17ff3c9a032c.png)\r\nExample: adding 100 keys (25+ GB spike)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31506341/194041776-3044bbaf-9957-4a44-83a2-90c4e6f9be51.png)\r\n\r\nIt is worth mentioning that after keys addition POD RAM consumption returns to normal values ~100-500MB RAM after 2-3 minutes.\r\n\r\n### Suggested Fix\r\nIs it possible to validate 1 key at a time (not doing it in parallel) freeing up memory after each validation? \r\nIt will take more time that will not result in such huge memory spikes. \r\n",

    "body": "@james-prysm the situation is the same with already created wallet. \r\nTried importing 10 keys on a small validator instance (2GB RAM) and validator pod failed in 5 seconds. \r\n\r\n`LAST SEEN   TYPE      REASON      OBJECT                                          MESSAGE\r\n4m13s       Warning   SystemOOM   node/ip-10-10-2-60.us-east-2.compute.internal   System OOM encountered, victim process: validator, pid: 29987`\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31506341/194473675-f341bf55-5f6f-40e8-b52c-1ec850f20817.png)\r\n\r\nAs well I would like to add that this validation process in UI is a bit confusing: \r\n1) When you type the keystore password - the prysm client will try to decrypt the keys right away as you type (you don't really see this except through the WEB console). \r\nIf your typing is not fast enough you will get failed validations before you actually finished typing. \r\n2) When the validation process kicks in and you try to press \"continue\" - there will be no effect until the validation process finishes. This might be especially confusing since validation process for 100 keys can take up to 30+ seconds. and during this time the WEB UI will not react on \"continue\" button. \r\n\r\nAny indication for the validation process and greyed-out continue button might be a good solution for this process. \r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n",
