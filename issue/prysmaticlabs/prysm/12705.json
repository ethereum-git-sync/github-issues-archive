  "body": "# ðŸš€ Feature Request\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nprysm does logging to STDOUT and can log to a file via `--log-file`. When a logfile is configured prysm should not log to STDOUT.\r\nRight now we have `--log-file` enabled to persist the logging in the filesystem but because prysm is logging to STDOUT too, all logs are logged via systemd/syslog, too.\r\n\r\nThis redundancy is not necessary.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nDisable logging to STDOUT when logging into a file has been enabled via `--log-file`.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nAlternative via systemd service file:\r\n\r\nBefore\r\n\r\n```\r\n[Service]\r\nExecStart=prysm --log-file=/data/prysm.log .....\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[Service]\r\nExecStart=prysm .....\r\nStandardOutput=append:/data/prysm.log\r\n```",
