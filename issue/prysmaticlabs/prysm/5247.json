  "body": "If I understand correctly, the voting summary should normally show all epochs as correctly voted. However, I get lots (>50%) of epochs where only source & target are correct and the head vote is incorrect. This is also reflected in the attestation rewards, which are generally low or even negative for my validator (index 41644).\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell there are no warnings or errors for the incorrect epochs, neither in the validator nor the beacon-client logs.\r\n\r\nIs this a common issue? What could be the reason, network issues? \r\n\r\nSetup is an ARM64 machine running prysm 0.3.8, but earlier versions & earlier testing on an AMD64 machine showed the same picture. Newtork-wise I am on LTE broadband, so NAT with no publicly accessible ports. Goerli is provided by a locally running geth instance.",
