  "body": "**Background**\r\nIn the current spec, new blocks are allowed to advance the chain every `slotDuration` seconds. As a concrete example, if the genesis block is published at time `T`, the first block can be published at time `T+slotDuration`, the second block time `T+2*slotDuration`, etc. Prysm currently has a naive implementation that uses the standard library [Ticker](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#NewTicker), but it has two issues. \r\n\r\n1. The clock doesn't tick precisely at `T+N*slotDuration`, where `N` is a non-negative integer. This means that the ticker will be \"off beat\" from the correct beat, even if the interval length is correct.\r\n2. The clock may drift over time. The ticker uses a monotonic clock, meaning that it won't adjust to miniscule inaccuracies in the interval length. This is an issue if we expect the beacon chain to run for days/weeks/months.\r\n\r\n**Requirements**\r\nReplace the current naive ticker with a ticker that addresses both issues above. It's probably best to confirm that clock drift is an issue, although [this thread](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/19810) seems to confirm that it is. The thread also contains a sample solution by Russ Cox -- that may be helpful :smiley:  ",
