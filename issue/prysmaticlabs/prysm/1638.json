  "body": "Currently our tree hashing algorithm does not do any caching at different heights of the merkle tree which leads to a runtime complexity of O(n) when computing the merkle root. This has lead to a bottleneck when computing the merkle root of a large object, leading to much larger times needed for performing state transitions. A PR to resolve this issue will add in caching to the tree, to reduce the time complexity of the algorithm ",
