The other 2 loggers are the geth logger and ipfs logger, these 2 loggers are only activated when we want trace logging. However due to them being different loggers, having all 3 of them in a single screen is confusing and difficult to read. \r\n\r\nTo resolve this issue, we would need to unite all the relevant `libp2p` and `discoveryV5` logs into logrus.
