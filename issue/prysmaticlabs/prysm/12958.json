  "body": "# ðŸ¦„ HTTP Endpoint Cleanup Tracking\r\n\r\n### Feature Description\r\n\r\nNow that all the validator client endpoints have been modified to be HTTP endpoints we need to clean up a few things before moving on to converting the rest of the Beacon API.\r\n\r\n### Tasks\r\n\r\n- [x] Remove the validation package\r\n- [ ] Change `s.V1Alpha1Server.GetBeaconBlock` call in `produceBlockV3` to use the `core` package instead\r\n- [ ] Write documentation on how to add new custom endpoints\r\n- [ ] Add a page with dedicated documentation for each endpoint\r\n- [ ] Handle Cors on all endoints\r\n- [x] Support comma-separated query values in a more future-proof way than https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/12966\r\n- [ ] Remove validation package from `beacon-chain/rpc/eth/shared/structs_blocks.go`\r\n- [ ] Move structs to a `structs` package and group them into definition-`ToConsensus`-`FromConsensus` for each type\r\n- [ ] Decide whether `ToConsensus` functions should start with a nil check\r\n- [ ] Decide on a common uint encoding pattern in `ToConsensus` functions. `fmt.Sprintf` is less verbose than `strconv`.\r\n- [ ] Allow SSL\r\n- [ ] Use `DecodeHexWithLength` in `ToConsensus` functions\r\n- [ ] Use the exact param name inside handlers in calls to `ValidateHex`/`ValidateUint`\r\n- [ ] Static analyzer checking that `HandleError` is always followed with `return` \r\n- [ ] Versioning scheme for custom endpoints\r\n- [ ] Rename `http` package to `httputil` to avoid aliasing in every handler file\r\n\r\nThis issue should be closed after all of the above tasks are complete.\r\n",
