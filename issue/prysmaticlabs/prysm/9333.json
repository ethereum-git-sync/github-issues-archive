  "body": "There is risk in user-provided file inputs regarding separators and other file path semantics that could lead users to specify an unintended file to Prysm. This is covered by popular go security linter, [gosec](https://github.com/securego/gosec) with the following rule G304.\r\n\r\n```go\r\nfunc File2lines(filePath string) ([]string, error) {\r\n    f, err := os.Open(filePath) // Arbitrary input from user, anything could happen!\r\n    if err != nil {\r\n        return nil, err\r\n    }\r\n    defer f.Close()\r\n    return linesFromReader(f)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTake from the example in stack overflow [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52320708/how-to-handle-gosec-linter-warning-potential-file-inclusion-via-variable/52321435).\r\n\r\nWe foresee the risk of not sanitizing arbitrary user input as mild as an error on using a command and as potentially as severe as accidental slashing by a user providing an incorrect validator datadir and wallet from bad inputs. Recommendation is to use path.Clean on every accepted user input, with some common base path if possible.",
