  "body": "# ðŸ’Ž Issue\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\nCurrently Prysm will dial all IPs its receives from discovery. While most of the ENRs we receive are valid, there also quite a bit of them which are mostly just junk, with unreachable IPs stored in them. This issue is to start a discussion on whether prysm should restrict dialing private IPs by default.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAs brought up in #11737 and these comments: \r\nhttps://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/issues/8459#issuecomment-1253241945\r\nhttps://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/issues/8459#issuecomment-1304424622\r\n\r\nThis is a common issue faced by users running via cloud providers as the provider ends up locking them out due to 'suspicious' activity. Most users running on mainnet will never need to peer with a node running on a private ip as they are usually running on a home network or via a cloud provider and are single node operators. However making this option the default will break most(if not all prysm) nodes running on devnets and local testnets as these nodes will not be able to make any outbound dials to valid nodes( which are run locally on private ips). \r\n\r\nTherefore if we were to make this the default, we would need to introduce this in a major version release as it is a breaking change. This could be added into our `v4` release which will intoduce support for the capella hard-fork.  ",
