  "body": "I have participated in the testnet since last week, due to network issue or somthing else, my validator offten got ejected! I have tried in many ways to get it back but only result in failure. I have to redo the participation process from scratch. #2677 \r\nSo here comes my question on the validator participation in the beacon chain:\r\n\r\n> according to the  <https://prysmaticlabs.gitbook.io/prysm/how-prysm-works/validator-deposit-contract> of last sentense \r\n`we emit a ChainStart log which sets the genesis time of Ethereum 2.0 to be 24 hours from when the threshold was reached`. \r\n\r\nThis message can be seen from the validator client output. The genesis time is about `24 hours` from the current time. It could really give sufficient time to prepare the clients ready for the networks. \r\n\r\nIt`s perfect for the node starting from scratch. But how about the those existing validators who were ejected from the active validator list by network issue, or any other unexpected reasons? What could be done through operation to make them back to the active list?\r\n\r\ne.g. a new deposit be sent to the validator via the smart contract to make the deposit value above the lowest validator? Then it could be back to the list?",

I mean if there is any design mechanism for the validator`s role life cycle management, e.g.\r\n```\r\nvalidator(bonded beyond the minimum deposit)-→activated to the active set-→ absent or some misbehavior with result **Eject**-→...\r\n```\r\nWhat is the following procedure should the validator itself take actively to make it back to the active list again?\r\nThere is  some reference in the POS, e.g. cosmos project. Here is some clue on its design explanation:[validator in cosmos](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/master/docs/spec/staking/02_state_transitions.md#validators)\r\nSo I think there could also be similar mechanism design here, but I`m not sure...",
