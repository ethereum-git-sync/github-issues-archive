They are not documented anywhere making them hard to find and use properly. We would like to have a page similar to https://ethereum.github.io/beacon-APIs/?urls.primaryName=v2.4.2 that describes custom Prysm endpoints.\r\n\r\nThe exact design is unknown at this point. We can probably leverage some Go package to generate the spec from the definitions.\r\n",
