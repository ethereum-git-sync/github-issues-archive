  "body": "Thanks @tzapu for the suggestion - we're a big fan of eth2stats.io and many users would benefit from being able to see how their node fares compared to others in the network and feel like they have a sense of participation greater than just reading cli logs. We can suggest users to navigate to https://eth2stats.io/add-node after they start their node from our https://prylabs.net/participate portal and also suggest them to check out the 2 block explorers available.",
