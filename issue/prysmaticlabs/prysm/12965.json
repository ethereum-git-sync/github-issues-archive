Could be also in RolesAt(..) method.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Has this worked before in a previous version?\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### ðŸ”¬ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Start Prysm Client with multiple validators using web3signer remote signer.\r\n2. Reject signatures in one of the signatures\r\n3. Intermittently, other validators are not working properly.\r\n\r\n### Error\r\n\r\n```\r\ntime=\"2023-09-15 13:11:48\" level=error msg=\"Could not get validator roles\" error=\"could not check if a validator is an aggregator: http: ContentLength=346 with Body length 0\"\r\n\r\ntime=\"2023-09-15 13:15:12\" level=error msg=\"Failed to subscribe to subnets\" error=\"could not check if a validator is an aggregator: http: ContentLength=346 with Body length 0\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Platform(s)\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### What version of Prysm are you running?
