  "body": "# üêû Bug Report\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n`rpchelpers.ValidateSync` is used to make sure the beacon node is synced before responding from rpc methods that require a correct head state, like Weak Subjectivity. Currently if this helper method fails to serialize json or has other internal processing errors when constructing a response body describing the sync status, it will respond with grpc code `InvalidArgument`. This translates to HTTP status 400 \"bad request\", which means the request was somehow malformed:\r\n``` The 400 (Bad Request) status code indicates that the server cannot or\r\n   will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be\r\n   a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request\r\n   message framing, or deceptive request routing).\r\n```\r\nHTTP 500 would be a more correct status code response.\r\n\r\n### Has this worked before in a previous version?\r\n\r\nno\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nMake a request during initial-sync to an endpoint using this helper, like `/eth/v1/validator/duties/attester/{epoch}`. \r\n\r\n## üî• Error\r\n\r\n Observe HTTP 400 status code.\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Operating System:**\r\n\r\nany\r\n\r\n**What version of Prysm are you running? (Which release)**\r\n\r\nv2.0.6\r\n",
