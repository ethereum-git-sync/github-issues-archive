  "body": "# ðŸš€ Feature Request\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nBeing able to monitor our inclusion distance over time, and ideally calculate the attestation effectiveness of our validator node would help stakers noticing when there's potentially an issue with our node causing our attestations to be broadcast late OR worse, not at all.\r\nAn example for me, during this period of non-finality was that the default max-peers (3) was causing some attestations to never be included, and an avg. distance of 2.5. Increasing this helped substantially. \r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nadd a `inclusion_distance` and an `attestation_effectiveness` metrics\r\n",
