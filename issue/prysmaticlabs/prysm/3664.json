What's going on here is that your client is receiving an attestation over p2p which cannot be verified in your local state. \r\n\r\nThere are two scenarios this might happen:\r\n- You or the peer producing the attestation are on a forked chain\r\n- There is a software bug within your client or peer's client with regards to validator indices and/or assignments. Someone signed an attestation out of turn by improper instruction by the client.",

    "body": "This was an issue due to incompatibility of 2 different cache implementations. \r\n\r\nBackground:\r\nWe have been using caches since early 0.2 spec, the current implementations are outdated but still get the job done. We have 3 caches (i.e. active indices, shuffled indices and active balances) that are used in run time. Last week, we implemented a  newshuffled indices cache to replace the old implementations. The new design itself has better semantics, and well tested within the constraints (i.e. new cache <-> new cache) Unfortunately this particular issue raises up when the new cache node sync with old cache node. \r\n\r\nWill further investigate and provide updates to this thread",
