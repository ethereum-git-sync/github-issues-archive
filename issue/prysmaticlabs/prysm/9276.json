  "body": "# ðŸš€ Feature Request\r\n#8954 brought down the `state` bucket size considerably. \r\nThis request is to further reduce the of the state DB by not storing `large arrays` in the `state` object.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nReduce the `state` DB size by bringing down the size of `large array's`.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nMost of the arrays are circular and store redundant information in every state. We could definitely benefit from an indirection and store a compressed list of index.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\n1) One simple way is to denormalise and store them in separate buckets and store the index inside the `state` object.\r\n\r\n2) Experiment with [tree_merklization](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/v0.10.0/ssz/simple-serialize.md#merkleization) since it supports adding a new object without impacting the destination object.",
