  "body": "On the [Mevconomics.wtf Summit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3sL0sCJFzk&t=4233s), Elaine Hu pointed out on average relayer receives `GetHeader` request on average **400ms** into the slot. This seems much longer than I had thought. Ideally, the relayer should receive the request close to the slot start. Here are a few reasons on top of my mind:\r\n1. Network latency between beacon node -> relayer \r\n2. Beacon node does some things before calling `GetHeader` (i.e pack attestations, slashings...etc). Prysm's block-building process is sequential and doesn't need to be sequential. We should be able to parallelize block construction   \r\n3. Mev-boost itself adds delay \r\n\r\nI think the reason is a mixture between 1 and 2. I don't have good data, so I think the first step is adding some good metrics and logs to monitor this. It's good to look into this problem now because it'll only get worse with EIP4844",
