    "body": "@prestonvanloon  Hi, just to let you know what I'm doing.\r\n\r\nSo I took the code from go-proto-library and I'm making the needed change for solidity. \r\nFor now, like the go_proto_library, I have an additional abi_library rule which generates the abi files. I don't know if it is of any use to you to have this additional step or if it should be merged with the go_abi_library rule in the final version. Here is an example:\r\n\r\n```bzl\r\nabi_library(\r\n  name = \"my_contract_library\",\r\n  srcs = [\r\n     \"my_contract.sol\",\r\n   ],\r\n   # other options\r\n)\r\n\r\ngo_abi_library(\r\n  name = \"my_contract_go_library\",\r\n  abi = [\":my_contract_library\"]\r\n)\r\n\r\n# then this can be used as a go_library \r\ngo_library(\r\n  name = \"go_default_library\",\r\n  srcs = [\"library.go\"],\r\n  deps = [\":my_contract_go_library\"],\r\n)\r\n```\r\nAs soon as my rules are working I will create a repo with only the rules so you can check them before I start the integration in your code base.",

I'm trying to set GOPATH in the action's env.\r\n```bzl\r\n    go.actions.run(\r\n        inputs = abi,\r\n        outputs = go_srcs,\r\n        progress_message = \"Generating into %s\" % go_srcs[0].dirname,\r\n        mnemonic = \"GoAbiGen\",\r\n        # This is set to \"@com_github_ethereum_go_ethereum/cmd/abigen:abigen\"\r\n        executable = compiler.abigen,\r\n        arguments = [args],\r\n        #env = {\"GOPATH\": \"should be go-ethereum path\"}\r\n    )\r\n```\r\nFor now, my main problem is I don't know which path in the project match the go-ethereum.\r\n\r\nDid abigen has already been used in the project successfully?\r\n\r\nMy WIP is [here](https://github.com/hubris/solrules). \r\n``bzl bazel build //soltest:contract-go-abi`` will fail because of _bind_ is undefined (missing import).\r\n\r\nMaybe I should try the rules directly in prysm in case I missed something when integrating prysmaticlabs/bazel-go-ethereum in my test project.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "@prestonvanloon  Hi,\r\nI'm a little stuck with the goimport. Here is the result of my investigation.\r\n\r\nFirst, goimports expects a tree structure like this _**src**/github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum_. This structure is generated in the  atlassian script [here](https://github.com/atlassian/bazel-tools/blob/e0e575b8a809c4565ef189be871bb6b11cd91043/goimports/runner.bash.template#L11).\r\n\r\nThe atlassian tool allows to do a goimport  for package generated by the current source tree only, not for external dependecies.\r\n\r\nMy plan was to write a similar script but instead of using $BUILD_WORKSPACE_DIRECTORY, I wanted to use the path to @com_github_ethereum_go_ethereum so I can create the symlinked src directory structure. Unfortunately, I can't figure how to get the path to the absolute path of the bazel external/ directory.\r\n\r\nDo you know how I could get the absolute path to external/com_github_ethereum_go_ethereum ?\r\nThank you.",

    "body": "Hey @hubris!\r\n\r\nSorry that this is turning out to be so challenging! I don't know how to do that without digging deep into Skylark/Bazel rules/macros. I believe you should be able to use make variables provided by bazel. Something like `$(location @com_github_ethereum_go_ethereum//:some_target)` which would provide you the location of that target in a genrule. \r\n\r\nAnother idea is to provide those targets a `data` attribute. I haven't explored this much though.",

    "body": "@prestonvanloon \r\nHi,\r\nI tried to focus on generating a go file from a sol file. \r\nI made a wip branch  [here](https://github.com/hubris/solrules). The rule looks like this:\r\n```bzl\r\nsol2go(\r\n  name = \"contract-go\",\r\n  src = \"Ballot.sol\",\r\n  pkg = \"ballot\",\r\n  )\r\n```\r\nI use a script similar to the goimports atlassian's rules. I only managed to find the \"external\" directory I had to do an ugly sed on the 'sandbox' directory which is probably not a good thing. Also I didn't manage to use make variables in my own attributes, they  don't seem to be expanded.\r\n\r\nYou can try the rule on my repo with:\r\n```bash\r\nbazel build    //soltest:contract-go\r\n```\r\nThe generated Ballot.go will have the correct import at least.\r\n\r\nLet me know if I should continue with this base and try to generate a library. Thank you.",

    "body": "@prestonvanloon Hi, I submitted a PR for you to review. I put the rules in contracts/rules. The 2 contracts  validator-registration-contract  and sharding-manager-contract are now generated with the new rule. \r\n\r\nNote that in order to work solc must be installed since it doesn't seem to exist a bazel repo for this. \r\n\r\nIn the end, I drifted away from the original design. As explained in the PR,  the rule sol2go will generate a go file from a given sol. Then a library can be built with the standard go_library rule. For example:\r\n\r\n```bzl\r\nsol2go(\r\n  name = \"contract_go\",\r\n  src = \"sharding_manager.sol\",\r\n  pkg = \"smc\",\r\n)\r\n```\r\nThis generate sharding_manager.go and the library can be created wilth:\r\n```bzl\r\ngo_library(\r\n    name = \"go_default_library\",\r\n     srcs = [\"sharding_manager.go\"],\r\n     importpath = \"github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/contracts/sharding-manager-contract\",\r\n     visibility = [\"//client:__subpackages__\"],\r\n     deps = [\r\n         \"@com_github_ethereum_go_ethereum//:go_default_library\",\r\n         \"@com_github_ethereum_go_ethereum//accounts/abi:go_default_library\",\r\n         \"@com_github_ethereum_go_ethereum//accounts/abi/bind:go_default_library\",\r\n         \"@com_github_ethereum_go_ethereum//common:go_default_library\",\r\n         \"@com_github_ethereum_go_ethereum//core/types:go_default_library\",\r\n         \"@com_github_ethereum_go_ethereum//event:go_default_library\",\r\n     ],\r\n)\r\n``` \r\nLet me know what you think.
