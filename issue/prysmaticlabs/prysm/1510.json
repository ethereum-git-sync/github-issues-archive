  "body": "Hi all,\r\n\r\nThis is a tracking issue for all PRs related to finishing our implementation of the entire validator document as specified [here](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/master/specs/validator/0_beacon-chain-validator.md). We are very close to finishing the entire logic in this document. Here is what has been done so far and the missing steps:\r\n\r\n- [x] Validator account initialization\r\n- [x] Submitting initial deposits pre-chainstart\r\n- [x] Proposer responsibility (client and server)\r\n- [x] Attester responsibility (client and server)\r\n- [x] Pending deposits queue for proposers to include in their blocks\r\n- [x] Remove pending deposits from the queue on block processing\r\n- [x] Broadcasting proposals and attestations via p2p (attestations need to be broadcast at slot+0.5*SLOT_DURATION seconds)\r\n- [x] Waiting for validator activation post-chainstart\r\n- [x] Responsibility lookahead\r\n- [x] Implement fetch ETH1 data in RPC server side\r\n- [x] Use tree hashing and BLS in the validator client\r\n- [x] Cap the number of block operations a proposer can include in a block\r\n- [x] Persist validator index to disk post activation (it is guaranteed not to change) and use it for computation throughout the validator's lifecycle\r\n- [x] (#1675) Pack validator initial credentials (withdrawal credentials can be computed as defined in the validator spec) into deposit input of the form:\r\n```python\r\n{\r\n    # BLS pubkey\r\n    'pubkey': 'bytes48',\r\n    # Withdrawal credentials\r\n    'withdrawal_credentials': 'bytes32',\r\n    # A BLS signature of this `DepositInput`\r\n    'proof_of_possession': 'bytes96',\r\n}\r\n```",
