    "body": "> Now, you can imagine a block with one blob that you are asking for. You cycle through your peers. The first peer you request returns a block with a bad blob. But you will never try to make a second request. Your node is officially stuck until a restart\r\n\r\nIf a peer provides a bad blob, we would reprocess the block again, no ? I don't see how this would be an issue, as we would be re-requesting blobs in the background. I think our current code is fine, as it remains that we **have** seen the block and it is in our pending queue. ",
