That's not ideal, thus the validator client alerts of this possibility with periodic logs.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nWhen using the `--web` flag, the validator client can generate a random auth token and log it to stdout + write it to a file to persist it. Then the user should copy the token and log in with it. Password managers will still see the login action and store the token so the user doesn't have to grab it again from the logs.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nStatus quo\r\n",
