    "body": "### Solution proposal\r\nBy far the largest amount of memory is required for the `Deposit.Proof` field. We currently keep all deposits (including historical) in `DepositCache.deposits` and all pending deposits (again including historical) in `DepositCache.pendingDeposits`, which means a lot of proofs are kept as well. Additionally most deposits are needlessly duplicated, bloating the memory even further. As blocks get finalized, some deposits are no longer pending, but we only prune pending deposits during `POWService`'s initialization (there is also a `DepositCache.RemovePendingDeposit` function, but it's not used anywhere outside tests).\r\nhttps://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/74101612ce1cb6a158fb4409e0ca401ad8bea209/beacon-chain/powchain/log_processing.go#L346\r\n\r\nPruning pending deposits after a block has been finalized will ensure that only a relatively small number of pending deposits are kept in memory at any time.\r\n\r\nBoth `deposits` and `pendingDeposits` fields are of the same `[]*dbpb.DepositContainer` type. `pendingDeposits` are used during block proposal, and so all fields of a deposit are needed in order to construct a valid block, including the proof. On the other hand some fields of `deposits` items are never used, proof included, and because of this it makes more sense to store `deposits` as a slice of simpler structs. As an example, instead of returning the whole deposit from the cache and having the caller calculate the root hash, the hash itself could be cached within this struct.\r\n\r\nOne more thing to fix is to remove the call to `depositCache.AllDepositContainers` during log processing. Because the cached deposits will no longer contain all data from the original deposits, log processing should handle processing and saving deposits internally instead of fetching cached deposits every `eth1DataSavingInterval`.\r\nhttps://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/74101612ce1cb6a158fb4409e0ca401ad8bea209/beacon-chain/powchain/log_processing.go#L84-L93\r\n\r\nAs a result of pruning pending deposits and keeping only a subset of fields in `deposits` the memory usage should drop significantly. It will slowly increase as data for more and more deposits is added to `deposits`, but given it's relatively small size it should not be a problem for a long time. I can provide more empirical evidence once I figure out what exactly should be kept in this struct,",

Log processing isn't fetching the deposits here, it is just saving it to the db. It already does handle processing and saving deposits to the cache. Would there be any issue with still saving containers here ",
