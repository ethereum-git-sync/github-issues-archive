However this introduced a race in which the node can be stalled due to the fact that the initial sync service missed an important event from our chainservice. \r\n\r\n### Has this worked before in a previous version?\r\n\r\nYes, this has worked before the offending commit was introduced.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nThis came up after a few times repeatedly starting/stopping the node in testing.  \r\n\r\n## üî• Error\r\n\r\nThe initial sync service go-routine is stalled here.\r\n```\r\n\r\n1 @ 0x45a1b6 0x469c32 0x15d7ba5 0x15d664b 0x48ad21\r\n#    0x15d7ba4    github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/beacon-chain/sync/initial-sync.(Service).waitForStateInitialization+0x204    beacon-chain/sync/initial-sync/service.go:192\r\n#    0x15d664a    github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm\r\n```\r\n```\r\n[2022-05-02 16:14:36] DEBUG registry: Starting service type *initialsync.Service\r\n[2022-05-02 16:14:36] DEBUG registry: Starting service type *sync.Service\r\n[2022-05-02 16:14:36] DEBUG registry: Starting service type *rpc.Service\r\n[2022-05-02 16:14:36] DEBUG registry: Starting service type *gateway.Gateway\r\n[2022-05-02 16:14:36] DEBUG registry: Starting service type *prometheus.Service\r\n[2022-05-02 16:14:36]  INFO blockchain: Blockchain data already exists in DB, initializing...\r\n[2022-05-02 16:14:36]  INFO initial-sync: Waiting for state to be initialized\r\n```\r\nAs you can see from the log, the state initialization event was sent out before the initial sync service managed to start. \r\n\r\n**What version of Prysm are you running?
