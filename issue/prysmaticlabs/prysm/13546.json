  "body": "Hello!  I had a power outage that took down my Validator yesterday.  I brought it back up when the power came back on, and my consensus and execution clients are back up and in synch (Geth and Prysm).  However, my validator is showing me constant errors with this messaging:\r\n\r\n[2024-01-27 11:42:10]  WARN validator: slots stream interrupted error=rpc error: code = Unimplemented desc = unknown method StreamSlots for service ethereum.eth.v1alpha1.BeaconNodeValidator: could not connect\r\n[2024-01-27 11:42:10] ERROR validator: Could not receive slots from beacon node, could not connect error=rpc error: code = Unimplemented desc = unknown method StreamSlots for service ethereum.eth.v1alpha1.BeaconNodeValidator\r\n\r\nIf I look at BeaconChain, it appears to be attesting just fine, but I'm worried about these errors, as that's not what I'm used to seeing.  I've tried restarting the validator, but the issue persists.\r\n\r\nAny ideas what might be causing this?",
