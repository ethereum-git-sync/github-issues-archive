  "body": "# ðŸš€ Feature Request\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAllow all the different data directories to be configurable with a single flag in the validator. Currently if we want to set a non default wallet directory , we ideally also want all the db/backup dbs and other related data to be in the same directory. However given how we specify the directories, if we set ```wallet-dir``` to a different path, our other directories would still reference an older path. We would have to set ```--backup-dir``` to the path that we want and so on. \r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nA single flag to specify all the data directories that we want under one banner instead specifying flags individually for everything. \r\n",
