There are a few things we should fix here:\r\n\r\n- Determining the DepositTrie is only necessary when there are pending deposits for inclusion. We're currently calculating it for every block, whether or not there are deposits ready to include.\r\n- The DepositTrie should be cached, if possible. Computing this on demand is expensive.\r\n- We're computing the DepositTrie up to the latest eth1 block, but it should only compute up to the canonical eth1 block since only deposits up to the canonical eth1 block can be included anyway.

    "body": "This was discussed offline in discord with @rkapka , summarizing it over here.\r\n\r\nWhen deciding on how to cache the trie and where to cache it, there are two possibilities on which height to cache it. Namely the height up till our last finalized checkpoint or the latest 'valid' eth1data.\r\n\r\n1) Finalized Checkpoint:\r\nBy caching the trie upto our eth1data in our finalized checkpoint. We have a stable base on which to build, and continue adding any additional deposits. We know for the most part, this will not change (excluding a major protocol fault). From this we can continue building the trie upto which ever eth1block that we wish to.\r\n\r\n2) Latest Eth1Data:\r\nBy Caching upto the latest eth1data, we continually make sure that our trie is the most upto the latest `valid` ethdata from the node's view. Ex: `Current_head` - `follow_distance` . This is usually accurate as the follow_distance gives us a margin of safety for any eth1 re-orgs. We expect each new 'valid' `eth1_block` we receive to be the direct child of our previous 'head eth1_block' , using this we can assume any new deposit coming in can be added directly into the trie. \r\n\r\nHowever there can be certain situations where this approach will not work and we will have to rebuild the trie. This would happen if our node has a different eth1 view compared to other nodes in the network. When proposing a block we build the deposit trie upto a selected `eth1_data` tuple. This can either be the `eth1_data` in the state or the latest `eth1_data` from our node's point of view. Optimistically building the trie and caching it according to the latter case is fine, however for the former there could be a discrepancy if all the other node's in the network vote in for a completely different eth1data from the point of view of our node. We would then have to rebuild the whole trie, as the cached deposit trie would be referencing some other `eth1_data` tuple.\r\n\r\nNamely the advantages of 1) are that the situation above cannot happen except in the case of a major protocol fault. It also allows us to handle any possible situations in which other nodes differ from our view of the eth1 chain. We can always add in the appropriate deposits onwards from the latest finalized checkpoint.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of 2) is that it does optimistic caching of deposits, so in the average case what our node sees of the eth1 chain lines up with what other nodes see too, caching the deposit trie this way would be fine. This will lead to us requiring less deposits to be inserted into trie compared to 1)\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Implementation proposal outline:\r\n\r\n- Add a new field `finalizedDepositsTrie *SparseMerkleTrie` to `DepositCache`.\r\n- Add a new function `(dc *DepositCache) InsertFinalizedDepositsTrie()` to `deposits_cache.go` and invoke it from `onBlock()` in `process_block.go` whenever `postState.FinalizedCheckpointEpoch() > s.finalizedCheckpt.Epoch`. Most likely pass the `postState.state.Eth1DepositIndex` as a parameter, rebuild the tree in `InsertFinalizedDepositsTrie()` and store it in the `finalizedDepositsTrie` field. My understanding is that this index shows the last processed deposit, so we can take the cached deposits up until that point and build the tree out of them. My analysis of deposit log processing lead me to believe that if a deposit with index `N` has been processed, then all deposits with index `i < N` have also been processed.\r\n- Retrieve the cached trie within `deposits()` an build the final deposit trie by inserting pending deposits into the cached trie.\r\n- Profit :-)\r\n\r\nQ1: Can we be sure that `PendingDepositsFetcher.PendingContainers()` will return the correct deposits, i.e. it won't return any \"finalized\" deposits?\r\nQ2: I am not sure if `finalized` is the best name because I don't think there is technically such a thing as a finalized deposit. Maybe some other name would be better?",
