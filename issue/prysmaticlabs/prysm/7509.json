  "body": "This issue tracks the follow of the following + rationales:\r\n\r\n* Delete the following feature flags:\r\n    * `disable-fork-choice-unsafe`: This is an unsafe flag. It hasn't been used in a while. This was designed in Sapphire days for emergency recovery. #7511\r\n    * `disable-ssz-cache`: This hasn't been used in a while. This was designed in Topaz days for emergency recover. #7513\r\n    * `skip-bls-verify`: This hasn't been used in a while. This was designed in Topaz days for emergency recover.  #7516\r\n    * `disable-initial-sync-verify-all-signatures`: This is an unsafe flag. One can easily trick a requesting peer to a malicious chain. #7517\r\n    * `cache-filtered-block-tree`: This has been deprecated ever since we move to proto array fork choice. This flag is doing nothing. Safe to delete. #7511\r\n    * `enable-local-protection`: This should be default on mainnet, it has been default `true` for a while. Safe to delete. \\\r\n#7543\r\n    * `disable-strict-attestation-pubsub-verification`: This is an unsafe flag and was only used once during Topaz testnet. #7526\r\n    * `disable-update-head-attestation`: This is an unsafe flag and used during Sapphire testnet. #7533\r\n    * `disable-domain-data-cache`: This has been enabled by default since Topaz testnet. Safe to delete.  #7526\r\n    * `enable-state-gen-sig-verify`: This was an option but it was never used. Safe to delete #7526\r\n    * `check-head-state`: This was an old feature from Sapphire testnet. Safe to delete. #7511\r\n    * `dont-prune-state-start-up`: This was an old feature before stategen pkg. Safe to delete. #7511\r\n    * `disable-reduce-attester-state-copy`: This has been enabled since Sapphire testnet. Safe to delete. #7526\r\n    * `disable-new-beacon-state-locks`: This has been enabled since Onyx testnet. Safe to delete. #7533\r\n    * `disable-batch-block-verify`: This has been enabled for a month. Safe to delete. #7526\r\n    * `init-sync-verbose`: This has not been used. Safe to delete. #7533\r\n    * `disable-accounts-v2`: We want to use v2 for beta. Safe to delete.\r\n    * `enable-att-broadcast-discovery-attempts`: (Won't be removed, this needs to be inverted)\r\n    * `disable-broadcast-slashings`: Unsafe flag. The node should broadcast slashing by default.  #7533\r\n    * `wait-for-synced`: I dont think this was used in a while. Will delete if no one further comments (Won't be removed, incomplete feature)\r\n\r\n * Delete all **deprecated** feature flags #7512",

We might be able to invert the flag without the optimization, but it might result in a lot of `BlockExists` calls, possibly causing many ETH1 block requests if blocks are not present in the cache. ",

    "body": "I'm confused as to why `disable-broadcast-slashings` was removed? Broadcasting currently removes all incentive to run a slasher, as 100% of the whistleblower reward currently goes to the proposer. The explanation above `The node should broadcast slashing by default` doesn't really make sense, that already was the default. Is there something else unsafe about not broadcasting slashings?",
