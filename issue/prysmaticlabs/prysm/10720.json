    "body": "Hey everyone, apologies for the delay, but I think I found something\r\n\r\nFirst, I just wanted to clarify that the DefaultFeeRecipient is getting overwritten because of the default_config.fee_recipient attribute documented [here](https://docs.prylabs.network/docs/execution-node/fee-recipient).\r\n\r\nI also believe I found the code block responsible for overwriting the config. In `validator/node/node.go` lines 488-497:\r\n```\tgo\r\n        // override the default fileConfig with the fileConfig from the command line\r\n\tif cliCtx.IsSet(flags.SuggestedFeeRecipientFlag.Name) {\r\n\t\tsuggestedFee := cliCtx.String(flags.SuggestedFeeRecipientFlag.Name)\r\n\t\tfileConfig = &validatorServiceConfig.FeeRecipientFileConfig{\r\n\t\t\tProposeConfig: nil,\r\n\t\t\tDefaultConfig: &validatorServiceConfig.FeeRecipientFileOptions{\r\n\t\t\t\tFeeRecipient: suggestedFee,\r\n\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAccording to the documentation, the DefaultFeeConfig is written in a json file, the path of which is passed into `flags.SuggestedFeeRecipientFlag.Name`. However, I'm not sure what the best way is to separate the two variables is. Perhaps we could write another function to get the fee recipient that checks if the context is set from the CLI and call it instead of looking up the default fee recipient in the config? Really appreciate all the help! Thank you! ",

    "body": "@james-prysm I just had a look at [where](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/develop/beacon-chain/node/config.go#L151-L193) `DefaultFeeRecipient` was supposedly overwritten, and traced it directly to the `suggested-fee-recipient` beacon node cli flag. \r\n\r\nIt seems like it's being set for the first time, and done prior to beacon start. Not sure if this still qualifies as a case of runtime mutation?",

    "body": "@lyzs90 It's set the first time here, but I think to kasey's point of starting this issue, the beaconConfig was intended to be this read-only config based on network settings ( mainnet, minimal -which is test net, etc) and not setting values at runtime. I'm sure we have other instances of breaking this intention but don't want things to get dangerous and break consensus unintentionally.\r\nthis was another one of the issues I wanted to start looking at as I address some other UX concerns around fee recipient.
