  "body": "Hi all,\r\n\r\nThis is a tracking issue to ensure Prysm passes the latest Eth2 spec tests as maintained [here](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-spec-tests/tree/master/tests). Every YAML file has a specific structure to it with specific expectations and configuration values. As discussed by the team offline, we agreed to keep these test runners constrained to the specific package they target. For example, the spec test runner for block processing should be kept in\r\n\r\n```\r\n/beacon-chain\r\n  /core\r\n    /blocks\r\n      /spectest\r\n        autogenerated.yaml.go\r\n        block_processing_spec_test.go\r\n      block_processing.go\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis runner will have specific Go code for parsing and running the [block sanity tests](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-spec-tests/tree/master/tests/sanity/blocks). This work can be split up, and [shuffling spec tests](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-spec-tests/tree/master/tests/shuffling/core) have already been handled by @shayzluf [here](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/b2ddee1ae8f93e502b3a44479a60abcb641b1155/beacon-chain/chaintest/backend/simulated_backend.go#L175), but they should still be moved somewhere closer to the core shuffling logic in a respective /spectest folder as outlined above. The TODOS are as follow:\r\n\r\n- [x] Isolate [shuffling related spec tests](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-spec-tests/tree/master/tests/shuffling/core) and their runner closer to the shuffling core logic #2829\r\n- [x] Implement [block processing](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-spec-tests/tree/master/tests/sanity/blocks) sanity tests runner #2817\r\n- [x] Implement [slot processing](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-spec-tests/tree/master/tests/sanity/slots) sanity tests runner #2813\r\n- [x] Implement epoch processing [crosslink](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-spec-tests/tree/master/tests/epoch_processing/crosslinks) tests runner #2814\r\n- [x] Implement epoch processing [registry updates](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-spec-tests/tree/master/tests/epoch_processing/registry_updates) runner #2814\r\n- [x] Implement block [attestation](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-spec-tests/tree/master/tests/operations/attestation) operations test runner #2828\r\n- [x] Implement block [attester slashing](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-spec-tests/tree/master/tests/operations/attester_slashing) operations test runner #2828\r\n- [x] Implement block [block header](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-spec-tests/tree/master/tests/operations/block_header) operations test runner #2828\r\n- [x] Implement block [deposit](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-spec-tests/tree/master/tests/operations/deposit) operations test runner #2828\r\n- [x] Implement block [proposer slashing](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-spec-tests/tree/master/tests/operations/proposer_slashing) operations test runner #2828\r\n- [x] Implement block [transfer](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-spec-tests/tree/master/tests/operations/transfer) operations test runner #2828\r\n- [x] Implement block [voluntary exit](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-spec-tests/tree/master/tests/operations/voluntary_exit) operations test runner #2828\r\n- [x] Implement SSZ [generic/core](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-spec-tests/tree/master/tests/ssz_generic/uint) test runner\r\n- [x] Implement [BLS](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-spec-tests/tree/master/tests/bls) tests #2826\r\n- [x] Implement finalization and justification tests #2896 \r\n- [x] Implement final updates tests #2901\r\n- [x] Genesis trigger spec tests #2940\r\n- [x] Update YAMLs from spec freeze",

These tests are not as big as I expected. \r\n\r\nEdit: We can should check in `xxx.yaml.go` files but not check in the yaml itself.
