  "body": "There was some miscommunication that led to the # of committees being reduced from 3 to 2: https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/commit/3c6952c510477595e94f3d949ed05f5aad5d53d2#diff-b6e8555721f33a1a4f2e46447c8c3d31R33\r\n\r\nThis reintroduced a bug, where cycle transitions failed: https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/issues/741#issuecomment-438128167\r\n\r\nThe fix that addresses #741 is not a complete fix, because a skipped block during a cycle transition will still cause an exception. In fact, this is using the wrong committee to assign validators. The true fix is to revert the number of committees back to 3 from 2, and to revert #744.",
