A total of 70 validators are running. But monitoring shows that one or two validators miss att every day.  It will deduct -10320 GWei. statistics show that about 10 validators miss att every week. How should I troubleshoot when I encounter this situation? All logs are normal, not error.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition, the monitoring also shows a penalty, although the amount is relatively small, generally -3177. But this penalty is very frequent, among 70 validators, the number of such penalties is about 100 times a week.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n\r\n<img width=\"442\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49090950/204240141-df5445a2-2f1d-4713-9654-28c0c2208b30.png\">\r\n-10320\r\n\r\n\r\n<img width=\"425\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49090950/204240810-fc94c81d-fee9-4164-bdb3-4e5c2a716311.png\">\r\n-3177  \r\n\r\n\r\n### Reousrces  \r\n- Geth:    4c 32GiB      storage:  EBS-gp2\r\n- Prysm BeaconNode ：  8c 32GiB   storage: EBS-gp2\r\n- Prysm Validator:  4c 8GiB   \r\n\r\n#### Geth  \r\n<img width=\"1855\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49090950/204242008-40fc68ad-b413-4ba0-a8e6-796dda46a85c.png\">\r\n<img width=\"1836\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49090950/204242156-b77c8345-3e91-46f7-a110-af313dc1bbef.png\">\r\n<img width=\"1848\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49090950/204242256-f54edaea-43dc-4b8c-af2f-8ec1db56f828.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Prysm  BeaconNode\r\n<img width=\"1847\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49090950/204241713-821affd5-abb1-4d99-a3f7-c59270550d9e.png\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1834\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49090950/204241788-c009c57b-6e01-4285-a9bc-a726d848fc57.png\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1858\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49090950/204241859-d2267bd3-de63-49bc-a1ed-11bbf356367d.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Prysm Validator\r\n<img width=\"1819\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49090950/204242563-d0c7b66b-a5f3-4531-b157-ffb36a5959eb.png\">\r\n<img width=\"1839\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49090950/204242596-da8ffed7-7f89-46df-87ba-b8a2f742d249.png\">\r\n<img width=\"1806\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49090950/204242667-eadda098-3430-4f9f-aafb-2b732dd67f69.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n**Any help would be greatly appreciated!**\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "I try to solve it, but am not an expert in this area. Many times I was not sure what the exact cause was, and just did a lot of black box testing, and related monitoring.   @okorolov \r\n\r\nRecently, I connected all the validator and beaconNode Metrics to prometheus. And did monitoring and alerting. The current situation is as follows, we have a total of 122 validators running. We found that when the balance decreases (and we have monitoring for balance decreases), it is not necessarily a miss att (aggr or prop) that occurs. It is suspected that it is not our fault. Of course, if our validator has a miss att (which can be seen by the metrics), the balance must decrease. \r\n\r\nBy our phenomenon indicates that there is a miss att of our validators, but this is rare, 122 validators about once or twice a week in total. But we still receive some penalties, which are suspected to be unrelated to us. This is in line with the idea of nisdas @nisdas       \r\n<img width=\"1502\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49090950/210502172-c16dc265-cf3a-4962-aabf-84657ce9b490.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\nAlert Issue https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/issues/11102.
