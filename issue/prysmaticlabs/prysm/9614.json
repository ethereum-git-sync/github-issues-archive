The VM had support for AVX2 and AVX512. May be the hypervisor didnt allow SIMD instruction set, i am not sure of that. But this happens in this setup. This is very siilar to what was captured by potus and Nishant  [here](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/issues/9389), but it might be different.\r\n\r\n- **scenario 1**\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/8SZBMeJ.png)\r\n- **scenario 2**\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/mkOCVYf.png)\r\n",
