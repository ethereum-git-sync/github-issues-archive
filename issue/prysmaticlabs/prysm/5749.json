    "body": "Hey @0xKiwi I can take a look at this as a first time issue. I think the approach I would take is to follow the article more or less, change the signature to:\r\n\r\nfunc EnterPassword(confirmPassword bool, pr PasswordReader) (string, error) \r\n\r\nwhere PasswordReader is an interface which we can gomock and we'd have an implementation of it which reads from stdin which we pass in for the 2 uses in account.go. Then I'd add a helpers_test.go file which has a table test of cases we'd want to validate: passwords match, don't match, failure to read etc. Does that make sense?",
