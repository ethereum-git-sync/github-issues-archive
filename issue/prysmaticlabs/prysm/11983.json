    "body": "Perhaps grpc-max-msg-size can be some very large value. \r\n\r\n@mcdee Do you have any suggested new default? \r\n\r\nI am considering using max int64 (no limit) and logging an ominous warning when the operator has their gRPC host set to anything other than localhost. The point of this guard is to prevent someone from sending an impossibly large message that would overwhelm the server and/or client, but that shouldn't be a factor for individuals running with a local validator or advanced professionals with other safeguards in place.\r\n\r\nIf you're happy with the suggestion above, we can add this in quickly ahead of Capella.
