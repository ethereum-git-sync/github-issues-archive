Without coreutils, the bash scripting is not very useful (i.e. `echo`, `cat`, etc). \r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add coreutils layer to docker images\r\n- [ ] Add /bin/sh or symbolic link to /bin/bash \r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nMost people are building their own docker images to include these tools. That is annoying and unnecessary with the completion of this issue.\r\n",
