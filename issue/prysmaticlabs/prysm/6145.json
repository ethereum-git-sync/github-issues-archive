Provide a certificate and key to connect securely\r\n```\r\n\r\nMost people have no idea what gRPC means and the word \"insecure\" is scary\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nA PR to resolve this would clarify the warning to tell users it isn't something they should worry about. We should not remove the warning, however, as it is important to display to users they are not using TLS\r\n",
