Then it will throw an error because the command is not defined.\r\n\r\n> user@user:~$ prysm/prysm.sh update\r\n> Latest Prysm version is v1.0.0-alpha.5.\r\n> Beacon chain is up to date.\r\n> Validator is up to date.\r\n> Usage: ./prysm.sh PROCESS FLAGS.\r\n> PROCESS can be beacon-chain or validator.\r\n> Starting Prysm update\r\n> prysm/prysm.sh: ligne 152: process : variable sans liaison\r\n\r\nImplementing the command to display a success message or nothing is enough for the feature to work.\r\nThe user may then restart the node the way that it choose to.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nImplement the update option in prysm.sh script file\r\nIt should display as this :\r\n\r\n> user@user:~$ prysm/prysm.sh update\r\n> Latest Prysm version is v1.0.0-alpha.5.\r\n> Beacon chain is up to date.\r\n> Validator is up to date.\r\n\r\nor do the update if needed.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nWe do nothing as it kind of work by itself.\r\n",
