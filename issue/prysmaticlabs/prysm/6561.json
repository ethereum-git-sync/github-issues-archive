    "body": "The main reason for `stamp` not working is that `go_image` doesn't support that: https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_docker/pull/560. It doesn't pass the `stamp` or `creation_time` config to the underlying `container_image` call.\r\n\r\nThe `container_bundle` `stamp` option (which is deprecated) is more for the image tag, it allows us to substitute `{BUILD_TIMESTAMP}` into tag if we want to (e.g. `v0.1-1605975953`).\r\n\r\nWe can have the creation timestamp back if we define the build rule like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Extra step to stamp the go_image output\r\ncontainer_image(\r\n    name = \"image_with_creation_time\",\r\n    base = \"image\",\r\n    stamp = True,\r\n)\r\n\r\ncontainer_bundle(\r\n    name = \"image_bundle\",\r\n    images = {\r\n        \"gcr.io/prysmaticlabs/prysm/validator:latest\": \":image_with_creation_time\",\r\n        \"gcr.io/prysmaticlabs/prysm/validator:{DOCKER_TAG}\": \":image_with_creation_time\",\r\n        \"index.docker.io/prysmaticlabs/prysm-validator:latest\": \":image_with_creation_time\",\r\n        \"index.docker.io/prysmaticlabs/prysm-validator:{DOCKER_TAG}\": \":image_with_creation_time\",\r\n    },\r\n    tags = [\"manual\"],\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut as suggested in https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_docker/issues/52#issuecomment-308490078, it seems to be by design for reproducible build. (`distroless` also has 50 years old image)\r\n\r\n```\r\ngcr.io/distroless/base                                   latest                      972b93457774        50 years ago        16.9MB\r\n```",
