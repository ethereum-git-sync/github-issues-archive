  "body": "The [crosslink mechanic has been updated](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/pull/111) due to a potential attack that was brought up [here](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/issues/106). With this changes, validator shuffling has a lower barrier to entry. To sufficiently implement these changes, we should wait to combine active & crystallized state to a [single state implementation](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/pull/122) to avoid future refactor hence I'm making this blocked at this very moment",
