  "body": "# ðŸ’Ž Issue\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\nWe have been storing state objects as blobs in our DB. For start, this looked okay but as time grew a large chunk of our DB size is just states. Previously, there have been some effort to bring down the time in #9155.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nMost of the expensive (to store) elements in the state object is incremental in nature.  They are of two types\r\n- Circular buffer type\r\n    block_roots: Vector[Root, SLOTS_PER_HISTORICAL_ROOT]\r\n    state_roots: Vector[Root, SLOTS_PER_HISTORICAL_ROOT]\r\n\r\n- Historically growing\r\n     historical_roots: List[Root, HISTORICAL_ROOTS_LIMIT]\r\n\r\nThe main theme of this issue is to check if we can store the state incrementally and not store any element twice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Issues to ponder\r\n\r\n- During de-normalization, we should keep an eye on resource consumption (CPU / MEMORY)\r\n- State re-construction times should be within some acceptable limit\r\n- Strike a balance between a normal user and the advanced user",
