Thus, it would require to keep half of the disk empty to be prepared for future updates.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nAllow user to specify a custom directory where the backup is supposed to be stored when providing --enable-db-backup-webhook.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nAlternatively, always write the backup db into a \"backup\" folder within the chaindata directory, which the user then could symlink to another disk if needed.\r\n",
