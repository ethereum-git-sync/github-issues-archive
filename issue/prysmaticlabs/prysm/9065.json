  "body": "# üêû Bug Report\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nReloadPublicKeys called in tight loop when eth1 connection fails (client v1.3.8)\r\n\r\n### Has this worked before in a previous version?\r\n\r\nThis wasn't observed in earlier versions.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease let us know how we can reproduce this issue. Include the exact method you used to run Prysm along with any flags used in your beacon chain and/or validator. Make sure you don't upload any confidential files or private keys.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## üî• Error\r\n\r\nA beacon had 14 seconds where it couldn't connect to eth1 (still trying to figure out why) -- while it was in that state, it generated close to 2000 error events per second (the 'Before/AfterReloadKeys' debug message); that looks like a bug you might want to investigate.  I can send logs.  This is how a 10-ms slice, and a 1-sec slice, look:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25420279/122659974-38c32e80-d14b-11eb-8f84-6d68254ee202.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25420279/122659981-45478700-d14b-11eb-9685-677fa06c8830.png)\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Operating System:**\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n  <code>\r\n\r\n  </code>\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n**What version of Prysm are you running?
