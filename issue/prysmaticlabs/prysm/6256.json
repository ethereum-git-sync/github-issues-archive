    "body": "The key difference between Topaz and Onyx is that we are now only using discovery v5 protocol which communicates mostly over UDP. \r\n\r\nIf you are unable to find any peers, you might have UDP traffic blocked on your network or system. \r\nThe original issue was that Prysm isn't binding to the ports 13000 or 12000. I should have been able to direct dial your node if the port forwarding was set up correctly. Additionally the MX toolbox report I linked earlier should have also indicated that 13000 was open for communication. You might have more than one issue. We haven't heard windows users report this issue (yet) so I am wondering if its system/setup related rather than a Prysm bug.",

    "body": "The private IP is the IP is directly assigned to your machine on your local network. \r\nThe public IP is the IP which is provided to your modem by your ISP. The public IP is what other nodes can use to connect to your modem which your computer is connected. The reason we need port forwarding is that the router wouldn't know where to route the request, especially when you have multiple devices in the same network. Having port 13000 and 12000 open and forwarded to your machine makes it so that external peers can connect to you on those ports. You would see this in Prysm as an \"inbound\" connection. \r\n\r\nWithout opening those ports and routing them to your machine, you should still be able to make outbound dials to peers. You could try to add a specific peer like `--peer=ip4/107.137.107.212/tcp/13000/p2p/16Uiu2HAmDBVBgnnUBDJUGmFTJodQj5bgwWySS2Loi6nhErF9ESmG`. I have a feeling there is something to do with your firewall where you aren't able to make UDP connections which is what discovery v5 protocol uses to find peers.",

    "body": "hi guys, just an update on this. With a different laptop i got a fresh prysm.bat and started a beacon-chain and it synced up ok and found peers ok, so wondering if it had something to do with my old laptop and setup and something to do with me disconnecting in between v10 and 11?\r\n\r\nAnyway, I am now running my validator successfully on this new laptop after copying the keys. So same network, same .bat version etc. On my old laptop it still can't find peers, but on this new one it doesn't. Is there anything I can try on my old laptop to try get it working there again? ie can I delete everything (except validator keys), then try all fresh again? \r\n",
