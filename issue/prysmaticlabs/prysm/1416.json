  "body": "Currently Abigen only supports contracts written in solidity, the goal is to also allow contracts written in vyper to also have their go bindings be generated automatically. We generate the bindings by first generating the abi and bytecode from the vyper compiler then using that as inputs into abigen.\r\n\r\nFor this issue to be closed abigen simply needs to take in a vyper contract source as an argument and use that to generate the bindings.A PR for this will need to be opened in the go-ethereum repository to make the changes. \r\n\r\nFiles/Folders that need to be changed to add support for vyper: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/cmd/abigen/main.go\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/tree/master/common/compiler\r\n\r\nThe first change would be to add support for the vyper compiler under `common/compiler` , and the second change would be to modify the `main` routine in abigen to take in vyper contract source code as an argument so as to output the go bindings.
