  "body": "Currently if running on the background on Linux using systemd, all events are logged at the default level (typically \"info\").  \r\n\r\nBy prefixing the lines of output with angle brackets with the loglevel, for example \r\n\r\n<4> This is a warning message\r\n<6> This is an info message\r\n\r\nThen a command like `journalctl -u beacon-chain -p 4` will only print the warning message. \r\n\r\nArguably this is uncomfortable for those not using journald and/or piping the logs somewhere else. In this case a simple workaround is not to print if running in the foreground. For a more involved solution journald exposes the syslog API so that this can be handled there. Given that the vast majority of Linux systems already switched to systemd I think that simply prefixing the lines would satisfy most people while the trade for those running custom logs would be minimal. \r\n",
