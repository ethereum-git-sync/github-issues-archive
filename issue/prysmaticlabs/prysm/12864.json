I have gone through part of the prysm code and want to participate in the development, but I found that issues are difficult to start, mainly because most of them are related to network synchronization. So could you give some suggestions and guidance? How to participate in the development of new features? (which I think it will help people better understand the code) Or whether there are part-time or intern like other communities. Thx for your time.",

    "body": "@0xCMars The reason it is different is because the mainnet specs are not distinguishing between pre/post bellatrix gossip message and chunk sizes, while we are. This was removed in https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/commit/5576d0e6850b0ddbffd1ec122841b35e31e66fee on the specification's end, so for our case we will also have to remove distingushing it and just use one variable name everywhere with the higher value.",
