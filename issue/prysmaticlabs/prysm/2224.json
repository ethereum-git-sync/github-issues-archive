  "body": "This is a major blocker for #1586. So far, we have observed that our cluster setup with postchainstart validators dies at inconsistent times with the following error log:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nError: could not update assignments: could not execute head transition: could not process epoch: could not get prev epoch attester indices: wanted participants bitfield length 2, got: 1  prefix=state-replay\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis occurs right when we are requesting assignments at a skip slot which is an epoch boundary it seems. This can be reproduced using the state-replay tool being worked on in this branch: https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/compare/raul-state-replay?expand=1 and using the following data directory from 3 nodes running 96 validators:\r\nhttp://prysmaticlabs.com/uploads/2019-04-08-beacondbs-second-attempt.tar.gz\r\n\r\nThis is our top priority issue, and we are suspecting it has to do with core logic around active validators in state transitions and when fetching assignments.",
