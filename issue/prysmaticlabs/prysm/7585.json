  "body": "# ðŸ’Ž Issue\r\n\r\nMemory usage has been all over the place during the recent non-finality on Medalla, but reached a peak for me of 7.85 GiB and is routinely bumping over 6 GiB.\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\nIt's been tough for Dappnode to keep up with all the releases lately, but these numbers are based on the current dappnode stable package for Prysm on Medalla (v1.0.0-alpha.27).  Lighthouse [has a similar problem](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/issues/1795). \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThere is a lot more memory consumption happening during non-finality than the recommended specs in most guides tell you to plan for. Does all this memory help with performance during non-finality?  Then the recommended specs should be increased.  And if it doesn't, then this is a performance problem that should be fixed.  Non-finality periods are exactly the times that nodes need to be rock-solid and not having performance constraints hurt them.",
