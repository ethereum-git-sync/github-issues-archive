  "body": "# ðŸ’Ž Issue\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\nOne pattern we should opt for across our repo is to rely more on package-level errors rather than putting the burden of nil checks in certain situations on the caller. For example, a common pattern seen across the codebase is this:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nst, err := beaconDB.StateByRoot(ctx, root)\r\nif err != nil {\r\n  return err\r\n}\r\nif st == nil || st.IsNil() {\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne time, there was a PR with a bug because we forgot to add a nil check. Another time, there was another failure because we forgot state needs _two_ nil checks. Pushing this check onto callers increases the probability. Go is already notorious for nil checks, which are risky if forgotten. Instead, we should aim to encapsulate them as much as possible and rely on error values as a sane alternative.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```go\r\n// beacon-chain/db/kv/state.go\r\nvar ErrNotFound = errors.New(\"not found\")\r\n\r\nfunc (s *Store) StateByRoot(root [32]byte) (*State, error) {\r\n  state := s.db.view(root)\r\n  if st == nil || st.IsNil() {\r\n    return nil, ErrNotFound\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// elsewhere.\r\nst, err := beaconDB.StateByRoot(ctx, root)\r\nswitch err {\r\n  case kv.ErrNotFound:\r\n    // Handle...\r\n  default:\r\n    return err\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\nIt is important to audit all uses of this nil encapsulation we are changing, however, as it is possible we introduce a bug in doing so. For example, some code paths might rely on error checking differently, and we may need to handle those error values in a sane manner. Additionally, some other code paths might actually rely on nil values returned from the db method to branch into certain execution. **We should be careful with this change**.",
