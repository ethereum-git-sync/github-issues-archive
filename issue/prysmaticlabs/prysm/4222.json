    "body": "This is a really great first issue for our new teammate @farazdagi to get involved in the repo. To outline some of the requirements a bit more, our [validator client](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/tree/master/validator) currently uses a `keymanager` interface created by @mcdee [here](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/40afef8b9e076fed4200f2aaa1cb2ab7c46b5b57/validator/keymanager/keymanager.go#L16) which can be implemented in a variety of ways, including this simple direct keymanager currently in our validator client code [here](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/40afef8b9e076fed4200f2aaa1cb2ab7c46b5b57/validator/keymanager/direct.go#L32). \r\n\r\nCurrently, on startup, a validator client fetches the validator keys currently in the store as part of its runtime and uses those throughout its lifecycle. A validator client can manage many keys, even tens of thousands, but those currently need to available on startup of the validator client for it to pick them up.\r\n\r\nThis issue is requesting to rescan the keystore (either filesystem or anything else that implements the `keymanager` interface) via some polling mechanism to easily add new keys without needing to restart the process. @mcdee here suggest just adding some `RescanKeys()` function in the interface definition and implementing that. There are a few issues that come to mind with a naive solution as mentioned in the comments above:\r\n1. We might need to decrypt the keys to understand if they are valid validator keys, making the rescanning a bit expensive\r\n2. Consider some of the possible keymanager implementations and their limitations, as doing polling on an HSM or other hardware might be inefficient based on how frequent we do it\r\n\r\nHowever, I believe would be nice for this to work in a simple manner for now and we can consider use-case limitations further down the line as they arise or are requested by people interacting with Prysm. To tackle this issue, here's the workflow we would typically take:\r\n1. Open a PR that mentions `resolves #4222` in the description using the default pull request template in the repo\r\n2. Describe your approach in the pull request description carefully\r\n3. Before writing code, talk with the rest of the team on discord regarding a suggested approach\r\n4. Keep the PR simple, scoped, and preferably under 300 lines (excluding tests)\r\n5. Write comprehensive tests that cover most of your logic, run `bazel run //:gazelle` and `bazel test //validator/keymanager:go_default_test` to run the package tests after you add your code\r\n6. Label the PR as `Ready for Review` and request reviews from teammates\r\n7. Mention on discord in our code-review channel your progress on the issue\r\n\r\nWe'd love to help out get you more accustomed to contributing. As a sample PR that follows these practices, please see: https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/4866",
