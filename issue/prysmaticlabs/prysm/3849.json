  "body": "Hey Prysm ðŸ‘‹\r\n\r\nI'm working to build a genesis state from your deposit contract but all the signatures are failing on our end. After some digging, I suspect there's a mismatch between Prysm and the spec.\r\n\r\nIn `process_deposit`, the spec declares:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Note: Deposits are valid across forks, thus the deposit domain is retrieved directly from `compute_domain`.\r\ndomain = compute_domain(DOMAIN_DEPOSIT)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe second parameter to `compute_domain` is omitted, so it defaults to `Version()` which I understand to be `[0, 0, 0, 0]`.\r\n\r\nIn Prysm it seems you're passing through the `Fork` from the `BeaconState`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/9bf55e53e70bfda50cc82ef460a1470d89b90e54/beacon-chain/core/blocks/block_operations.go#L966-L972\r\n\r\nWhich in your testnet is set to this:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/acf11262de3439ffa4c976565d59d0739c18ce29/shared/params/config.go#L236\r\n\r\nSo, as I understand it, the spec calls for `[0, 0, 0, 0]` but Prysm is using `[0, 0, 0, 2]`. If this turns out to be the case and you're passing all the v0.8.3 tests, it seems that the EF tests have a coverage gap. This seems feasible if all the tests assume that the `Fork` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`.",

All other non-deposit messages will still fail verification.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, keeping the deposits on the 0 fork/domain means that you can replay deposits across different testnets. This doesn't immediately seem like a vuln though, there seems to be no gain to spending `x ETH` to place a deposit for a key that you don't own. In fact, this might even be a feature! It means we could seamlessly move validators from an existing testnet over to a new one, even if the testnet fork changes.",
