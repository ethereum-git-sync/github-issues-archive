This is particularly useful when the node sits behind a firewall or using docker.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nflags like `p2p-host-tcp-port` and `p2p-host-udp-port`\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nChanging internally used ports with `p2p-tcp-port` and `p2p-udp-port` but making it difficult when scaling automatically or using docker-compose.\r\n",
