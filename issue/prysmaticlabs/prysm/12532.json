  "body": "# ðŸ’Ž Issue\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\nCurrently as defined by the consensus specs: https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/p2p-interface.md#topics-and-messages , gossip topics are defined as:\r\n\r\n`/eth2/ForkDigestValue/Name/Encoding`\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe issue with our current topic validation is that while it is secure due to how gossipsub filters out messages without valid and subscribed topics, the matching of the different components in a topic string is done in a janky fashion.   Components are matched via\r\n```\r\nstring.Contains(topic, 'desired_component') \r\n```\r\nThis is a fragile way of checking if a particular topic has our desired property and might lead to issues in the future. A refactor of how topic strings are handled in `sync` should help to remove this fragility. Instead of being ` string` type, topics would now be its own custom type which would allow us to match components(`eth2` / `ForkDigestValue`) in a more robust fashion rather than what we have now.\r\n\r\n\r\nAudit Finding: TOB-PRYSM-15\r\n",
