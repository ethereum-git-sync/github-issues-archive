    "body": "Some thoughts on this:\r\n  - each keymanager is responsible for holding and caching its own keys.  We probably want to retain this functionality, as `keymanager.FetchValidatingKeys()` is called frequently throughout the codebase\r\n    - the alternative would be for the validator to have a key cache separate to the keymanager; although this is possible it would lead to duplication of data between keymanager and validator, so would rather avoid if possible\r\n  - we have three options for update functionality:\r\n    - periodic refresh\r\n      - this is the simplest option, but it introduces unnecessary work (when there are no changed keys) and requires a balance between responsiveness (lower refresh period) and efficiency (higher refresh period) that could be difficult to provide in a way that meets every case\r\n    - keymanager push\r\n      - this is a good option if all keymanagers can provide it.  Although I believe we could do this with all current keymanagers, if we consider the case of HSMs that aren't directly aware of which of their keys are being used for validating this is not guaranteed for all implementations\r\n    - ad-hoc refresh\r\n      - this provides a good user experience in terms of functionality (user asks for a refresh, keymanager refreshes immediately) but requires some sort of interface to the validator to carry out this operation, so probably involves adding a gRPC server to the validator\r\n\r\nI think that keymanager push is the best technical option, _if_ we can convince ourselves that future keymanagers will be able to provide us with the information.  If not, we could go for the ad-hoc refresh.  I'll investigate these two options over the next week and report back with my findings.",

The way this will work is:\r\n\r\n  - each keymanager maintains its own cache of validating keys (as it does today)\r\n  - the keymanager creates its own method to either find or be informed of changes to the keys it is managing\r\n  - the keymanager uses the information obtained from the change notifications to update its cache\r\n\r\nThis allows each keymanager to decide the best way to provide updates for its keys, whilst retaining the performance of having a local cache.\r\n\r\nI'll take a look at implementing this for the `wallet` and `remote` keymanagers to see how the theory goes.\r\n\r\nThe only slight concern with this is that we'll have to introduce a mutex in to each keymanager, to avoid concurrent read/write of the cache.  I don't think this should cause contention as we don't ask for keys that frequently, but something to keep an eye on.",

It should be transparent as far as the end user is concerned, so no changes required to their configuration.\r\n\r\nNote this is against `v0.11` as there have been other changes to wallet in `v0.11` and if this went against master it would cause conflicts (plus as it changes wallet functionality it makes sense to keep the changes off the current live testnet).\r\n\r\nDefinitely worth reviewing the code, and more testing is always good (I ran some initial tests that seem to behave but I'm sure there will be bugs in there somewhere).
