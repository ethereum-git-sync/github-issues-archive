  "body": "When excessive blobs are present in the database, the data availability check fails. Currently, the database retrieves all blobs based on their root. This behavior is problematic, especially when the block references fewer KZG commitments than the number of blobs retrieved from the database. For instance, if a block references only 4 KZG commitments but the database retrieves 6 blobs (2 being excessive), the DA check will attempt to verify all 6 blob sidecars against the 4 KZG commitments, resulting in a failure.",
