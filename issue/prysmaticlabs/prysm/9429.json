  "title": "Hello I have a problem. I have active  a node of ethereum 2.0 with prysm beacon. Lately the amount of RAM that the Prysm Beacon service uses is enormous. I have 16 Gb but 90% of it is used by Prysm and it keeps growing until the computer crashes, so I have to manually restart it every 4-5 hours. When I first started running Prysm months ago the amount of RAM was much less. How can I solve that? Is this excessive consumption of RAM memory normal? Thank you.",
