  "body": "Hi, I'm Yevgeny Pats Founder of [Fuzzit](https://fuzzit.dev) - Continuous fuzzing as a service platform.\r\n\r\nI saw that you implemented Fuzz targets but they are currently not running as part of the CI.\r\n\r\nWe have a free plan for OSS and I would be happy to contribute a PR if that's interesting.\r\nThe PR will include the following\r\n- Continuous Fuzzing of master branch which will generate new corpus and look for new crashes\r\n- Regression on every PR that will run the fuzzers through all the generated corpus and fixed crashes from previous step. This will prevent new or old bugs from crippling into master.\r\n\r\nYou can see our basic example [here](https://github.com/fuzzitdev/example-go) and you can see an example of \"in the wild\" integration [here](https://github.com/google/syzkaller).\r\n\r\nLet me know if this is something worth working on.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nYevgeny\r\n",
