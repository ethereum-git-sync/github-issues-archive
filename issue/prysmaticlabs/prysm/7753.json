The result is that every time GetVersion() is called, it re-tries to execute `git`, and fails over and over.\r\nThis results in spam in the logs, ignores consistent logging (it's just `log` package, instead of the prysm logger), and costs unnecessary overhead (eth2stats polls it a lot)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/15706a36cb251232ae0fbb787d1287a3e6aad707/shared/version/version.go#L30\r\n\r\n```\r\n2020/11/09 18:37:55 exec: \"git\": executable file not found in $PATH\r\n```\r\n\r\nCaching that the version is unavailable would be nice.\r\n",
