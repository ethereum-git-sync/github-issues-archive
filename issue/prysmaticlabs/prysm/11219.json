  "body": "# üêû Bug Report\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen calling the API route `/eth/v1/beacon/states/<state>/validators` using a historical state for `<state>` from a few days ago, I ran into this RPC error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nHTTP status 500; response body: '{\"message\":\"Invalid state ID: error while replaying history to slot=3661055: could not process block: could not process block header: proposer index: 155125 is different than calculated: 35920\",\"code\":500}'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe Beacon Node did not show any errors in its logs when this happened, so all I have is this RPC error message.\r\nI suspect this has something to do with Blinded Blocks?\r\n\r\nThis error is intermittent; trying it again a few minutes later worked properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Has this worked before in a previous version?\r\n\r\nI believe this started with v2.1.4, but it could be related to Bellatrix or something else that happened around this time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nThat's a good question, I haven't been able to repro it reliably unfortunately.\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî• Error\r\n\r\nSee above\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Operating System:**\r\n`Debian 11 x64`\r\n\r\n**What version of Prysm are you running? (Which release)**\r\n`v2.1.4` or more accurately, Docker image `prysmaticlabs/prysm-beacon-chain:HEAD-4e225f-debug`\r\n\r\n",
