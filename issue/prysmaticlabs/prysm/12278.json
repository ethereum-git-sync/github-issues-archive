  "body": "# ðŸ’Ž Issue\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\nCurrently blocks built via relays/builders consist of the majority of the blocks on mainnet. However due to how the builders interact with validators, the whole proposal process is fraught with many failure modes when proposers run with builders. This issue is to track including builders into our e2e test suite so that this process can be better tested.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nCurrently there is no way to test builder paths effectively for prysm in our E2E test suite, the solution for this would be to build an independent builder component which will separately pack transactions and submit it to the proposer with a bid. Running this component as a separate service will allow us to test the builder paths out along with testing the scenarios that we want.\r\n\r\nAn earlier attempt of proof of concept of this was done here https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/12017 .\r\n",
