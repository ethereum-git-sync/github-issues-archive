  "body": "**Description**:\r\n\r\nThe blob pending queue is not being utilized in the current sync package. When a blob sidecar is received without its parent, it gets cached. However, even after caching, it is subsequently requested again from the peer from which the block was received. This behavior seems redundant and potentially inefficient.\r\n\r\n**Possible Solutions**:\r\n1. **Remove Blob Pending Queue**: If the queue is not serving any functional purpose, it might be best to remove it entirely and rely solely on a request-on-demand mechanism.\r\n2. **Enhance the Use of Blob Pending Queue**: Alternatively, we can optimize the use of the blob pending queue to prevent re-requesting cached blobs from peers.",
