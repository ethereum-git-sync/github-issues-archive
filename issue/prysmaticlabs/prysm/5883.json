He didn't use the `--enable-account-metrics`\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIn the previous version, if you don't add `--enable-account-metrics` to the validator command, then you don't have access at all to http://localhost:8081/metrics\r\nNow it seems like some of the metrics are still getting through without it, and it is misleading some users. I'm also not sure this is a wanted behavior at all.\r\n\r\nI would personally expect either you enable everything or either you don't want anything. ",

    "body": "To give a bit of background on this, having validator account metrics on by default causes high data carnality which can inflate retention sizes in tsdb. This is only a concern to users running many validators. So the current behavior is working as intended but it does have some user confusion. \r\n\r\nI'm going to mark this as a feature request to invert the flag functionality. Power users can opt-out of validator account metrics rather than having most users opt-in.",
