Log an error stating that the default Prysm nodes will be removed in the next release. It can go in the same block as this warning. (alpha.19)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/7903ec0b12dcc705bac0e5eee6b457be687b6dee/beacon-chain/node/node.go#L469\r\n\r\n2. Remove default flag value, fail when unset. (alpha.20 or later)\r\n\r\nUsers could still opt to use Prysm's hosted nodes which will remain available for the foreseeable future, but they should not grow accustomed to this practice since we may not offer this service at mainnet launch.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nWe already display a warning, but users are still using Prysm's hosted eth1 nodes. \r\nThis may be because of a knowledge gap or a lack of willingness to run their own eth1 node.\r\n",
