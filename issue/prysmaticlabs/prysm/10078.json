However, the analyzer currently does not detect more complex patterns as seen by the following examples:\r\n[example 1](https://github.com/Heph789/prysm/blob/feature/recursivelock-analyzer/tools/analyzers/recursivelock/testdata/complexlocks.go) \r\n[example 2](https://github.com/Heph789/prysm/blob/feature/recursivelock-analyzer/tools/analyzers/recursivelock/testdata/globallocks.go).\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️--> It would be great if someone expanded on my analyzer (or perhaps created an analyzer from scratch) in order to catch these more complex patterns. If you're not familiar with the Go AST or analysis tools, feel free to message me. I'd be happy to walk through what my analyzer does and how it works since there aren't good beginner guides on static analysis in Go.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️--> None to my knowledge.\r\n",
