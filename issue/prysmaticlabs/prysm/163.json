  "body": "Currently the mock `smcClient` is used for testing both in the notary and proposer packages. \r\n```go\r\ntype smcClient struct {\r\n\tsmc         *contracts.SMC\r\n\tdepositFlag bool\r\n\tt           *testing.T\r\n       backend   *simulated.backend\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\nInstead of repeating it for testing in both notary and proposer, it would be better to define it in a common package and then use it from there.\r\n\r\nSo the mock smcClient , and its methods can be defined in `sharding/client/testing`  and have its methods defined something like this:\r\n```go\r\nfunc (s *smcClient) Account() *accounts.Account {\r\n\treturn &accounts.Account{Address: addr}\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunc (s *smcClient) SMCCaller() *contracts.SMCCaller {\r\n\treturn &s.smc.SMCCaller\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunc (s *smcClient) ChainReader() ethereum.ChainReader {\r\n\treturn nil\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunc (s *smcClient) Context() *cli.Context {\r\n\treturn nil\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis will be blocked by #131 and #111 as it can only be done when they are completed",
