  "body": "# ðŸš€ Feature Request\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, our spec test suite downloads spec tests from a repository [here](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-spec-tests/tree/master/tests) using a Bazel HTTP rule, and then we have to write manual Go tests for each test case according to the assertions required. We do this by checking all test cases under a hard-coded test directory path such as:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntests := readTestCases(\"tests/minimal/epoch_processing/capella\")\r\nfor _, tt := range tests {\r\n  runEpochProcessingTest(tt)\r\n}\r\n```\r\nHowever, if there is a typo in the test directory path, our test will `PASS` despite us not testing anything. Instead, we should check that we read every single file inside of the spec tests repository during our test suite so that we do not forget an important case due to a typo.\r\n",
