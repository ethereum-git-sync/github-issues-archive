  "body": "# ðŸš€ Feature Request\r\n\r\n### Current behavior\r\nCurrently, if multiple keys are set in Prysm validator, and if only one of them (or more generally, a subset) fails the Doppelganger test, then Prysm validator refuses to start, and so does not attest/propose blocks for all other valid keys.\r\n\r\n### Wished behavior\r\nIf multiple keys are set in Prysm validator, and if only one of them (or more generally, a subset) fails the Doppelganger test, then Prysm validator could start anyway and attest/propose blocks for all other valid keys, while logging error messages for keys with doppelganger issues.\r\n\r\nWe might imagine 2 implementations:\r\n1. Keys with Doppelganger issues will remain definitely invalid until Prysm validator restart\r\n2. Keys with Doppelganger issues will be retried every epoch, and will become eventually valid.\r\n\r\n### A little bit of context\r\nIf we have for example:\r\n- Validator 1 connected to Web3Signer\r\n- Validator 2 connect to the same Web3Signer\r\n\r\nand if we want to move some keys from validator 1 to validator 2, then validator 2 won't start unless we deactivate (at least temporarily) DoppelGanger.\r\n\r\nSome people will argue that we could disable doppelganger check (and local anti slashing database) since Web3Signer provides an anti-slashing mechanism, but sometimes 2 (3) protections are better than 1.\r\n",
