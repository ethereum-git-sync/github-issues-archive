  "body": "# ðŸš€ Feature Request\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nBy default many other clients include the client name + version/build info in the graffiti area of a proposed block, while still allowing the user to override this value with a flag.\r\n\r\nKnowing the version of the client software that produced a block can be helpful for debugging. This also sets us up to align with a [proposed engine api change](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/pull/517) enabling clients to easily include CL+EL identifiers in blocks, which will aid in analyzing the health of EL client diversity.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nSet the default graffiti to include the \"prysm\" agent identifier along with version/build information. We already have the option to customize graffiti, so we only need to change the default to include prysm build info.",
