  "body": "# üêû Bug Report\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIn schlesi, there has been a current long running fork with more than 80 epochs since finality. This had led to clients being on different side of the fork. As a consequence Prysm has had to process blocks from the other side of the fork. However due to the nature of how long the chain had been forked, each block necessitated a recalculation of a base state from more than 70 epochs back. This has lead us being unable to process the block and the state. The error is stated below.\r\n\r\n### Has this worked before in a previous version?\r\n\r\nN.A\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nRunning the slasher will reproduce the error as it tries to retrieve all blocks from genesis and\r\nverify them.\r\n\r\n## üî• Error\r\n\r\n```\r\ntime=\"2020-05-17 00:51:25\" level=error msg=\"Failed to handle p2p pubsub\" error=\"could not process block: could not execute state transition: could not process block in slot 141257: could not process block header: proposer index: 317 is different than calculated: 150\" prefix=sync topic=\"/eth2/9925efd6/beacon_block/ssz_snappy\"\r\n```\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n",
