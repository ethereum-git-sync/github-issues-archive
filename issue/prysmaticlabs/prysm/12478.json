We can now bundle both the consensus and networking config data into a single config. \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis issue is to track the update of our internal config structure to accommodate this particular change. Some things to be mindful of:\r\n-  Does not break users running custom devnets. Previous flags/configurations used by them still work fine here. \r\n-  This works fine with e2e and our other multiclient testing configurations. ",
