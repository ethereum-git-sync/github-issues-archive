(Use bazelisk to automatically download bazel 6 based on `.bazel_version`)\r\nStep 2: Observe failing builds\r\nStep 3: Update bazel-toolchains, fix everything (???), and update documentation for cross-toolchain compilation in docker sandbox or RBE with compatible backend\r\nStep 4: Observe successful builds\r\n",

You may see errors or other issues that are caused by the breaking changes in `Bazel 6.`\r\n\r\nUpdate `bazel_toolchains` to the latest version and make any necessary changes to your project's configuration or code to fix any issues caused by the update. You may also need to update the documentation for your project to reflect the changes made in step 3.\r\n\r\nObserve the builds in your project again to see if they are successful. If the builds are successful, your project should be updated and ready to use with Bazel 6.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that updating to a new version of Bazel may introduce other changes or breaking changes that could affect your project.
