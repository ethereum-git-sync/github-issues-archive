  "body": "# ðŸ¦„ Feature Request\r\n\r\nThe shell script `prysm.sh` currently checks the environment for `shasum` which gives `shasum -a 256` later on line :137 to check integrity of download. Some systems have `sha256sum` installed in place of `shasum` where the call `sha256sum -c <file to check>` is equivalent to `shasum -a 256 -c <file to check>`.\r\nAn incoming PR `shell_script_support4_sha256sum` makes the appropriate changes to `prysm.sh` to accommodate this other call. \r\n",
