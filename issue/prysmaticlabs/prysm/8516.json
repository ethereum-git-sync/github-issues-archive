  "body": "# ðŸš€ Feature Request\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIt would be handy to expose the version of the beacon node through a prometheus metric.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nA metric that shows something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nprysm_info{version=\"1.3.1\"} 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nwould be nice (and similar to how the Go version is already presented in the metrics).  Additional labels can be added for other items if desired (commit hash or whatever).\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nCould do this through an API call, but prometheus is very much the standard here so providing the info through prometheus gives it much wider reach.",
