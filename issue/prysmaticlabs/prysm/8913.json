  "body": "# ðŸ’Ž Issue\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\nOur optimized slasher implementation is a total rewrite of how slasher is meant to function. Although it is meant to be more efficient from first principles, there are a few low-hanging fruit we want to improve to ensure the implementation is up to high standards.\r\n\r\nOne of the slow functions is `CheckAttesterDoubleVotes` found https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/401f73d341a119feccacb1f9cf56d11d2b9fdea6/beacon-chain/db/slasherkv/slasher.go#L89. The goal of the function is to detect if a validator has created a double vote attestation, that is, the validator has cast two attestations at the same target epoch with different attestation data roots.\r\n\r\nThe current implementation is fairly naive, doing the following:\r\n```\r\nTake in a list of attestations\r\nCreate an empty list of double votes found\r\nfor each attestation:\r\n  for each validator in its attesting indices:\r\n    database_key = attestation.target_epoch ++ validator\r\n    if exists_in_db(database_key): append to list of double votes\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe could have hundreds of attesting indices and hundreds of attestations passed into this function. The impact on CPU is quite clear here: \r\n\r\n<img width=\"1748\" alt=\"Screen_Shot_2021-05-20_at_9 44 50_AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5572669/119023450-863f5680-b967-11eb-8238-3deaef19f85b.png\">\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWe want to identify a solution that improves this performance bottleneck and can be benchmarked.",
