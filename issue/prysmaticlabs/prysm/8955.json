    "body": "After looking more thoroughly into the problem, it could be related to `updateFinalizedBlockRoots()`. Until the block root is written into the DB we use an in-memory mapping of roots that is shared with forkchoice, but upon finalization we essentially rebuild the canonical roots DB and refer to that instead of the in-memory map. That could explain the sudden change what the beacon node is reporting.",
