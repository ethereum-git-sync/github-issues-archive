  "body": "# ðŸ’Ž Issue\r\nThe subcommand for computing the latest weak subjectivity checkpoint could be improved. One idea is to call it `prysmctl cpt weak-subjectivty`.\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n It was originally a companion command to checkpoint sync, so it lives right next to `cpt save` (used for downloading state+block ssz files for checkpoint sync). Now that these are 2 distinct concepts, we should give it a clearer differentiating name.",
