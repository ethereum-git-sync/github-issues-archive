    "body": "There is a better summary on the core issue offline:\r\nhttps://discord.com/channels/476244492043812875/550365651118850081/803258212701700116\r\n\r\nThe gist of this is that, iterating through buckets often can be expensive and can be especially expensive for heavily used buckets such as `blocks` and `state-summary` buckets. These buckets often have multiple routines reading and writing to it, given that we require bucket stats , which requires us to iterate through all the pages in a bucket it can be pretty expensive especially for buckets with a large amount of data(ex:  blocks bucket). In periods with high intensity , getting stats from this particular bucket can be very expensive, which leads to the high cpu and memory usage seen here. A few tentative solutions:\r\n\r\n- Disable all db metrics collection, so as to still have access to other metrics. \r\n- Disable metrics collection for those particular buckets.\r\n\r\nThe former is an extreme solution which would lead us to having much less data on a critical part of the application. The latter is a better variant of this, as we can instead focus on the problematic buckets and not collect any data from them(while still unblocking us and any subsequent metrics collection).",
