    "body": "Removing `go-ssz` is important, as I believe `compositeSliceSSZ` in go-ssz doesn't check list limits. Making it susceptible to a network split if used in production in a multi-client testnet. And there have been others problems, as discussed in discord. And with a new better SSZ, I am all for replacing the bazel build step to just default prysm to a safe and fast ssz, in every build mode. :clap: ",
