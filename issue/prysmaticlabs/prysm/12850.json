  "body": "# üêû Bug Report\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIn Nethermind we reverted one of the changes and ensured that our eth_call is according to the spec:\r\nhttps://[ethereum.github.io/execution-apis/api-documentation/](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-apis/api-documentation/)\r\nOne of important things is to have \"input\" field on transaction details.\r\n\r\nWhen this adjustment was made, noticed that on any node with Prysm (sepolia/mainnet/goerli) we started getting errors:\r\n```\r\nError when handling ID 3, eth_call({\r\n  \"data\": \"0x621fd130\",\r\n  \"from\": \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\",\r\n  \"to\": \"0x7f02c3e3c98b133055b8b348b2ac625669ed295d\"\r\n},latest) | {\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"error\":{\"code\":-32015,\"message\":\"VM execution error.\",\"data\":\"revert\"},\"id\":3}\r\n```\r\nAfter some investigation we noticed, that instead of receiving \"input\" from prysm we got \"data\". When we reverted that change everything is fine for now, but the usage of eth_call in that scenario is not matching the API specifications mentioned above.\r\n\r\n### Has this worked before in a previous version?\r\n\r\nYes, until we adjusted according to spec.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease let us know how we can reproduce this issue. Include the exact method you used to run Prysm along with any flags used in your beacon chain and/or validator. Make sure you don't upload any confidential files or private keys.\r\n-->\r\nI guess it is quite self explanatory from Description - as for now Nethermind handles both fields but we would like to support only one as described in spec.\r\n\r\n## üî• Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\nError when handling ID 3, eth_call({\r\n  \"data\": \"0x621fd130\",\r\n  \"from\": \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\",\r\n  \"to\": \"0x7f02c3e3c98b133055b8b348b2ac625669ed295d\"\r\n},latest) | {\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"error\":{\"code\":-32015,\"message\":\"VM execution error.\",\"data\":\"revert\"},\"id\":3}\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Operating System:**\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n  <code>\r\nUbuntu 22.04, Docker installation of Prysm and nethermind\r\n  </code>\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n**What version of Prysm are you running?
