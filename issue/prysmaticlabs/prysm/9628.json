  "body": "# Slasher Documentation is inaccurate\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\nIn the future, it is expected that slasher functionality will move from a dedicated binary to a command line argument to the beacon-chain binary.  This change is expected with v2.0.0, coinciding with the Altair upgrade.  As part of this change, public facing client documentation will need to be updated.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI have found several errors in documentation that should be addressed prior to the v2.0.0 release\r\n\r\n1. Currently, the guide at https://docs.prylabs.network/docs/prysm-usage/slasher/ indicates that one should simply add --slasher to the beacon node command line arguments to active a slasher.  However, as of c2.0.0-rc.0, this command line flag is inaccurate and using it causes `\"ERR0[0000] flag provided but not defined: -slasher  prefix-main\"  `  It appears that the documentation is referencing a future state which is not yet correct.  Documentation should be caveated with this information.\r\n\r\n2. This same page also references an invalid command line switch for slashing protection at the validator `--enable-external-slashing-protection` but this command line switch as implemented in the validator is actually `--enable-external-slasher-protection`",

Our plan for improving our docs involves adding documentation versioning, which will help with this problem. I will amend the current docs to resolve this issue for now.",
