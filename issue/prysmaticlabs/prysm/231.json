  "body": "Hi all,\r\n\r\nAs part of #230 and our greater effort to proceed with a random beacon chain implementation, our system will have little to no dependencies on geth, therefore it is not necessary for us to continue using their environment and build system. As we implement the random beacon chain, we should look into gradually eliminating geth from this repository and proceeding with turning this repository into our own codebase and not just a fork.\r\n\r\nA tangible item for this issue could be to start integrating Bazel into this repository instead of using geth's build system. Eventually, this entire repo will become a Bazel repo. @prestonvanloon expressed interest in this - assigning provisionally.",
