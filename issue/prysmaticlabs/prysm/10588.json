  "body": "Today we have fallback support for eth1 endpoint and that's not the same as fallback support for ee endpoint. I propose that we remove support for either since eth1 endpoint will be replaced by ee endpoint. The benefits are multiple EE isn't as clear and we could replace the fallback option with the proxy approach. \r\n\r\nWhy removal?\r\nThese backup endpoints are generally for 3rd party services like Inufra and since an EE can only be driven by a single beacon node, the shared backup is no longer feasible. For at-home setup, there's no longer an option to use centralized services as a backup. For enterprise setup, redundancy for many EE is going to be more expensive. Redundancy for EE is less appealing economically than existing places and the benefits of redundancy with EE be becomes dubious. \r\n\r\nWhat we could do is support failover via multiple EE via external built proxy and that requires another design of its own\r\n",
