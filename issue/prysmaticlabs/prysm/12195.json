  "body": "# üêû Bug Report\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhile testing Prysm with my execution multiplexer ([eleel](https://github.com/michaelsproul/eleel)) I noticed that some of Prysm's forkchoiceUpdated messages were not matching Lighthouse.\r\n\r\nI tracked it down to Prysm sometimes setting the `safeBlockHash` to the `finalizedBlockHash` rather than the `justifiedBlockHash`. I noticed that this seems to happen only for fork choice updates that include payload attributes, which at a glance makes sense given the code here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/f5bfb8e9eb8c00adb7e72396183e4e14d41abb25/beacon-chain/rpc/prysm/v1alpha1/validator/proposer_execution_payload.go#L139-L143\r\n\r\nThis isn't a critical bug, and I think the impact is minimal. For now I'll work around it in `eleel`.\r\n\r\n### Has this worked before in a previous version?\r\n\r\nNot sure. I noticed it on v3.2.2 and upgrading to v4.0.0 didn't fix it.\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Operating System:**\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n  <code>\r\nUbuntu 22.04 x86_64\r\n  </code>\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n**What version of Prysm are you running? (Which release)**\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n  <code>\r\nv4.0.0\r\n  </code>\r\n</pre>",
