I created a chain yesterday with the following config:\r\n\r\n- min genesis time 1587755000 (7:03:20 pm UTC)\r\n- min genesis delay 3600\r\n\r\nHowever, both Prysm and Lighthouse did compute different genesis times:\r\n- Prysm computed genesis time 8:00:00 pm UTC\r\n- Lighthouse computed genesis time 9:00:00 pm UTC\r\n\r\n### Has this worked before in a previous version?\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nI created a Schlesi config for Prysm to be able to hack the genesis delay:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/compare/v0.12...byz-f:q9-schlesi-config?expand=1\r\n\r\nFor Lighthouse, I uploaded the spec here: https://github.com/goerli/schlesi\r\n\r\n## üî• Error\r\n\r\nLighthouse genesis time:\r\n\r\n```\r\nApr 24 21:35:26.680 INFO Starting node prior to genesis          seconds_to_wait: 5073\r\n```\r\nThe timestamp is UTC+2, so genesis time in Lighthouse is 9:00:00 pm UTC.\r\n\r\nPrysm genesis time:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[2020-04-24 20:35:50]  WARN initial-sync: Genesis time is in the future - waiting to start sync... genesis time=2020-04-24 22:00:00 +0200 CEST\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe timestamp is UTC+2, so genesis time in Prysm is 8:00:00 pm UTC.\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Operating System:**\r\n\r\nArch Linux with Bazel.\r\n\r\n**What version of Prysm are you running?
