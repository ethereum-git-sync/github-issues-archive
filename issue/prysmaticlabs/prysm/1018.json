  "body": "Currently in our repo there are 3 sync services which are started up concurrently, however the initial sync and normal sync services are directly dependent on the result of the sync query service. Currently, the sync query service blocks until it can get a result to pass on towards the other sync services. This is not optimal,as all the services should be able to be run concurrently. \r\n\r\nA solution to this would be to collapse the sync services into a single service and have the sync query encapsulated in this combined sync service so that the result can be used to determine whether to run normal or initial sync. \r\n\r\nDoing this would also simplify the logic we have right now in trying to start both the initial sync and normal sync concurrently.
