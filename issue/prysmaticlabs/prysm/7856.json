  "body": "# üêû Bug Report\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAt the moment, eth1data consensus is not being reached.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7246818/99590732-98cdd880-29a2-11eb-8fc3-5a127e0c5734.png)\r\n\r\nNimbus is voting for a very old block, 5 days old. https://goerli.etherscan.io/block/0x0566a632683a61180a735bf72f7daea59deeb9781d4a43be41a86d484df6287f\r\n\r\nLighthouse and Teku are voting on a block that is 30 minutes older than what Prysm thinks is the start of the eth1voting period.\r\nhttps://goerli.etherscan.io/block/0x3da88bec112d32d5e81741dfd395df14381346ebf48b91b1bfa111fdb7a69b5f\r\n(Nov-18-2020 10:18:00 AM +UTC)\r\n\r\nPrysm thinks the start of this eth1data voting period is \r\n```javascript\r\nnew Date((1605700807 + 2048*12-2048*14)*1000)\r\n// Wed Nov 18 2020 02:51:51 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time)\r\n```\r\nGenesis time is 1605700807\r\nSlot is 2048\r\nEth1FollowDistance is 2048\r\n\r\nSo the current start slot time minus the eth1followdistance comes out to be `Wed Nov 18 2020 02:51:51 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time)`.\r\n\r\nSo Prysm considers this block to be the highest block in the previous eth1data voting period. https://goerli.etherscan.io/block/0x227ed776f1e4a705ec8fae4ac1342d316be3f4cb9bf5248a9848bf344776f9c5 (Nov-18-2020 10:51:45 AM +UTC)\r\n\r\nThe reason I am filing a bug in Prysm is that I think that Prysm's voting with the majority mechanism should consider votes from the previous voting period to be acceptable. Otherwise we could see these types of issues or off by one issues when multiple blocks are produced in quick succession on eth1.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to consider, if client teams do not have the same eth1 block time of 14s then it will be even more difficult to reach eth1data consensus at mainnet.  Some additional context: https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/issues/2132 Prysm MUST conform with other clients in this regard for mainnet configuration. As such, I am marking this as a P0.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Has this worked before in a previous version?\r\n\r\nMaybe when Prysm was the majority then Lighthouse and Teku would favor Prysm's block vote because it is still in range of their interpreted eth1data voting period.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nThis is occuring in Pyrmont testnet.\r\n\r\n## üî• Error\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Operating System:**\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n**What version of Prysm are you running? (Which release)**\r\n\r\nv1.0.0-beta.3\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant (validator index / public key)?**\r\n\r\n- [x] Fix caching issue\r\n- [ ] Fix mainnet spec config difference",
