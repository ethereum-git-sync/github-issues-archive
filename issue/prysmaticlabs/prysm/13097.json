  "body": "When a node doesn't have a parent, it's placed into the pending block queue. This queue has a designated pruning time, after which blocks are pruned. However, the Seen Block Cache remains set to true for these blocks, which prevents them from being reinserted into the pending block queue in the future.\r\n\r\nThe Seen Block Cache does not currently account for blocks pruned from the pending block queue. It treats any block that has ever been inserted into the pending block queue as \"seen,\" thereby preventing future processing of these blocks. This becomes problematic when the eth1 client reconnects, as it cannot re-insert blocks that should now be pending but are marked as \"seen.\"",
