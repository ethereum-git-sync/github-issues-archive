  "body": "# Beacon Chain node sync progress & relation to the validator\r\n\r\n### Background\r\nIn the section [How to tell if Prysm is running as expected - Running the beacon node](https://docs.prylabs.network/docs/prysm-usage/is-everything-fine#running-the-validator-client)  there is a claim that properly running beacon node looks like this (in a screen):\r\n```\r\n... level=info msg=\"Synced new block\" block=...\r\n... level=info msg=\"Finished applying state transition\" ...\r\n```\r\nBut a screenshot is not good enough information, it would be better to put more detail or reference where can I read about the details of the beacon node sync.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nI will just ask 2 questions:\r\n\r\n1. Are you suppose to wait till the beacon node will sync to the current epoch number to run the validator or is it fine like according to the screenshot in the docs? For example, according to the screenshot in the page I am `good to go` but according to the log I am currently 3000 epochs behind so(current epoch is `32462` I am at `29531`) I am not sure if it is good time to start my validator yet or wait till the beacon node catch up with the last epoch.\r\n```\r\n... Synced new block\" block=0xc6a3efa5... epoch=29533 finalizedEpoch=29531 finalizedRoot=0x43900a46... prefix=blockchain slot=945056 slotInEpoch=0\r\n... Finished applying state transition\" attestations=30 prefix=blockchain slot=945056\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. could someone provide me a link or a way how to read more about the params in the log of prysm beacon-node? I would understand more about them and about the underlying concepts?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for the info info I will submit a PR and update the docs for others.\r\n",
