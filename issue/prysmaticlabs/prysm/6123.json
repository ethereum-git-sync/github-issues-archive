This first spike has been followed a bit after by a crash of all my validators balance of about 0.5 ETH each. Then when the balances has been fixed there was a second spike of CPU usage, mem didn't move much\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23481418/83732402-46933800-a64c-11ea-82f1-21c130f1a522.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Has this worked before in a previous version?\r\n\r\nThis is not the first time I see this happening, even though it's pretty rare, but this is the first time this is that big.
