  "body": "This issue exists to track progress on exploration of other serialization strategies for sharding and Ethereum. We'll likely want to move this into a new repository once work has been started.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nWith RLP and other serialization mechanisms for Ethereum, it feels a bit like reinventing the wheel when there may be a more supported open source library.\r\n\r\nThe main motivation for RLP:\r\n\r\n> The alternative to RLP would have been using an existing algorithm such as protobuf or BSON; however, we prefer RLP because of (1) simplicity of implementation, and (2) guaranteed absolute byte-perfect consistency.\r\n\r\nThe question we try to answer is whether or not this is an issue that is not already solved by protocol buffers or other mechanisms.\r\n\r\n## Challenges with Hashing in Different languages\r\n\r\n> Key/value maps in many languages don't have an explicit ordering, and floating point formats have many special cases, potentially leading to the same data leading to different encodings and thus different hashes.\r\n\r\nSee [RLP design rationale](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Design-Rationale#rlp) for more context.\r\n\r\n# Google Protobuf\r\n\r\n> Protocol buffers are Google's language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data – think XML, but smaller, faster, and simpler. You define how you want your data to be structured once, then you can use special generated source code to easily write and read your structured data to and from a variety of data streams and using a variety of languages.\r\n\r\n## How to test consistency across all languages?\r\n\r\nOne option is to write a gRPC service definition and implement the test in each popular language. The test would be easy to extend to another language, provided that it implements the service. \r\n\r\n## gRPC server for each language\r\n\r\nExample service defintion: \r\n\r\n```protobuf\r\nservice SerializerTest {\r\n  rpc TestHash(Block) returns (Hash) {}\r\n}\r\n\r\nmessage Block {\r\n  Header header = 1;\r\n  repeated Header uncles = 2;\r\n  repeated Transaction transactions = 3;\r\n\r\n  message Header {\r\n    bytes parent_hash = 1;\r\n    bytes uncles_hash = 2;\r\n    ...\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nmessage Transaction {\r\n  uint64 nonce = 1;\r\n  uint64 price = 2;\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Hash result \r\nmessage Hash {\r\n  bytes hash = 1;\r\n  Block block = 2;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe request proto has an object resymboling a block then the service response with the resulting hash. The test then compares this against the actual hash. \r\n\r\nThe test can and should be populated with real Ethereum blocks that have been mined and their associated hash. This provides solid evidence that these test cases are valid.\r\n\r\n## Why set up this infrastructure of gRPC services?\r\nThe main idea is that we can run these tests against each language with an agnostic client, in isolation.\r\n\r\n## Why gRPC?\r\nDue to its low boilerplate, code generation, and structured payload. \r\n\r\n*List of official supported languages*\r\n\r\n- c++\r\n- java\r\n- python\r\n- go\r\n- ruby\r\n- c#\r\n- node.js\r\n- android java\r\n- objective C\r\n- PHP\r\n- Dart\r\n\r\n*List of 3rd party supported languages*\r\n\r\n- [rust](https://github.com/stepancheg/grpc-rust)\r\n\r\nThere are probably many more languages...\r\n\r\n## How does the test client work?\r\nThe test client will act as a command line tool and most likely read from a series of config files.\r\n\r\nWe can imagine at least config for service to hit and another config for the test cases.\r\n\r\nThe client will send the test proto to each of the services listed, in parallel. At the end of test execution, the client will print and/or write a report of pass/fail for test cases.\r\n\r\nExample output of the client:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./run_tests\r\n\r\nRunning 5 test cases\r\n\r\nTest 1\r\nJava - PASS\r\nGo - PASS\r\nJavaScript - FAIL - Wanted hash ... got ...\r\nPython - PASS\r\n\r\nTest 2\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample services config:\r\n\r\n```toml\r\nservices = [\r\n   [\"java\", \"127.0.0.1:5001\"],\r\n   [\"go\", \"127.0.0.1:5002\"],\r\n   # ...\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample test protos:\r\n\r\nTODO: Real blocks with hashs in proto supported format.\r\n\r\n## What about service orchestration?\r\n\r\nMaybe using docker compose?\r\n\r\nIt would be annoying to start many gRPC services locally without a single command.\r\n\r\n## What about benchmarks?\r\nBenchmarks are important, but we already know RLP is not as good in terms of performance for serialization. \r\n\r\nWe can add language specific benchmarks after we answer the question: will this work at all?\r\n",

Moreover, RLP is the de facto encoding scheme throughout the entire Ethereum protocol, and the assumption is that the encoding scheme provides byte-perfect consistency.\r\n\r\nHate to be the nay-sayer, especially because I'd like to see a faster encoding scheme replace RLP as well, but I don't think we can use protobuf as is.",

The encoding is defined byte-for-byte independent of any platform. However, it is designed to be efficiently manipulated on common modern CPUs. Data is arranged like a compiler would arrange a struct – with fixed widths, fixed offsets, and proper alignment. Variable-sized elements are embedded as pointers. Pointers are offset-based rather than absolute so that messages are position-independent. Integers use little-endian byte order because most CPUs are little-endian, and even big-endian CPUs usually have instructions for reading little-endian data.",

    "body": "> Yep, take an encoding of a protobuf object and reorder the fields.

I want to clarify if you mean\r\n\r\n```\r\nmessage Foo {\r\n  uint64 a = 1;\r\n  bytes b = 2;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAnd \r\n```\r\nmessage Foo {\r\n  bytes b = 1;\r\n  uint64 a = 2;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWill be marshaled into the same bytes? If my understanding is correct, I've some followup questions:\r\n\r\n- What's the use case or reordering? I assume the convention is that when we define a proto msg, we usually don't break the field order.\r\n\r\n- And even one step back, does the order matters? In the case above, Foo hasn't been meaningfully changed, so that it should be okay to have the same serialized footprint in the memory, no?",
