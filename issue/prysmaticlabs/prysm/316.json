  "body": "Currently the tests for `proposeCollations` in #305 are unable to pass travis due to the fact they end up leaking into each other during the package test. The best way to fix it would be to use an alternate method rather than log hooks to check for whether collations have been created and sent. \r\n#### Lifecycle of Collation\r\n- Transactions are received from p2p feed\r\n- Transactions are then batched together into a collation and sent out\r\n- Transactions are serialized into blobs and then sent to the SMC\r\n- The collation is also saved into the shardDB\r\n\r\nThere are a few concurrent services going on which are set off when a collation is proposed , the fix would be to stop the services gracefully and appropriately handle them so as to not leak into other tests",
