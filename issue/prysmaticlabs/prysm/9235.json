    "body": "# :bulb: Workaround\r\n\r\nThere are no breaking changes between v1.3.11 (previous release) and v1.4.1. Therefore, it is possible and safe to run validator account commands with the prior version until a release for v1.4.2 is announced in the coming days.\r\n\r\nIf using the prysm.sh script, set the environment variable `USE_PRYSM_VERSION` to `v1.3.11` and run your commands.\r\n```\r\nUSE_PRYSM_VERSION=v1.3.11 ./prysm.sh validator accounts list\r\n\r\nUSE_PRYSM_VERSION=v1.3.11 ./prysm.sh validator accounts import\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf using docker `:stable` image, use the tag `:v1.3.11` for any _validator_ subcommands as pointed out above.\r\n\r\nLastly, it is safe to run v1.3.11 version of validator with the London hardfork ready beacon-chain at version v1.4.1. \r\nIf validator subcommands are blocking staking operations, it may be desired to run the prior version of the validator until v1.4.2 is released.\r\n\r\n## TL;DR\r\nIt's safe to run the validator at version v1.3.11 and the beacon node at version v1.4.1. Expect a patch release in 24 hours.\r\n",
