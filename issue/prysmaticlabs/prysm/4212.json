    "body": "@mog3n it's TCP port 13000. The issue here is that you maybe struggling to find peers that accept inbound connections and when you do find those peers they may go away at any time. \r\n\r\nOne potential solution is to change your set up so you can accept inbound connections. To do this, you can port forward TCP 13000 in your router to your local machine. Then you can add flag `--p2p-host-ip=$(curl -s ident.me)` which will advertise your public IP to peers. ",
