    "body": "This is a known cosmetic issue. Both v4.0.0 and v4.0.1 were built from the same commit `191e603e2816e63ca8b1d2615634108e009caceb`. I believe that there might have been a build cache hit that resulted in the version string not changing or the wrong version tag was selected when two tags existed at the same commit. \r\n\r\nA corrective action would be to rebuild and reissue the release for v4.0.1, but I feel that this isn't worth the trouble since these tags are on the same commit. We had to issue v4.0.1 to solve an issue with go.mod (#12201). \r\n\r\nOur next release, v4.0.2, comes out soon so this won't be an issue any longer. ",
