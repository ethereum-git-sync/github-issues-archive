For this reason, makes sense to look for ways to restrict the use of the engine API in the EL, so it is used by one CL at a time.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️--> If you have a solution in mind, please describe it.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the `auth-token` would be nice to add headers to the EL endpoint (`--http-web3provider`) requests, to indicate the Host who is requesting. This could be used in conjunction with the host whitelist in Geth `--authrpc.vhosts value`, see [geth docs](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interface/command-line-options).\r\n\r\nThis implementation should look similar to the one Prysm has already with the flag `--grpc-headers value`\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nNA\r\n",
