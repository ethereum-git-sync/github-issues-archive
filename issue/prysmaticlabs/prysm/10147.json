It might give me some insight on how to proceed with migrating the metrics.\r\n2. I assume since we are going to capture the metrics in `beacon-chain/`, the value of those metrics should be capturable within its packages.\r\n3. I noticed that most of the metrics for the validators are captured in: `validator/client/metrics.go`. Would you like the instantiation of these metrics migrated to `beacon-chain/monitor/metrics.go`, and for the values to be captured within the `beacon-chain/` packages?\r\n\r\nIf my assumption for point 3 is correct, then I think I know how I need to proceed.\r\n\r\nI would also imagine that there would be a 1 <> 1 correlation for the metrics within the two packages. As I migrate the metrics, they should be equal to each other. \r\n\r\nLet me know what you think.\r\n",

    "body": "I was considering the sort of metrics that might be useful for users that are not currently present. A few metrics I was capturing in my application were the following, and I wanted to see if they would be useful for validators to know:\r\n\r\n- `knownGaps` - Keep track of any gaps that might have occurred when head tracking. For instance, if the last slot we saw was `x`, and the next slot we see is `x+2` instead of `x+1`, then we know we have a gap. Not sure if this is something that can actually occur, or if its even worth capturing.\r\n- `reorgs` - Simply capture the number of reorgs that have occurred.\r\n- `skipped` - Keep track of the number of slots that have been skipped.\r\n\r\nLet me know if any of these seem useful. Also if you know of any metrics that users want/need, I would be more than happy to work on those. Currently, I am just looking for some inspiration. @potuz @james-prysm ",

But they are out of scope for this issue as this does not pertain the validator monitor. Metrics that should be added for this issue should be typically indexed by validator index tracked or aggregates among the tracked validators. ",
