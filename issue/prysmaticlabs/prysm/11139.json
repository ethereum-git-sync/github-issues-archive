  "body": "Hi!\r\n\r\nIn our validator config, we have multiple beacon-chain endpoints configured through the **--beacon-rpc-gateway-provider**  and **--beacon-rpc-provider** flags. However, whenever there is some sort of disconnection between the validator and the connected beacon-chain, the node does not failover to the next beacon-chain in the configured list. Instead, it just hangs and does not try to reconnect to the original beacon-chain endpoint or a new one. When this happens, the beacon node being used would still be healthy however the connection to it may have had a hiccup, and the validator client stops sending requests to it.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we also see a spike in `grpc_method=\"DomainData\" DeadlineExceeded` errors around this time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Hi @jacquesvcritien , I tried to reproduce the problem but the failover worked for me.\r\n\r\nFirst I started two beacon nodes:\r\n```\r\n--datadir=xxx --http-web3provider=zzz --prater\r\n\r\n--datadir yyy --http-web3provider=zzz --monitoring-port=8081 p2p-tcp-port=13001 --p2p-udp-port=12001 --grpc-gateway-port=3501 --rpc-port=4001 --prater\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen I started the validator client:\r\n```\r\n--wallet-dir=vvv --beacon-rpc-provider=\"127.0.0.1:4000,127.0.0.1:4001\" --beacon-rpc-gateway-provider=\"127.0.0.1:3500,127.0.0.1:3501\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nInitially the second beacon node was not fully synced and the validator started attesting, which ensured me that it's connected to the first node. After some time I stopped the first node and got the following logs from the validator client:\r\n```\r\nERROR validator: Could not receive blocks from beacon node, could not connect error=rpc error: code = Canceled desc = Context canceled\r\nWARN validator: block stream interrupted error=rpc error: code = Canceled desc = Context canceled: could not connect\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter a few minutes the validator client started attesting again:\r\n```\r\nINFO validator: Previous epoch voting summary correctlyVotedHead=false correctlyVotedSource=false correctlyVotedTarget=false epoch=113599 inactivityScore=0 newBalance=31.999053034 oldBalance=31.999064814 percentChange=-0.00004% percentChangeSinceStart=-0.00007% pubKey=0xb6bdb41f87ee startBalance=31.999076594\r\nINFO validator: Attestation schedule attesterDutiesAtSlot=1 pubKeys=[0xb6bdb41f87ee] slot=3635237 slotInEpoch=5 totalAttestersInEpoch=1\r\nINFO validator: Submitted new attestations AggregatorIndices=[] AttesterIndices=[372936] BeaconBlockRoot=0xce1e1e68cf22 CommitteeIndex=52 Slot=3635237 SourceEpoch=113600 SourceRoot=0xa18b0704344c TargetEpoch=113601 TargetRoot=0xc28561307823\r\n```\r\n",

    "body": "Hi @rkapka, (replying on behalf of @jacquesvcritien), we're hitting a different rpc error than Context canceled. Ours stall is being hit when the following error happens:\r\n```DeadlineExceeded desc = context deadline exceeded,```\r\n\r\nI want to figure out how to replicate this, as we've only hit this in production whilst validator clients are using a beacon chain at another provider and there's a hiccup in the internet connection for a short time (possibly seconds rather than minutes).",
