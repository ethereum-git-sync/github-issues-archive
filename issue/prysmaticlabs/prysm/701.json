  "body": "Whenever block processing or attestation processing fails, blockchain service tests hang and run forever rather than exit and fail. @rawfalafel suggested there's a blocking channel at the end of `processBlock` in `blockchain/service.go`, This issue makes it difficult to debug test failures as well as writing new blockchain service code and tests moving forward. We'll need to think of a better way to design those tests.",
