  "body": "The connection to Github is very unstable in China, sometimes the site is completely banned.\r\nWhen  Github connection is lost, even with Prysm client and blockchain data up to date, we still cannot run prysm with the default prysm.bat / prysm.sh script successfully. \r\nIs there a way to run Prysm beacon and validator client directly using local downloaded file? Just like geth and other clients, possibly with modified bat/sh file or a command specifying the executables.\r\nAny suggestion is appreciated. Thanks!",
