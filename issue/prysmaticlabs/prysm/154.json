  "body": "Hi all,\r\n\r\nGiven that #149 is merged and we have defined a `p2p` subpackage under the `sharding` package, we can start working on basic p2p proof of concepts. The p2p service is already initialized in `sharding/node/backend.go` as part of `ShardEthereum`. Now, we have a well-defined service that runs all the required peer to peer functionality for sharding, so we can start integrating existing go-libp2p code. As an example, we can take a look at what @mhchia has done already in his [code](https://github.com/mhchia/go-libp2p/blob/poc-testing/examples/minimal/listeningshards.go).\r\n\r\nAt the very least, if we can get some sort of echo pub/sub working that can be utilized via services in the system such as a notary, then we are on the right track. Let's get started on this asap.\r\n\r\nTeam help me scope this out into more tangible action items to move forward: @prestonvanloon @nisdas @terenc3t. ",
