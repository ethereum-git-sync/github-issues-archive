  "body": "# ðŸ’Ž Issue\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\nRunning a validator with Prysm currently centers around the use of the `prysm.sh` script to download and run the beacon chain, and validator executables. This approach does allow for easy updating, but goes against a more typical Linux system service paradigm.\r\n\r\nThere has been significant work done in the community to adapt the Prysm deployment to this more standard approach (e.g. Coin Cashew and Somer Esat guides), however this could be improved by providing an official package which streamlines many of these manual steps, and provide a 'secure by default' configuration.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis PR (#8872) aims to integrate the package building into the existing Bazel build infrastructure, so that these packages can be produced in a consistent manner.\r\n\r\nChanges to the default configuration and systemd unit files can be subject to the standard GitHub PR process. \r\nThese curated config files would allowing for validator maintainers to deploy a common 'just works' config quickly.\r\n\r\nUltimately, an Ubuntu PPA would ideally be created and maintained, so that authenticity of the packages can be ensured, and updates can be deployed to validators quickly and easily.",
