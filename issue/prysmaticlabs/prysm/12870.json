In such cases, syncing using the finalized epoch is not recommended.\r\n\r\nThe information that I deduce from the spec is:\r\n- We should consider some non-finalized check point within the retention window as finalized and checkpoint sync from it\r\n- This is more a client implementation mechanic to bypass the DA checks (I believe we do have this today)",
