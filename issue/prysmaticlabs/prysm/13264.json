However, it is not easy debugging when there are issues with proposals or attestations. Would it be possible to add a Prometheus metric indicating the consensus layer being used? This would help us identify the consensus layer likely to be causing issues at a particular time.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nHave a Prometheus metric indicating he consensus layer node endpoint being used by the validator client\r\n\r\n",
