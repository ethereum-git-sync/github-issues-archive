  "body": "# üêû Bug Report\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nCurrently client-stats will fail a scrape cycle altogether if one of the metrics is missing, with an error message like:\r\n```\r\n[2021-06-02 22:34:19]  INFO Scraping beacon-node at http://localhost:8080/metrics\r\n[2021-06-02 22:34:19] ERROR main: Scraper error: scraper did not find metric family p2p_peer_count\r\n```\r\nThis metric in particular could be missing while a beacon node metric is syncing and does not have active peers. Rather than failing the entire scrape job, we can log an INFO message for metrics that are missing and submit the metric with the zero value. \r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\nAll environments\r\n\r\n\r\n**What version of Prysm are you running? (Which release)**\r\n1.3.10\r\n",
