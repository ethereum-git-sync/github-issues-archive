  "body": "Currently, `sync/service.go` and `initial-sync/service.go` determines the sync status of the node (in relation to the network) by calling `db.HasStoredState()`. \r\n\r\n`db.HasStoredState()` only determines whether or not the local database has been initialized, not whether or not the local chain is caught up with the current chain. Therefore, we should replace `HasStoredState` with a new method `IsSynced` which surveys peers in the network. ",
