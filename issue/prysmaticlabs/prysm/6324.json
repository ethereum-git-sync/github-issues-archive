Beacon-node is set to announce the ddns name with `--p2p-host-dns`\r\n\r\n- 24h disconnect was around 3:20h that night, but peers started dropping at around 2:00h already\r\n- On previous days the disconnect had only minimal effect and peer count raised to 30 immediately again.\r\n- There are still inbound and outbound connections happening occasionally.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Has this worked before in a previous version?\r\n\r\nNever noticed similar problems.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nNot tried to reproduce it yet.\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Operating System:**\r\n\r\nUbuntu 20.04 on arm64\r\nDocker\r\n\r\n\r\n**What version of Prysm are you running? (Which release)**\r\n\r\n802bdf5 compiled from source\r\n\r\n",
