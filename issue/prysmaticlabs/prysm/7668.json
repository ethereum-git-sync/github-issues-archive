  "body": "#üêû Bug Report\r\n\r\nI ran head-sync on 8c2fff3a75ffe672781a8c8d61651f64c228c370 (yesterday's master) fine for ~20 hours.  Then it entered a sync loop:\r\n\r\n(Info level only): https://www.dropbox.com/s/5y5mnk3xa0acjre/INFOonly.txt?dl=0\r\n(Debug level): https://www.dropbox.com/s/xppeu8mvs5fkbvq/resync.log?dl=0\r\n(Smaller section debug level): https://www.dropbox.com/s/c1159hejul81ilu/message.txt?dl=0\r\n(DB): https://www.dropbox.com/s/u71r1sp3vayzy91/beaconchain.db.bak-loop?dl=0\r\n\r\nI built 3b34954e7583eff8868dd9c8933950004332db73 (current master) and ran with --head-sync and it quickly entered same sync loop.  I then tried without --head-sync and it jumps from 500156 to 610110 after about 7 minutes without Synced log and proceeds to reach head.  Validators are attesting well.  I did not expect such a sync behavior without using --head-sync.\r\n\r\nThough beacon later died (OOM total-vm: 24.9GB, anon-rss: 13.9 GB file-rss: 0).  Wasn't running eth2stats, or anything that would use the RPC other than validator.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAs above\r\n\r\n### Has this worked before in a previous version?\r\n\r\nMy first sync loop in a while.  Also normally I haven't had OOM kills.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nProbably hard to reproduce the --head-sync portion.  Perhaps the DB linked may help.  \r\n\r\n## üî• Error\r\n\r\nAs above\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Operating System:**\r\n\r\nUbuntu 20.04.1 LTS\r\n\r\n**What version of Prysm are you running? (Which release)**\r\nSee above.  Two different masters.",
