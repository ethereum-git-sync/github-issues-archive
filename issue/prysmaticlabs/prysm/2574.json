  "body": "Hi Prysmatic team,\r\n\r\nAntoine Toulmne and I are working on an ETH2 test runner that needs access to the state of the clients under test at each block. Currently, we're doing this by exposing a JSON log with the following format:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n   \"date\":1557296388510,\r\n   \"index\":1,\r\n   \"slot\":1,\r\n   \"epoch\":0,\r\n   \"block_root\":\"0x774D273A6A67482FAA5627A3F3CD3D55E2074EC89BDCC448873DA7B0F3F52C1B\",\r\n   \"block_parent_root\":\"0x73F42156F0E9611F710891CFB059EDFCA7CB18CBFF60DC0A6CB2ED39678B4782\",\r\n   \"block_body\":\"0x0DE2E04B0BF89EFEC669C00EF41BE42E8F93218B85CC6272C6CCD95B8399648D\",\r\n   \"last_justified_block_root\":\"0x73F42156F0E9611F710891CFB059EDFCA7CB18CBFF60DC0A6CB2ED39678B4782\",\r\n   \"last_justified_state_root\":\"0x38F7F34A166FB777C8647C66725F12454DCED268024BA5054C20ABF31CE7A213\",\r\n   \"last_finalized_block_root\":\"0x73F42156F0E9611F710891CFB059EDFCA7CB18CBFF60DC0A6CB2ED39678B4782\",\r\n   \"last_finalized_state_root\":\"0x38F7F34A166FB777C8647C66725F12454DCED268024BA5054C20ABF31CE7A213\",\r\n   \"validators\":[\r\n      {\r\n         \"pubkey\":\"(05209b1ea72bd2c1a430cda13d79cfbe617694c18b374a0fbf2a85aa74f6f582373f4ace1ac7b996969bc7540125ce84,08b081dc8249ef361d17510d17a193a7aee28940a9ab1fba742c1f7f9a3f9cf1288a767efcd37c750e91a8d0cf408b1f)\",\r\n         \"balance\":\"32000000000\"\r\n      }\r\n   ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe were thinking that the log would be exposed by either:\r\n\r\n1. A CLI flag to write the log to the specified directory.\r\n2. A JSON-RPC endpoint to get the log at a specified block.\r\n\r\nWhich would your team find more amenable, and what do you think of this approach in general? To make things easier, we're happy to implement this and open a PR.",

    "body": "> Do you have more details you could share?\r\n\r\nWe're looking to support a number of different test cases within the runner:\r\n\r\n1. Consensus spec compliance (i.e., via the YAML tests).\r\n2. Networking spec compliance.\r\n3. When they are developed, RPC spec compliance.\r\n\r\nWe'll perform testing both for single clients (i.e., by running the test suite against a 7-node Prysm cluster) and multiple clients (i.e., by running the test suite against a 7-node Prysm/Lighthouse cluster) for each of the above items. From there, we'll branch out into performance + stress testing. The goal of the JSON log specifically is to allow us to make assertions about the state of each node within a test cluster without having to standardize RPC interfaces immediately. In sum, the JSON log is a testing tool _only_ that we expect to be replaced eventually once RPC interfaces solidify.\r\n\r\n> Is it read on the fly and monitored or processed post test run?\r\n\r\nI believe we'd process it post test run. The runner is executed as part of a Jenkins job; including the JSON log as part of job results would be ideal for debugging purposes.\r\n\r\n> Also any thoughts to a push gateway?\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean by this? If by push gateway you're referring to a similar Websocket-based API as Lighthouse (https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/issues/374#issuecomment-491578805) was suggesting, I'd be happy to implement it.\r\n\r\n> Would the test runner support protobuf?\r\n\r\nWe're not currently planning on it.",
