In such cases, the new validator retains the status `STATUS_UNKNOWN`.\r\n\r\n### Has this worked before in a previous version?\r\n\r\nUnknown.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nI started with a working validator with no issues.\r\n\r\nI stopped the validator (in the gap between two attestations) and imported a new keystore into the same wallet as the first one:\r\n\r\nI then restarted the validator process:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ sudo systemctl stop prysmvalidator\r\n$ sudo /usr/local/bin/validator accounts import --keys-dir=/home/ianmacd/eth2deposit-cli/validator_keys\r\n$ sudo systemctl start prysmvalidator\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following was logged:\r\n\r\n```\r\nJul 16 07:15:31 serenity validator[53443]: time=\"2021-07-16 07:15:31\" level=info msg=\"Validating for public key\" prefix=validator publicKey=0x9961a780f5d5\r\nJul 16 07:15:31 serenity validator[53443]: time=\"2021-07-16 07:15:31\" level=info msg=\"Waiting for deposit to be observed by beacon node\" prefix=validator pubKey=0x9961a780f5d5 status=\"UNKNOWN_STATUS\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nI then made my contract deposit via the eth2 launchpad. It went into block 12836095. And then I waited.\r\n\r\nJust under 17 hours later, the deposit was accepted by the beacon chain in epoch 51,169, slot 1,637,422.\r\n\r\nI continued to wait, but the Prysm validator logged nothing to suggest it had noticed the clearance of the deposit.\r\n\r\nI waited for more than 7 hours and finally, after becoming somewhat nervous, decided to restart the Prysm validator, which then immediately logged the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nJul 17 11:35:43 serenity validator[59632]: time=\"2021-07-17 11:35:43\" level=info msg=\"Validating for public key\" prefix=validator publicKey=0x9961a780f5d5\r\nJul 17 11:35:43 serenity validator[59632]: time=\"2021-07-17 11:35:43\" level=info msg=\"Deposit processed, entering activation queue after finalization\" index=196685 positionInActivationQueue=1622 prefix=validator pubKey=0x9961a780f5d5 status=DEPOSITED\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo my great relief, the restart forced the validator deposit's change in status to be picked up by Prysm, All is now well.\r\n\r\nSo, either the deposit's change in status is not always noticed by Prysm, or Prysm merely fails to log that it noticed said change. Either way, this would appear to be a bug.\r\n\r\nI reported my finding to Nishant on the Prysmatic Labs Discord, and he requested that I open an issue on GitHub.\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\nDebian 10 (Buster)\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n  <code>\r\nLinux serenity 5.4.0-77-generic #86-Ubuntu SMP Thu Jun 17 02:35:03 UTC 2021 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\r\n  </code>\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n**What version of Prysm are you running?

So even if your validator had its deposit accepted and is `pending` , it will not log out the status of that validator until it becomes 'active' . To summarise this is a cosmetic issue, the validator client is aware of all keys at all times. Some solutions to this:\r\n\r\n1) Do nothing and leave the current validator client as it is.\r\n2)  Log out the current status of all keys during the start of an epoch.
