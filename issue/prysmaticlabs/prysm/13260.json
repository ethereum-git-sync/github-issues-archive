After downloading the master branch, it is failed to compile by using the command \"bazel build //beacon-chain --config=release\", and the result is as shown in the attached figure. But I can compile the branch \"v4.1.1\" successfully when there is a \"BUILD.bazel\" included in the folder \"beacon-chain\". \r\n![build](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/assets/41711151/61a1a0fd-bb2c-4fa7-a586-7a9811dfb884)\r\n\n\n### Has this worked before in a previous version?\n\n_No response_\n\n### 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\n\n_No response_\n\n### Error\n\n_No response_\n\n### Platform(s)\n\n_No response_\n\n### What version of Prysm are you running?
