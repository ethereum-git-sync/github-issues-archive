Also it could be better to have env vars controlling the params of the binary. \r\n\r\nProposal for new entry point\r\n```\r\n#!/bin/sh\r\nexec $@\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nThis container doesn't have a /bin/sh shell.

They consist of only the compiled binary for linux amd64 and the manifest that describes the docker image.\r\n\r\nIf you need shell, or any other tooling, then you may want to generate your own docker image. We think that a minimal image is more secure than an image that builds off of some external base image. \r\n\r\nWith regards to environment variables, what are the use cases? ",
