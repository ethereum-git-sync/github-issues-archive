  "body": "# ðŸš€ Feature Request\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nCurrently the ENRs created by a Beacon Node are dynamic, in the sense that they can constantly \r\nchange with new information added to it. For the purposes of running a bootnode/static node using a normal Prysm Node this is undesirable as we would have ENRs which are changing every few minutes. For this reason there should be a flag to allow static ENRs to be created. \r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nStatic ENRs would require discoveryV5 to stop endpoint prediction . Also new information should not be written to ENRs once the ENR has been instantiated. Another Action Item for this issue would be to allow the host ip address to be the only address added to an ENR in the case the flag is defined (do not add in the internal ip to the ENR).\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nN.A",
