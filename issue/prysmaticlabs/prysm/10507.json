  "body": "# ðŸš€ Feature Request\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to debug e2e tests. Useful information, like the start command for a component of interest, is surfaced in the logs, but the logs are so incredibly noisy that it is difficult to find anything. It is also difficult to find paths in the bazel sandbox for things like like logs or the db path for a component.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nA zpage that could be loaded while the test runs could provide extra info and context that could be helpful for a human running the test to better understand what's happening under the hood.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nI've also considered advocating for e2e tests to move into kubernetes, which would provide visibility into runtime components, make logs more accessible etc. But this would be a much bigger change! I'm very interested in other ideas for e2e UX improvements.",
