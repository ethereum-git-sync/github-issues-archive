It would be handy to have a flag to disable this behavior ,and always return the blinded block with payload from the MEV relay.\r\n\r\n### Has this worked before in a previous version?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nSent to prysm:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/eth/v1/validator/blinded_blocks/1882275?randao_reveal=0x97d2a7e4fbe3a21e79ab310a8e0a33104f0c650949d374da9f540756187e37a64b54ac147100edf453b297a897c36bc3119e1f86f1def8382ffab25620e8cbd8a4b9b659e76c11fcc648368b18bc5244989d81280966348345d90bd7231eb4a5&graffiti=0x417474657374616e742f566f7563680000000000000000000000000000000000\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Error\r\n\r\nReceived from prysm:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\"message\":\"Unsupported block type\",\"code\":400}\r\n```\r\n\r\nprysm logs show:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\"blockHash\":\"0xd98081ea8366e15d409ce5f7e288258ad938936c6a2489ef9ee72619d2204faa\",\"builderPubKey\":\"0x845bd072b7cd566f02faeb0a4033ce9399e42839ced64e8b2adcfc859ed1e8e1a5a293336a49feac6d9a5edb779be53a\",\"level\":\"info\",\"msg\":\"Received header with bid\",\"prefix\":\"rpc/validator\",\"time\":\"2023-03-09T00:15:00Z\",\"value\":\"957081901767780\"}\r\n{\"builderValue\":957081901767780,\"level\":\"warning\",\"localValue\":957081901914780,\"msg\":\"Proposer: using local execution payload because higher value\",\"prefix\":\"rpc/validator\",\"time\":\"2023-03-09T00:15:00Z\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\nprysm 3.2.2-rc.3",
