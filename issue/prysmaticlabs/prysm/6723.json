  "body": "ℹ️ **THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN MERGED INTO #6715**\r\n\r\n# Information \r\n\r\nTested on Ubuntu 20.04\r\n\r\n# Issues\r\n\r\n## Wallet\r\n\r\n### HD\r\n\r\nJULY 25\r\n\r\n- [x] The following prompt is displayed when creating a new wallet:\r\n\r\n> Confirm you have written down the recovery words somewhere safe (offline)? [y/N]\r\n\r\nTyping anything other than `y` results in the same behaviour, so the `N` option does not make much sense. Furthermore, typing `Y` does not confirm although it should. Maybe it would be better to change `[y/N]` to `[y/Y]`?\r\n\r\n- [x] When recovering the wallet I typed this pass phrase:\r\n\r\n> 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4\r\n\r\nThe message:\r\n\r\n> FATAL accounts-v2: Could not recover wallet: could not initialize new wallet seed file: could not convert mnemonic to wallet seed: word \\`1\\` not found in reverse map\r\n\r\nThen I typed `critic` 24 times and got this:\r\n\r\n> FATAL accounts-v2: Could not recover wallet: could not initialize new wallet seed file: could not convert mnemonic to wallet seed: Checksum incorrect\r\n\r\nIn my opinion these messages are too technical. In both scenarios a unified, more user-friendly message should be displayed.\r\n\r\n## Accounts\r\n\r\n### HD\r\n\r\nJULY 25\r\n\r\n- [x] Providing a wrong password on account creation displays this:\r\n\r\n> FATAL accounts-v2: Could not create new account: could not initialize keymanager: could not initialize derived keymanager: could not decrypt seed configuration with password: invalid checksum\r\n\r\nThe message should just say that the password is incorrect.\r\n\r\n- [x] The command `create --help` lists a `--skip-mnemonic-confirm` flag, but the mnemonic is a part of HD wallet creation, not account creation. Providing this flag when creating an HD wallet results in an unknown flag error.\r\n- [x] There is a small difference in formatting between `list` for a non-HD wallet and an HD wallet.\r\n\r\nNon-HD\r\n\r\n> ideally-composed-chipmunk\r\n[public key] 0xa5a1c7904c7a49a0930cb5494e340ae08c0b53e129d8555a3147ea8df10807ba98525ee0ba5ba487d99d6b579f057a54\r\n[created at] 1 day ago\r\n\r\nHD\r\n\r\n> positively-relative-skunk | 1 hour ago\r\n[withdrawal public key] 0xb0d4aff8a4557047858ee0d95115e453847680e3fc1d5f348e1814dafa4a666d776247e4e3d34c6876a3abda0a853f8a\r\n[derivation path] m/12381/3600/0/0\r\n[validating public key] 0x98585b12562cc6300658b9a1c3491b617e806d3eec672a2ba321658cacac0ad82ec184721651a53d987cefa115cb676a\r\n[derivation path] m/12381/3600/0/0/0\r\n\r\nThe Non-HD one has the creation date on a separate `[created at]` line while the HD one has the creation date in the first line after a separator.",
