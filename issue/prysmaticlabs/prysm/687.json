  "body": "Currently travis downloads the latest version on master from every dependency of prysm. This has caused issues where upstream maintainers have made a breaking change on master and our build breaks. To resolve this issue travis has to lock in versions of packages instead of downloading the latest one. \r\n\r\nA few dependency management solutions are, `gomod` or `deps` . However, would involve a large amount of work which might be overkill, since this just affects travis builds which are for lint and code coverage. \r\nAlso if the linter can be run on buildkite instead this issue would also be resolved.
