  "body": "üêû Bug Report\r\n\r\nWhen importing, if you enter the wrong wallet password, it will prompt you again for the correct one.  Once you submit the correct password, the program completes.  If you then try to import again (same directory or another), it will not accept the correct password.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è--> A clear and concise description of the problem...\r\n\r\n### Has this worked before in a previous version?\r\n\r\nI did not test it rigorously enough to say.  Based on experience, perhaps this is new within 24 hours.  This is a guess.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n1. git clone the most recent master and cd into it\r\n2. bazel run //validator -- accounts-v2 import --keys-dir=/dockermedalla/validator_keys\r\n3. Then put in the default directories.  Select a password for the wallet.\r\n4.  bazel run //validator -- accounts-v2 import --keys-dir=/dockermedalla/validator_keys2\r\n5.  This time, submit an incorrect password followed by the correct one and let it complete.\r\n6.  bazel run //validator -- accounts-v2 import --keys-dir=/dockermedalla/validator_keys3 \r\n7.  The password you chose will no longer work.  Alternative for step 6 you can just do accounts-v2 list or simply run the validator itself.  They will refuse the password.\r\n\r\nThis problem occurs even if you import the same keystore directory repeatedly, rather than different ones as above.\r\n\r\n## üî• Error\r\n\r\n```\r\nWrong password entered, try again: \r\nIncorrect password entered, please try again\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Operating System:**\r\n\r\nUbuntu 5.4.0-42-generic in a docker container in an Ubuntu VM.  (64 bit)\r\n\r\n**What version of Prysm are you running? (Which release)**\r\n\r\n6af950f0012fc3ab5ca5976e4de9e12596551c4d (latest master at the time of writing this issue)\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant (validator index / public key)?**\r\n\r\nNo\r\n",
