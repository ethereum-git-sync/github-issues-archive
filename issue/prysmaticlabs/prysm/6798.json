Fetched the latest images (If I understood the 'Build at' line in the screenshot correctly, it can be seen that I really started the latest one). \r\n3. Went through the Medalla docker setup documentation to run the validator and beacon chain\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nIt seems like everything is working except that it is showing the wrong version for both the beacon chain and validator as seen in the screenshot.\r\n\r\nedit: I just checked the image-digest, which is the same as the latest on docker hub. So I am definitely running the latest version\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2020-07-31 at 09 17 15](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22744609/89014480-d6382880-d315-11ea-8018-1f86e70e5846.png)\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Thanks for the report. This is a problem with our CI infrastructure. Here's whats going on.\r\n\r\n1. When a PR merges to master, we immediately build and push docker images for that commit.\r\n1. When we are evaluating a release candidate, we let it soak in a production environment for several days\r\n1. After a release candidate has passed all of our automated and manual testing, then we create a release.\r\n\r\nThe problem here is that the docker image already existed before we tagged v1.0.0-alpha.17. We should consider rebuilding these images whenever we tag a new release so that the version reflects the appropriate git tag.",
