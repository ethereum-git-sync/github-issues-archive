  "body": "# ðŸ’Ž Issue\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\nThe Pyrmont testnet upgraded to the Altair hard-fork this morning, August 19th. However, we had a serious problem caused by code that was not updated inside of `beacon-chain/state/v2` but updated in `beacon-chain/state/v1`. This is due to serious duplication between the packages, increasing the risk of bugs.\r\n\r\n![Image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/665286944078692371/877954788963283004/Screen_Shot_2021-08-19_at_10.38.30_AM.png)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWe should consolidate and deduplicate _as much as humanly possible_ for these state packages, as they are some of the most critical code in the repository and cannot afford issues arising here.",
