As you can see there, all slots are in sequence (and I guess correct timewise). So in the previous testnet it looked ok to me, but not now.\r\n\r\nThe submission of attestations (and proposer blocks) is time critical. So I would say that the log should correctly indicate when an submittal was issued (to the very second and not 12 second later). Only then an analysis can start why attestations (or blocks) 'went missing'.\r\n\r\nBy the same token, if this is correct \"log behaviour\", then attestations are being sent too late.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1450\" alt=\"Screenshot 2020-01-31 at 13 22 00\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28559038/73595368-1e69c000-4518-11ea-9627-1e1cb41dc483.png\">\r\n\r\n",
