With\r\nmultiple geth nodes being run this increases the possibility of such failures happening.\r\n \r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nRun E2E multiple times, this error should show up in one of the runs.\r\n\r\n## üî• Error\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n\r\nendtoend_test.go:296: E2E test ended in error: failed to start the ETH1 miner: P2P log not found, this means the eth1 chain had issues starting: could not find requested text \"Started P2P networking\" in logs:\r\n¬†\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n",
