  "body": "#🐞 Bug Report\r\n\r\n`[2020-11-22 09:02:07] FATAL accounts: Could not import accounts: could not write accounts: file already exists without proper 0600 permissions`\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nIn Windows (with no prior existing wallet at the location), if you accounts import first (which creates the wallet and imports) and then immediately again, it will give the above error.  See:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPS H:\\...\\prysm\\validator> .\\validator.exe accounts import --keys-dir H:\\prysmstuff\\testKeys0 --pyrmont\r\n[2020-11-22 09:06:51]  WARN flags: Running on Pyrmont Testnet\r\nEnter a wallet directory (default: C:\\Users\\dv8si\\AppData\\Roaming\\Eth2Validators\\prysm-wallet-v2):\r\n\r\nPassword requirements: at least 8 characters including at least 1 alphabetical character, 1 number, and 1 unicode special character. Must not be a common password nor easy to guess\r\nNew wallet password:\r\nConfirm password:\r\n[2020-11-22 09:06:57]  INFO accounts: Successfully created new wallet wallet-path=C:\\Users\\dv8si\\AppData\\Roaming\\Eth2Validators\\prysm-wallet-v2\r\nEnter the password for your imported accounts:\r\nImporting accounts, this may take a while...\r\nImporting accounts... 100% [==========================================]  [3s:0s]\r\nSuccessfully imported 5 accounts, view all of them by running accounts list\r\n```\r\n**Immediately re-executed**:\r\n```\r\nPS H:\\...\\prysm\\validator> .\\validator.exe accounts import --keys-dir H:\\prysmstuff\\testKeys0 --pyrmont\r\n[2020-11-22 09:07:05]  WARN flags: Running on Pyrmont Testnet\r\n[2020-11-22 09:07:05]  INFO prompt: (wallet path) C:\\Users\\dv8si\\AppData\\Roaming\\Eth2Validators\\prysm-wallet-v2\r\nWallet password:\r\nEnter the password for your imported accounts:\r\nImporting accounts, this may take a while...\r\nImporting accounts... 100% [==========================================]  [3s:0s]\r\n[2020-11-22 09:07:14] FATAL accounts: Could not import accounts: could not write accounts: file already exists without proper 0600 permissions\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, this seems to be because in shared/fileutil/fileutil.go for WriteFile() ~L63:\r\n```\r\n\tif FileExists(expanded) {\r\n\t\tinfo, err := os.Stat(expanded)\r\n\t\tif err != nil {\r\n\t\t\treturn err\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\tif info.Mode() != params.BeaconIoConfig().ReadWritePermissions {\r\n\t\t\treturn errors.New(\"file already exists without proper 0600 permissions\")\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\treturn ioutil.WriteFile(expanded, data, params.BeaconIoConfig().ReadWritePermissions)\r\n```\r\nHere, the first time, the file won't exist.  It will use ioutil.WriteFile to create the the file and write it.  Unfortunately, it appears that the ReadWritePermissions are ignored.  This may be OS-dependent behavior.  I'm not quite sure where to look on Windows to definitively find the permissions but a simple right click on all-accounts.keystore.json shows it \"Read and execute\" checked.\r\n\r\n### Has this worked before in a previous version?\r\n\r\nI believe it worked before but may have been a while ago.\r\n\r\n## 🌍  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Operating System:**\r\n\r\nWindows 10 (AMD64)\r\n\r\n**What version of Prysm are you running? (Which release)**\r\n\r\nCurrent master 98557e8f5e62c2f716bcfca3b843fb0d2738d78a",
