  "body": "**Description**\r\n\r\nAny papa staker's worse nightmare would be a potential slashing of his baby validator.  As much care as we all put into the safeguarding of our validators, we cannot dismiss the small chance of an honest mistake happening.  An example of that being accidentally running the validator on two machines simultaneously.  A single slashed validator can be a heavy price to pay but manageable.  What if that operator is running multiple validators on the same machine?  What if he is running 10, 20, 50 validators? After a potential slashing event, why should the client continue to stupidly run uninterrupted, leading the remaining baby validators towards a sky high cliff, and a sure death? (slashing)\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nImplement a fail safe mechanism, whereby if the client detects a single slashing, it proceeds to immediately halt the remaining validators from attesting or proposing. This will give time to the papa operator to assess the situation and take the necessary measures to safeguard his remaining children.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nAn alternative would be to offer our condolences to our fellow etherean operator, and move on.  We're not like that though.  99.99% of us are honest operators.  I hope we can all guide and take care of each other.  Implement a fail safe mechanism for post-slashing events so that damage is mitigated.  Sleep well at night knowing that even if you ever do a mistake, not every single one of your validators will be at risk.  It probably won't happen to you, but it will surely happen to others in our community.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time.",
