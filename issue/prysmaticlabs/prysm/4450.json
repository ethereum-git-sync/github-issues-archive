  "body": "Thanks @shayzluf for bringing this up. Currently, our archiver stores information regarding items for the canonical chain, such as committees, participation, etc. but fails to consider archiving information relating to orphaned or a forked chain, which would still be important for the slasher service to listen for. Opening this issue for discussion and for @shayzluf to elaborate more on the problem.\r\n\r\nIt seems like, specifically, we care about archiving committees for orphaned chain branches, is that right?
