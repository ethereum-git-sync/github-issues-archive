  "body": "# üêû Bug Report\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nI am on prysm 4.0.7\r\n\r\nI noticed that after some hours/days, my inbound peers dropped to 0. I checked on canyouseeme.org and found that port 13000 was refused (however, it is open in my firewall). I restarted prysm -- inbound peers began connecting again, and canyouseeme.org revealed 13000 open.\r\n\r\nA few days later, I noticed the same issue with peer count, `inbound=0`. I performed the same steps, and got the exact same result -- after restart, inbound connections improved. IE:\r\n` Peer summary activePeers=55 inbound=30 outbound=25`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Has this worked before in a previous version?\r\n\r\nI am not sure.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nStart prysm beacon node on a known working network setup, and allow it to run for at least 3 days.\r\n\r\n## üî• Error\r\n\r\n`inbound=0`\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Operating System:**\r\n\r\n Ubuntu 22.10\r\n\r\n**What version of Prysm are you running? (Which release)**\r\n4.0.7\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant (validator index / public key)?**\r\nfwiw, this is not impacting my ability to attest at all, the loss of inbound connections is made up by outbound connections. however, if this is a widespread issue, it can hurt overall network stasis\r\n",
