  "body": "# ðŸ’Ž Issue\r\n\r\nWhen https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/11746 is merged, e2e runs will start from bellatrix. We want to make sure that we are testing all fork transitions in the twice-daily scenario tests, and can choose to run e2e from any fork.\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/11746 modifies e2e to start from the bellatrix fork. To keep that PR managable we're leaving out the ability to start from other forks at first, but that needs to be a very temporary situation.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nWe'll add a bazel test param or environment variable to specify the name of the fork to start from. In order for this to work a few things need to be fixed:\r\n- genesis state helper method for other forks\r\n- `blocks.NewGenesisBlockForState` to support other forks\r\n- e2e plumbing to respond to the parameter\r\n- evaluator changes to conditionally run test that apply to different forks (like `altairForkOccurs`)\r\n- beacon node e2e component generating and saving dynamic config files so that we can change parameters that are currently hardcoded in `testnet_e2e_config.go` ",
