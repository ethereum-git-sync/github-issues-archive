  "body": "Hey all,\r\n\r\nCongrats on the Ethereum 2.0 Prysm Demo Release v0.0.0!\r\n\r\nI was wondering if there was interest in paying bounties for finding and creating Github issues for bugs and usability problems. I have previously done a [pilot study on Gitcoin](https://github.com/gitcoinco/web/issues/760) that I think turned out pretty well :)\r\n\r\nIf this seems like a good idea, would love to hash out details in this thread and then fund the program in another thread. Thanks and congrats on the release!",
