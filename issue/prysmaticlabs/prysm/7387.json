However, we do not have this functionality yet. Moreover, users can't even extract the validating private keys from a non-HD wallet today without programmatically decrypting them.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nThis is a feature request to add a command `prysm.sh validator accounts-v2 private-keys` which if a user has an HD wallet:\r\n1. Will ask the user for the wallet password\r\n2. Unlock their keys and use the derivation path to output their validating private keys and withdrawal secret keys to a file of the user's choice\r\n\r\nIf a user has a non-HD wallet:\r\n1. Will ask the user for the wallet password\r\n2. Unlock the keystore file containing their accounts in their wallet and then save the validating private keys and withdrawal keys to a file of the user's choice",
