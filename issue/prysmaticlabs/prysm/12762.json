  "body": "Hello guys. I'm not sure if this problem in prysm or with geth, hope you will say. \r\nSo. Running Geth 1.12.0 and Prysm 4.0.7\r\nAnd this bundle worked perfect before the last week. Tonight was the third time it stucked. \r\n\r\nLogs are in attachments. \r\n[geth log.txt](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/files/12393118/geth.log.txt)\r\n[prysm log.txt](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/files/12393119/prysm.log.txt)\r\n\r\nAll started in prysm at 03:52:36 - **WARN p2p: Attestation is too old to broadcast, discarding it. Current Slot: 7145661 , Attestation Slot: 7145628**\r\n\r\nBut node still worked. Worked for almost an hour, though there was a lot of old attestation warnings. \r\n\r\nThen at 04:45:52 geth started to say **Ignoring already known beacon payload    number=17,959,321 hash=a1fae9..88f259 age=17s**\r\nAnd this is all it sayed for next 3.5 hours. \r\n\r\nAt this time prysm sayed either **WARN initial-sync: Block is not processed error=could not notify the engine of the new payload: timeout from http.Client: received an undefined execution engine error** or **WARN initial-sync: Range is not processed error=Range had no valid blocks to process**\r\n\r\nWithin this time there was a lot of peers connected. \r\n\r\nMy setup: \r\nAMD Ryzen 5 5600G\r\n32 GB RAM\r\nWindows 10 x64\r\n",
