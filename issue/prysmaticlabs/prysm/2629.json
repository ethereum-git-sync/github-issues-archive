  "body": "To fix #2616, Here is one proposal on how we can aggregate attestation.\r\n\r\n1. Attester wait until middle of the slot to send attestation to beacon node so any blocks from this slot have time to reach the beacon node. Duration is from `0` to `SecondsPerSlot / 2`\r\n\r\n2. Beacon node gathers and aggregates attestations. Duration is from `SecondsPerSlot / 2` to `SecondsPerSlot`\r\n\r\n3. Beacon node broadcasts packaged attestations every `SecondsPerSlot`\r\n\r\nWith this approach, we'll update the following:\r\n- beacon node needs a ticker to know when the end of the slot is\r\n- beacon node needs to store attestation in memory and track when an attestation can be aggregated (e.g. same slot, same head root...etc) if aggregation is possible, it simply discards the duplicated the attestation and flip the existing attestation's bitfield to 1 based on the attester index\r\n- beacon node RPC server only broadcasts attestations once every slot",
