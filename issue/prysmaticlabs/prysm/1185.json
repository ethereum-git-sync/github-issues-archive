  "body": "Hi all, \r\n\r\nThis is part of #294 and similar to #718. In this case, we want a PR that successfully advances a beacon state from genesis for `N` slots given a genesis validator set and a demo configuration. This would allow us to have high confidence in our runtime if state transitions can execute flawlessly from a YAML test. A follow-up PR can implement better debugging tools and perhaps a dump of the state at each transition to disk to visualize what occurred during the simulation.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, these tests will then become part of our CI suite so we can be confident our core beacon chain works without needing to do trial and error through build and run workflows.",
