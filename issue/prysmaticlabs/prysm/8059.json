  "body": "# üêû Bug Report\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI have a prysm beacon node setup which I run over a vpn with port forwarding on a residential internet connection. The ISP disconnects every 24h and issues a new IP.\r\nWhen the disconnect happens, obv Prysm loses all the peers. The vpn connection is reestablished. Prysm seems to reconnect to peers (75) and also has peers for all subnets etc (see logPeers). However, prysm shows no block syncing / processing activity afterwards - no log msgs on info lvl at all. I have to restart the beacon node because it cant recover.\r\n\r\nThere is only one error msg see below. Please see logs for further log msgs. Please note that the disconnection happens at around 02:47:52 and the vpn connection is re-established at around 02:48:48. And after that prysms starts to reconnect to peers.\r\n\r\nSide note: Geth is reconnecting fine and stays synced.\r\n\r\n### Has this worked before in a previous version?\r\n\r\nIt worked fine on the testnets without the vpn. It was fine the first two days with same version with vpn. But it seems that the problem doesn't occur every time there is an internet disconnection /vpn reconnection. So not sure what to deduct from that.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n24h dis-/reconnect or manually dis/-reconnecting my modem or manually dis/-reconnecting for my device from the internet.\r\n\r\n## üî• Error\r\n\r\nThe only log msg on lvl error is\r\n<pre><code>\r\n level=error msg=\"Failed to find peers\" error=\"failed to find peers for subnet\" prefix=p2p\r\n<!-- ‚úçÔ∏è-->\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Operating System:**\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n  <code>\r\nUbuntu 20\r\n  </code>\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n**What version of Prysm are you running? (Which release)**\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n  <code>\r\nbeacon-chain version Prysm/v1.0.2/b150acffca3d93e8cf1f404ff7e4602391017186.\r\n  </code>\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n[logdebug.txt](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/files/5650163/logdebug.txt)\r\n[logPeers.txt](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/files/5650164/logPeers.txt)\r\n\r\n",
