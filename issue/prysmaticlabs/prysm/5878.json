    "body": "Same Issue. 51 Validators and a BC on a Raspberry Pi 4 (4Gb RAM) with Ubuntu 20.04 and an SSD.\r\n\r\nValidators vote appropriately, and the Pi doesn't struggle, mem usage and load are both nominal.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the slasher starts up, it appears to crowd the RPC connection so that Validators can't submit attestations. Nothing but repeating \"level=error msg=\"Could not submit attestation to beacon node\" error=\"rpc error: code = DeadlineExceeded desc = context deadline exceeded\" prefix=validator\" as soon as the slasher is running.\r\n\r\nRunning the slasher with historical detection disabled. Starting the slasher will \"take down\" all the validators as described. Stopping the slasher will instantly resume normal validator operation. It does not appear to be a CPU/Memory issue, as load and memory usage do increase but not to OOM-threatening levels. \r\n\r\nI have Grafana and can restart my slasher to catch the exact metrics before the validators \"die off\" if it helps, but that won't highlight any potential RPC issues to my knowledge.\r\n\r\nBC/Validator/Slasher: alpha.8\r\n",

For real-time detection there are no issues but for historical detection where the slasher is just demanding so much computation from the beacon node constantly, I start seeing that context deadline issue.\n\nI think the slasher might be too fast now lol, it finishes an epochs worth of attestation processing quickly and immediately asks for more. Beacon node might be getting genuinely overwhelmed.\n\nWhat is there that can be done to handle this? @prestonvanloon ",

    "body": "After thorough investigation of what could be going wrong, I believe this issue has been solved by a few changes:\r\n* #5958 no longer starts historical detection (the choking process) on startup, it isn't as important as realtime detection anyways. Better to make realtime detection easier to run.\r\n* #5971 changes `StreamIndexedAttestation` to use the target root to grab that state, which means there is nearly 0 state regen for realtime detection. This should be clearing most of the problem.\r\n* #5999 changes `StreamIndexedAttestation` to process the attestations it has received 2/3rds into a slot. This prevents the heavy computation from interfering with role assignments to validators.\r\n\r\nThis issue still exists for historical detection, but I consider this non-essential for users wishing to run a slasher.
