  "body": "# üêû Bug Report\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nA tag for v4.0.0 was prematurely created for the release candidate 0 (v4.0.0-rc.0) and this was indexed by golang's checksum server and proxy. The tag for v4.0.0 was deleted and retagged later when the appropriate release candidate was promoted for release. As such, users are finding a checksum mismatch as the current v4.0.0 does not match that checksum that was previously issued.\r\n\r\nThe resolution for this is to create a new release from the same commit, v4.0.1 and allow golang to index that as the latest release.\r\n\r\n### Has this worked before in a previous version?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nUse go get to fetch Prysm at v4.0.0\r\n\r\n## üî• Error\r\n\r\n<pre><code>    github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/v4/consensus-types/primitives: github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/v4@v4.0.0: verifying module: checksum mismatch\r\n    downloaded: h1:BMMhPSzfYXQLxiweJY+hJEbmY/MI8ZShEbTz3omV3aY=\r\n    sum.golang.org: h1:c7qkGB+iwiWRN00/29wQk37sG+XtsKjy0AGfpGHhaa4=\r\n\r\nSECURITY ERROR\r\nThis download does NOT match the one reported by the checksum server.\r\nThe bits may have been replaced on the origin server, or an attacker may\r\nhave intercepted the download attempt.\r\n\r\nFor more information, see 'go help module-auth'.\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Operating System:**\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n  <code>All</code>\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n**What version of Prysm are you running?
