    "body": "The strategy we use for catching double and surround votes is referred to as [min-max spans](https://github.com/protolambda/eth2-surround#min-max-surround). This strategy involves maintaining every validators information on a per-epoch basis for the full validator set.\r\n\r\nSay we receive an aggregated attestation of 16 validators, spanning from source epoch 2 to target epoch 8. We update the min max spans representing epoch 0 to epoch 8 for each of those 16 validators. Currently, we chunk up the min max spans for the full validator set into per-epoch buckets, so if we want to change epoch 3, we need to load that epoch into the cache to perform an update on it.\r\n\r\nEvery attestation we receive needs to have its min spans updated which means updating the spans from the source epoch, all the way to 0. This is troublesome to handle for validators that haven't attested until epoch 10,000, because it means we need to update the min spans from epoch 0, all the way to epoch 10,000. Processing such an attestation would normally load all of the existing validator history into memory for 10,000 epochs.\r\n\r\nThis wouldn't be a huge problem to do once, but we would need to do it for every new validator index received in the network. \r\n\r\n\r\nOur current workaround is to only \"lookback\" 128 epochs. Say we get an attestation for epoch 1000, we only update the spans to epoch 872, instead of epoch 0. This allows us to keep the full 128 epochs of lookback in a cache to prevent unneeded database checks and edited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo the goal of this issue is to find a solution that will allow us to properly handle attestations with min man spans that are larger than the lookback distance of 128 epochs.",
