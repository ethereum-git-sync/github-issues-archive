  "body": "# ðŸ’Ž Issue\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\nIn #9442 , we added in the ability to re-insert oprhaned attestations back into the pool. However the change misses some \r\nedge cases.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n```\r\n100 ->  102 -> 103 (Fork A) \r\n  \\ -> 101 -> 104 (Fork B)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you shift from fork A to fork B, all the attestations at slot 102 get thrown away and are not included in the pool. Only 103 gets re-inserted. While deeper re-orgs are unlikely in mainnet, for correctness purposes we should be reinserting the whole orphaned branch rather than just the previous head block.",
