  "body": "# ðŸš€ Feature Request\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIn the backfill process the majority of time is spent downloading blocks - block downloads can take multiple seconds, in comparison to signature verification which usually completes well under 100ms. Currently we verifying signatures in the same worker process that downloads blocks. The issue here is that when many workers are used, we could be computing for cpu time with other cpu intensive tasks, which could be particularly problematic if a node is selected to propose during backfill. Isolating all backfill signature verification to a single goroutine would likely have no impact on the throughput of backfill, while isolating the cpu intensive task to a single core at a time.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nChange the backfill.verifier type to spawn an accessory goroutine that reads from a channel of batch verification requests and writes back responses. Add a functional facade method in front of those channels to the verifier so that workers can call the verification method like a normal func. That func will assemble the `VerifiedROBlocks` in the same goroutine as the caller, but then pass a slice with all the pieces of data needed to verify signatures to the accessory goroutine to do all the cpu-intensive work.\r\n",
