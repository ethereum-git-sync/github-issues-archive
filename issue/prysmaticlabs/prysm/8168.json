    "body": "@d00medman From what I understand, @Dimasin wants to provide hex data as grafitti rather than a UTF-8 string. So instead of providing the validator \r\n\r\n```\r\n--graffiti=🐠Welcome to the New Beginning\r\n```\r\nwe can instead use \r\n\r\n```\r\n--graffiti=0xf09f90a057656c636f6d6520746f20746865204e657720426567696e6e696e67\r\n```\r\nThen the validator will internally convert the hex data to a utf-8 compatible string and add that to any future proposed blocks.",
