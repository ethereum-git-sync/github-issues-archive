    "body": "Hi @PengFei-eth this one is a bit hard to debug given there can be many reasons this happens (maybe your beacon node disconnected while a validator API call was in-flight, for example). I imagine there was something bottlenecking your node at the time that prevented the call from completing quickly. Unfortunately, we don't have enough info to reliably reproduce this. I imagine your node was likely CPU bottlenecked at the time. Given we don't have any actionable steps for this issue, we'll close. If it persists or shows up a lot more please let us know.",
