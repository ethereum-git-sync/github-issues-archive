  "body": "# üêû Bug Report\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nHello Prysm team, my node is missing sync committee duties a lot. \r\nThe problem has persisted for quite some time. The general issue is:\r\n\r\nAttestations and proposals are good.\r\nThe sync committee duties are good for the first several hours and then it will begin to struggle with lots of misses & penalties. \r\nDuring the struggle the peer count and logs are fine.\r\nThe problem will be solved once I restart Prysm client. \r\nBut restarting during sync committee also hurts.\r\n\r\nThis happens every time when my validators enter the sync committee.\r\n\r\nI have found reports by others with same problem:\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ethstaker/comments/113s1so/every_sync_committee_i_have_to_reboot_prysm_to/\r\nhttps://discord.com/channels/694822223575384095/782670371735732274/937392575294349355\r\n\r\n### Has this worked before in a previous version?\r\nThe problem has lasted for quite long time (at least the recent 3-4 Prysm versions). \r\nI thought it was network issue until I found restarting will almost always help.\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Operating System:**\r\nWindows 11\r\n\r\n**What version of Prysm are you running? (Which release)**\r\n4.0.3\r\n\r\n**Hardware Info:**\r\nIntel NUC latest gen i5-1240p 64GB RAM\r\n4TB SSD dedicated for prysm and 8TB SSD for Geth\r\n",

We have never seen this issue in our testing, so I am not sure if the node is actually stressed or there is some other issue at play here. Debug logs + a profile would help us investigate this further. You could try to keep your system's clock synced and see if that helps when you start running into this issue as an out of sync clock is the only thing that would explain what you have observed. ",

It seems that the gathering of data will be stopped after a short while, like ~30 seconds. \r\n\r\nTherefore it is unlikely to get the info around the right moment when the situation deteriorates. Only the profiles before and after, once I found the problem emerged. (Or maybe that's already enough?)\r\n\r\nThe Prysm node's OS is Windows, and curl is ported from linux (some functions may not be exact the same). \r\n\r\nThanks!",
