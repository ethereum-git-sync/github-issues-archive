    "body": "@ShawkiS The problem here is that the user has 5 validator keys. Only 2 of these are active. The feature request is to only log \"previous epoch voting summary\" for activated validators as this log is not helpful for pending ones. A pending validator had no duties in the last epoch and there is really nothing to report on their performance.\r\n\r\nGenerally, we want to only print this message when this condition is true\r\n```go\r\n\tif validator.Status == ethpb.ValidatorStatus_ACTIVE || validator.Status == ethpb.ValidatorStatus_EXITING {\r\n```\r\nSee #5397 for an example how duties logs were cleaned up, maybe you could do a similar clean up for this request. \r\n\r\nAssigning to @ShawkiS, let me know if don't want to work on this and I'll unassign. Thanks!",
