I couldn't find any flag to limit the ram usage. Is there any?\r\n\r\nCan prysm not run on a 16gb machine anymore?\r\n\r\nthanks \r\n\r\n### Has this worked before in a previous version?\r\n\r\nIt was OOming maybe once a month or so before. Now basically every day or multiple times a day.\r\n\r\n### ðŸ”¬ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Error\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Platform(s)\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### What version of Prysm are you running?
