Switch to v3.1.2 and it just says `INFO initial-sync: Waiting for enough suitable peers before syncing required=3 suitable=0` forever.\r\n\r\nIt is perfectly reproducible by switching between these two releases.  Immediate peers with v3.1.1, but never gets peers with v3.1.2.\r\n\r\nIf it is relevant, when 3.1.2 is searching for peers, I can only shutdown by forcing a panic with 10 interrupts.",
