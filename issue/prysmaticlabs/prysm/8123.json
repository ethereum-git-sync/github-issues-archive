  "body": "# ðŸš€ Feature Request\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nImprove the validator UX for Windows users who are not particularly tech savvy.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\n1. Downloadable installer.\r\n2. Installs Beacon client as a system service.\r\n3. Installs Validator client as a system service.\r\n4. Adds system tray icon for monitoring their status.\r\n5. Clicking on the system tray icon brings up a UI (could be electron app, or browser app).\r\n6. Web UI allows me to fully configure/manage the services, including choosing what chain they are connected to, what accounts they are using, etc.\r\n7. Most importantly, don't require users to open a command prompt or edit a config file by hand.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nThere is a spectrum between hostile to non-developers and incredibly approachable to everyone.  Right now, the CLI tooling is very close to the \"non-developer hostile\" end of the spectrum as you have to use CLI tools with certain flags that are buried in docs in order to run/manage a beacon client/validator.  The above suggested setup would bring us a long way toward \"approachable\" and I don't think comes with any *major* hurdles.\r\n\r\nHowever, some steps could be taken that get part way there such as making it so everything can be configured from a UI but without the installer and system services as an intermediate step, or perhaps installer and system services with config file editing by hand.",
