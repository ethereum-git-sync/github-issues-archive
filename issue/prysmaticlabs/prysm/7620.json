  "body": "# ðŸ’Ž Issue\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\nAs of #7593, load blocks simply returns nothing in the event it processes and invalid range. The reason we do not return an error yet is because a lot of tests using `stategen` would break as then all states and blocks used in the relevant tests would have to be fully valid ( able to transition state). This would prevent us from being able to test out various test scenarios easily as testing any of them would require a very complext test setup.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nTo resolve this, we should return an error in the event there is an invalid range and mock out our stategen package in tests. Mocking out the stategen package would require defining it in terms of an interface rather than  a struct as it is now.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
