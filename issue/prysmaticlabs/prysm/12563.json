  "body": "# üêû Bug Report\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nI'm currently working with Beacon API stuff and use prysm nodes for accessing corresponding endpoints. I'm encountering an error. \r\n\r\nThe flow of handling the blocks from Beacon API looks like this:\r\n- We subscribe to block event\r\n- We receive an event\r\n- We request the block of hash that we received inside the event\r\n\r\nI'm subscribing to block events by using the endpoint: `http://%s/eth/v1/events?topics=block`.\r\nAnd when I receive the block event I'm trying to fetch it using the `http://%s/eth/v2/beacon/blocks/%s` route.\r\nBut in the case of the Prysm client, the response of this route is undefined, sometimes it's okay, and sometimes it returns\r\n`code:404 message:Could not find requested block: signed beacon block can't be nil`.\r\nAnd if I made this request in a few seconds, the block will be accessible.\r\n\r\n## Expected result\r\nThe flow should be deterministic. And if the node sends the event about the block, it should be accessible by another endpoint without any delays.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n1. Subscribe to `http://%s/eth/v1/events?topics=block`\r\n2. Request block from `http://%s/eth/v2/beacon/blocks/%s`\r\n3. The result is not always the block\r\n\r\nNote: I use the `Accept: application/octet-stream` header to request the block.\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**What version of Prysm are you running? (Which release)**\r\n{\r\n  \"data\": {\r\n    \"version\": \"prysm/v4.0.0-boost0.2.0 (linux amd64)\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n",
