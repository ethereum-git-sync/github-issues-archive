  "body": "Hi all,\r\n\r\nA recent change to accept proto.Message instead of generic `interface{}` for p2p messages over topics led to some breaking issues at runtime.\r\n\r\n### What Went Wrong and How to Reproduce?\r\n\r\nIf we run the beacon-chain on the master branch with a simulator flag on, we get unknown topics. We can address this issue by making sure every `.Send(), .Broadcast()` call in the beacon chain project uses pointers of protos: `p2p.Broadcast(&pb.SomeProto{})`. We also have to update the topic mappings in `node/` package to use pointers instead of values in the mapping.\r\n\r\nOnce we do this, we get this following new issue:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n[2018-09-02 17:10:45] DEBUG simulator: Announcing block hash announcedBlockHash=0x53b6738547051e47c9f35d9ece4bd278080aa4c66e003c4f3d8ef74c22b1fa00\r\n[2018-09-02 17:10:45] DEBUG p2p: Broadcasting msg hash:\"S\\266s\\205G\\005\\036G\\311\\363]\\236\\316K\\322x\\010\\n\\244\\306n\\000<O=\\216\\367L\\\"\\261\\372\\000\"  topic=BEACON_BLOCK_HASH_ANNOUNCE\r\n[2018-09-02 17:10:45] ERROR p2p: Received message is not a protobuf message\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "I have identified the issue with reflect types. Since proto.Message is a pointer to the underlying struct, i.e. `*pb.BeaconBlockAnnounce`, and reflect.New creates a new pointer to the given type, we ended up with `**pb.BeaconBlockAnnounce` which ended up resolving to a nil ptr. \r\n\r\nI have the fix ready, I'm just trying to resolve new test breakages with libp2p.
