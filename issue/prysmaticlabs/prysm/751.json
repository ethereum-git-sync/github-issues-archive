  "body": "Update ValidatorRegistration contract as per the latest spec\r\n\r\nThe initial deployment phases of Ethereum 2.0 are implemented without consensus changes to the PoW chain. A registration contract is added to the PoW chain to deposit ETH. This contract has a registration function which takes as arguments pubkey, withdrawal_shard, withdrawal_address, randao_commitment as defined in a ValidatorRecord below. A BLS proof_of_possession of types bytes is given as a final argument.\r\n\r\nThe registration contract emits a log with the various arguments for consumption by the beacon chain. It does not do validation, pushing the registration logic to the beacon chain. In particular, the proof of possession (based on the BLS12-381 curve) is not verified by the registration contract.\r\n\r\nA PR that would resolve this issue would be to update the current Validator Registration Contract by adding in a proof of possesion parameter to the deposit function.\r\n\r\n",
