    "body": "@rauljordan The v1.4.1 release states\r\n\r\n> Prysm slasher binary deprecation\r\nWe have been communicating that the slasher is going to be deprecated in the v1.4 release. This effort has been pushed back while we work on various storage optimizations in parallel to Altair development. Expect the Prysm slasher binary will be deprecated and removed in the upcoming Prysm v2 release with Altair support. Follow the v2 tracking issue for more info #9166.\r\n\r\nAs v1.4.1 has not deprecated slasher, there's a `gcr.io` Docker image for slasher too.\r\n\r\nThe v1.4.2 release just states the following:\r\n\r\n> Small fix on top of v1.4.1. Please review the v1.4.1 release notes if upgrading from v1.3.x or older.\r\n\r\nHowever there's no v1.4.2 slasher Docker image.\r\n\r\nWhich contradicts your statement\r\n\r\n> [...] the current slasher is deprecated and will no longer have docker images nor binaries released\r\n\r\nEDIT: I'm also concerned with this approach -- even if deprecated -- isn't the purpose of deprecation to give users a transition window during which they can migrate? IMHO, deprecation means \"supported in current release, but not in upcoming\". Supporting a piece of software extends to release binaries also.\r\n\r\nAs of now, the v1.3.x slasher configuration (which is not deprecated according to release notes) is broken on v1.4.1 and v1.4.2:\r\n* On v1.4.1, subcommands don't work, making the release pretty much unusable. The slasher Docker image is present though.\r\n* On v1.4.2, the slasher Docker image is missing (the binary is present)",
