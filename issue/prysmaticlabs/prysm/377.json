    "body": "> I think @fgimenez is working on fixing the remaining conditions.\r\n\r\nNot really, currently there's only one remaining data race in `shared/p2p`, but we can't fix it because it is caused by a third-party library, see https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/390#issuecomment-412415378.\r\n\r\nWe had some issues recently regarding tests that fail on travis with the race detector enabled, but these seem to be related to travis execution environment (the failure is not from the race detector and they don't fail locally). \r\n\r\nI'm starting looking into #282, hopefully with a remote bazel worker we can have more data to determine if the current problem is actually related to travis. I'll keep you posted.",
