  "body": "Hi all,\r\n\r\nThis issue will explore all of the latest talk around what Merkle tree scheme we will follow as part of our sharding implementation. As #100 is being worked on, it is important to discuss the state trie design as it is beyond the scope of that PR. Sharding gives us a unique opportunity to optimize Ethereum's state tries in ways that were not possible before.\r\n\r\nIn its current form, Ethereum's trie has two layers. That is, there is a global accounts trie where each account has a corresponding storage trie. In a system with a sharded state, the inefficiencies behind this current scheme become immediately apparent as cross-shard transactions would have too many dependencies.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the data availability problem becomes a major concern when exploring stateless client mechanisms in a sharded environment. We want our trees to have built-in mechanisms for fraud proofs and data validity checks that are efficient.\r\n\r\nFinally, we want to be storage-efficient with our trie implementation. We maintain that storing the trie representation should have as little footprint on sharding clients.\r\n\r\n## Storage Efficiency\r\n\r\nTo increase storage efficiency and create a single-layer trie instead of the current two-layers (accounts trie and storage trie for each account), a solid approach would be to use a Binary Tree as [proposed by Dfinity](https://github.com/dfinity/js-dfinity-radix-tree/blob/master/benchmark/results.md), as it creates much smaller proofs.\r\n\r\nThe context of this approach was first explored in this: [A Two Layer Account Trie Inside a Single Layer Trie](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-two-layer-account-trie-inside-a-single-layer-trie/210/2\r\n) on ETHResearch.\r\n\r\n[Vitalik's implementation in Python](https://github.com/dfinity/js-dfinity-radix-tree/blob/master/benchmark/results.md)\r\n\r\n##  Data Availability\r\n\r\nSee: [Data-Availability Friendly Tries](https://ethresear.ch/t/data-availability-proof-friendly-state-tree-transitions/1453) and [Detailed Analysis of Stateless Client Witness Size](https://ethresear.ch/t/detailed-analysis-of-stateless-client-witness-size-and-gains-from-batching-and-multi-state-roots/862).\r\n\r\nAnother possible approach to a modified Merkle tree that is friendly towards data availability proofs is a Sparse Merkle Tree construction. This approach would save what we call \"intermediate state roots\". This means that \"a full node can now easily generate efficient fraud proofs for invalid state roots, because they only have to prove that one intermediate root is invalid for the whole block to be invalid.\" (ETHResearch Post) and would give the system massive efficiency gains.\r\n\r\nAnother approach is to use Reed-Solomon reparation schemes as our tree implementation, but this is a bit fuzzier and not talked about as much. It was proposed in the following ETHResearch [post](https://ethresear.ch/t/rsmt2d-go-implementation-of-two-dimensional-reed-solomon-merkle-tree-data-availability-scheme/1738)\r\n\r\n## Potential Pull Request\r\n\r\nA potential PR could be to just start with a binary tree similar to what Vitalik was creating in the Python implementation and test out some basic benchmarks in Go. As this issue is fleshed out more, we can discuss what other scheme we can follow next, including sparse Merkle trees.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know your thoughts, team.",

    "body": "### Data availability\r\nThe Reed-Solomon approach seems more complex in term of algorithm and structure that having something close to a flat layout (nonce, balance, code, storage) in a simple tree (where hash can then easily be used for adressing).\r\n\r\n### Proof footprint\r\nI also liked the idea of having smaller proof/receipt/simple-walk-along-**one**-tree in a environment where we are highly restricted by gas cost and gas usage, that may allow some extra functionalities in account abstraction possibilities.\r\n\r\n### Implementation issues\r\nOn the implementation sides of things, I think we should be more litterate on what kind of mecanism there is already in Geth and what that would that imply in term of how would be handled account in Geth (for example for hardware wallets, caching, storage, etc) with that new mindset.",

This would work well for a system such as sharding where we assume very little computational requirements or storage capacity of nodes.",

    "body": "Just wanted to note that the Reed-Solomon encoded tree and the sparse merkle tree serve two different purposes, so they are not mutually exclusive.\r\n\r\nThe Reed-Solomon encoded tree is for representing the transaction data in each block (the \"transactions merkle root\"), in such a way that allows for data availability guarantees (i.e. that the transaction data is actually available), as opposed to using a standard merkle tree.\r\n\r\nSparse merkle trees are for representing the state of the entire blockchain (the \"state merkle root\"); having intermediate state roots reduces the cost of generating fraud proofs for incorrectly generated state roots. This still requires a data availability scheme to store these intermediate roots (unless light clients actually download them), such as the Reed-Solomon scheme, thus they are not mutually exclusive. I call this \"data availability proof friendly\" because you don't need to ensure availability of the entire state tree anymore, which would be insanely expensive to do per block (i.e. you don't want to apply Reed-Solomon encoding on the entire state!).\r\n\r\ntl;dr: you don't want to be using the Reed-Solomon scheme for the state merkle root; just probably for the transaction merkle root.",
