It can be misused as follows:\r\n`SecretKeyFromBigNum(\"1\")` will produce a BLS private key consisting of 31 zero bytes.\r\n\r\nThe description of the function `SecretKeyFromBigNum takes in a big number string and creates a BLS private key` doesn't say anything related to 0-bytes padding.\r\n\r\nAt the present time the function is not used within the codebase but as I have said above it is available outside the project.\r\n",

You may for example reject the degenerate cases (0 and 1), and perhaps reject ridiculously short strings as it's statistically unlikely to hit (say) at 4 byte value if picking a random secret key, whatever its encoding.",

Given that this is publicly accessible, it would be better to more strictly validate this, I will proceed to remove the padding and instead just build the secret key from the provided string directly without any additional padding.
