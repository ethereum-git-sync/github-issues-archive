Current flag `--peer` could not guarantee a long-term satble connection between a pair of nodes. It is very difficult to have a long connection between two trusted nodes. we hope prysm provide a method that allow two nodes  connect to each other and both should not consider the other as bad peer or disconnect it by p2p gossip network. \r\n\r\n2. The trusted peers and peers are able to being  dynamic added after the beacon started. Since after beacon start we could not use `--peer` to add more peers.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️ A clear and concise description of the problem or missing capability... --> \r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\n1. could have a flag called `--trusted-peer`, a trusted node should not be consided as a bad peer by IpTracker or any scorers, and should not be disconnected by the gossip network. \r\n\r\n2. have some relevant apis Add, Delete, Query, and Modify;  maybe for beacon rpc, like /3500/addTrustedPeers/enr or for metrics, like /8080/addTrustedPeers/enr .\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️ If you have a solution in mind, please describe it. --> \r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nCurrently, we use `--peer` and once we find the connection is broken, we restarted both beacon chains.  This is very inconvenient. This sepcific connection is likely to broken because of `too many peers` or badresponse scorer. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
