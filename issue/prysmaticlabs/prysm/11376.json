Or maybe even just skip loading checkpoint-sync configured state if db is populated with any state?\n\n\n### Background\n\n(Nice-to-have) in prod environments if there was some issue that required db wipe/new volume, teams could recover by falling back on checkpoint-sync without having to update prysm arguments.  This could also pair nicely with #10410 for teams that don't want to rely on an external api\n\n### Description\n",
