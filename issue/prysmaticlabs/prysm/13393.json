  "body": "### Describe the bug\n\nMy validator machine(Windows, on Mainnet, running Geth) was recently rebooted.  I tried to run Prysm.bat from the command line, and it detected and updated to v4.1.1.  When I run it though, I get this error:\r\n\r\n‚ÄúThe system cannot find the file specified‚Äù\r\n\r\nfollowed by\r\n\r\n‚Äú( was unexpected at this time‚Äù\r\n\r\nIt looks like an issue parsing the bat.  How can I get further details on what file it‚Äôs looking for, and what is causing it to fail?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\n\n### Has this worked before in a previous version?\n\n```text\nYes.  I‚Äôm honestly not sure what the last version was, but I restarted my beacon node right around Thanksgiving, and it updated Prysm then.  I tried downgrading to 4.1.0, but I get some ‚Äúinput string too long‚Äù when I do that.\n```\n\n\n### üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\n\nPrysm.bat beacon-chain ‚Äîdatadir G:\\GethChain ‚Äîexecution-endpoint=http://localhost:8600 ‚Äîjwt-secret=G:\\jwt.hex ‚Äîsuggested-fee-recipient=(mywalletaddress)\n\n### Error\n\n```text\nSee above.\n```\n\n\n### Platform(s)\n\nWindows (x86)\n\n### What version of Prysm are you running? (Which release)\n\n4.1.1\n\n### Anything else relevant (validator index / public key)?\n\n_No response_",
