Currently, either is supported by `--p2p-local-ip ::` or `--p2p-local-ip 0.0.0.0`. As users will need both v4 and v6 peering, being able to specify `--p2p-local-ip` twice, once for each address family, would be helpful. Defaulting to dual-stack would be gravy.\r\n\r\n**Context**\r\n\r\nP2P support is the driver, here. Metrics, REST, key manager, all can stay v4, at least initially. If it's trivial to make them dual-stack as well, by all means do, but for the bulk of users where this is an issue - home users with CGNAT - they'll have v4 available and they won't need to reach REST via v6 from \"the Internet\"\r\n\r\n### Tasks\r\n\r\n- [ ] Feature flag created as opt-in\r\n- [ ] Feature implemented / code complete\r\n- [ ] Feature tested in production for adequate amount of time\r\n- [ ] Feature flag is inverted to be opt-out and the opt-in flag is deprecated\r\n- [ ] Feature has made it to a tagged production release as an opt-out flag\r\n- [ ] Opt-out feature flag is deprecated and old code paths are cleaned up\r\n\r\nThis issue should be closed after all of the above tasks are complete.\r\n",
