  "body": "### Describe the bug\n\nAccording to the spec, the _safe_ block hash sent in fcU should be set to the block hash of the justified block: https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/fork_choice/safe-block.md#get_safe_beacon_block_root\r\n\r\nPrysm uses the _unrealized_ justified block: https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/45a2746d0ea46e8d32c657777a1ad468ba46b437/beacon-chain/blockchain/execution_engine.go#L68-L74\r\n\r\nI noticed this while working on Eleel's fcU matching algorithm and didn't think anything of it, but @parithosh and @barnabasbusa recently raised this as a potential client interop issue. In some sense it would be nice to be able to poll a collection of nodes and get a consistent answer as to what the safe head is.\r\n\r\nPersonally I think Prysm's behaviour is actually better than the spec's, because it gives a more recent view of justification that is almost-as-good. I'm opening this issue to track it on Prysm's side, but if you would prefer we change the spec I would be supportive. Changing the definition of \"safe\" may interact with confirmation rule work (https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/3339), but I get the feeling that most clients aren't close to having that implemented, and that PR doesn't currently change the definition of _safe_ used by fcU anyway.\n\n### Has this worked before in a previous version?\n\n```text\nPrior to the introduction of unrealized justification.\n```\n\n\n### ðŸ”¬ Minimal Reproduction\n\nRun Prysm and observe fcU compared to another client (e.g. Lighthouse).\n\n### Error\n\n_No response_\n\n### Platform(s)\n\nLinux (x86), Linux (ARM)\n\n### What version of Prysm are you running? (Which release)\n\nv4.4.1\n\n### Anything else relevant (validator index / public key)?\n\n_No response_",
