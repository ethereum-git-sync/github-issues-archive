  "body": "The problem areas are:\r\n\r\n1. **Broken Tests**: The current method of constructing blocks seems to be failing when slots are processed.\r\n2. **Incomplete Block Links**: The blocks are not linked in a way that would make them complete, contributing to the test failures.\r\n3. **Unverified Behavior**: Tests mention specific behavior like engine timeout and optimistic status but don't actually verify these.\r\n\r\n### Solutions:\r\n\r\n1. **Use Deterministic Genesis State**: As mentioned, one way to circumvent this problem is to use a deterministic genesis state for constructing blocks. This approach could yield more reliable test results and could eliminate issues tied to block linkages.\r\n  \r\n    ```python\r\n    st, keys = util.DeterministicGenesisState(t, 64)\r\n    b0, err = util.GenerateFullBlock(st, keys, util.DefaultBlockGenConfig(), 0)\r\n    ...\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n2. **Comprehensive Testing**: To make sure that specific behaviors like engine timeout and optimistic status are tested, write additional test cases that explicitly verify these behaviors.",
