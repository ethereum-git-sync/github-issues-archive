  "body": "# ðŸ’Ž Issue\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\n`Store.HighestSlotBlocksBelow` incrementally scans the block slot index, starting at the lowest slot and moving upward until it finds the last slot below the requested upper bound[1]. As the beacon chain grows, prysm will need to scan up to higher slot numbers, increasing latency and database contention, and decreasing page cache effectiveness. \r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/develop/beacon-chain/db/kv/blocks.go#L411\r\n\r\n### Description \r\nIt is possible to instead seek to the minimum value at or above the upper bound, and then step backwards to the next-highest key. This approach would prevent performance from degrading as described.",
