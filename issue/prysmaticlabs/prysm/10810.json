Currently, we do not have granular warnings for the users when they select either an unreasonably low number or an unreasonably high number for the gas limit. Typically this is caused by a typo and should warn the user. Blocks can not be instantly set to the number selected but the network will over time trend towards a number that is higher or lower. The default is set to 30M wei.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nNew logs should be added to the piece of code that unmarshals and reads the inital gas limit from config and provide warning logs when the user selects a number that is too high or too low. Details and suggestions were provided in this [issue thread](https://github.com/ethereum/builder-specs/issues/17)",
