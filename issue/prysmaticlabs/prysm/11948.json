  "body": "# üêû Bug Report\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIf validator client `POST /eth/v1/validator/{pubkey}/gas_limit` is called with a `{pubkey}` without any fee recipient registered in validator client configuration, then `{pubkey}` fee recipient is set to `0x00000....`, and any tip earned by a block proposal for this validator will be burned (even if a default fee recipient is set in the beacon node).\r\n\r\nI suspect it is not the expected behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n1. Run a beacon node with `suggested-fee-recipient`\r\n2. Run a validator client with a given pubkey, (with or without a `default_config` fee recipient, but **without** a `proposer_config` fee recipient for the given `{pubkey}`)\r\n3. At the beginning of the next epoch, no `PrepareBeaconProposer` function will be called for this pubkey ==> At the next block proposal for this pubkey, the used fee recipient will be the default one provided by the beacon node.\r\n4. Call `POST /eth/v1/validator/{pubkey}/gas_limit` for this pubkey.\r\n5. At the beginning of the next epoch,`PrepareBeaconProposer` function will be called for this pubkey, but with `0x0000.....` as fee recipient. ==> At the next block proposal for this pubkey, tips will be burned.\r\n\r\n## üî• Error\r\n[here](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/develop/validator/rpc/standard_api.go#L460) and [here](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/develop/validator/rpc/standard_api.go#L467), we have this snippet of code:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nGetFeeRecipientByPubKey(ctx, &eth.FeeRecipientByPubKeyRequest{\r\n\t\t\tPublicKey: []byte(nonExistantPublicKey),\r\n\t\t})\r\n```\r\n\r\nNo `FeeRecipient` is provided into `eth.FeeRecipientByPubKeyRequest` ==> `FeeRecipient` will default to `common.Address` default value: `0x0000...`\r\n\r\n[here](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/develop/validator/rpc/standard_api.go#L478), `pOption.FeeRecipient` is set to `params.BeaconConfig().DefaultFeeRecipient,`, which is also `0x0000...`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Operating System:**\r\nMacOS Ventura 13.1\r\nPrysm v3.2.0\r\n",

    "body": "Right this seems like an unintended ux.\r\nsetting the gas limit is specific to using the builder, i think what solves this is throwing an error when builder settings don't exist, as builder logic requires a set fee recipient on the validator client side ( in addition to the beacon node side) to enable which should resolve this. will look at the fix sometime soon. thanks for reporting.\r\n\r\n*note to self try to find a way where we can do this without really throwing errors...*",
