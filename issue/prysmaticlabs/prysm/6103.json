The following is a code snippet from the `VerifySlotTime` function in `beacon-chain/core/helpers/slot_epoch.go`:\r\n```\r\n\tslotTime := 1000 * (genesisTime + slot*params.BeaconConfig().SecondsPerSlot)\r\n\tcurrentTime := 1000 * uint64(roughtime.Now().Unix())\r\n\ttolerance := uint64(timeTolerance.Milliseconds()) // 500ms\r\n\tif slotTime > currentTime+tolerance { ‚Ä¶ }\r\n```\r\nLet‚Äôs say that `slotTime` is 5000s, and actual time represented by `roughtime.Now()` is 5900 ms. However, since `roughtime.Now().Unix()` returns time in seconds - that is, it returns 5s, and `currentTime` ends up being 5000 (same as `slotTime`). However, an actual current time is 5900s, which is 900ms higher than `slotTime`, but 900ms is bigger than 500ms. Therefore, the time difference is actually higher than `MAXIMUM_GOSSIP_CLOCK_DISPARITY`.\r\n\r\nThe same pattern is used in the `validateAggregateAttTime` function inside `beacon-chain/sync/validate_aggregate_proof.go` to verify if the attestation slot is within the last `ATTESTATION_PROPAGATION_SLOT_RANGE` slots.\r\n\r\n### Recommended fix/mitigation:\r\nIf tolerance is less than a second, it makes more sense to do time computations in milliseconds directly, rather than using seconds and then multiplying by 1000. Use [https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Time.UnixNano](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Time.UnixNano) instead of just `.Unix()`. Same applies to validating other things, e.g., attestations.\r\n",
