If this is true, then moving the beacon data directory to slower disk would be ok ? \r\n\r\nCan developer confirm that this is true ? \r\n",

    "body": "hi @NakedKoala unfortunately it is not possible to use an execution client without an SSD, and I believe you will also have a lot of these problems with Prysm if you do not use an SSD. The node simply cannot sync and an execution client will never catch up to the chain head without an SSD. It's a minimum requirement",
