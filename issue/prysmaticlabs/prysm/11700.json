Prysm Remote Signer was gRPC-based it was not adopted by other clients. \r\n\r\n### Description\r\nWe propose deprecating Prysm Remote Signer during Prysm v4\r\nSince the merge support for Prysm's Remote Signer has fallen by the wayside, we provide a POC of the remote signer for users to build on https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/remote-signer but has not been maintained since last September. Web3signer continues to be supported as a standard interface for remote signing in Ethereum. Learn more about its capabilities at https://docs.web3signer.consensys.net/en/latest/\r\n\r\nPlease use this issue to voice any concerns with this proposal.\r\n\r\nThese deprecation actions should include:\r\n\r\n- Deprecate the prysm remote wallet keymanager type\r\n- Removal of the Prysm Remote Keymanager type from the Prysm repo\r\n- Deprecate related flags for Prysm Remote Signer\r\n- Add 2-way TSL support to web3signer hook for Prysm Remote Signer feature parody #9994 \r\n- Deprecate the Remote Signer Poc https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/remote-signer repo",
