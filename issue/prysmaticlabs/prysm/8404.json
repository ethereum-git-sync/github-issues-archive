  "body": "# ðŸš€ Feature Request\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI would like a straight forward command to output the ?index id's? of your validator(s). Not sure if _index id_ is the correct word for it but basically the validator id number that is shown in the second column here: https://mainnet.beaconcha.in/validators/leaderboard\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\n`--list-validator-id   --all`\r\nRequests a dump of available id's, while --all selects all. Specifiying --pubkey 0x1  0x2  0x3  0x4 can be useful too.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nBeaconcha.in works, if you don't have a lot of validators. However, I don't think we should force users to a website when our own data surely got to be available on our own staking machines. ",
