  "body": "**Background** : Incoming blocks must also include an attestation by the proposer. Specifically, a signature along with a shard block hash must be included. The current implementation includes `AggregatedAttestation`, a data structure that represents an aggregation of attestations, not a single one. There are fields that won't be used to validate the block, and are therefore a waste of resources.\r\n\r\n**Relevant code**\r\n* [Incoming blocks in the sync service](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/a53395db9474530a7abdb66c85685565a7d66ded/beacon-chain/sync/service.go#L154)\r\n* [Block's attestation](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/master/proto/beacon/p2p/v1/messages.proto#L35)\r\n\r\n**Requirements**: Replace `AttestationRecord` with a new proto message that contains just a signature and 32 byte hash representing the shard's block. Use these fields to validate the proposer's attestation.",
