For example, the first block producer is too slow to produce a block and everyone votes headvote to the previous block. But the second block producer think that this block has been proposed and pull this block back. The result is that almost 20000 people will lose the income of headvote, but the mining pool protects a block that should have been missed.\r\n\r\nFor example, epoch 214334, slot 6858693 and 6858694; epoch 216178, slot  617727 and 6917728.\r\n\r\nThe validators of 6858693 believed that it was missed and voted in favor of 6858692. The proposer of 6858694 believed that 6858693 had successfully been proposed. However, it was later discovered that 6858693 had indeed been proposed. As a result, almost all validators experienced a loss in headvote gains.\r\n\r\nIf this is indeed the case, is there anything we can do to protect most people's gains?\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️ If you have a solution in mind, please describe it. --> \r\nVote monitoring or something?\r\n\r\n",
