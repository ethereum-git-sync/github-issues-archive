  "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nENRS allows user to report their own external/public ip address. At the moment, many peers do this incorrectly and by default often give an internal ip address. When attempting to discover new peers, this is generating a significant amount of traffic at private ip addresses in the the following ranges:\r\n\r\n10.0.0.0/8\r\n172.16.0.0/12\r\n192.168.0.0/16\r\n100.64.0.0/10\r\n169.254.0.0/16\r\n\r\nMostly at destination port 13000 (or whichever port peers self-report).\r\n\r\nMy cloud ISP (Hetzner, in this case) eventually blocked my box after receiving between 10-100 request per minute, and asked me to file a report to explain what is happening. Successful managed with firewall rules including ip address and CIDR as above, against port 13000. \r\n\r\nSuggestions:\r\n-Add something to documentation to explain the above, including firewall rules needed. \r\n-Track \"bad\" peers and stop connecting?\r\n-Somehow further encourage users to report correct IPs?",
