    "body": "@shayzluf That step is described in [this part of the validator activation pages](https://docs.prylabs.network/docs/install/lin/activating-a-validator/#step-3b-submitting-the-deposit-data), I think the issue is with people that're simply following the steps on prylabs.net  sans documentation. The prylabs page could probably use a more concise note about this step which I'm happy to change, and also @wgknowles suggestion of adding it to the console printout is a good one :slightly_smiling_face: Would do that adjustment as well, but not sure which file in the repo contains the string. Probably easier for one of you folks to fix that part. ",
