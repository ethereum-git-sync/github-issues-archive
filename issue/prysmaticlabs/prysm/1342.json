    "body": "Hey @IvanTheGreatDev, you can just find all references in the spec to eth1 - I can see a few places:\r\n\r\n1. We'll need to modify the initial beacon state function to include eth1 data\r\n2. We'll need to modify the proto for the BeaconState to include this\r\n3. We'll need a new block operation called ProcessETH1Data (core/blocks package)\r\n4. We'll need a new epoch operation called ProcessETH1Data (core/epochs package)\r\n\r\nThere are probably a few more places but doing a ctrl+f in the spec will give the full scope of what needs to be done. Probably easiest to split it up into smaller PRs (one PR for the block operation with tests and one for the epoch operation with tests).",
