Withdrawal happens in two forms: (1) voluntary full withdrawal (2) excess balance withdrawal (over 32 ETH). The issue I wanted to discuss was potential conflicts with slashing since that is currently an event type on the on the beacon chain that signifies a reduced balance and leads to exiting. \r\n### Description\r\n\r\nTo summarize we have 3 cases that lead to a reduced balance:\r\n1) voluntary full withdrawal where the user unstakes and retrieves all funds + rewards. Leads to exiting.\r\n2) an automatic withdraw when the user takes no action after the upgrade. Excess balance (over 32 eth) is automatically returned. Validator remains active.\r\n3) slashing when there is a violation in attestation. Penalty is applied in balance and leads to exiting. Full withdrawal becomes available afterwards.\r\n\r\nWill there be event types to help distinguish these three scenarios for validators and the transactions that reduce their balances on the beacon chain? If so what are they and how can I learn more information/documentation on how to view these on the beacon chain.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n[https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/capella/validator.md#enabling-validator-withdrawals](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/capella/validator.md#enabling-validator-withdrawals)\r\n\r\n[https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/f2eb5e38e2ad651afe1d55eece2e3d28260c2b4a/specs/phase0/beacon-chain.md#beacon-operations](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/f2eb5e38e2ad651afe1d55eece2e3d28260c2b4a/specs/phase0/beacon-chain.md#beacon-operations)\r\n\r\n[https://www.attestant.io/posts/understanding-the-validator-lifecycle/](https://www.attestant.io/posts/understanding-the-validator-lifecycle/)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I can respond with a link once we have this published.\r\nThe short answer to the questions:\r\nthe process of withdrawals requires a new action to change the withdrawal_credentials field to a value that starts with 0x01 and ends with an execution address ( the address you want to withdraw to), we will be providing the tools and guidance for this action.\r\nOnce the withdrawal credentials are changed validator balances over 32 eth will be automatically withdrawn 16 validators at a time each block.\r\nValidators that are fully exited and have their withdrawal address set will be fully withdrawn, again part of the same 16 validators that can withdraw block.\r\nvalidators that have been slashed can also be withdrawn for whatever remains above 0 Eth given that they are fully exited. \r\nIf the validator is not in an exited status either being in a sync committee or slashed there may be a delay.\r\n\r\nI hope this answers your questions.\r\nfor now until we publish the full document https://notes.ethereum.org/@launchpad/withdrawals-faq has some useful information.\r\n\r\n",

Rereading the question it sounds like you'd want some kind of report API that specifies balance changes and the cause of the balance change? ( if that's the question then there are no API endpoints that support it, and you'd have to build your own utilizing the beacon APIs https://ethereum.github.io/beacon-APIs/?urls.primaryName=dev#/)\r\nThe beacon API will only have a new endpoint to check if your withdrawal credential change is in the waiting room so to speak. If this is a question around Execution APIs(json-rpc) I'd be less familiar. the consensus client notifies the execution client via the execution engine APIs and will contain a list of withdrawal messages for the execution client to process https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/capella/beacon-chain.md#executionpayload\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if that answers your question though ",

    "body": "Yes exactly, I am looking for a way to identify the cause of the balance change once it occurs. I was hoping an API was available for this. So by event types I meant the events that trigger this balance change, namely the voluntary withdrawal, the automatic withdrawal and a slash. I assume there must be a field somewhere in the beacon chain that will show the cause of the balance change? You mentioned no API exists for this but we can build it using beacon chain APIs? Can you be more specific about what you mean by that? It won't be hard to create the API ourselves but I just have no idea where to look on the beacon chain to find these causes.
