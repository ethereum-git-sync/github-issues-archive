  "body": "\r\n# üêû Bug Report\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAn attestation for epoch N that is only included in epoch N+1 is treated as missing by `GetValidatorPerformance` \r\n\r\n### Has this worked before in a previous version?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nIf a validator attested in epochs N and N+1 and both attestations are included in epoch N+1 then a call to `/eth/v1alpha1/validators/performance` on epoch N returns `inclusion_distance` of `2^64-1` and on epoch `N+1` it returns information about the last attestation, thus you never get information about the attestation on epoch `N`. \r\n\r\nThis also affects all the averages reported since launch. \r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\nDiscussion about this in discord: https://discord.com/channels/476244492043812875/730447046930071672/772172731046952989\r\n\r\nImplementation of the metrics being exported to Prometheus (still suffering from the same problem as the API call) {{7561}}\r\n",
