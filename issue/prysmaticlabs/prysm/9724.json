    "body": "Hi @tsudmi , thanks for reporting this. When running the beacon node, did you change the value of the flag `--slots-per-archive-point`? The smaller the value, the faster it is to fetch states (and in turn state validators). For historical state fetching we recommend setting the value to `64` or even `32`. Mind you that decreasing the value will result in the beacon DB taking much more space. Unfortunately there's a trade-off between speed and storage size.",
