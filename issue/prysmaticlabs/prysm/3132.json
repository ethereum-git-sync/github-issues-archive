New attestation: sync or RPC when we receive the initial (aggregated) attestation.\r\n2. New block: at sync or RPC when we receive a block with attestations.\r\n3. At attestation insertion into the attestation pool\r\n4. When computing the state root, as part of operations processing. (Same as 2 probably).\r\n5. When requesting attestations from pool.\r\n\r\nMany of these are redundant verification in the same code path. I'll follow up with a simplified path where we only verify attestations when inserting into the attestation pool or when we receive a new block from RPC or sync. ",
