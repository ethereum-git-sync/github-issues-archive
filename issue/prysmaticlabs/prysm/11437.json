    "body": "> Jim comments that he needs this to remain `name`. And to resolve this by \"You could tweak the JSON in passing to change 'name' to 'description'.\".\r\n> \r\n> Reason as to why this is a wontfix in his library: \"description isn't unique, whereas name is. This was a long-ago argument, but we require the name field to be present and unique as it is commonly used as the reference for the account.\"\r\n\r\nI think the spec (EIP-2335) needs to be rediscussed and eventually modified to support the current limitations then. Otherwise we'll get many varying implementations for a prime attack target.",
