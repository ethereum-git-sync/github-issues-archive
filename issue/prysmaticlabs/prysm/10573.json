  "body": "# üêû Too many open files\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI'm syncing Prysm 2.1.0 connected to Geth over ipc.\r\nIt slowly increases number of used file descriptors until it reaches the limit, then starts to produce errors. Almost all connections are to ipc socket.\r\n\r\n### Has this worked before in a previous version?\r\n\r\nDidn't notice this problem in version 2.0.6\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nI don't think I did anything special to my configuration. Just run a node for few hours. If you want to reproduce it faster, use `ulimit -n 300` (or even lower, depends on your p2p-max-peers).\r\n\r\n## üî• Error\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\n2022-04-27T23:07:57.949Z        ERROR   basichost       basic/basic_host.go:328 failed to resolve local interface addresses     {\"error\": \"route ip+net: netlinkrib: too many open files\"}       \r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Operating System:**\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n  <code>\r\nx86_64 GNU/Linux\r\n  </code>\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n**What version of Prysm are you running?
