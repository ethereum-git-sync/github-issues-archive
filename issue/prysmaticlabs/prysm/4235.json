In this scenario, would you consider the status `missed` or \"not exist\"? Or does `missed` mean something else? \r\n\r\nTo go back to [Epoch 25242](https://beaconcha.in/epoch/25242) example:\r\n- Beaconchain UI = `Missed` block for [Slot 201940](https://api.prylabs.net/eth/v1alpha1/beacon/blocks?slot=201940) . Would this indicate:\r\n\r\n>  However, it is concerning when there was a block proposed but no block archived in the DB when attempting to retrieve it from the API.\r\n \r\n- Beaconchain UI = non-existent for [Slot 201939](https://api.prylabs.net/eth/v1alpha1/beacon/blocks?slot=201939)\r\n\r\nBoth slots come back with the same response from the API, but have different statuses on beaconcha.in. \r\n\r\nApologies in advance if this question is out-of-scope for you guys and should be posted in their repo instead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
