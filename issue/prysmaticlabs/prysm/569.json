Currently, the function accepts a bitfield that's assumed to be zero-filled except for the index which represents the single attester. \r\n\r\n**Requirements**: Modify the function to accept the attester's validator index rather than a bitfield. Ensure that a bitfield isn't being created unnecessarily to represent a single validator.",
