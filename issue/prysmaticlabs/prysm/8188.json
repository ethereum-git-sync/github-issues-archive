This crash-looping may be the intended behavior but it's not user-friendly or platform-friendly.\r\n\r\ne.g. after connection made:\r\n```\r\ntime=\"2021-01-02 21:05:34\" level=info msg=\"Waiting for beacon chain start log from the ETH 1.0 deposit contract\" prefix=validator\r\ntime=\"2021-01-02 21:10:36\" level=fatal msg=\"Could not determine if beacon chain started: could not receive ChainStart from stream: rpc error: code = Unavailable desc = transport is closing\" prefix=validator\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen it finally stops crashing:\r\n```\r\ntime=\"2021-01-02 21:15:36\" level=info msg=\"Waiting for beacon chain start log from the ETH 1.0 deposit contract\" prefix=validator\r\ntime=\"2021-01-02 21:15:36\" level=info msg=\"Beacon chain started\" genesisTime=2020-12-01 12:00:23 +0000 UTC prefix=validator\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nA client should be able to be started before its beacon node and be resilient and patient.  If nothing else, this behavior should be optional (`--no-fail-fast`).\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nIf we can't get this added, we'll need to build our own readiness probes to hold off starting the client until it's likely not going to crash.  Pod crash-loops are something our platforms alerts on as, in general, crashing under 'normal operation' should be avoided.",
