  "body": "# ðŸš€ Feature Request\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI would like the ability to enable/disable validator keys on the fly without having to delete and/or re-import the keys.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nLighthouse has a simple `enabled: true|false` flag that can be set on a per-validator entry:\r\nhttps://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/validator-management.html\r\n\r\nI would like the ability to do something similar. This would allow more flexibility and portability between validator clients when using an external wallet management system. In the event that Lighthouse or Prysm encounters a bug / DDoS / etc. this would help in being able to flip a switch and move validator clients without worrying about your Prysm validator coming back online and double signing. It would allow for more rapid testing between clients, etc.\r\n\r\nThis could either be a command like `accounts-v2 enable|disable` or it could just be a key we could set inside `all-accounts.keystore.json` or something? :man_shrugging:\r\n\r\nI just feel like enable/disable is better than delete and re-import most of the time.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nObviously there are risks in running dual validator setups (active/standy), but this would LESSEN that risk for those of us that want to experiment.",

    "body": "Continuing the discussion here @rauljordan .\r\n> Thanks @fabdarice, do you think we can get this wrapped up within a week? We should discuss the approach to this issue. One way we could do it is:\r\n\r\n>1) Inside of the keymanageropts.json file within a wallet, we can store a \"disabled_validators\": [pubkey] entry and exclude those validators when initializing the keymanager (both imported and derived)\r\n> 2) Define enable and disable commands under prysm.sh validator accounts, which will allow a user to perform selection similar to accounts backup and delete. These commands will essentially write to the keymanageropts.json file as needed\r\n\r\nI was thinking of doing 2, which in my opinion is easier for the average joe, will do my best to get a draft PR by EoW",
