  "body": "Hi all,\r\n\r\nCurrently in #5029 we aggregate attestations we receive via RPC and then broadcast them to the slasher. In parallel, our attestation pool does the same aggregation routine in the background elsewhere in the node runtime. This redundancy is inefficient given the aggregation algorithm is slow. Ideally, we can remove the logic from rpc `StreamIndexedAttestations` and instead use the aggregated attestations in the attestation pool itself. One requirement is that slasher _also_ wants unaggregated attestations, not only aggregated ones. Slasher needs _everything_, it can't miss any information.\r\n\r\n- [ ] send p2p aggregated attestations to slasher #5809\r\n- [ ] send pool aggregated/ unaggregated attestations to slasher \r\n- [ ] remove indexed attestations stream redundant aggregation flow",
