  "body": "# ðŸš€ Feature Request\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe execution API spec defines an optional `id` claim that can be set in a JWT token to convey information about the client being authenticated. This is useful for more advanced forms of authentication beyond the basic 1-CL-to-1-EL authentication that we usually do. For example, my [_Electric Eel_](https://github.com/sigp/eleel) multiplexer uses the `id` to identify the connecting client and decide which JWT secret to use. Without the ID, it has to fall back on iterating all known JWT secrets and trying to verify the token against them (which is slow).\r\n\r\nThe spec defines the `id` claim here: https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/blob/main/src/engine/authentication.md#jwt-claims\r\n\r\nIt's worth noting that the ID in the claim is _distinct_ from the key-ID concept defined by the JWT standard, which is part of the _header_, not the body. Apart from being a bit inelegant this isn't an issue.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nAdd a flag to Prysm like `--jwt-id` which takes a string to use as the JWT ID for claims made to the EL.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n* Software version: Prysm v4.0.8",
