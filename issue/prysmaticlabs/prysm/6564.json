  "body": "# 💎 Issue\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\nDuring investigation of potential attestation inclusion issues, I was looking at the code paths for attestation processing.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAs part of the validation for signed aggregated attestation and proof, there is a bit of code that seems out of place for `getAttPreState`.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/a4cfd147ff7ab93aa54768d757012ea067066250/beacon-chain/blockchain/process_attestation_helpers.go#L32-L37\r\n\r\nI find this bit of code weird since it deals with initial sync and saving blocks. This code needs to be annotated with comments or removed since it doesn't seem to be related to fetching the attestation pre-state. \r\n\r\nAssigning to @terencechain as a recent author of this code. \r\n@terencechain can you please comment here on what we should do?\r\n",
