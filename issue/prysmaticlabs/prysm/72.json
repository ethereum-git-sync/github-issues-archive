  "body": "Hi Team,\r\n\r\nAs part of this issue I would like to propose we use **libp2p** as our sharding networking protocol. It is a solid library created by Protocol Labs and currently powering IPFS. Let's use this issue to elaborate on this as much as we can and discuss if we want to integrate this.\r\n\r\nLet's figure out how different it is from devp2p and if it would be worth our while to try this approach.\r\n\r\nHere are some of the resources to get started:\r\n\r\n[libp2p site](https://libp2p.io/)\r\n[libp2p specs](https://github.com/libp2p/specs)\r\n[go libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p)\r\n[js libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p)\r\n\r\n[distinction between p2p libraries](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/12290/what-is-the-distinction-between-libp2p-devp2p-and-rlpx)\r\n[libp2p video by juan benet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxueJbeMVG4)\r\n[devp2p wiki](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/%C3%90%CE%9EVp2p-Wire-Protocol)\r\n\r\nLet me know your thoughts below.\r\n",

    "body": "I did an overview summarizing what devp2p and libp2p would entail , you guys can take a look for it here https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K9NVV2SBjxdgejWnip3l-ZYyknOdWu6i5Ot_X_y6t1k/edit?usp=sharing \r\n\r\nI am in agreement with Raul that for us using libp2p would be a better option than devp2p owing to the fact the former has more robust documentation , libp2p was designed to be able to use a much wider variety of transport protocols and is transport agnostic. Also the team at protocol labs is consistently working on it and improving on it which is beneficial to us. In comparison devp2p has very sparse documentation and does not look like it is being actively maintained. ",
