  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nAs I'm currently synching an archive mainnet instance of Prysm, I'd noticed everything is kept in a single file (beacondchain.db) which is already at 4TB. I can always accommodate by migrating to XFS RAID arrays, but this would be an issue once it approaches the 16TB file size limit for users on EXT4 formatted RAID arrays.\r\n\r\nDoes the team plan to split the beaconchain.db data into multiple files?",

I just double-checked your docs and saw the recommended value is a multiple of 32... my mistake there. Could that be why my db built up so quickly to 4TB?",
