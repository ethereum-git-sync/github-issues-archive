  "body": "# üêû Bug Report\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nDepending on when a user starts up their validator client and how long their beacon node takes to sync/get ready a certain fatal error path could be triggered which leads to the validator client being shut down and a user being offline. The root cause of this error is how we apply our deadline here in `PushProposerSettings` \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/develop/validator/client/validator.go#L993\r\n\r\nWe round up the slot to the end of the epoch here in `RoundUpToNearestEpoch` in the majority of the cases. However if our current slot is the first slot of the epoch, we will not round it up. Instead it will apply the deadline to the end of the current slot. While this is fine if the current time is earlier on in the slot, this becomes an issue if our current time falls towards the end of a slot. If our current time is already close to the end of a slot and the deadline is at the end of it, it might give us a very short time period to execute all the calls in `PushProposerSettings`. In this case our deadline will very likely expire and the validator client will produce a fatal log and shut down. \r\n\r\nThe correct solution would be to apply a fixed time period to execute all these calls rather than relying on rounded up slots as being a marker of how long we have to execute these calls. \r\n\r\nFound by Antithesis\r\n\r\ncc @0xTylerHolmes\r\n\r\n### Has this worked before in a previous version?\r\n\r\nN.A\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nThis error is difficult to reproduce as it requires the validator client to start up in a short time period in an epoch (1 second).  \r\n\r\n## üî• Error\r\n\r\n<pre><code>\r\nlevel=fatal msg=\"Failed to update proposer settings\" error=\"rpc error: code = DeadlineExceeded desc = context deadline exceeded\" prefix=validator\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n**Operating System:**\r\n\r\nx86_64 GNU/Linux\r\n\r\n\r\n**What version of Prysm are you running?
