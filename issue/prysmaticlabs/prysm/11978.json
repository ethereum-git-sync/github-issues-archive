A part of the reason to this is from the fact that the Prysm Beacon node supports 2 types of endpoints, a gRPC endpoint and a Rest endpoint. Typically the gRPC endpoint is internal use only but many commands from prysmctl and on the validator only support the gRPC version while others may support both or only the rest version. As we begin migrating away from gRPC and more towards the standard REST versions we should re-evaluate these flags, their usage, and the naming.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nprysmctl \r\ncheckpoint sync used `beacon-node-host` - gRPC only\r\nprysmctl withdrawals uses `beacon-node-host` - REST only\r\nvalidator accounts commands uses `beacon-rpc-provider` and `beacon-rest-api-provider`but only support the gRPC at this time.\r\nOther commands and usage needs to be evaluated.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
