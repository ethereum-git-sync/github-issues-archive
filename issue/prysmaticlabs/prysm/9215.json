  "body": "Hi, \r\nHere I'm describing the issue and related information.\r\n**Issue**\r\nWhen using the web interface on docker once we set up the wallet and start the validator it works fine but when we restart the docker container it freezes with few logs given below. \r\n\r\n```\r\n[2021-07-16 11:06:33]  WARN flags: Running on Pyrmont Testnet\r\n[2021-07-16 11:06:33]  WARN flags: Enabled feature flag attest-timely=Fixes validator can attest timely after current block processes. See #8185 for more details\r\n[2021-07-16 11:06:33]  INFO node: Enabling web portal to manage the validator client\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Reason**\r\nThis happens because the wallet directory is already available on a given path which was created before we restart the docker. If we remove that wallet directory then it works fine. (I have used the local volume for the wallet directory by mounting in docker).\r\n\r\n**Flags Used in docker**\r\n```\r\n\"--wallet-dir=/wallet\",\"--datadir=/validatorDB\",\"--beacon-rpc-provider=127.0.0.1:4000\",\"--accept-terms-of-use=true\",\"--pyrmont\",\"--enable-db-backup-webhook\",\"--attest-timely\",\"--web\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**\r\n1) Run the web interface via docker with the above commands\r\n2) Import wallet keys \r\n3) After running the validator on the web interface stop the docker container and then start again.\r\n4) It'll freeze at ` INFO node: Enabling web portal to manage the validator client` log. \r\n\r\n**Prysm client version**\r\n1.3.11\r\n\r\n**Additional Information**\r\nWhen the log freezes the validator not getting started and even port 7500 has no response as the validator service is not getting started. I keep the system as it is to check if the validator response for more than 17 hours but there was not any additional logs.",
