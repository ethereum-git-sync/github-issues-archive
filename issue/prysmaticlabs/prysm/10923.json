    "body": "Quoting @kasey \r\n\r\n> what if we add a new wrapper type that internally calls HashTreeRoot() and memoizes the result? It could be returned by all the constructors that currently create SignedBeaconBlock values from their concrete types. Since this type embeds the SignedBeaconBlock interface it also implements SignedBeaconBlcok so I think we would have to change very little code",
