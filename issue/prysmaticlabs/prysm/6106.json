  "body": "# üêû Bug Report\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhistleblower index can be 0, i.e. the first validator in the registry. Currently it is used as default condition. (since the spec has an optional parameter here).\r\n\r\nThis does not affect Phase0, as in phase 0 we always default to rewarding the proposer anyway. However, if we decide to change this, or phase 1 comes, it would break consensus.\r\n\r\n### Has this worked before in a previous version?\r\n\r\nNot that I know of. It is one of the few phase-1 placeholder left overs in the spec, and not reachable from phase 0 functionality.\r\n\r\n## üî¨ Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nSee the `== 0` check in `SlashValidator(state *stateTrie.BeaconState, slashedIdx uint64, whistleBlowerIdx uint64) (*stateTrie.BeaconState, error)`\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/75aaa5e07bde2667b6f2f81cff56b876272e8216/beacon-chain/core/validators/validator.go#L153\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî• Error\r\n\r\nNone (yet)\r\n\r\n## üåç  Your Environment\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\n",
