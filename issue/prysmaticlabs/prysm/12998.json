  "body": "Deneb changes the maximum number of blocks per rpc request to account for the overhead of concurrent blob requests over the same range. We have 2 separate parameters for the pre- and post- deneb request size, requiring boilerplate code to pick the right variable depending on the request epoch. It would be helpful to have a single config helper that takes the epoch as an argument and gives the appropriate value. We also need to audit the code and find instances where one or the other is hardcoded and consider whether we need to use the new helper.",
