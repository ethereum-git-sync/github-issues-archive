  "body": "### Describe the bug\n\nI run several nodes behind a node balancer. I query for the checkpoint and when I receive a new one I query `/eth/v1/beacon/headers/{block_id}` with the `block_id = finalized_root` from the checkpoint payload. Then, I query for all the slots between the previous finalized slot and the current finalized slot.\r\n\r\nWhen I queried slot `8118490` (endpoint = `/eth/v2/beacon/blocks/8118490`) after having seen a new checkpoint (not necessarily from the node that I was quering), I received the payload for the block with the flag `finalized: true` which is not what I was expecting since the slot has been forked/uncled.\r\n\r\nI was expecting either a 404 (block not found) or `finalized: false`. \r\n\r\nIs this an expected behaviour?\r\n\r\n[Here](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/files/13818624/slot_response_8118490.json) is the payload that I received for slot `8118490` that shows the finalized flag = true. \r\n\n\n### Has this worked before in a previous version?\n\n```text\nNot sure\n```\n\n\n### ðŸ”¬ Minimal Reproduction\n\nBelow are the prism flags and environment used for all of the nodes behind the node balancer.\r\n```\r\n[Service]\r\n\r\nEnvironment=USE_PRYSM_MODERN=true\r\nEnvironment=USE_PRYSM_VERSION=v4.0.8\r\n\r\nExecStart=/data/prysm/prysm.sh beacon-chain \\\r\n--slots-per-archive-point 2048 \\\r\n--execution-endpoint=http://localhost:8551/ \\\r\n--mainnet \\\r\n--jwt-secret=/path/to/jwt.hex \\\r\n--datadir /path/to/datadir \\\r\n--monitoring-host 0.0.0.0 \\\r\n--grpc-gateway-host 0.0.0.0 \\\r\n--grpc-gateway-corsdomain 127.0.0.1 \\\r\n--accept-terms-of-use \\\r\n--enable-debug-rpc-endpoints\r\n```\n\n### Error\n\n_No response_\n\n### Platform(s)\n\nLinux (x86)\n\n### What version of Prysm are you running?
