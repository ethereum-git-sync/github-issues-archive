  "body": "Hi all,\r\n\r\nAs part of the chain service, we have a property called `unfinalizedBlocks map[[32]byte]*statePair` which tracks an unfinalized block's (activeState, crystallizedState) pair in memory for the updateHead function to handle scoring and reorgs. If the beacon node shuts down for some reason and this map was full during the session, we should always initialize this map of unfinalized blocks on the chain service, `.Start()` function in case there are items in persistent storage within new sessions.\r\n\r\nA PR for this would leverage an efficient and concise way of storing unfinalized blocks and their associated states to disk and make it easy to fetch all of these items during startup.",
