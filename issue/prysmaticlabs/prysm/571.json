  "body": "In the shared sub-package in the repo, there is a helper function called `CheckBit` which is used to check for the existence of a bit in a bitfield. However the method panics whenever an index that does not exist in the bitfield is used in the function. \r\n\r\nA PR to solve this issue would instead return an error if an invalid index is used in conjunction with the inputted bitfield. The function signature should look like this:\r\n```golang \r\nfunc CheckBit(bitfield []byte, index int) (bool,error) \r\n``` ",
