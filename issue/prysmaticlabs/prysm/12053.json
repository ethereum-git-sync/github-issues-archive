This is limited to the last `SLOTS_PER_HISTORICAL_ROOT` state roots (8192 on Mainnet). This is because there is no easy way to fetch an arbitrary state by root from the database, and we keep the latest `SLOTS_PER_HISTORICAL_ROOT` state and block roots in memory, which allows us to do this:\r\n```\r\nfor i, root := range headState.StateRoots() {\r\n\tif bytes.Equal(root, stateRoot) { // stateRoot is the requested root\r\n\t\tblockRoot := headState.BlockRoots()[i]\r\n\t\treturn p.StateGenService.StateByRoot(ctx, bytesutil.ToBytes32(blockRoot))\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- ✍️ A clear and concise description of the problem or missing capability... --> \r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nIt would be desirable to be able to use an arbitrary state root for the `{state_id}` parameter. One possible solution is to create a `state_root -> block_root` mapping in the database. This way we could get the block root efficiently and then use `StateGenService` to fetch the entire state. \r\n",
