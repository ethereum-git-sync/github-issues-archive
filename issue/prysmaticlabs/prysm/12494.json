  "body": "With withdrawals, initial syncing from Genesis is considered unsafe due to long-range attacks. We should consider a path to disallow or not recommend initial sync from Genesis. Given the blob availability window, disallowing initial sync from Genesis also benefits Deneb. It cleans out overall logic. \r\n\r\nWhat I recommend:\r\n- Error out when syncing from Genesis\r\n- Flag to override error out \r\n- When syncing from genesis to head, if the block is outside the blob availability window, the blob-referenced block has to be finalized",
