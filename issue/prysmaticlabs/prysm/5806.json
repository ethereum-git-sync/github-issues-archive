Connecting the validator to a slasher instance and validating its blocks and attestation before transmission will enable much more secure validation activity.\r\n\r\nThe other option that this feature possibly enables is running a redundant validator at a different location. this should be battle tested for timing issues and correctness\r\n\r\n- [x] add slasher grpc client to validator #5807\r\n- [x] validate attestation before submission using is slashable attestation slasher endpoint\r\n- [x] validate block before submission using is slashable block endpoint\r\n- [ ] test protection timing on local setup and using remote slasher ",
