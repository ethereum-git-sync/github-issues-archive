  "body": "In the current system, the Pubsub timeout is set to 30 seconds, which means that if a block is stuck during Data Availability (DA) check, the worst-case scenario is it will exit after 30 seconds. Additionally, the pending queue interval is 4 seconds, which implies that if an unknown parent is received, the system will request the parent block and all its associated blobs and attempt to process it every 4 seconds.\r\n\r\nThe issue arises when a node is waiting for a DA check for a missing blob. During this period, the node will not process the block in the pending queue. Consequently, if a blob at a particular index is never received over the gossip network, the system will have to wait for 30 seconds. This is in contrast to the ideal case where it would have taken only 4 seconds if the node could request its block and blobs over RPC by root request.",
