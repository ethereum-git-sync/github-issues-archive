  "body": "Jotting down this idea from an offline discussion with @nisdas.\r\n\r\nPrysm nodes advertise several multiaddresses, however when a libp2p node peers with another without using discovery v5, then these nodes don't exchange their ENRs and the nodes learn about metadata through p2p rpc.\r\n\r\nThis idea proposes to advertise another multiaddress containing the ENR. Perhaps adding a new [protocol](https://github.com/multiformats/multiaddr/blob/master/protocols.csv) to facilitate this functionality.\r\n\r\nAn example multiaddr might be \r\n- `/ipv4/127.0.0.1/tcp/5000/<pubkey>/discv5/<ENR>`\r\n- `/discv5/<ENR>`\r\n",

    "body": "For some related discussion on this https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/issues/1637 and \r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/pull/1673. For most purposes having the ping/metadata rpc methods will be sufficient. As we just need to know the current status of subscribed subnets of our peers. \r\n\r\nHowever being able to exchange enrs to other peers has advantages from the point of peer discovery. As that way you will be able build a larger dht, by adding new nodes to your local table. \r\n\r\nHowever one downside of this is that ENRs are large objects being around 300 bytes. Constantly exchanging it whenever you connect with a new peer might be expensive.",

However the metadata only gives us a portion of the enr. So we cannot use the metadata to add that peer to our discv5 table.
