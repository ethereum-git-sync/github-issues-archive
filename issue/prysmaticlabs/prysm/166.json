  "body": "An important part of the Minimal Sharding Protocol and our first release is enforcing a challenge period \r\nfor a Notary's Proof of Custody. That is, when a Notary votes on a collation header and submits a proof of custody to show that it has the full collation data at time of submission, we want to prevent notaries from deleting this data from their persistent storage until a certain challenge period is over.\r\n\r\nThis is critical for sync as when notaries are selected on a shard in a period, they will have to sync the latest 25 collations for said shard and also fetch the submitted headers to the SMC by proposers. The windback process for fetching collations will be synced from other notaries that have persisted this data due to the challenge period requirement.\r\n\r\nWe need a publicly-readable challenge period that our sharding node can enforce on Notaries and notify them when it is safe to delete persisted data (when the challenge period is over).\r\n\r\nAlso implement the ability for a notary service to read this from the SMC on every rerun of its event loop and eventually help delete persisted data automatically when the period is over.\r\n\r\nAssigning provisionally to @terenc3t.",
