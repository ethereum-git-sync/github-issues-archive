In that case, the traditional pubkey/privkey management mechanisms will not apply but this is yet to be finalized. @rawfalafel brought this up on Gitter.\r\n- The same **identity** that deposited 32ETH into the PoW Chain VRC contract should be the same one that spins up a validator as part of beacon node. This is why it makes sense for the beacon node to have the privKey corresponding to the pubKey that deposited on the mainchain.",

    "body": "The original issue was that if the private key used to deposit 32ETH to the PoW chain was the same as the private key used to validate on the beacon chain, there would have to be some mechanism to securely move the private key over to the beacon chain.\r\n\r\nThis shouldn't be an issue. A would-be validator can generate a new private key from the validator client and include the pubkey of the new key in the validator deposit contract (there's a field for this in the 2.1 spec). The original key stays in the PoW chain wallet and the validator key stays in the validator client.\r\n\r\nOne more note: From what I understand, Eth 2.0 is 100% switching over to a new signature scheme since we're relying on BLS aggregation to scale up the number of attesters.",
