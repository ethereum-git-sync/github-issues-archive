  "body": "# ðŸš€ Feature Request\r\n\r\nCurrent instructions for windows all require the use of external dependencies (e.g. docker, git bash, WSL, etc.)  The .exe releases work just fine without these pre-requisites, however windows can't run .sh bash scripts.  A prysm.bat file that mimics the functionality of prysm.sh will allow for documentation to be consistent across all platforms.\r\n\r\nDesired outcome:\r\nAbility to run all commands available in prysm.sh in windows using prysm.bat",
