  "body": "# ðŸ’Ž Issue\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\nOn the dashboard, we can follow the participation rate to have a quick idea of the network health. This info is very important in order to understand some of the penalties that could be encountered by the staker (participation rate < 66%)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nSince a while now (at least since Topaz testnet) the participation rate suddenly drops to 0, and this is still on going on Onyx. \r\nI know that this is local on each node, could happen to any node but randomly, and if it happens to one it doesn't mean it will happen to the other nodes at the same time.\r\n\r\nFor the participation rate to drop to 0, it means that the metric `total_voted_target_balance` drops to 0, so at some point, this value isn't correctly fetched by the node, and set it to 0.\r\n\r\nYou can see here the `total_voted_target_balance` dropping to 0, then participation rate is dropping to 0 as well\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23481418/85520821-b705f700-b603-11ea-9ce1-46e0ce6a39eb.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be good to fix this issue, it is really not a big deal so far, but still annoying (wrong chart + alerts for nothing)",
