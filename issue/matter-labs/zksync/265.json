  "body": "As per https://kalis.me/unlimited-erc20-allowances/ it is considered harmful to ask the user to authorise an ERC20 `approve()` with an unlimited allowance.  Arguably this might be OK if both the following are true:\r\n\r\n1. The interface makes it very clear to the user that this is what is happening, and what corresponding risks they are undertaking by authorising such a transaction.\r\n2. The interface takes advantage of the unlimited allowance by never asking for further approvals - after all, the whole point of requesting unlimited allowance is to remove the need for this, thereby reducing further UI friction.\r\n\r\nHowever, as I've noted in #264, it seems the UI is currently insisting on requiring an `approve()` every time regardless of whether it's needed; therefore defaulting to unlimited allowance is not just insecure but also fails to take advantage of the UI benefit offered by that extra risk.\r\n\r\nSo I suggest capping `approve()` transactions to the minimum required.  You could perhaps also explicitly offer the user the choice to set a higher allowance, or even an unlimited one as long as an appropriate warning is given first in this case.\r\n\r\nOf course if I've misunderstood something then happy to be corrected.",
