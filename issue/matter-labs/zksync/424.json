  "body": "hi, I studied the changePubKey process of zksync,  on process is firstly changing pubkey in L1, then L2 also send a changePubkey tx which signed the pubkey_hash with corresponding L2 private_key and verified in circuit. but it not verify the L1 address. when malicious user signed the wrong L1 address with self L2 private_key, it will result in commitBlock verified failed in L1.\r\n\r\nfor example. user A first deposit  100ETH in L1 with addr_A address. B sign a change pubkey tx to addr_A, the circuit will verify it success as no verification with addr_A and pubkey_hash_B,  however, it will verify failed in L1 when commitBlock submitted to check the changePubkey map.\r\n\r\nif there is some wrong ,please let me know, thanks.",
