  "body": "### **Prize Title**\r\n\r\nCheap blanc checks / payment links dapp built with zkSync.\r\n\r\n### **Prize Bounty**\r\n\r\n500 DAI.\r\n\r\n### **Challenge Description**\r\n\r\n**Introduction**\r\n\r\nThere is an open-source coder Alice. She earns her living via donations. She receives payments on Ethereum, but to make the process of donating simple, Alice wants to put on her project's GitHub page a donation payment link instead of her address. This way, the users can jump straight into donating by clicking the link.\r\n\r\nAlice does not want to pay high fees and does not want her users to pay them either, so she uses zkSync as the Ethereum scaling solution of her choice. But how can she generate such a payment link?\r\n\r\n**The challenge**\r\n\r\nYour task is to create a website that can generate zkSync payment links. Your website should be able to do the following:\r\n\r\nGiven an Ethereum address and maybe some additional information, your website should generate a payment link, which encodes the address of the transaction's recipient (and possibly some additional information). Whenever someone opens the link, the user will go through the zkSync checkout process and will donate to the provided zkSync account.\r\n\r\nThe library that you must use to start the checkout process is described [here](https://www.notion.so/zkSync-Checkout-docs-2bffd6f169e746d0b51873e4127992a6). \r\n\r\n### **Submission Requirements**\r\n\r\n- The solution must use the zkSync checkout library. Here is the [link to the docs.](https://www.notion.so/zkSync-Checkout-docs-2bffd6f169e746d0b51873e4127992a6)\r\n- It must be secure, i.e. no exposure of private keys, etc.\r\n- A link to the demo of your service must be included in the submission. You might also attach the link to the GitHub repo of your solution.\r\n- You must include the link to the GitHub page with the source code, containing [README.md](http://readme.md/) with the description of your solution in English.\r\n\r\n### **Judging Criteria**\r\n\r\n- UI quality.\r\n- The UX should be smooth and delightful.\r\n- Usability, i.e., it should be easy for both senders and recipients to use your service.\r\n- Universality, i.e. there should be many use-cases for your service. Donations is only one example. There might also be shops, that would want to use your website. The bigger the target audience is, the better!",
