  "body": "\r\n\r\n### üåü Feature Request\r\n\r\n#### üìù Description\r\n\r\nThe `setup-dev.md` guide in the `zksync-era` repository provides comprehensive instructions for setting up the development environment. However, there are several areas where the guide could be enhanced for clarity and completeness, particularly for new contributors or those unfamiliar with specific tools or environments. The proposed improvements are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. **Clarification on Docker Installation:** \r\n   - The current guide mentions using Docker Desktop for Linux. It would be beneficial to clarify that Docker Desktop is not the only option and that Docker can be used without it, especially for users who prefer a CLI-only setup.\r\n\r\n2. **Expanded Section on Windows Compatibility:** \r\n   - The guide briefly mentions using WSL 2 on Windows. An expanded section with detailed instructions and resources for setting up and troubleshooting WSL 2 would be highly valuable.\r\n\r\n3. **Additional Tips for MacOS Users:** \r\n   - For MacOS users, particularly those with ARM processors (e.g., M1/M2), including tips or resources for ensuring compatibility and performance would be helpful.\r\n\r\n4. **Enhanced Explanation of `nix` Usage:** \r\n   - The section on using `nix` for dependency management is currently brief. An expanded guide with detailed steps and examples would greatly benefit users unfamiliar with `nix`.\r\n\r\n#### ü§î Rationale\r\n\r\nImproving the `setup-dev.md` guide is crucial for several reasons:\r\n\r\n- It reduces the initial setup time and potential frustration for new contributors, making the project more accessible.\r\n- Clear and detailed setup instructions help ensure a smoother and more consistent setup process across different operating systems and environments.\r\n- Enhanced documentation reflects well on the project, showing a commitment to community and contributor experience.\r\n\r\n#### üìã Additional Context\r\n\r\nThese improvements aim to make the development environment setup process more approachable, efficient, and user-friendly. They are expected to benefit all contributors, especially those who are new to the project or certain technologies mentioned in the guide.\r\n\r\n",
