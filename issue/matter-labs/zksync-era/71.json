  "body": "Hi, we're researching the status of MEV in zksync-Era. Since the sequencer is centralized, we only expect to find back-run MEV bots possible on the chain, since a sandwich-attack would require the sequencer's cooperation. Looking at the open-sourced code here, the transactions are supposed to be ordered by `received_timestamp_ms` in every block, which is a common practice.\r\n\r\nHowever, when inspecting data on-chain, I found a number of cases where transaction with higher `received_timestamp_ms` gets positioned in front of transaction with lower `received_timestamp_ms`. How could this happen and is it expected?\r\n\r\nAn example block would be 9906913. Where transaction `0x7a8c5aef3ac0cafc6ce8eff46a9e4ab263920d4bd18b559c9dfd32bdbf58d5e5` with timestamp `1690690011178` gets executed in front of transaction `0x7e2e9c7dade17a54ea7d8fb96b9bd37a5a9d8754d7631febe8c6de22dfedd6e3` with timestamp `1690690011140`.\r\n\r\nThis could indicate that something is going on in the dark, but I wouldn't make such a conclusion yet.",
