  "body": "I have raised this issue before in #4134 and solc-js dependency has been updated from 0.6.0 to 0.6.9 but nodejs 10 support was an obstacle to updating it further. Now that nodejs 10 support has been dropped Truffle should be able to update to the latest version.\r\n\r\nIn general solc-js is guaranteed to be forward-compatible only with the same major release series of Solidity. It may happen that older versions of solc-js still work with newer versions of `soljson.js`, but an upgrade is normally needed after every breaking release. The latest version of solc-js is always kept compatible with all previous versions of the compiler.\r\n\r\nIn 0.8.10 we'll be dropping a workaround that keeps pre-0.6.9 version working with latest `soljson.js` binaries (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12236). Truffle won't be affected since it's using 0.6.9 but an update to at the very least 0.8.0 is recommended anyway.",
