  "body": "- [ ] I've asked for help in the [Truffle Gitter](http://gitter.im/Consensys/truffle) before filing this issue.\r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\n## Issue\r\n\r\n`truffle@tezos` uses an old version of smartpy compiler and hence does not compile when using a valid contract from the online smartpy editor e.g. any contract that uses `view` decorator \r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\ntry to compile using the experimental [view decorator](https://www.smartpy.io/dev/reference.html#_views)\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nTruffle should always install the latest version of smartpy compiler as it does for ligo.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Actual Results\r\n\r\nWhen using new features e.g. `view` decorator the compilation fails.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n* Operating System: \r\n* Tezos client: ganache cli\r\n* Truffle version (`truffle version`): v5.5.0-tezos.4 (core: 5.5.0-tezos.4)\r\n* node version (`node --version`): v10.16.0\r\n* npm version (`npm --version`): 6.14.7\r\n\r\n## Resolution\r\n\r\nPart of the issue can be resolved with this [PR](https://github.com/trufflesuite/SmartPyBasic-Docker/pull/2)\r\nand the next step would be to update the compiler version in truffle and create a new release\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Hello @haltman-at & @fainashalts can you please make a statement as to why Tezos support is not a priority anymore? To be honest it leaves a bad taste after the big announcement od Tezos support in Truffle ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/trufflesuite/status/1250486441341304835) and [Blogpost](https://trufflesuite.com/blog/branching-out-announcing-tezos-support-in-truffle/)) over two years ago. The funny thing is the support didnt last long, less than a year later Truffle started to ghost all issues and update requests on github or stated to do it later.. why the sudden change back then?\r\n\r\nAt least make either make it official and announce that you are not supporting Tezos anymore or at least update Tezos Truffle to current protocol standard. I dont know maybe its a failure on the communication side, maybe Truffle @tcoulter and Tezos Foundation @drchrispinnock need to talk but the current state is unfortunate.",

    "body": "Apologies @BearCooder for the change there. We had big hopes for integrating Tezos into Truffle, but our initial Proof of Concept showed us that proper support would require a significant amount of effort, since Truffle is quite tightly-coupled with the EVM. Since this project is in a position of juggling priorities with limited labor-power, we had to stop our efforts to make Tezos first-class in our tools.\r\n\r\nPossibly in the future, we'll improve Truffle's architecture to the point where supporting other blockchain computer architectures becomes feasible, but unfortunately that's just not the case today. Hopefully there are alternative tools for Tezos smart contract development that you can use instead of Truffle.\r\n\r\nThanks for understanding.",
