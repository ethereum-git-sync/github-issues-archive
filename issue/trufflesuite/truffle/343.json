We need to profile it, find bottlenecks and implement some caching.\r\n* `truffle version` takes 4s on my computer\r\n* `truffle test` with solidity tests doesn't cache compiled contracts and artifacts and rebuilds them on every run\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n* run `truffle version`\r\n* run `truffle tests` with solidity tests\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n* I expect time for `truffle version` to be negligible\r\n* I expect second test run to be faster than the first one and use precompiled contracts or only recompile the changed ones.\r\n  * Maybe use a temp directory\r\n  * Maybe have a directory inside of a project ignored in a generated `.gitignore`\r\n\r\n## Actual Results\r\n\r\nAbove^\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n* Operating System: macos\r\n* Hardware: Macbook Retina 12 inch early 2016 1.1GHz Intel core m3\r\n* Truffle version: 3.0.5\r\n* Ethereum client: testrpc\r\n* node version: v7.5.0\r\n* npm version: 4.1.2\r\n",

    "body": "Talking about the first part of this issue: (Every truffle command takes at least 4 seconds)\r\n\r\nI profiled the code and ~60% of time is spent in a C++ function which parses the module.\r\nHere is the [profiler output](https://gist.github.com/anonymous/def6b52795dfead4c60848da3cb61c63#file-profiler-tree-L110)\r\nIt means, that the dependency tree is too big and it takes a lot of time for node to load all the modules.\r\n\r\nNot all this code is required every time we run truffle, so the solution would be to **make some of requires lazy**. This will cut huge parts of dependency tree and load them on-demand.\r\nNode made the decision, that require should not be lazy, because it was designed for writing web-serers, where startup-time is less important than latency, but if you use require inside of a function it is not executed before you actually call the function.\r\n\r\nI propose to split by command, cause it's the most natural way to do it. We don't need to load a compiler dependencies on `truffe version` run.\r\n\r\nI already tested that approach on my computer and it speeds up a lot.\r\nFor example the execution time for truffle version:\r\n* Before\r\n```\r\nTruffle v3.0.4\r\n\r\nreal\t0m4.759s\r\nuser\t0m4.112s\r\nsys\t0m0.337s\r\n```\r\n* After\r\n```\r\nTruffle v3.0.4\r\n\r\nreal\t0m0.439s\r\nuser\t0m0.404s\r\nsys\t0m0.055s\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is my [diff](https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5b2113f96671bc488b9eab40b3c97d65)\r\nIt just moves required inside of a run function for commands.\r\nIf you hae better ideas, I'm happy to discuss them.\r\n\r\nI had an idea of making the file `/lib/commands/index.js` the splitpoint by replacing for example\r\n```\r\ncompile: require(\"./compile\"),\r\n``` \r\nwith\r\n```\r\ncompile: () => require(\"./compile\"),\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut this is currently not possible, cause we need all the command info for `yargs`.\r\n",

    "body": "Talking about the second part of this issue: (Contracts are recompiled every time we run the tests)\r\n\r\nI wrote an [example implementation](https://gist.github.com/LogvinovLeon/25f469848f26402e2664b5d191841f07) that caches the precompiled contracts in tests.\r\n\r\nIt's not perfect and it's a subject to discussion, but I personally am happy with that and I'm getting faster test runs.\r\n\r\nFirst I used temp directory compiled_test_contracts to store compiled contracts.\r\nThe directory is in system-specific location outside of the project folder.\r\nAfter implementing that I experienced an error, because `Contracts.compile` didn't return the paths. It has a callback with three arguments (error, abstractions, paths).\r\nIt's because in `truffle-compile/index.js:118` we call the same callback with no arguments.\r\nI tried to call that callback with an empty array of paths, but had a problem, that a second test run failed, because the dependencies were not linked.\r\n\r\nSo I just added some code for getting required deps, that does not require on paths and it started to work.\r\n\r\nI understand, that that is not a perfect solution and I'm opened for a discussion.",
