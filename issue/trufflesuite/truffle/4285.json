  "body": "Currently, when a user sets gas to 0 in their network configuration, Truffle will treat that as undefined and get a gas estimate to use instead. Setting gas to 0 is not valid when using Ethereum, but we want to leave this option open for people who may be running their own chain that doesn't care about this. So in Truffle 6, we should respect the user-generated parameter of `gas:0`. \n\nNote: Optimism users may be setting gas to 0 to force gas estimation, so we should be sure we notify the Optimism folks about this change when it happens.
