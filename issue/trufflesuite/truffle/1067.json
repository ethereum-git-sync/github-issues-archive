  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm trying to use truffle-contract in a React Native app but this error is thrown:\r\n`undefined is not a function (evaluating 'Object.setPrototypeOf(ExtendableBuiltin, cls)')`\r\n\r\nSurprisingly, this error doesn't appear when launching the app with the Remote JS debugger. I wasn't able to identify the cause of the error.\r\n\r\nThis issue has already been declared: https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle-contract/issues/113 without solution.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nDario",
