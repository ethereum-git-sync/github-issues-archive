  "body": "While stepping through an Ethereum transaction with the Truffle debugger, currently there is no way to step over a Solidity function modifier.  The `step out` or `o` command, still steps one line at a time through the function modifier.  It would be very helpful if the `step out` command stepped completely over the function modifier.\r\n\r\nAn added feature would be to have a `step into function body` command that would jump directly into the body of a function, skipping over _all_ the function modifiers a function might have.",
