  "body": "When an out of gas error occurs, the debugger doesn't mention it. It only says:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTransaction halted with a RUNTIME ERROR.\r\n\r\nThis is likely due to an intentional halting expression, like assert(), require() or revert(). It can also be due to out-of-gas exceptions. Please inspect your transaction parameters and contract code to determine the meaning of this error.\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut it would be useful for the user to see that an out of gas error is what's causing the transaction to fail. And since the gas information is known to the debugger (via `!evm.current.state.gas`) this presumably wouldn't be that hard to daylight.\r\n\r\nTested on v4.1.11.",
