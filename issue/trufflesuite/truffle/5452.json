  "body": "This is currently blocking #5335 (and PR #5367) due to there being scenario tests in this repo that are meant to be testing the `@truffle/preserve-*` plugins.\r\n\r\nSpecifically in this case, `@truffle/preserve` depends on `@truffle/error`, and #5367 introduces breaking changes to that package. As a result, there's a chicken/egg problem where we have to publish an update for `@truffle/error` in order to publish an update for `@truffle/preserve`, but with the current state of affairs I can't publish `@truffle/error` because the integration tests for the current version of `@truffle/preserve` produce a red build of `@truffle/error`.\r\n\r\nI could work around this by avoiding the breaking change in #5367 (and I may do that as well), but this issue will just pop up again in some other way. The underlying problem is that we effectively haven't decoupled `truffle` from `@truffle/preserve` until we've stopped testing that the current version of `@truffle/preserve` integrates with in-flight dev changes _from within in the `truffle` repo_.",
