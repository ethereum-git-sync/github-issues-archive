  "body": "## Issue\r\n\r\nCurrently, the debugger's `stepOut` function has a special case where it checks if you're on a multiline source range and if so does `stepOver` instead.  It's not entirely clear what this was intended to accomplish (do you remember, @gnidan?), but it doesn't seem to work as `stepOver` should.\r\n\r\nThe intent may have been that when you're on a function declaration node or contract declaration node, you step over it rather than into it.  But due to the way `stepOver` works, you end up stepping into it anyway.  Moreover, this also means that if you happen to be on a multiline source range within a function body, you don't exit the function as you should.\r\n\r\nSo, it's likely that this special case should be removed.  However, removing this special case raises the possibility that issues like #4502 will arise, so care must be taken to ensure that doesn't happen.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, perhaps there should be a special case here, and should happen instead is that `stepOver` should be altered to step over in such cases rather than in.  (Actually, probably that latter part should be done *regardless*!)  If so it's possible that such a special case might be better off checking the current node type, rather than if the source range is multiline.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n* Truffle version (`truffle version`): 5.4.25",
