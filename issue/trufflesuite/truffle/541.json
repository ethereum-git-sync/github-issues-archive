  "body": "- [x] I've asked for help in the [Truffle Gitter](http://gitter.im/Consensys/truffle) before filing this issue.\r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\n## Issue\r\n\r\nIf a truffle project imports a file containing only abstract contracts (used as interfaces in other contracts ... let's call it Interfaces.sol), several issues occur:\r\n\r\n1) Truffle always seems to need to recompile Interfaces.sol regardless of whether changes have been made.\r\n2) Truffle often throws the error \"The contract code couldn't be stored, please check your gas amount\" unless I make sure to `rm -rf build` and `truffle migrate --network blah --reset`.  Sometimes it still fails when I follow this procedure, but the failures seem to be less frequent.\r\n3) If Truffle _does_ successfully deploy, it still sometimes fails to add the deployed addresses to the JSON contract artifacts (the `address` key is missing entirely).\r\n\r\nWhen I move the abstract contracts into the .sol file that refers to them, and remove Interfaces.sol entirely, all of the deployment issues seem to disappear.\r\n\r\nIt's worth mentioning that none of my migration scripts attempt to deploy the abstract contracts — they're just used as state variables in other contracts.  So this isn't a dupe of #476.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nReproducing this issue can be difficult, as it seems to be sort of non-deterministic.  However, I have a setup like the following:\r\n\r\nInterfaces.sol\r\n```\r\ncontract Shape {\r\n    function numSides() returns (uint);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMyContract.sol\r\n```\r\nimport \"./Interfaces.sol\";\r\n\r\ncontract MyContract {\r\n    Shape shape;\r\n\r\n    function setShape(address _shape) {\r\n        shape = Shape(_shape);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nShape.sol\r\n```\r\ncontract Shape {\r\n    function numSide() returns (uint) {\r\n        return 123;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn order to rectify the issue, I can simply move the abstract contract version of `Shape` into MyContract.sol, while leaving the real `Shape` in Shape.sol.  So maybe it's an issue where identically-named contract artifacts are overwriting one another, even though one of them is never deployed (nor even deployable)?\r\n\r\nThis doesn't seem like intended behavior, and isn't ideal for various use cases.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nTruffle should consistently deploy the contracts without an error.  Also, it shouldn't require a `rm -rf build` and without requiring the `--reset` flag for `truffle migrate` (although to be fair, these techniques only mitigated the problem rather than eliminating it).\r\n\r\nOr at the very least, it should fail the same way every time, and preferably should give a helpful error message.\r\n\r\n## Actual Results\r\n\r\n`truffle migrate` frequently throws the error \"The contract code couldn't be stored, please check your gas amount\".  Sometimes it even does so _after_ deploying the contract that requires the interfaces (so to use the above example, it deploys MyContract without an error, then attempts to deploy Shape, and dies with the \"check your gas\" error).\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n* Operating System: macOS Sierra 10.12.5 (although this is reproducible when running against a Dockerized Ubuntu geth)\r\n* Truffle version: 3.4.8\r\n* Ethereum client: geth 1.6.6-stable-10a45cb5\r\n* node version: 8.1.3\r\n* npm version: 5.0.3\r\n",
