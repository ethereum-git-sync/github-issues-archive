    "body": "So, I'm a little confused what the situation is here, exactly.  Let me try to get this straight.\r\n\r\nSo, you ran a transaction that attempted to create a contract, but the creation was reverted.  Yes?  And then you tried to debug... some transaction. I'm a little unclear here -- was the transaction that you were trying to debug the same transaction that attempted to create the contract?  Or was it a different transaction that attempted to call into that contract?\r\n\r\nI also don't know what you mean when you say you \"can't debug\".  What precisely is happening that you don't think should be happening?  You've displayed the \"UNKNOWN\" message, but what actually goes wrong during debugging?  Do you encounter an error message?  Is that part of the transaction simply skipped over?  I'm not very clear on just what the undesired behavior is here.\r\n\r\nThanks!",

    "body": "Yes, I think I see.  But to be clear, the transaction then calls into contract B after creating it, and it's not the creation itself that caused the revert?  That step is important. :)\r\n\r\nLike, if that is what's going on -- as I suspect -- then, OK, I'm going to have to write some more code to keep track of contract code, because I don't have code to handle that case.  (I guess I'll have to do that regardless, anyway, now that I've realized the issue!)  In that case the issue is due to us just failing to keep track of certain information.\r\n\r\nWhereas if it's the creation that's causing the reversion, then I can't think of any reason you'd get the above message, and I have to go bug-hunting.\r\n\r\nI'm assuming probably though it's the first case and I have my work cut out for me...\r\n\r\nThanks again!",
