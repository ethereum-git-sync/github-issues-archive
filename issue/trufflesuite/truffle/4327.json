  "body": "## Issue\r\n\r\nOrdinarily, in Truffle, it is possible to set per-network configuration options in one's Truffle config.  However, as best I can tell, there is no way to do this for the ephemeral networks created by Truffle Test.  This issue has come up twice recently in other discussions (#3780, #4319) so I'm making an issue for it.\r\n\r\nThere are actually two problems here.  One of them, the easier one, I've split off as #4335.  So what's the harder one?  Let's look at the [current behavior](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/blob/develop/packages/core/lib/commands/test/index.js#L174).  Currently (a few lines above where I linked), if no network is specified, it will default to `\"development\"` or `\"test\"` (depending on if a config for `\"development\"` has been defined), and then (at the point where I linked), it will start up an internal Ganache (ordinarily called `\"test\"`) precisely if... no config is defined for the current network (whether explicitly selected or defaulted to).\r\n\r\nThis makes it impossible to configure this internal network.  A user might think, oh, well, the internal network is called `\"test\"`, so to configure it I'll add a config for the network `\"test\"`.  But as soon as they do so, Truffle will now say, oh, well since you have a config for `\"test\"`, you must have been intending to connect to some external network called `\"test\"`, and we won't start up Ganache for you.  That's not what the user wanted!  And people have been asking about this.  But right now there is no way to configure that internal network without Truffle concluding that want an external network instead.\r\n\r\nIt's not entirely clear what the solution to this is (without breaking backwards compatibility).  If we could break backwards compatibility, I'd just say that we should always start up a Ganache when the current network is `\"test\"`, regardless of whether a config exists or not, but I expect that would probably break what a lot of people are doing.  So, some other solution should be found to avoid breaking changes.  Perhaps we could try connecting to the network, and starting up Ganache if it doesn't exist?  Or there could be an option one could pass to force Truffle Test to start Ganache?  (It's annoying, though, because the people asking about this are likely just running `truffle test` and don't want to have to deal with additional options.  That said, that hasn't always been true of the people who have about this, so maybe I'm just wrong about that.)  Or maybe we could just set aside a new network name for the internal test network, like `\"test-internal\"` or something, and we could change it to be called that instead of `\"test\"`, since changing the name of the internal test network shouldn't break anything?  That might be the simplest solution, actually.\r\n\r\nAnyway, one way or another we should come up with a fix for this.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n* Truffle version (`truffle version`): 5.4.11",

    "body": "@cds-amal \r\n\r\nNot quite. I'm curious to see how i can get `truffle test` to default to its own ganache instant that it spins up. If I have a \"networks\" block defined in the config, it will force me to determine a network and uses the \"development\". If I do not have a \"networks\" block defined, running `truffle test` will work by using its own ganache instance i've read. Regardless of how it does it (let's not focus if i understood how this happens), it will run the tests. How do I get it to do this behavior and use its own test blockchain, instead of tryign to use a network i've defined in the config.",
