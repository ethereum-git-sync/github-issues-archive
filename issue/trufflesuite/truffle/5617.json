    "body": "Hi!  Jumping in here to clarify a bit what I'm pretty sure is going on here.\r\n\r\nThe lack of contracts in the original project is not a problem.  Truffle can compile a project with no contracts in it just fine (if you create an empty project and compile there should be no problem).\r\n\r\nWhat is going wrong, then?  Well, one thing I notice is that you're trying to require by source name, rather than contract name; that's not how `artifacts.require` works, you simply supply the contract name, e.g. `artifacts.require(\"TimelockController\")`; you shouldn't be supplying a path.\r\n\r\nHowever, even with that fixed, I don't think this would work.  The core problem, it seems to me, is that you're trying to `artifacts.require` an NPM dependency that was never actually imported in any contract.  In order to do `artifacts.require`, there have to be artifacts in the build directory, which means that the contracts being required have to have been compiled.  However, Truffle only compiles NPM dependencies if they're actually imported here.  So, in this case, these contracts won't get compiled and so won't have artifacts to require.\r\n\r\nIt's not obvious to me what we can do about this.  Changing Truffle to compile dependencies regardless of whether they're imported is not something I'm sure we can reasonably do.  Maybe we can error better here?  I'm not sure how we would detect this situation, though.\r\n\r\nAs for what I would recommend for you to do, I would suggest that instead of creating a Truffle project that imports these contracts, you simply include these contracts directly in your Truffle project (or fork the repo they're from if it's a Truffle project).",

    "body": "Hi @haltman-at,\r\n\r\nUnless this has changed recently, Truffle always used to support importing contract artifacts directly from `node_modules` without requiring them to be compiled and included in the `build/` directory. See e.g. https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/issues/1791 for context.\r\n\r\nThis is a very useful feature to have, as it is common to want to deploy contracts you didn't write yourself. For example, in my case I want to deploy the ERC20PresetFixedSupply in order to have an ERC20 contract to use in the tests. None of my contract code needs to depend on ERC20PresetFixedSupply's source code, as it is accessed using the generic IERC20 interface. I also want to deploy the TimelockController, which again none of my contract code needs to know about.\r\n\r\nIn any case, it works when including just _one_ contract from `node_modules`, but fails in a completely non-obvious way when including more than one. Which definitely seems like a bug to me.",
