Going to leave this on this repo though.)  I think that was added prematurely; we had intended to make in-test debugging work with calls, but actually doing this ran into problems and it was never done.  Somehow that made it into the documentation anyway; I hadn't noticed that.  Sorry about that.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, you can work around this limitation by forcing the call to be a transaction instead.  You can use `instance.getValue.sendTransaction()` to force a transaction, and then you'll be able to debug that.\r\n\r\nI'll go update the documentation to reflect this.  Again, sorry about the confusion.  It's also possible we need to produce a better error message if someone does attempt to use `debug` with a call...",
