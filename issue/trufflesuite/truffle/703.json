Answer \"y\" to the \"Terminate batch job (Y/N)?\" prompt.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nIt should clean the .node-xmlhttprequest-sync-XXXX when answering \"y\" to the prompt.\r\n\r\n## Actual Results\r\n\r\nSome .node-xmlhttprequest-sync-XXXX files stay in the directory and are never cleaned.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n* Operating System: Windows.\r\n* Truffle version: 4.0.1\r\n* Ethereum client: testrpc\r\n* node version: 9.2.0\r\n* npm version: 5.5.1\r\n",
