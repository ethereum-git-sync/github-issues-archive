Note that it only alters line-based breakpoints; if you manually advance onto a normally-skipped node with `;`, and then place a node-based breakpoint with a bare `b`, sorry, that one's not getting adjusted (at least not as the PR is currently written).  But I don't expect that to come up too often, so I thought it was OK to ignore that case.",
