  "body": "We need an official data tracking policy for our google analytics data. I took this excerpt from the release in which we added the analytics tracking, and I propose we add dashboard instructions, add this to our main Truffle readme,  and link to it in the Dashboard analytics dialog: \r\n\r\n```\r\nOpt-in Analytics\r\nTo try and obtain more information about how we can improve Truffle, we have added an optional analytics feature. By default it is turned off but if you enable it, the Truffle developers will receive anonymous information about your version number, the commands you run, and whether commands succeed or fail.\r\n\r\nWe don't use this anonymous information for anything other than to find out how we can make Truffle better and have also ensured that it doesn't make for a slower experience by sending this information in a background process.\r\n\r\nTo turn this feature on you can run:\r\n\r\ntruffle config --enable-analytics\r\n\r\nIf you want to turn the analytics off you can run:\r\n\r\ntruffle config --disable-analytics\r\n\r\nP.S. feel free to go take a peek at the two places in the code where metrics are gathered: [when running a command](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/blob/next/packages/truffle-core/lib/command.js#L114-L118) and [to report version and errors](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/blob/next/packages/truffle-core/cli.js). If you go ahead and do a good ol' [GitHub search for the word analytics](https://github.com/search?q=analytics+repo%3Atrufflesuite%2Ftruffle&type=Code) you can verify that these are the only places this code gets invoked. ðŸŽ‰\r\n```",
