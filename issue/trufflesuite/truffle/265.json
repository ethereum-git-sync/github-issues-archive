    "body": "In general I see this as a good feature. However, I'd guess you want this feature so you can bump the version up to solidity 0.4.x, right? If so, this solution will likely cause more problems than it solves.\n\nThe main reason Truffle hasn't been bumped up to version 0.4.x already is because of the introduction of breaking changes: Specifically the `pragma` statement. This is an issue because Truffle uses a library called [solidity-parser](https://github.com/ConsenSys/solidity-parser) in order to perform some preprocessing, and solidity-parser needs to be upgraded to support the `pragma` statement before you can use 0.4.x with Truffle. If you were to use the proposed feature to upgrade the version to 0.4.x, Truffle will error before compilation ever occurs.\n\nWhere this feature could be very useful is downgrading the compiler version, or setting a specific compiler version for testing purposes (aka, testing the compiler) or locking your project into a specific version. But it won't be able to go forward past the latest version Truffle supports (0.3.5 in this case). If we implement this feature, we need to ensure we don't allow users to go higher than the latest version supported as that will cause unexpected errors.\n\nTo better understand your use case, why do you want to specify the version?\n",

    "body": "Actually, the main reason is not only 0.4.x but exactly what you mentioned about the downgrading.\n\nCompilers do not behave the same, so while it is advised using the latest, sometimes, people prefer to use a given (older) version.\n\nThe 0.4.x example you mention is a good one, we _should_ use 0.4.x, but for now we don´t (whatever the reasons are).\n\nI think it would be fair to have such feature, and as you suggest, lock it down, at least for now, to a given set of versions (ie everything < 0.4.x)\n\nTo avoid any extra issue reports, I would specifically point to this ticket since you now nicely explained why 0.4.x cannot yet be working :)\n",
