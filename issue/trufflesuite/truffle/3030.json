  "body": "## Issue\r\n\r\nThe reason we haven't been getting coverage reports in some time is because, well, the coverage build is broken, and has been for quite a while.  The errors don't seem to be inconsistent; they happen every time and appear to reflect some sort of real problem. \r\n\r\n## Actual Results\r\n\r\nFor instance, the most recent `develop` coverage build failed as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSome packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have\r\nrequested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable\r\ndistribution that some required packages have not yet been created\r\nor been moved out of Incoming.\r\nThe following information may help to resolve the situation:\r\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\r\n solc : Depends: libc6 (>= 2.29) but 2.23-0ubuntu11 is to be installed\r\n        Depends: libgcc-s1 (>= 3.0) but it is not installable\r\n        Depends: libstdc++6 (>= 9) but 5.4.0-6ubuntu1~16.04.11 is to be installed\r\nE: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.\r\nerror Command failed with exit code 100.\r\ninfo Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/run for documentation about this command.\r\nThe command \"yarn ci\" exited with 100.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd, well, this is the same error I always seem to see when I look at why coverage builds failed.  So, there seems to be a real problem here.",
