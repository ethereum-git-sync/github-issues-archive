  "body": "Currently the docs state you can \"easily swap\" TestRPC for `geth` or `eth`:\n\n> Though we suggest you use the TestRPC during development, you can easily swap it out for geth or eth and re-run your tests without changing a single line of code.\n\nWhile this is technically true, in practice it is not so easy, and if you count the command-line voodoo that's required in a separate terminal as \"a single line of code\", then this claim is misleading at best.\n\nThe developer must be aware of the ins and outs of `geth` to be able to do this, and from my understanding of Embark it is by no means trivial to setup `geth` in a fake dev mode.\n\nIdeally, you'd be able to do the following:\n\n```\ntruffle serve --geth\n```\n\nAnd `tuffle`, like Embark, would setup and run geth for you. Right now, however, the developer must know how to run `geth` themselves in a way that does not put their account balances at risk.\n\nIf instead, you could just specify the EVM source via `truffle serve --testrpc` (or something like that), and have truffle do all the work of setting everything up safely and cleaning up after itself when it's done, then development would be so much simpler, safer, and smoother.\n",

Why trust Truffle to do it right? \n\nThat said, I'm going to close this as as of Embark 1.0.2 Truffle and Embark no longer have philosophical differences, and will eventually merge efforts in the long run.
