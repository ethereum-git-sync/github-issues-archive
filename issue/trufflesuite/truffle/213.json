However i did get a work around for it. \n\n\"Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, lstat 'D:\\truffletest\\build\\contracts'\n    at Error (native)\"\n_This issue was resolved by creating a contracts folder on the given path._\n## Now when i run **truffle build**, it gives me this error\n\nTruffle v2.0.4 - a development framework for Ethereum\n\nUsage: truffle [command] [options]\n\nCommands:\n\n  build           => Build development version of app\n  compile         => Compile contracts\n  console         => Run a console with deployed contracts instantiated and available (REPL)\n  create:contract => Create a basic contract\n  create:test     => Create a basic test\n  exec            => Execute a JS file within truffle environment\n  init            => Initialize new Ethereum project, including example contracts and tests\n  list            => List all available tasks\n  migrate         => Run migrations\n  networks        => Show addresses for deployed contracts on each network\n  serve           => Serve app on localhost and rebuild changes as needed\n  test            => Run tests\n  version         => Show version number and exit\n  watch           => Watch filesystem for changes and rebuild the project automatically\n## Any help guys???\n",
