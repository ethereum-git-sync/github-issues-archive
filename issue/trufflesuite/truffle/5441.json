  "body": "## Issue\r\n\r\nWhen Truffle compiles Solidity, it merges the settings from the Truffle Config into some default settings, those default settings being:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nsettings: {\r\n  optimizer: {\r\n    enabled: false\r\n    runs: 200\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSeems harmless, right?  Well... turns out that on Solidity versions prior to 0.8.6, having `enabled` set to `false`, and having it absent entirely, had different results.  Having it set to `false`, as opposed to absent entirely, actually turned on some optimizations (though evidently not much).\r\n\r\nThis poses a problem when it comes to contract verification; see discussion on [this Blockscout issue](https://github.com/blockscout/blockscout/issues/5748).  Unfortunately I don't think we can just get rid of this default without potentially breaking things.  But we can perhaps discard it in `fetch-and-compile` specifically.  However if we do so, we'll have to update the Etherscan fetcher (and possibly the Sourcify fetcher?) per the linked discussion (like, the Etherscan fetcher will have to convert `enabled` being absent to it being `false`; the `runs: 200` default may also be necessary).\r\n\r\nAll of this is basically OK for now, but it will need to be solved if we want to do something about #4779.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n* Truffle version (`truffle version`): 5.5.26",
