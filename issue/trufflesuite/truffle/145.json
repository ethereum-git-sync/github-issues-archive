  "body": "Creating a contract where a suspected transation OOG error occurs but is never thrown and transaction never rolled back.\nIn our case this results in a bytes32 -> address mapping being populated with an odd Contract address of format [0x74696f6e5f544553540000000000000000000000] which appears to be formed from the post 8 chars of the byte32 key with which we try to create it instead of the contract address itself. Also no OOG error is thrown.\nCode sample here:\nhttps://github.com/elenadimitrova/ContractFactory\n",

We can override this by raising the gas value in truffle.json \"gas\": 4000000 (we went with just under homestead limit)\n\ntestrpc 2.0.7 now has the Homestead gas limit which also helps\n",
