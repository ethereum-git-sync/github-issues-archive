The installation done and this is the last few lines of the result on PowerShell:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm ERR! code 1\r\nnpm ERR! path C:\\Users\\lenovo\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\node_modules\\truffle\\node_modules\\bufferutil\r\nnpm ERR! command failed\r\nnpm ERR! command C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\cmd.exe /d /s /c node-gyp-build\r\nnpm ERR!

    "body": "### **The cause of the problem:**\r\n\r\n**1)** As I said in the question, `truffle` folder doesn't exist in the both directories mentioned by the errors:\r\n\r\n`C:\\Users\\lenovo\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\node_modules\\truffle\\node_modules\\bufferutil`\r\n\r\nAnd\r\n\r\n`C:\\Users\\lenovo\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\node_modules\\truffle\\build\\cli.bundled.js`\r\n\r\nAnd the installation is incomplete. Because we shouldn't install truffle by the latest version of npm, we should install it by version 6 of npm.\r\n\r\n**2)** There is an error in the last few lines of installation process (There is in the question):\r\n\r\n`npm ERR! command C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\cmd.exe /d /s /c node-gyp-build`\r\n\r\nThat says `node-gyp-build` module doesn't work or doesn't exist. [node-gyp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-gyp) is a cross-platform command-line tool written in Node.js for compiling native addon modules for Node.js. [node-gyp-build](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-gyp-build) is a build tool and bindings loader for `node-gyp` that supports prebuilds. It seems the system that is installing truffle lacks the both them.\r\n\r\n### **Solution**:\r\n\r\n1. Uninstall Truffle: `npm uninstall -g truffle`.\r\n2. Delete all Truffle's files and folders. Some directories like `C:\\Users\\lenovo\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm`, `C:\\Users\\lenovo\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\node_modules`, `C:\\Users\\lenovo\\AppData\\Roaming` and so on, may have Truffle's files and folders.\r\n3. Delete all files associated to `node-gyp` and `node-gyp-build` if you have some of them. Some directory like `C:\\Users\\lenovo\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm` may have them.\r\n4. Delete node_modules folder from `C:\\Users\\lenovo\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm`.\r\n5. Change the version of npm to 6: `npm install -g npm@6`.\r\n6. Install node-gyp: `npm install -g node-gyp`.\r\n7. Install node-gyp-build: `npm install -g node-gyp-build`.\r\n8. Install canvas: `npm install -g canvas`.\r\n9. Install Solidity compiler: `npm install -g solc`.\r\n10. Install Truffle: `npm install -g truffle`.\r\n11. Change the version of npm to the latest: `npm install -g npm@latest`.",
