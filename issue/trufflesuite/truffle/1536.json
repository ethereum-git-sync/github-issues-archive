We are also now webpacking hdwallet-provider so that most dependencies are even more locked, cause they make it into the bundle completely.\r\n\r\nI think the only work left here is to pin the dependencies.",

I don't think yarn.lock on the root of the monorepo is relevant for this purpose.\r\n\r\nWould you happen to know exactly how those 2 package managers pull dependencies of dependencies? I'd expect it to obey a package-lock.json if that is present in the package ðŸ¤” ",
