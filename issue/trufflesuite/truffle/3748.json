  "body": "## Issue\r\n\r\nRight now, in Truffle DB, if you have a project, you can ask for all contracts that are current in the project, and then ask for all compilations for those, but you'd have to do some deduplication afterward.  You should be able to directly get compilations-containing-a-current-contract for a given project.\r\n\r\nThis probably needs to be carefully documented, as it's not \"current compilations\" per se, since that doesn't actually make sense.  For instance, we could have contracts `A` and `B`, where the current version of `A` belongs to a compilation containing an *older* version of `B`.  Is that compilation a \"current\" compilation?  It contains the current version of `A`, but an outdated version of `B`!  So it's hard to say.  But, I want to be able to get all compilations containing a current contract.  In a direct manner, I mean, that doesn't require me to deduplicate or make multiple queries.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n* Truffle version (`truffle version`): 5.1.63",
