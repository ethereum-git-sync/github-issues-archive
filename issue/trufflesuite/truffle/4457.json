    "body": "OK, I can reproduce the issue.  Thanks for bringing this up.  It definitely does seem that, in this instance, a call is failing with insufficient value.  Moreover, this is happening when using an external service, not Ganache, so this isn't a Ganache issue.  As such, it does look like there is something to be done here.\r\n\r\nThe approach taken in your PR #4397 is one possibility (although the PR itself will have to be fixed; as currently written it does nothing).  But I think we should make sure we understand the exact problem a bit better before taking any action.\r\n\r\nLike -- why, exactly, is Matic refusing the transaction?  Is this truly a matter of ether in the sending account being insufficient, or is it a matter of the specified gas being insufficient?  Of course no amount of gas is explicitly being specified in this case, ~~so it should be determined automatically via a gas estimate but it something causing that to go wrong in this case?~~  (@fainashalts?)  (Edit: Oops, that doesn't apply to calls, does it?  Only to transactions.  So I guess it's up to the *client*, then, fif I understand correctly...?)  There are a number of steps in the chain here (Truffle Exec -> Truffle Contract -> HDWalletProvider -> Web3 -> the actual raw requests that are issued -> Matic), and it's not obvious to me which step is truly the problem.\r\n\r\nSo, while the approach you took in #4397 is (once fixed) certainly one possibility, I think we need to investigate and make sure we understand the problem a bit better before merging it.\r\n\r\n(Note: I've edited this comment to fix a few mistakes.)",

That's why in case of `send`, the gas price can still be set by the user.",
