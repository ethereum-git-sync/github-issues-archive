    "body": "Is it possible that the warnings are correct? You might have multiple libraries that define contracts of those names. \r\n\r\nThose messages were added a couple of patches ago and you will most likely experience the same problem as you will in 5.1.46. Truffle currently keeps track of contracts by name and each contract name must be unique. We will change this at some point in the future as this is not the best way to do this. If you have multiple contracts of the same name, one will probably clobber the other and result in unpredictable behavior that is not desired.",

    "body": "@eggplantzzz ok, found the duplication. I have one big ass flattened .sol file where multiple contract names are defined, it is an old file from another project that also inherited from Openzeppelin. TIL that truffle takes all the contracts in the file and compiles them separately.\r\n\r\nClosing this, thank you!",
