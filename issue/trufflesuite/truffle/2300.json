  "body": "## Issue\r\n\r\nTruffle has an engineering process, but it's not really visible to the community. Fortunately, most of the artifacts of the engineering process are already publicly available, except that they are behind a ZenHub login-wall.\r\n\r\nSince it's a pretty minor barrier to entry, we should probably mention this! Really, we ought to document our processes! Maybe in the README? Or maybe we start using the [repo's wiki](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/wiki).\r\n\r\nNot sure everything this should include, but at the very least, it'd be nice if we indicated:\r\n- an overview of our processes around ticket processing / releasing\r\n- a meta-note about how our process is currently rather light, but we keep an ongoing conversation to make process changes as utility suggests\r\n- and that you can get a much better view of the state Truffle's development if you install the [ZenHub extension](https://www.zenhub.com/extension) or visit the [Truffle Dev board on app.zenhub.com](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/truffle-dev-5c67177dfd28fb7faae0855e/board) directly\r\n\r\nEventually, it'd be nice if this document/section included a breakdown of details... what labels mean, and so on, but that would likely take further refinement. It'd just be nice to start with _something_ that shows \"hey, we're a software project and we do our work using these techniques/tools! see what we see!\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Seek project process info / current state.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n2. Find project process info / current state.\r\n\r\n## Actual Results\r\n\r\n2. Find 230 open issues and 26 open PRs.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n(h/t @wbt... I haven't forgotten you)",
