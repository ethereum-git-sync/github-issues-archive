  "body": "It's not very clear that truffle uses its own default `gasPrice` value when connecting to an external network (like a running `ganache-cli` node). @haltman-at recently opened https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-core/issues/391 because it appears as though ganache-cli doesn't respect a user-configured `gasPrice` value in its transactions (ganache-cli and truffle use the same default `gasPrice` value).\r\n\r\nI've thought of two alternatives to using a default value within Truffle:\r\n\r\n1. call `eth_gasPrice` on initialization. Unclear if this is reliable for real-world transactions.\r\n2. don't specify a gasPrice in unsigned transactions at all. At least in ganache's case, this will cause the transaction to inherit ganache's default `gasPrice`.\r\n\r\nAnd just in case it wasn't clear: setting `gasPrice` in the network's truffle-config _does_ work as expected.",
