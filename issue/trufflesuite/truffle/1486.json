  "body": "- [ ] I've asked for help in the [Truffle Gitter](http://gitter.im/Consensys/truffle) before filing this issue.\r\n\r\nI did not ask for help on Truffle because this is a feature request.\r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\nCurrently you turn the `solc` optimizer on by adding a top-level section to your _truffle.js_ file like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n  solc: {\r\n    optimizer: {\r\n      enabled: true,\r\n      runs: 200\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nI would like to be able enable/disable the `solc` optimizer on a per-network basis.  I want it off for Ganache because I need the Truffle debugger for my work and the debugger doesn't work with optimized contract code currently.  However, I need the optimizer to deploy to Rinkeby, Main Net, etc. or I get out-of-gas errors.",
