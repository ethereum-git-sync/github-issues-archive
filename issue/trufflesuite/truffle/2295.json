  "body": "## Issue\r\n\r\nThis is a followup to #2292 and #2293.\r\n\r\nOrdinary methods have `sendTransaction`, `call`, `estimateGas`, and `request`, although `request` doesn't currently work.\r\n\r\n`Contract.new`, however, only has `sendTransaction` (which it doesn't have explicitly; you can do `Contract.new()`, but not `Contract.new.sendTransaction()`), and `estimateGas`.\r\n\r\nI would like to suggest:\r\n\r\n1. `Contract.new.sendTransaction` be added as an alias of `Contract.new`\r\n\r\n2. `Contract.new.request` be added, with the new functionality I describe in #2293 (although possibly under a different name, since I suggest possibly changing the name)\r\n\r\n3. Not now but perhaps in the future there could also be `Contract.new.call`.  I would not suggest adding this now because, well... what would it return?  See #2292; you might expect it to return a contract object, but it can't, because no contract is actually created.  Moreover, what would the return value be decoded with?  I would suggest not implementing this for now (but I think it might be doable in the future).",
