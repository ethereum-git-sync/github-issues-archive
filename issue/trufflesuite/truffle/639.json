    "body": "I am fairly new to solidity, but the `Assert` contract only gives you helper functions to validate specific types that are common. A struct is a plain-ol-data construct, the definition of which is left to the developer. Therefore, it would not make sense to have common helper functions for custom structures. \r\n\r\nWhat is it that you are trying to validate? Your contract will typically have accessors which are public to fetch various pieces of your structure - you would call those functions, fetch the underlying types and `Assert` (for example) against those. Does that make sense?",
