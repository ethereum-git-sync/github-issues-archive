I have some preliminary questions:\r\n\r\n+ Do you have any advice about how we might organize our docs so that translations are easily accessible and maintainable?\r\n+ The docs will always be a work in progress.

    "body": "@cgewecke I am in favor of anything that increases the inclusiveness of our community! So I'm a fan of internationalization of our documentation (or i18n of our d13n for short ðŸ˜„).\r\n\r\nHowever, maintenance and drift are certainly concerns. We'd be dependent on the wider community (and folks like you @dbucci24!) to keep the documentation up to date. So it's possible that the project might stall. Also, keeping our own English documentation up-to-date is pretty much a full-time task. It would be a shame if the information in one language didn't match that in the other.\r\n\r\nTo your points @lazaridiscom , I don't see us having much bandwidth to actively assist with this at the moment, though we're certainly in support. And our current documentation framework (Metalsmith) doesn't really help us much in this domain. It's an argument for something like Sphinx/Transifex, for sure.\r\n\r\nFor now, I think in the short term, I'd prefer to see a proof of concept on a different site, and we could certainly link to it in our official documentation. In the longer-term, we could build a better system and bring it under the \"official\" label.\r\n\r\nOne last thing, the actual source code for our documentation is here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/trufflesuite/trufflesuite.com/tree/master/public/docs\r\n\r\nThe link listed previously is for the built (HTML) site.\r\n\r\nIf anyone would like to volunteer at a first pass, that would be great!",
