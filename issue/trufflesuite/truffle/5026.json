  "body": "- [ ] I've [opened a support ticket](https://trufflesuite.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) before filing this issue.\r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\n## Issue\r\n\r\nFor every contract deployed by truffle, a new provider appears to be instantiated. This is a memory leak but it all results in a chattier application with unnecessary calls the the JSON RPC endpoint. \r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create a new truffle project (MetaCoin works)\r\n2. Pull down `ganache` (not required but helps illustrate the point)\r\n3. Change \r\n`logging-options.ts L102  log: config.quiet ? () => {} : console.count`\r\n4. In your migrations, Copy/Paste the deploy line so you are deploying multiple times:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6285466/163443497-7ad985fa-6a30-4a6b-a612-d4b2f9608fce.png)\r\n5. Start a local ganache from cli with 8s block mining interval\r\n6. define and deploy to the local ganache network\r\n\r\nTested against truffle stable and the `provider-changes` branch, confirmed on both. Logged output:\r\n\r\nLogs on stable: https://gist.github.com/tenthirtyone/e9e30ec9d6a5520e7ed2d91a15908aee\r\nLogs on provider-change: https://gist.github.com/tenthirtyone/a0d1d232984d4b8662012edda3d3bdec\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe number of JSON RPC endpoint calls between contract deploys should be consistent. \r\n\r\n## Actual Results\r\n\r\nJSON RPC calls increase linearly for each contract deployed. \r\n\r\nTruffle Stable RPC call growth per contract deployed:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6285466/163443893-4914466b-fde5-402f-a016-2088363a2e31.png)\r\n\r\n`provider-changes` RPC call growth per contract deployed:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6285466/163443935-7957d997-0f43-4ab5-b85d-61fc44232a8e.png)\r\n\r\nI measured the number of `eth_getBlockByNumber` calls made between every contract deployment\r\n\r\nE.g.\r\nRPC calls made between contract 1 & contract 2 and a constant block mine interval of 8s: 45\r\nRPC calls made between contract 2 & contract 3 and a constant block mine interval of 8s: 70\r\nRPC calls made between contract 3 & contract 4 and...: 94\r\n\r\nThe change is consistently at 24.\r\n\r\nThis contributes to why users experience the polling timeout and soft caps us on the number of contracts we can deploy per migration file. I have not run this test against multiple migration files. \r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n* Operating System: UBUNTU\r\n* Ethereum client:\r\n* Truffle version (`truffle version`): 5.5.3\r\n* node version (`node --version`): 12.22.7\r\n* npm version (`npm --version`): \r\n",
