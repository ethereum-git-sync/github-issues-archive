  "body": "# Issue\r\n\r\nIf ganache is run with a network ID of 69420 I get the error \"TypeError: Cannot read property 'gasUsed' of null\".\r\n\r\nIt has to be 69420. Not 69419, or 69421. \r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nClone this https://github.com/ConsenSys-Academy/truffle-test-debugging\r\n\r\nStart ganache- `ganache-cli -l 10000000 --networkId 69420`\r\nIn a different  terminal, navigate to project-dir\r\n`truffle test`\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nI expect the tests to pass\r\n\r\n## Actual Results\r\n\r\nI get the error \"TypeError: Cannot read property 'gasUsed' of null\".\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n* Operating System: OS Catalina\r\n* Ethereum client: Ganache CLI v6.7.0\r\n* Truffle version (`truffle version`): Truffle v5.1.3\r\n* node version (`node --version`): v10.17.0\r\n* npm version (`npm --version`): 6.13.1\r\n\r\nI think we can all agree this problem is of great importance and needs all of Truffle's top men on it asap. Do you want to live in a world where we are not free to set out network Ids to 69420? I didn't think so.",
