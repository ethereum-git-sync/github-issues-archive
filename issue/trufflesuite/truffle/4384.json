  "body": "## Background\r\n\r\nBasics:\r\n- [abi-to-sol](https://www.npmjs.com/package/abi-to-sol) is a package that takes ABI JSON as input and produces Solidity code that compiles to that ABI JSON. It allows you to specify a Solidity version range, and will produce output that is compatible with that specified range.\r\n- Truffle provides \"experimental\" support for making this super easy: you can have `.abi.json` files in your `contracts/` directory, import them in Solidity like `import \"./Uniswap.abi.json\";`, and it will be as-if you imported `interface Uniswap` with all the functions, etc., defined by that ABI.\r\n\r\nNow, my [recent attempt to upgrade abi-to-sol](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/pull/4365) fails CI because later versions of this dependency produce output that is compatible with only a narrow range of Solidity versions (default `>=0.7.0 <0.9.0`). Previously, this wasn't a problem our current version of that dependency does not change its output syntax at all, and the pragma it produced was overly broad.\r\n\r\nabi-to-sol has gotten a lot more robust, in that it now produces valid Solidity output much, much more reliably, and so we could probably make this Truffle feature not-so-experimental, if only we could upgrade.\r\n\r\nFor the Truffle feature, we invoke abi-to-sol during `resolver.resolve()`, which in turn happens via the profiler. If the user imports a `.abi.json` file in their Solidity code, `resolver.resolve()` will recognize the file extension, read the corresponding ABI JSON from disk, and then call abi-to-sol toÂ produce a Solidity source instead of this raw JSON\r\n\r\nIdeally, when the user does this, the produced Solidity source should match whatever pragma it was imported by, and abi-to-sol output should be compatible with this pragma. So if you're in a file that has `pragma solidity ^0.4.24 || 0.8.9;`, and you import an ABI JSON file, then Truffle should tell abi-to-sol that it needs to produce output that's also got `pragma solidity ^0.4.24 || 0.8.9;`.\r\n\r\n## Issue\r\n\r\nThe issue is: `resolver.resolve()` doesn't know anything about the language, compiler version, settings, etc. for which it's invoked! So there's no way for this functionality to specify the correct version to abi-to-sol (as per the background above), since it doesn't have this info at all.\r\n\r\nAnd since this codepath is run via the profiler, we also need the profiler to know this information. Right now, the profiler also does not get information of this kind.\r\n\r\nSo maybe there's a clean way for compile-solidity, etc. to invoke the profiler with this information? And then this information could get passed along to `resolver.resolve()`? Hopefully this is not just asking for a giant mess.\r\n\r\n(Side note: besides the background above, I imagine this information could be useful more generally - right now there's this weird `if` statement [here](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/blob/develop/packages/resolver/lib/resolver.ts#L61-L63) that seems to exist for Vyper only. Maybe if we solve this information access problem, we can clean this up?)\r\n",
