  "body": "**Environment** \r\n\r\nWindows 10 64 bit machine running Truffle v4.1.13, Solidity v0.4.24, Ganache v1.1.0, Node v8.11.3 and npm v5.6.0\r\n\r\nThe bug is caused by a Truffle project containing two contracts of the similar filename. The user must name the second contract the same as the first with one integer appended (e.g. Test.sol, Test1.sol).\r\nAfter migrating the projects' contracts to Ganache, running \"truffle test\" causes a test to only migrate the contract containing the integer in the filename and ignore migrating other contracts.\r\n\r\n**Steps to replicate:**\r\n\r\n1. git clone https://github.com/tcoulter/truffle-bug.git\r\n2. Start Ganache.\r\n3. Ensure the RPC server is running on the same port as in the truffle.js file.\r\n4. Open Terminal.\r\n5. Navigate to Truffle project directory.\r\n6. Run \"truffle migrate --network ganache\".\r\n7. After successfully migrating, run \"truffle test\".\r\n\r\nThe expected behavior is for all contracts to be compiled, but as you can see, only the contract with the integer appending the filename is being compiled.\r\n\r\nI tried testing multiple integers appended to the filename (ie. Logic123), differing case with the starting character (ie. logic1) and running \"truffle test\" without migration first. I also tried a non-natural integer (0) but the result was the same. I found that remigrating to Ganache, then running test again would compile all contracts except the one with the appended integer. This could be an issue with not specifically declaring the contract in the migration files as well as the compiler not expecting filenames to contain an integer after a string.",
