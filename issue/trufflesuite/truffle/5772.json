  "body": "## Issue\r\n\r\n(Opening this based on @benjamincburns's question on #5767.)  Supposedly web3 has now fixed their included types, so we shouldn't need `@types/web3` anymore.  This being web3, I don't know how much I trust that!  But we should see if it's possible to get rid of that dependency.\r\n\r\nNote there are also other places in the code where we've basically replicated some of web3's types ourself (e.g. I think there's some of that in decoder).  So we might also want to see about rooting those out if web3's types are now ok.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n* Truffle version (`truffle version`): 5.6.8",
