  "body": "## Issue\r\n\r\nWhen an error occurs during deployment, even if the error is *caught*, it may still go on to cause the overall deployment to error (as in, `await deployer.start()` will throw; in a migration, an error message will be printed).\r\n\r\nFor a repro example, one may use the same example as in #3066.\r\n\r\nThe obvious culprit is the line `self._error(e)` in [this file](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/blob/develop/packages/deployer/src/deferredchain.js).  However, removing this line causes test failures.  (Note that #5216 added `throw e` but did *not* remove `self._error(e)` and so did not fix this issue.)\r\n\r\nHopefully it is possible to fix this without a breaking change (see #5223, #3867); whether or not it is will remain to be seen.  I think it's worth a try though, I'm hopeful about this one.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n* Truffle version (`truffle version`): 5.5.18",

    "body": "OK, it turns out I don't know how to fix this after all.  I thought I could fix this by removing the line `self._error(e)` from `DeferredChain.prototype.then` (which actually allows one to delete that whole `catch` as unnecessary) and instead adding a `.catch(this._error)` in `DeferredChain.prototype.start` (line 42; actually I used a a second argument to `then`, rather than a `catch`, but you get the idea).  For whatever reason, this caused all sorts of hangs.  I dunno.  I guess I have no clue how to solve this after all!",
