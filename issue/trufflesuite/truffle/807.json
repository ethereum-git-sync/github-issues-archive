  "body": "---------------------------\r\n\r\n## Issue\r\n\r\nTruffle & EthPM seem to be designed to function similar to NPM. `truffle install <package>` installs the package to the `installed_contracts` directory, similar to how `npm install <package>` installs a NPM package to the `node_modules` directory.\r\n\r\nAlso, `truffle install` will install any dependencies from the `ethpm.json` file, similar to how `npm install` installs any dependencies from `package.json`.\r\n\r\nOne feature that seems missing is a command analogous to `npm install -s <package>`, which installs a package and adds the dependency to `package.json`.\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nA feature would be added to the Truffle CLI to allow installing new dependencies and saving the dependency to `ethpm.json`. Keeping in line with NPM, this could be added with a `-s` flag, so `truffle install -s <package>`.\r\n\r\nIf the `ethpm.json` file doesn't exist, a new file could be automatically generated.\r\n",
