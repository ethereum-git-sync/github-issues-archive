  "body": "- [ X ] I've asked for help in the [Truffle Gitter](http://gitter.im/Consensys/truffle) before filing this issue.\r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\n## Issue\r\n\r\nI get `Error: Invalid number of arguments to Solidity function`. Then I run `rm -rf build/contracts && truffle compile --all` and the issue is fixed.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nI'm working on this. I'll come up with a step to reproduce eventually, but for now this bug is pretty obtuse.\r\n\r\nI've noticed it gets caused by method signatures getting jacked up in the contract `json` after certain solidity refactors\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nNot having to manually clobber `build` to get working builds.\r\n\r\n## Actual Results\r\n\r\n`Error: Invalid number of arguments to Solidity function`\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n* Operating System: OS X Sierra\r\n* Truffle version: 4.0.1\r\n* Ethereum client: testrpc/ganache\r\n* node version: v8.6.0\r\n* npm version: 5.6.0\r\n",
