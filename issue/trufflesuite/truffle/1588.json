The readme at the link is outdated.  \r\n\r\nWith the time invested so far, I cannot tell exactly how much of the readme is outdated, but I can see that the Full Example links to the deprecated [truffle-artifactor repo](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle-artifactor), and the [current readme](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/tree/develop/packages/truffle-artifactor)'s backlink for the truffle-contract package goes to a similarly deprecated repo.\r\n\r\nWith the release of v5, it would be nice to review the readme files of these packages to see how much needs to be changed/updated, as the current state of documentation post-release is very confusing.  A user does not know what information is still accurate and what is deprecated with the new version, without extra hours of effort experimenting.\r\n\r\nThe note at the end that \"_This package is the result of breaking up EtherPudding into multiple modules. Tests currently reside within truffle-artifactor but will soon move here._\" seems out of date as well.\r\n\r\nRelated: Issue #1587 about version number mismatch. \r\n\r\n",
