    "body": "Hi @carbonnetwork. Support for `view` and `pure` is planned for the debugger but not currently possible. The debugger 'replays' transactions and at the moment it requires the tx hash to identify  the relevant execution. \r\n\r\nAnother trufflesuite engineer, @seesemichaelj has recently written a real-time debugger called Velma that supports these modifiers - you might be interested in checking it out [here](https://github.com/SeesePlusPlus/velma). \r\n\r\nAdditionally, you might be able to work around this in the `truffle-debugger` by temporarily removing the modifier, running the function as a transaction and seeing where it fails. You won't get a return value but you'll be able to step through the logic. ",
