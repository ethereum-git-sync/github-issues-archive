    "body": "Hey @guylando , iirc, `TestContract.at` looks for the TestContract code on the blockchain. In your scenario where `truffle develop` has been restarted, that code isn't on the chain (no chain persistence), but `truffle-contract` under the hood can use the `TestContract.json` available in your `build/contracts` folder to access the previously deployed instance. You'll notice if you delete the build folder and then try `await TestContract.deployed()` or `TestContract.address`, it won't work.",

    "body": "> Since the json has the contract code then why does truffle only take it partially for autocomplete and .deployed() and does not also put the code on the blockchain after restart?\r\n\r\nInteresting idea! I think the current plan is for `truffle develop` to be a \"throw-away\" chain that gets destroyed and refreshed on each restart, leaving it up to the user to migrate. However, I see how the current behavior of `contract.deployed()` is a bit confusing.\r\n\r\nAfter looking into this a bit more, there _may_ be a way to either have a `truffle develop` migration not save to the actual json artifacts (so after restarting `truffle develop`, the artifacts will be detected, but the `develop` network will not be found), _or_ possibly have `truffle develop` remove the `networks` it added during the repl session when `.exit`ing out. Will need to look into this more thoroughly.",
