  "body": "- [ ] I've asked for help in the [Truffle Gitter](http://gitter.im/Consensys/truffle) before filing this issue.\r\n\r\nI have not asked for help yet as this requires a detailed breakdown of the problem.\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\nI am referencing this similar issue but please note, I believe it's due to a different cause than the one hypothesized in the issue linked to below, which indicates that it was due to a \"stale\" copy of _solc_ existing on the user's station.  I executed the same steps suggested to the user and it did _not_ solve my problem.  I believe that my issue (assumption, not confirmed) has to due with my use of the new \"compiler\" section available with Truffle 5.0 beta to use an older compiler.  I believe that Truffle _is_ using the older compile because since I added the \"compiler\" section with version \"0.4.21\" it no longer throws errors for addresses not marked as _payable_, a 5.0 specific error, even though it prints out a message indicating the 5.0 compiler is in use:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/issues/906\r\n\r\nHere is the error I am getting since I upgraded to Truffle 5.0:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nError parsing /home/robert/Documents/GitHub/ME/ether-band-battles-work/solidity/contracts/Migrations.sol: ParsedContract.sol:7:14: ParserError: Expected identifier, got 'LParen'\r\n  constructor() public {\r\n             ^\r\nCompilation failed. See above.\r\n\r\nTruffle v5.0.0-beta.2 (core: 5.0.0-beta.2)\r\nSolidity v0.5.0 (solc-js)\r\nNode v8.11.1\r\n```\r\nHow can I fix this?  Here is the relevant section of my Truffle js file:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n  compilers: {\r\n     solc: {\r\n       version: \"0.4.21\"\r\n     }\r\n  },\r\n  /** Added solidity optimize in attempt to combat out of gas errors during migrates to Ganache. **/\r\n  solc: {\r\n    optimizer: {\r\n      enabled: true,\r\n      runs: 200\r\n    }\r\n  } \r\n```\r\nNote, if I am correct in my analysis, this also indicates that Truffle should print out the version of _solc_ actually being used, as per the directive in Truffle.js, instead of simply printing out v0.5.0 as it appears to be doing now.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
