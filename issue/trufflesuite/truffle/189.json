  "body": "I'm getting an error when I try to deploy a contract (via serve):\n\n```\nModule build failed: Error\n      at DeployError.ExtendableError \n```\n\nOr when I try `truffle deploy`:\n\n```\nChecking sources...\nCompiling SimpleStorage.sol...\nCollecting dependencies...\nError deploying SimpleStorage:\n\nundefined\n\nDeploy failed. See above.\n```\n\nThis worked before on `testrpc` without problems. But my guess is that I need to **authenticate**, but how?.\n\nI've not configured much other than add an account on the command line, and one in the geth javascript console. (Which created 2 different/seperate accounts?) But never logged in, or configured anything to use them. But I can also not find anything about this in the docs\n\nIt seems it's just assuming testrpc where everything just magically works..\n\nIs it even possible to deploy contracts on a live Node from truffle, because I would first need to unlock an account from whence I deploy the contract no?\n\nI've been searching for hours now for anything that would allow me to tell `truffle` to login, and deploy the contracts on `geth` like it does in `testrpc`.\n",
