  "body": "When I call the getGasPrice() via Web3 with Ganache as the Ethereum network provider I get an extraordinarily large value of 20000000 (2 ETHER).  The Web3 docs say that the gas price is calculated by recent block activity.  However, I get this value even when I have just started the Ganache GUI client.  At one point when trying to solve an out of gas error when deploying a contract, I did set the Gas Limit via the Ganache CHAIN settings to 20000000.  But I did try clearing that value out and restarting the GUI client.  I still get that value for the gas price.  I assume setting the Gas Limit should not affect the value returned by getGasPrice(), especially after clearing that value and restarting the GUI client?\r\n\r\nEnvironment:\r\nUbuntu 18.04 Bionic Beaver\r\nNode v 8.11\r\nGanache v 1.2.2\r\nTruffle 5.0 Beta",
