You should add this issue's id to the \"This Issue is blocking\" list at https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/truffle-dev-5c67177dfd28fb7faae0855e/issues/trufflesuite/truffle/2199, to not forget about issue #1347 in the \"icebox\". At least i'm unable to find it on zenhub where i'd expect it when following your guidline on finding v5.1 releases.",

    "body": "#2199 is set as blocking this issue.  I moved this (#1347) to the Blocked column.\r\n\r\nThis isn't part of the schedule for v5.1... the plan was to release the event system, then resolve this missing logs problem, although I'm happy to revisit that decision. My thinking is that this issue is a bug, not a feature, and so the fix here could be a patch release.\r\n\r\nBut, It'd be nice to get this into v5.1, certainly. I just don't think anyone on the team has capacity to take on the work, and I'm hesitant to delay v5.1 past October.\r\n\r\nI'll mark this \"help wanted\" in case anyone else is interested. The work here should target the `reporter` branch, at least until #2035 is merged. Docs for the event system can be found on the corresponding PR (see [here](https://github.com/trufflesuite/trufflesuite.com/pull/496/files?short_path=49d8c6b#diff-49d8c6b43a44f1e652094b9b275fc963) specifically), but there might be code changes required.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I'll have more attention to devote to this myself after DevCon, and that might change my assumptions.\r\n\r\n(EDIT: oh, I guess this isn't \"blocked\", per se... it's just that the Event system isn't merged yet, and is thus subject to change. But if it has to change to support simple transaction logs in migrations, then we should know about that!)\r\n\r\n(EDIT two: meant to cc @eggplantzzz)",
