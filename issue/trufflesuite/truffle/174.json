  "body": "Hi.\n\nI am currently running truffle on win64 (windows 10). When I try to deploy a contract with testrpc, everything works fine. But when I try to deploy it to the testnetwork using Geth I get stuck on `collecting dependencies`. But the contract seems to have been made when I look in the output from Geth.\n\nOutput from geth:\n\n```\nI0610 20:12:53.348075 eth/api.go:1178] Tx(0x3a0d75.....) created: 0x07601.....\n```\n\nOutput from Truffle\n\n```\n$ truffle deploy --verbose\nUsing environment development.\nNo contracts updated; skipping compilation.\nCollecting dependencies...\n```\n\nEdit: I know tried running in on a ubuntu machine with the following:\ngeth 1.5.0\ntruffle 1.0.3\n\nWhen I tried to deploy it I got stuck at \"collecting dependencies..\" This is with the standard metacoin-example.\n",
