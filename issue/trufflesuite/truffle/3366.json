  "body": "- [X] I've asked for help in the [Truffle Slack](https://truffle-community.slack.com/archives/CS0EWDGNN/p1600125614005300?thread_ts=1598601354.001600&cid=CS0EWDGNN) before filing this issue.\r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\n## Feature Request\r\n\r\nSupport multi file verification on Etherscan using Truffle.  \r\nThis is instead of flattening contracts.  \r\n\r\nFlattened contracts:\r\n* Can only contain one SPDX License Identifier (introduced in Solidity 0.6.8) per file.  Risking license identifiers being removed, especially from third party libraries.\r\n* Remove import statements, making it harder to identify how contracts have been imported and from what sources such as an installed npm package\r\n* Generally harder to ready and identify any inheritance used, including third party libraries such as OpenZeppelin Contracts.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nVerify the following contract inheriting from OpenZeppelin Contracts v3.2.0\r\n```solidity\r\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\r\npragma solidity ^0.6.0;\r\n\r\nimport \"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol\";\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * @title SimpleToken\r\n * @dev Very simple ERC20 Token example, where all tokens are pre-assigned to the creator.\r\n * Note they can later distribute these tokens as they wish using `transfer` and other\r\n * `ERC20` functions.\r\n */\r\ncontract SimpleToken is ERC20 {\r\n    /**\r\n     * @dev Constructor that gives msg.sender all of existing tokens.\r\n     */\r\n    constructor() public ERC20(\"Simple Token\", \"SIM\") {\r\n        _mint(msg.sender, 100000000 * (10**uint256(decimals())));\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Ideal Behavior\r\n\r\nIdeally the contract would be verified as multiple files.\r\nThe following example shows the six files that make up the contract:\r\nhttps://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x3fFfF0a40E2E3152ab35D78cC49218dD2C35c6cc#code\r\n\r\nThe contract was verified using https://github.com/nomiclabs/buidler/tree/development/packages/buidler-etherscan which ideally there would be a Truffle plugin that supports multi file verification.\r\n\r\n## Actual Results\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rkalis/truffle-plugin-verify flattens the contracts, removes SPDX License Identifiers and replaces with a single SPDX License Identifier and removes imports so that the contract can compile.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows a single flattened file for the contract:\r\nhttps://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x5D226974f9ce71179a68B8EDcC7EeE99df8FC3C5#code\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n* Operating System: WSL2 Ubuntu 18.0.4\r\n* Truffle version:\r\n```\r\n$ npx truffle version\r\nTruffle v5.1.44 (core: 5.1.44)\r\nSolidity - 0.6.12 (solc-js)\r\nNode v10.21.0\r\nWeb3.js v1.2.1\r\n```",
