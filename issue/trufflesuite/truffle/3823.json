  "body": "## Issue\r\n\r\nAdd a system for tracking gas usage to txlog.  This means the following:\r\n1. Calls -- both external and internal -- would contain a field indicating how much gas they used.  This would be measured *inclusively*, i.e., including the cost of the call itself, and any costs from returning.  This would be gross gas used; refunds would not be tracked at this level.\r\n2. The outermost `transaction` action would include fields about gas usage, including gross gas used, net gas used, total refund, and transaction fee paid (and to whom).\r\n\r\nNote that we want to do this in such a manner that the debugger doesn't need to know about any explicit gas cost values itself, and so we don't need the debugger having different cases for different hard forks.  There is one specific gas cost that the debugger will need to know to implement this, though, which is the code deposit fee.  Thankfully this has so far never changed throughout the different hardforks, so hopefully hardcoding it in won't cause too much of a problem in the future.\r\n\r\nQuestions that need answering:\r\n1. What is the `gas` field returned by `debug_traceTransaction`, and does it contain information we can use that we couldn't obtain otherwise?  Could we use it to avoid the hardcoding in of the code deposit fee?\r\n2. Would the completion of #2894 warrant revisiting the decision not to track the occurrence of individual refunds, as well as other decisions that followed on from that?",
