  "body": "I have a strange situation where the same RPC eth_call request goes out from embark and from truffle to the same function in the same contract (deployed at different addresses because one uses the embark blockchain and the other testrpc, but that's the only difference).  The embark call returns a result while the other returns zero.  I see differences in the HTTP requests going over the RPC port, but I don't know why / if that explains the difference.  I'm filing this as a possible truffle bug - could the Connection: close vs keep-alive be causing the issue?\n\nFunction in contract:\n\nfunction fn(int x) constant returns (int result);\n\nThis is being called from truffle (pudding) using:\n\nContract.fn.call(4000000.0, {from: coinbase}).then(function(res) {\n    console.log(\"result=\" + res.toString(10));\n});\n\nWorks (embark):\n\nPOST / HTTP/1.1\nHost: localhost:8101\nConnection: keep-alive\nContent-Length: 252\nOrigin: http://localhost:8000\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/45.0.2454.85 Safari/537.36\nContent-type: application/json\nAccept: _/_\nReferer: http://localhost:8000/\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nAccept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8\n\n{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"method\":\"eth_call\",\"params\":[{\"to\":\"0x0a181d935007b7bfe2720091f33c628b1bfcecb9\",\"data\":\"0xd271b06700000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000003d0900\",\"from\":\"0x3c9601da93841f13f48f7c1f13a3f5950c1cd00f\"},\"latest\"],\"id\":4}\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:8000\nContent-Type: application/json\nVary: Origin\nDate: Thu, 24 Dec 2015 02:53:59 GMT\nContent-Length: 103\n\n{\"id\":4,\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"result\":\"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000152736\"}\n\nDoesn't work (truffle):\n\nPOST / HTTP/1.1\nUser-Agent: node-XMLHttpRequest\nAccept: _/_\nContent-Type: application/json\nHost: localhost:8545\nContent-Length: 252\nConnection: close\n\n{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"method\":\"eth_call\",\"params\":[{\"from\":\"0x82a978b3f5962a5b0957d9ee9eef472ee55b42f1\",\"to\":\"0xc305c901078781c232a2a521c2af7980f8385ee9\",\"data\":\"0x8e6f235300000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000003d0900\"},\"latest\"],\"id\":2}\n\nHTTP/1.0 200 OK\nServer: BaseHTTP/0.3 Python/2.7.6\nDate: Thu, 24 Dec 2015 02:52:01 GMT\nContent-type: application/json-rpc\nContent-length: 107\nAccess-Control-Allow-Headers: Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: *\n\n{\"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"result\":\"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\", \"id\": 2}\n",
