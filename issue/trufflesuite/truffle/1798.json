But forcing people to reinstall their whole development environment because Truffle or one of its dependencies doesn't work with NPM installed a certain way seems a bit extreme, doesn't it?\r\n\r\nYep, you're 100% correct. My earlier assumption, considering that best practice recommends against `sudo npm`, was that it was not urgent to fix it, since it is arguably unsafe.\r\n\r\nEarlier today, the rest of the team and I came to the conclusion that this reasoning is egregiously unsound. This is basically entirely thanks to all of the users whose bug reports have made it clear that it's **unexpectedly weird** and **basically unacceptable** for Truffle to fail to operate if installed by root.\r\n\r\n@sarbogast your point here cuts directly to the heart of what was wrong with the prior assumption. Thank you for expressing it; I will be glad to remember it in the future when something else runs the risk of breaking user expectations like that.\r\n\r\nAnyway, good news! Upon reaching the aforementioned conclusion, @eggplantzzz went and implemented what we believe to be a very straightforward fix! See #1801 for the PR if you're curious. I'm confident that we'll be able to get it into the next release, which will be sometime next week at the latest. (Thanks @eggplantzzz!)",
