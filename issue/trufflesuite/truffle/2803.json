We can get ahead of them by validating `TruffleContract` schemas prior to persisting. @fainashalts suggested the concept of a strictness version, at which point Truffle will enforce strict contract version conformity. Validations will now throw exceptions and we will rely on Travis CI, our test coverage and git workflow to flag problems before they are introduced into `develop`\r\n\r\n**Todo**\r\n\r\n- [ ] Cunning plan to implement and execute\r\n",
