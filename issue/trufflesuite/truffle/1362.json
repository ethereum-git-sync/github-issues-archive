  "body": "- [x] I've asked for help in the [Truffle Gitter](http://gitter.im/Consensys/truffle) before filing this issue.\r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\n## Issue\r\n\r\nI can't understand the concept of Truffle's artifatcs .json files in comparison to Remix IDE. When exporting the ABI and the Bytecode from Remix IDE, I would expect those to be exactly the same as in Truffle's artifatcs. \r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Deploy contract via Remix IDE\r\n2. Copy the Bytecode\r\n3. Paste in the Contract.json that is compiled via Truffle\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nBytecodes are the same, expecting to deploy the contract from Remix and use the compiled Truffle .json to call the functions.\r\n\r\n## Actual Results\r\n\r\nTruffle Contract.json is different from the Remix IDE artifatcs, hence, when deploying from Remix to Ganache I am getting `\"network/artifact\" mismatch error.`\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n* Operating System: Windows x64\r\n* Ethereum client: Ganache\r\n* Truffle v4.1.14 (core: 4.1.14)\r\n* Solidity v0.4.24 (solc-js)\r\n* node version v9.4.0\r\n* npm version 6.4.1\r\n",

I suspect they are different, since when I deploy a contract from the Remix IDE, and then run `truffle compile`, when launching, the dapp does not recognize that the contract is deployed from the Remix IDE (I am **not** running` truffle migrate`).\r\n\r\nPerhaps, I understand this whole process wrong, but my understanding was that `truffle migrate ` and deploying from Remix IDE work the same way.",

When you compile and migrate there is also some metadata (like networks where it is deployed and their address)that Truffle needs for access.
