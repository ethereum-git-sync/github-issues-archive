  "body": "## Issue\r\n\r\nTravis is slow and getting slower now that both `solc` and `vyper` have to get installed.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. https://travis-ci.org/trufflesuite/truffle\r\n2. Options -> Trigger Build -> etc.\r\n3. Wait longer than an amount of time for which it is reasonable to have patience\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe two main CI jobs (Packages & Integrations) should not run any tests that rely on any packages installed by `apt-get`.\r\n\r\nA separate job should run for specifically these tests. (unknown requirement: should this job be marked as \"allowed failure\"?)\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nThere are at least two places where CI environment changes how or which tests are run:\r\n\r\n- The [external compile tests](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/blob/46fc7bdb9fde7cc3fa99b94fef04b1d6c04c38f7/packages/truffle/test/scenarios/external_compilers/truffle-compile.js#L15) use the `jq` utility, so these only run if the `CI` environment variable is true.\r\n\r\n- A bunch of tests are marked `[ @geth ]` ([e.g.](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/blob/46fc7bdb9fde7cc3fa99b94fef04b1d6c04c38f7/packages/truffle/test/scenarios/migrations/production.js#L24-L25)), which gets indicated to mocha by way of the \"test filter\" option.*\r\n\r\n*This approach is annoying because it means the main CI script for running \"all the tests\" consumes this CLI flag (`-k` I think but I'm too lazy to look it up). So you can't use `-k` locally, effectively at all, if you just want to do `yarn test -k ...some filter...` in the root.\r\n\r\nFor this issue, it may be worth thinking of a more explicit strategy for how CI manages collections of tests. Or not. Alternate strategy: hack it in and get tests faster by any means necessary.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\nTravis-CI",
