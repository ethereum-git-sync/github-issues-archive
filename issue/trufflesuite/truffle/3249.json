  "body": "- [x] I've asked for help in the [Truffle Gitter](http://gitter.im/Consensys/truffle) before filing this issue.\r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\n## Issue\r\n\r\nUsing Ganache-CLI to fork mainnet for testing purposes. When doing this running into a problem where when I try to deploy to this development blockchain I get an error that says the first of the autogenerated accounts with 100 ETH have 0 WEI, so cannot pay gas for deployment. \r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Run: ganache-cli --fork https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/<infura_project_id> --gasLimit=0x1fffffffffffff --allowUnlimitedContractSize -e 100\r\n\r\n2. Deploy with these settings: \r\n\r\n```\r\nconst HDWalletProvider = require('@truffle/hdwallet-provider');\r\nrequire('dotenv').config() \r\nconst mnenomic = \"divide there....\"; //autogen seed phrase copied from ganache-cli\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n\r\n  networks: {\r\n\r\n     development: {\r\n      host: \"127.0.0.1\",     // Localhost (default: none)\r\n      port: 7545,            // Standard Ethereum port (default: none)\r\n      network_id: \"*\",       // Any network (default: none)\r\n      provider: () => new HDWalletProvider(mnenomic, \"https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/15f54146bc594f10a1db67c35275579a\"),\r\n      from: \"0x7136fbDdD4DFfa2369A9283B6E90A040318011Ca\"\r\n     },\r\n\r\n    // Useful for deploying to a public network.\r\n    // NB: It's important to wrap the provider as a function\r\n\r\n  },\r\n\r\n  // Set default mocha options here, use special reporters etc.\r\n  mocha: {\r\n    // timeout: 100000\r\n  },\r\n\r\n  // Configure your compilers\r\n  compilers: {\r\n    solc: {\r\n       version: \"0.5.17\",    // Fetch exact version from solc-bin (default: truffle's version)\r\n       docker: false,        // Use \"0.5.1\" you've installed locally with docker (default: false)\r\n       settings: {          // See the solidity docs for advice about optimization and evmVersion\r\n        optimizer: {\r\n          enabled: true,\r\n          runs: 200\r\n        },\r\n        evmVersion: \"byzantium\"\r\n       }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Run: `truffle migrate` in command line\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nExpect contracts to deploy to this test chain forked from mainnet. Contracts deployed fine to purely local ganache network. \r\n\r\n## Actual Results\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"Migrations\" could not deploy due to insufficient funds\r\n   * Account:  0x868945aa455FEff1a676b95Ff364Ba58b2bEFCf8\r\n   * Balance:  0 wei\r\n   * Message:  sender doesn't have enough funds to send tx. The upfront cost is: 327152000000000 and the sender's account only has: 0\r\n   * Try:\r\n      + Using an adequately funded account\r\n      + If you are using a local Geth node, verify that your node is synced.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n* Operating System: Mac\r\n* Ethereum client: Assume Geth (launching via infura)\r\n* Truffle version (`truffle version`): v5.1.30\r\n* node version (`node --version`): v10.15.0\r\n* npm version (`npm --version`): 6.14.4\r\n",

    "body": "Hmm, It could be a ganache issue, however we do run tests for forked balance checks.\r\n\r\nI noticed the from in the config (`0x7136fbDdD4DFfa2369A9283B6E90A040318011Ca`) and the from in the migration (`0x868945aa455FEff1a676b95Ff364Ba58b2bEFCf8`) are different. I wonder if that could be the culprit?\r\n\r\nIn any case, the most recent version of ganache does have some forked account related fixes, albeit not for balances, specifically. Can you upgrade truffle to v5.1.39 and try again?",
