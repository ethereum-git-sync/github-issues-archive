But as You see in ganache there is 0.\r\n\r\nThe 3 steps I performed (see hardcopies in obove repo) were:\r\n\r\n1) truffle deploy (to deploy the contract SimpleStorage, as you see in ganacheTest/console/truffleDeploy.png)\r\n\r\n2) truffle test ./test/simple_storage.js (to test setting storedData = 17 in contract SimpleStorage, as you see in ganacheTest/console/truffleTestSimpleStorageJs.png)\r\n\r\n3) truffle test ./test/simple_storage.sol (to test setting storedData = 18 in contract SimpleStorage, as you see in ganacheTest/console/truffleTestSimpleStorageSol.png)\r\n\r\nAs you see from the hardcopies deploy and the tests succeeded either.\r\n\r\nYou also see from the harcopies named worspace... what happened due to deploying and testing on the ganache blockchain on the account, the blocks, transactions and the contract after each of the above steps. \r\n\r\n**Without the update facility of smart contracts in truffle/ganache testing contracts does not make real sense making truffle/ganache quite worthless.**  \r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Hey @pstrotmann! The behavior you specify above is correct and expected. Ganache has a special rpc method for reverting state. While running `truffle test`, Truffle at different points resets the state of the chain to what it previously was as this is very useful for testing. Relevantly, one of those times is at the end of running the test suite. So I would expect the chain to be in the state it was in when you started the tests. If you run against another chain like Geth (which does not support this special rpc method), however, it would be typical for the chain state to have mutated.\r\n\r\nIf you do the same calls to set the variable in your migrations you will get an altered chain state as there is no mechanism for resetting the chain state involved in running the migrations.",

    "body": "`truffle test` is meant for running automated tests. Teardown/cleanup is a common, standard part of automated testing and helps ensure that you can write tests without worrying about state changing all the time between tests etc. This allows you to consistently get deterministic results, especially when adding more tests to your test suite that may mutate state as well. If you'd like to request a feature to turn this off, please submit an issue [in the Truffle repo!](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/issues) We're always glad to hear about what features you all want.\r\n\r\nYou can also just open up a Truffle development console and interact with your contracts that way as well. You should check out the Truffle docs; here are the docs for [running migrations](https://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/getting-started/running-migrations.html). But it now sounds like the Truffle development console might be an easier way for you to interact with your contracts (though you will have to run migrations while using it to deploy your contracts before you can interact with them).
