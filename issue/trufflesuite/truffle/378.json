    "body": "So it looks like `HumanStandardTokenFactory.sol` is missing from IPFS.\r\n\r\n```\r\nSource: /Users/tim/Documents/workspace/Consensys/test3/installed_contracts/tokens/contracts/HumanStandardTokenFactory.sol \r\nURI ipfs://QmSMdCxaH1H5TfyjKVtiPKnFabkQByciTBG6FTCAiCufX7\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to fix this is to publish a new version of `tokens` to the registry. If Ropsten is dead and wonâ€™t let you do that, then the only way to fix it is to upload HumanStandardTokenFactory.sol back to IPFS in the exact state it was in when you originally published it (so it receives the same hash).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this isn't a bug in Truffle so much as it is an inherent problem with IPFS. IPFS needs to Swarmify or Swarm needs to get done. :( \r\n\r\nGoing to close this for now. ",

For the `tokens` package, however, it looks like data is missing. @skmgoldin, if you want to release a new version of the `tokens` package, it should fix the issue. \r\n\r\nIn general though, there was data loss at the IPFS level, and I can't speak to why (I don't have enough information). At its heart, however, there's no guarantees that any data will remain on the network, so data loss is bound to happen again. IPFS is like bittorrent: if people stop seeding the data, it's gone. IPFS's Filecoin needs to get here fast, or SWARM needs to finish development.\r\n\r\n@SirensOfTitan There's no work that can be done as of now, unless you want to somehow speed up SWARM development.
