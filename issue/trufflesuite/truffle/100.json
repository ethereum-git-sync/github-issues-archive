Solidity imports are relative to the contract, and due to an assumption that all contracts live in the `contracts` directory, Truffle's having trouble finding the contract source. \n\nI've written a bug for this here, and verified it on my own: https://github.com/ConsenSys/truffle/issues/141\n\nFor now, configuring the name of the contracts directory is a bigger feature that needs to be addresses after major structural changes (in the works). For housekeeping purposes I'm going to close this ticket, but know that having a more flexible file structure is something we're actively pursuing. \n\nThanks!\n",
