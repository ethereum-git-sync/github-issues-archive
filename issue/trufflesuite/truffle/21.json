    "body": "Hi Iuri. I honestly believe the statement in the Readme to be correct and I don't consider it to be misleading. I do think Truffle intends to do things differently.\n\nRegarding contributing, I think Truffle's functionality differs significantly from that of Embark and it might be too late to merge the two (though I could be wrong). That said, in multiple interactions with you it seems you've been less than happy that Truffle exists, and during those interactions you did not come off as friendly or genuinely interested in having a dialog about what makes Truffle and Embark different. I heavily pushed the idea within Consensys of merging the two codebases, but ultimately the tone of your interactions caused us not to consider the idea further. \n\nWe might reconsider this in the future - in fact, I would like that. But right now we see ourselves as taking a different approach, and we're going to see that through. If you have any questions or would like to talk more, please let me know.\n",

I think you can agree it was definitely 'inspired' at the very least given the many similarities. I also clarified at the time a lot of the misconceptions, but the readme never corrected this.\n\nIt seems that when you decided to create truffle (which is absolutely your right ofc) , and I'm assuming you acted in good faith here, it seems you had misunderstood what embark could do - leading to the creation of truffle - and I wished you had talked to me to clarify some features and instead contributed if needed like so many people do so there wouldn't be duplication of efforts like this.\n\nP.S I see you fixed some of the Readme in the meanwhile, many thanks for this.
