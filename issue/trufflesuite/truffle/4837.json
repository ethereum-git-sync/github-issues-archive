May even be more useful if the actual network appeared instead of network==\"dashboard\"\r\n\r\n</div>",

    "body": "Interesting, the problem here is that the names Truffle uses are for _network configurations_ and not networks themselves. Currently there is no way to associate any given network the dashboard is connected to with a configuration supplied in `truffle-config.js`. A workaround for this might be to fetch the chain id in your migrations and use conditional logic based on the result. Offhand I'm not sure a really clean solution comes to mind. We'll have to think about this and brainstorm some solutions. Thanks for proposing this!",
