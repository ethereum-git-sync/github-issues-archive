  "body": "It seems that there is (still) no straight way to verify your solidity contracts on `etherscan.io`. Truffle makes it easy to build and deploy `real` solidity projects. Splitting code into multiple files is a good practice but using `imports` makes it difficult to verify your contracts on `etherscan` because you have to provide all your contract's source code as a single file. I use `npm` libraries to build solidity contracts so you can imagine that it's extreamly difficult to collect all source code.\r\n\r\nTruffle could procide a new command `verify` or `export` which would build additional files needed for verification proces on `etherscan.io`.",
