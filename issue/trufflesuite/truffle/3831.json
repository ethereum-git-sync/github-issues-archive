Because return value decoding is ABI-based and Vyper uses the same ABI as Solidity, doing this shouldn't be too hard; it just isn't possible at the moment due to some awkwardness with the debugger internals.  Still, it shouldn't be too hard and it's something we should do.",

    "body": "Note: This problem will also apply to Yul once we support Yul (#1906).  (Yul has no ABI, of course, but the problem still applies to return values from constructors.)  Again, this is purely a problem with debugger internals.  More specifically the issue is that it relies on there being a `ContractDefinition` AST node for the contract.  This shouldn't be necessary; it's just arranged that way at present.  So the problem is to rearrange it so that's no longer a requirement for decoding.",
