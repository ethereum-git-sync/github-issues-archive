  "body": "## Issue\r\n\r\nI'd like to be able to change the value of address literals in solidity source code before migrating to a local test chain. Currently, if a contract A needs to know the address of another contract B, you must pass B's address to A's constructor, which means the address must be stored as a state variable in A's storage. This is very expensive, costing 20,000 gas for initialization plus 200 gas for every read. Ideally B's address could be stored in A as a _constant_ state variable, but constant's cannot be set in a constructor, only hardcoded into the source code.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to do this currently? If not maybe this could be a feature in future versions of Truffle.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\nFor example, here, creation of C uses 20,000 more gas than D. And D's get() can be `pure` rather than `view`. I'd like to be able to change D's value of `a` before compiling and migrating to a test network.\r\n```\r\ncontract C {\r\n    address a;\r\n    constructor(address _a) public {\r\n        a = _a;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    function get() external view returns (address) {\r\n        return a;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```\r\ncontract D {\r\n    address constant a = 0x1111111111111111111111111111111111111111;\r\n    \r\n    function get() external pure returns (address) {\r\n        return a;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSorry if this isn't an appropriate issue, it's more of a feature request / question.",
