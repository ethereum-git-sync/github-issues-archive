    "body": "Truffle Next Blog Post\r\n\r\nWe have released the most awaited version of Truffle just in time for….________. There are SO many exciting things to mention that will make your Truffle experience a rich one. Highlighted below are the new exciting things Truffle has to offer:\r\n\r\n1. Bring your own compiler!!!! You can now choose any solc-js version available at solc-bin just tell Truffle which one you want and it will get it. This includes the ability to use docker and native binary in an advanced way.\r\n2. Web3 1.0- the truffle-contract command is now using web3.js 1.0! This will be great for error handling!\r\n3. New Migrations Command, in v5 this command has been completely rewritten. We have included better error messages, when a deployment fails Truffle will tell you and give you an idea of possible fixes. Truffle will now also give your more information about what is going on when you deploy a contract, cost summaries and real time status updates about the amount of a time a transaction has been pending. Dry run simulations now run automatically if you deploy to a known public network. Using the ‘— interactive’ flag on the command line will give you a prompt between dry runs and real deployments. The ability to configure the amount of block confirmations in between deployments. Allowing user to specify the amount of blocks to wait before timing out. Web3 has this value hardcoded at 50 blocks, which can pose a problem when deploying large contracts at the lower end of gas price range. \r\n4. User Analytics have been added and users can opt-in by running ‘truffle config --enable-analytics’. This is vital in making informed decisions about future of Truffle and deciding what is most valuable to our users. When enabled Truffle will collect information about your version number, the commands you run, and whether commands succeed or fail, all annoyomously.\r\n5. Truffle run <command>-  Truffle now gives users the ability to create custom command plugins.\r\n6. Vyper support- Truffle will now compile *.vy contracts. We have published a Truffle Box to help you get started with Vyper you can access it by running: ‘truffle unbox vyper-example’, (make sure you have Vyper installed.) Link: (https://vyper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing-vyper.html)\r\n7. Solidity v0.5.0- Truffle now uses solidity v0.5.0 by default. Solidity v0.4.xx is still supported and can be used by specifying the version in your Truffle config.\r\n8. Structured function parameters- Truffle has been upgraded to use Web3.js v1.0.0-beta.36, it includes support for passing/returning ‘struct’ s in Solidity functions. To use this you need to specify it at the top of your contracts using: ‘pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2’. This feature allows you to use complex function arguments and have the values returned in Solidity and interact with the resulting contracts via truffle-contract’s JS interface. \r\n9. Help system- Now access Truffle’s built in help system by running ‘truffle help (command)’ this allows you to see all the available options for the command as well as a description of what it does.\r\n10. Unique truffle mnemonics- Truffle will now generate random mnemonics that will persist only for you. Use caution with crypto security when working with mnemonics and private keys!!!!!\r\n11. Debugger Improvements- V5 includes debugger breakpoints! Add breakpoints using the ’b’ command and remove them using the ‘B’ command. Additionally we have added mapping support for the debugger!\r\n12. ‘Truffle init/truffle unbox’ - These commands have been improved you are now asked if you want to overwrite files. A ‘— force’ command has also been added to overwrite the files automatically.\r\n13. Async/await is now supported in truffle-console. \r\n\r\nBreaking Changes? (Should I add them?)\r\n\r\nLooking forward we are hoping to add third-party plugins. (Add more roadmap stuff here) \r\n\r\nThank you to all who have helped make this release of Truffle possible! We hope you enjoy this new Truffle release! Let us know if you have any suggestions or problems on our community Gitter channel or on our GitHub page! ",
