  "body": "- [ ] I've asked for help in the [Truffle Gitter](http://gitter.im/Consensys/truffle) before filing this issue.\r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\n## Issue【Error: PollingBlockTracker - encountered an error while attempting to update latest block:】\r\nI'm going to be bullied by this damn truffle and I'm going crazy! I tried to deploy to the test network through truffle migrate --network rinkeby --reset --compile-all, and also tried to switch between various truffle versions and node versions, but the timeout has been displayed for three days, and I ping https in cmd ://rinkeby.infura.io/v3/myKey but it shows that it has timed out, so I purchased a VPN, but unfortunately I can come here to ask the gods, but I cannot connect to my https://rinkeby.infura .io/v3/myKey🤢.. . . . And I found through IP address search that the ip address of my infura is constantly changing 😂🤣 (I am in China, I don’t know if your infura is like this). So, my question is: now how do I deploy truffle to the rinkeby test network? ? I think it is possible that Truffle v5.1.33 has a bug Finally, I offer a reward of 0.0001ETH, if someone can help me deploy my solidity to rinkeby through truffle!\r\nWhat the issue is, in broad strokes.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nPlease provide the shortest amount of steps to reproduce your issue.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nWhat you expected to happen.\r\n\r\n## Actual Results\r\n\r\nWhat actually happened.

It fails after some txs (with some simple contracts it works sometimes because fewer txs = less probability of failing)\r\n\r\nI am pretty sure this comes up when infura returns empty responses. \r\n\r\nI have got this error using (https://github.com/jmonteer/simplecontract), which is a simple project to check if it was something wrong on my code, which I believe is not. If this does not fail when you first run \"truffle test --network rinkeby\", try running it several times, it will fail eventually. \r\n\r\nIn my repo's truffle-config.js you will see 3 different networks: rinkeby, rinkeby_alchemy and test. I got it working with test and sometimes with rinkeby (Infura's provider). rinkeby_alchemy always throws a 429 error... (too many requests). \r\n\r\nBtw, it worked before (early August), although I have not been able to downgrade packages to make it work again. \r\n\r\nTHanks!!!

Maybe your connections are not as fast or something. I'm not sure! This will certainly be difficult to troubleshoot if it is not reproducible. Perhaps you could try migrating from a different connection that you know to be faster to see if you can reproduce it.",

I tried again just now with one with a 20 Mbps upload speed but I see that it just gives the timed out error immediately after the contracts are compiled during migration. It's not as if it takes time to time out ! Do you see any thing in my package.json that could cause this ? I had earlier seen [this issue](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/issues/3182) and thought what I am seeing could be related. I hope I am not using any faulty dependencies.",

Please pull the latest code from it.\r\nThen, I run 5 times \"truffle test\" on each of the networks (rinkeby, rinkeby_alchemy, test). [ rinkeby uses infura, rinkeby_alchemy uses alchemyapi and test uses TruffleTeams sandbox ]\r\n\r\nThe results: \r\n- \"truffle test --network rinkeby\" : Successfully passed all tests 1st, 2nd, 4th and 5th try. Failed 3rd try, threw this error: \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68742302/93865295-68313180-fcc6-11ea-87e6-8f7302d44461.png)\r\n\r\n- \"truffle test --network rinkeby_alchemy\" : Failed all tries. Too many requests. Threw this error: \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68742302/93865919-46847a00-fcc7-11ea-9241-1ad619f753c1.png)\r\n\r\n- \"truffle test --network test\" : successfully passed all tests the 5 tries. \r\n\r\nAn interesting thing to point out is that using infura (real Rinkeby network), tests took a lot longer to execute. Using truffle sandbox, it took way less. This may have something to do. \r\n\r\nInfura Rinkeby: \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68742302/93866384-df1afa00-fcc7-11ea-8c7a-a98a4164e607.png)\r\n\r\nTruffle Sandbox:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68742302/93866426-ee01ac80-fcc7-11ea-9cf3-e50ac49fad0a.png)\r\n\r\nWhen deploying / testing more complex contracts, it almost never goes through the whole migration. \r\n\r\nMy theory is that this has to do with how HDWalletProvider (or web3-engine-provider) deals with times out or empty blocks or similar issue. \r\n\r\nThis is so frustrating so hope you can help me with this one. \r\n\r\nThank you so much",

There may be something wrong with how you are connected to their api. \r\n\r\nOur hunch is that this is probably not a problem with HDWallet Provider. Based on the error message you posted, perhaps there is some rate-limiting going on with the Rinkeby Alchemy API?\r\n\r\nThese docs regarding configuring your networks might help? https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/reference/configuration#networks\r\n\r\nPlease let us know if there are more details to consider or if you figure out what's going on. Thanks!",

    "body": "Hi @fainashalts thanks for you reply. \r\n\r\nNo. The thing is that this is difficult to replicate because it is quite random. Using infura is the main problem for me. The problem is that using Infura it may successfully go through for some times in a row and then fail. This is the case with simple contract like the one I created for this demo. With more complex contracts and tests, the rate of failure is almost 100%. This is because this happens only after X transactions have been sent so if the contract deployment / test does not need many transactions to be done, it won't fail. \r\n\r\nRegarding Alchemy API, I sent the simplecontract to the team and they said that those errors were happening because Truffle was sending too many requests (more than they believed were needed). I am using the Free Tier there but it should be enough to deploy a contract like the one I copied in this issue (simplecontract). \r\n\r\nI am sure that my connection is working (I tried 3 different networks) and that I am correctly connecting to both Infura and Alchemy API.\r\n\r\nI managed to deploy contracts to Rinkeby before with other projects (and versions of Truffle) but I does not seem I can get back the same npm packages. \r\n\r\nI can add you as a contributor in one other more complex contract for you to look into this. \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n",

    "body": "I confirm that buidler deploys the contracts to Rinkeby successfully. \r\nTruffle does not, same project (~same conditions). What I said above about the null response is 99% the reason this happens. \r\n\r\nAlso, I believe that Truffle does way more requests than Buidler (but this is only my impression + I do not know what happens under the hood in each of them). Lots of calls to eth_blockNumber when running truffle migrate. .\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68742302/96579708-9448ce00-12d7-11eb-8046-a3133e61cca3.png)\r\n\r\nhope this helps",

I have now returned to the United States. This morning I turned on the computer to update truffle to the latest version, and changed the Internet cable instead of connecting to the coffee shop’s wifi. This problem was solved. I don't know why this is, maybe it has something to do with the Great Firewall of China.",
