  "body": "I tried following these steps to get webpack to work:\nhttps://github.com/ConsenSys/truffle/wiki/Using-Truffle-and-Webpack-(beta)\n\nI know it's beta, but the last few steps are not clear, and not all very useful or relevant after a fresh `truffle init`.\n\nI get errors from the import statements:\n`$ truffle build\nError: Cannot find module '../stylesheets/app.scss'\n`\nBecause the path is not correct for a clean install (`truffle init`). \nWhen I fix the path:\n\n> /app/stylesheets/app.scss: Unexpected token (1:5)\n>  1 | body {\n>         |      ^\n>   2 |   margin-left: 25%;\n\nWhen I remove the imports alltogether:\n\n> Warning: No compiled contracts found. App will be built without compiled contracts.\n> Running `webpack`...\n> Error: spawn webpack ENOENT\n>     at exports._errnoException (util.js:953:11)\n\nI would like a code example in its completeness, because the last few steps (especially 8) are too vague, and not working on clean install. I also don't understand the inclusion of step 6, since that path is already correct after a fresh `truffle init`.\n",
