Use the networks[networkName].networkCheckTimeout property to do this.\r\n```\r\nIt would be nice to have this message provide some confirmation of exactly which network Truffle is trying to connect to, showing the host and port.\r\n\r\nI spent an embarrassingly long period of time today encountering this when connecting to a local geth instance running a private network, where I can clearly see the \"HTTP endpoint opened\" message in the Geth output and I have the host and port number matching in my truffle-config. \r\n\r\nThen I figured out that the truffle-config I was looking at wasn't the one in effect.\r\n\r\nHaving this error message tell me the host and port it was trying to connect to would have shortened that debug time to seconds.
