  "body": "- [x] I've asked for help in the [Truffle Gitter](http://gitter.im/Consensys/truffle) before filing this issue.\r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\n## Issue\r\n\r\nI'm trying to compile https://github.com/argentlabs/argent-contracts/tree/1eb980e922ecd092b99bad76d8fad02ed1bfc9a1 (the latest commit at the master branch at the time of writing). `contracts_directory` in the config option is set to `  contracts_directory: \"contracts/wallet/\",` (https://github.com/argentlabs/argent-contracts/blob/1eb980e922ecd092b99bad76d8fad02ed1bfc9a1/truffle-config-wallet.js#L5) but it tries to compile contracts outside this directory which require different compiler version and thus fail.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Clone https://github.com/argentlabs/argent-contracts/tree/1eb980e922ecd092b99bad76d8fad02ed1bfc9a1\r\n2. Run `npm i`\r\n3. Run `npm run compile:wallet`\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe command runs successfully and contracts are compiled\r\n\r\n## Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe config includes `contracts_directory: \"./contracts/wallet/\",`, but it also tries to compile \r\n```\r\n> Compiling ./contracts/infrastructure/dapp/CurveFilter.sol\r\n> Compiling ./lib_0.7/paraswap/V4/lib/curve/CurvePoolMock.sol\r\n```\r\nwhich are clearly outside of the directory and not imported. The same command on a mac with i7 works just fine.\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n```\r\n~/p/p/argent-contracts master !1 ?1 ❯ npm run compile:wallet        6s 19:50:25\r\n\r\n> argent-contracts@1.0.0 compile:wallet\r\n> npx truffle compile --config truffle-config-wallet.js\r\n\r\n> Warning: possible unsupported (undocumented in help) command line option: --config\r\n\r\nCompiling your contracts...\r\n===========================\r\n> Compiling ./contracts/infrastructure/dapp/CurveFilter.sol\r\n> Compiling ./contracts/wallet/BaseWallet.sol\r\n> Compiling ./contracts/wallet/Proxy.sol\r\n> Compiling ./lib_0.7/paraswap/V4/lib/curve/CurvePoolMock.sol\r\n\r\nCompileError: ParserError: Source file requires different compiler version (current compiler is 0.8.3+commit.8d00100c.Emscripten.clang) - note that nightly builds are considered to be strictly less than the released version\r\n --> /Users/mmv/projects/personal/argent-contracts/lib_0.7/paraswap/V4/lib/curve/CurvePoolMock.sol:1:1:\r\n  |\r\n1 | pragma solidity 0.7.5;\r\n  | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n\r\n\r\nError: Truffle is currently using solc 0.8.3, but one or more of your contracts specify \"pragma solidity 0.7.5\".\r\nPlease update your truffle config or pragma statement(s).\r\n(See https://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/reference/configuration#compiler-configuration for information on\r\nconfiguring Truffle to use a specific solc compiler version.)\r\n\r\nCompilation failed.

Tried with 14.17.0, the same result\r\n* npm version (`npm --version`): 7.13.0. Tried with 6.14.13 and yarn v1.22.10.\r\n\r\n## Misc\r\n\r\nI ran `node --inspect ./node_modules/.bin/truffle compile --config truffle-config-wallet.js` and it all narrows to https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/blob/develop/packages/compile-common/src/profiler/profiler.ts#L24 return the wrong paths.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2021-05-30 at 19 37 01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16622558/120111172-f3ca5e80-c181-11eb-9b32-baa13d7c0642.png)\r\n```\r\npaths = (4) [\"/Users/mmv/projects/personal/argent-contracts/contracts/wallet/BaseWallet.sol\", \"/Users/mmv/projects/personal/argent-contracts/contracts/wallet/Proxy.sol\", \"/Users/mmv/projects/personal/argent-contracts/contracts/infrastructure/dapp/CurveFilter.sol\", \"/Users/mmv/projects/personal/argent-contracts/lib_0.7/paraswap/V4/lib/curve/CurvePoolMock.sol\"],\r\n```",

    "body": "@kevinbluer Thanks for taking a look. I tried upgrading it when I was looking for a fix and it didn't help. Please check my recent comment about what I think was the problem for me:\r\n\r\n> The issue is fixed by deleting the build folder. The problem is that it tried to recompile contracts that were already present there, even if they were not included in the path defined in the contracts_directory option\r\n\r\nSo, if you build contracts that use a different solidity compiler version, it will fail. I just tried to reproduce it again and here are the steps:\r\n1. `npm run compile:infrastructure_0.5`\r\n2. Change something in infrastructure 0.5 contracts. For example, go to `argent-contracts/contracts/infrastructure_0.5/MultiSigWallet.sol` and change line 25 to `uint constant public MAX_OWNER_COUNT = 12`\r\n3. `npm run compile:wallet`\r\n\r\nStep 3 should fail because it would try to compile `argent-contracts/contracts/infrastructure_0.5/MultiSigWallet.sol` contract, but it's not included in `contracts_directory` option.\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "So the problem is actually the profiler. When compiling, Truffle looks at all the artifacts in the build directory and compares them to their sources to see if anything has changed. Because the artifacts folder is full of builds from ALL contracts that have been compiled, it picks up the contract that was changed in your reproduction steps. Even though it is from the contracts directory you did not specify, it will attempt to compile it with the contracts that require a different version of the compiler and fail. \r\n\r\n@mikheevm You might check out the pragma feature which most likely takes longer but allows you to use multiple versions of the Solidity compiler in one compile. You can set `version` to `\"pragma\"` in your config and then attempt compilation of all the contracts.",
