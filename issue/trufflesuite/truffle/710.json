  "body": "- [ ] I've asked for help in the [Truffle Gitter](http://gitter.im/Consensys/truffle) before filing this issue.\r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\n## Issue\r\n\r\nWhen running truffle JS tests against ganache-cli, it creates a new snapshot at the beginning of tests, but never reverts.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nHaven't tried creating a minimal repro, but in my repo I presently have one JS test exercising a contract I've written. I'd think any trivial JS test which kicks off a transaction should exhibit this behavior.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nGiven that I write JS tests using `contract` and `it` statements and run them against ganache-cli, \r\n\r\n1. `truffle test` should make the RPC call `evm_snapshot` before running a `contract` block\r\n2. `truffle test` should make the RPC call `evm_revert` once testing is completed for a `contract` block.\r\n\r\n## Actual Results\r\n\r\n1. `truffle test` did make the RPC call `evm_snapshot` before running a `contract` block\r\n2. `truffle test` **did not** make the RPC call `evm_revert` once testing is completed for a `contract` block.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n* Operating System: OS X High Sierra\r\n* Truffle version: v4.0.1\r\n* Ethereum client: ganache-cli v6.0.3\r\n* node version: v9.0.0\r\n* npm version: 5.5.1\r\n",
