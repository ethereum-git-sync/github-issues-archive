  "body": "If someone wants to deploy a contract provided in OpenZeppelin they currently have to somehow put it in a place where Truffle will compile it. A common hack is to create an `Imports.sol` file in the project with contents `import 'openzeppelin-solidity/contracts/...';`. This is not ideal. OpenZeppelin should provide the artifacts in the npm package and Truffle should be able to create a contract abstraction from those artifacts.\r\n\r\nThis is an ugly API just to get a picture of the potential usage:\r\n```javascript\r\nconst ERC721Token = artifacts.dependency('openzeppelin-solidity').require('ERC721Token');\r\n\r\nawait ERC721Token.new(name, symbol);\r\n```\r\n\r\n",

Since `openzeppelin-solidity` is an unscoped package, this should work right now with the official release.\r\n\r\n@gnidan @cgewecke There's overlap in that #1085 also has a changeset for `truffle-resolver` which enables the existing syntax for scoped packages on NPM (so, `artifacts.require('@scope/pkg/Contract')`).",

I've not used this pattern for a while though, since I tend to need contract instances available on local development chains, but there was a time I believe this did work.",

    "body": "@eggplantzzz I've tested against the most recent release, and I don't think this correctly resolves `node_modules` directories in all cases. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I think this works in the case where `truffle` is called from a directory where the path to the contract artifact is `./node_modules/@project/package/build/contracts/Contract.json`. However, it seems that it does not work if the path to the contract artifact is located at `../node_modules/@project/package/build/contracts/Contract.json`. Is this desired? We use a monorepo managed by lerna and the package we'd like to access is stored in the `node_modules` directory under root.\r\n\r\nThanks for all your work around this feature -- much appreciated!",

My point is that if you require an artifact that is in `node_modules`, Truffle has no way of knowing where it is located in there. `artifacts.require` takes the **contract name** and not the path to an artifact as an argument. I'm not sure what happens if you specify a path in there; it might work but that is not the intended api.",
