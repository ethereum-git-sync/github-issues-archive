  "body": "During an attempt to solve an out of gas problem when deploying a contract, I put a high value in the Gas Limit field on the Ganache client CHAIN settings page.  Later I wanted to clear that field and leave it blank to return to the default value.  Unfortunately you can not do that.  If you clear out that field, then Save & Restart the client, the value changes to 0.  This of course causes errors during further transactions because the Gas Limit for blocks is now 0 resulting in fatal errors during transactions.\r\n\r\nFor now I will just put in some arbitrary high value to get around it, but it is a problem.\r\n\r\nHere is a screenshot showing the field cleared out to a \"blank\" state:\r\n\r\n![screenshot from 2018-11-28 05-34-38](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4660487/49146353-fbb69880-f2cf-11e8-937a-243be5f959d9.png)\r\n\r\nHere is a subsequent screenshot showing that field after restarting the client.  Note that the value has changed to a numeric \"0\":\r\n\r\n![screenshot from 2018-11-28 05-34-49](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4660487/49146344-f5c0b780-f2cf-11e8-9ad2-c5762a16378d.png)\r\n\r\n",
