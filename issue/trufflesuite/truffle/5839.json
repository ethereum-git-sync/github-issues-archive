  "body": "- [x] I've [opened a support ticket](https://trufflesuite.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) before filing this issue.\r\n\r\nYes ticket #986905\r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\n## Issue\r\n\r\nTruffle runs Mocha with the --exit argument appended (Mocha argument reference here: `https://mochajs.org/)`. You can find it in the code base wherever Mocha is called. This changes the behavior of Mocha to not wait for async operations in reporters before exiting. We need an option in Truffle to override this. No Mocha reporters that perform async operations (usually at the end) will function otherwise. Since Truffle (doesn't appear) to expose a separate reporting interface, this is critical to have an option for.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nUse a Mocha test reporter that includes an async function operation for the 'end' event. Mocha exits (ends the process) without waiting for the function to complete.\r\n\r\nI became aware of this when having issues reporting results to Tesults with Truffle but not Waffle with the Tesults Mocha Reporter\r\nNpm package: `https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha-tesults-reporter`\r\nDocumentation: `https://www.tesults.com/docs/mocha`\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThis is not a bug, it seems to be by design because Truffle uses the --exit command with Mocha. The issue is we need an option for Truffle not to do that (i.e. omit the --exit command or add the --no-exit (which is default for Mocha)).\r\n\r\n## Actual Results\r\n\r\nSee expected behavior above, this is not a bug so the expected/actual template here does not apply.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n* Operating System:  Tested with Mac OS\r\n* Ethereum client: N/A\r\n* Truffle version (`truffle version`): Tested with 5.7.2\r\n* node version (`node --version`):  Tested with 16.3.0\r\n* npm version (`npm --version`): Tested with 8.1.0\r\n",

    "body": "@eggplantzzz I believe it is using the --exit flag even when running truffle test.I discovered this when trying to determine whether the Mocha framework reporter for Tesults would 'just work' with Truffle, I expected it would but discovered it does not due to this flag. Here is a temporary repo I've setup to demonstrate the issue: https://github.com/ajeetd/temporary-truffle-test\r\n\r\nRun `npm install` and then `npm test`\r\n\r\nYou will find that in the console output, at the end you see 'Tesults results upload... (TEST)' which is output in tesults-reporter.js (the custom mocha reporter) but the Mocha process exits before the callback can complete, we would expect to see console output from lines 228-235 in tesults-reporter.js if the callback were to complete.\r\n\r\nThe best solution to this would be to offer an option to have a way for Truffle to omit the --exit flag when running.",
