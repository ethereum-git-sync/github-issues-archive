  "body": "## Issue\r\n\r\nDon't know if this is worth doing, but it's a thing we could do.  Note that there's some trickiness here because we wouldn't be able to easily supply an assertion library in the same way we do with Solidity, because Vyper has no notion of linking.  The best idea @gnidan and I had was that test contracts in Vyper would optionally accept an address parameter to its constructor, and when deploying them we'd give them the address of the assertion library as the argument to the constructor (assuming the constructor takes an argument).\r\n\r\nNote that we wouldn't necessarily need to write separate Vyper assertion libraries; we could just add JSON files with the ABIs for our existing assertion libraries and rely on Vyper's native ability to import JSON.",
