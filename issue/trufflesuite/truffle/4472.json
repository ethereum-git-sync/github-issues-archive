However, I'm stuck trying to get the \"getting started tutorial\" for truffle-tezos to work on my windows 10 PC. I can't get the compiler to work. It seems windows can't find it. I tried literally everything to fix it, but it won't work (environment variables, using WSL2, manual docker start). It's really frustrating. \r\nWhenever executing \"truffle compile\" the compiler throws the error \"Error executing ligo\" (no additional error-messages). Looking into docker-desktop, whenever executing \"truffle compile\", the ligo-container gets started for a second and then exits immediately. Writing \"ligo --version\" on the console doesn't work either, command is not known.\r\n\r\nTo let you know, Truffle-Etherium works perfectly on my Windows 10 PC.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nFollow the getting started tutorial (https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/tezos/truffle/quickstart) on Windows 10.\r\nWhenever comming to executing \"truffle compile\" the compiler throws the error \"Error executing ligo\".\r\nI've also tried to implement the tutorial on WSL2, but the same error appeared.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe compiler to work. Or at least showing version of Ligo when typing \"ligo --version\"\r\nI've also followed this guide, which actually considers this error (https://forklog.com/sp/dev-on-tezos/en/environment-setup/).\r\n\r\n## Actual Results\r\n\r\n\"Error executing ligo\"\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n* Operating System: Windows 10\r\n* Ethereum client: (Tezos)\r\n* Truffle version (`truffle version`): v5.5.0-tezos.4\r\n* node version (`node --version`): 6.12.0\r\n* npm version (`npm --version`): 6.12.0\r\n",

    "body": "Hello @haltman-at & @fainashalts can you please make a statement as to why Tezos support is not a priority anymore? To be honest it leaves a bad taste after the big announcement od Tezos support in Truffle ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/trufflesuite/status/1250486441341304835) and [Blogpost](https://trufflesuite.com/blog/branching-out-announcing-tezos-support-in-truffle/)) over two years ago. The funny thing is the support didnt last long, less than a year later Truffle started to ghost all issues and update requests on github or stated to do it later.. why the sudden change back then?\r\n\r\nAt least make either make it official and announce that you are not supporting Tezos anymore or at least update Tezos Truffle to current protocol standard. I dont know maybe its a failure on the communication side, maybe Truffle @tcoulter and Tezos Foundation @drchrispinnock need to talk but the current state is unfortunate.",

    "body": "Hi @BearCooder, unfortunately we had to drop our Tezos support because of architectural constraints that confine Truffle to the EVM for the foreseeable future.\r\n\r\nAlthough we were quite optimistic at the time about our ability to support the Tezos ecosystem, in practice it turned out to be infeasible and we had to abandon these efforts. I'd love for the situation to be different, as I believe that the Tezos community helps push our ecosystem forward in many ways, but legacy code gets in the way :/\r\n\r\nPerhaps this will change over time, as we seek to expand support for different blockchain architectures... but this is sadly not a short-term vision.\r\n\r\nThank you for voicing this feedback.",
