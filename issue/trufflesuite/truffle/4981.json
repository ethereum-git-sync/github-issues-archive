    "body": "Hey @soyludev, it seems people using version 8 of npm are experiencing problems installing Truffle when their build tools are a bit out of date: in your case, xCode on mac. So make sure you update xCode to the most current version. You might need to update your OS to do this as you are using 10.x. I had to update to 11.x before I could get the latest.\r\n\r\nYou could also downgrade to npm version 6 as well as a quick and dirty workaround. Let me know how it goes!",
