Thank you!\r\n\r\n(Actually it's quite curious that it's erroring at at `JSON.parse` in `index.js`, since that would mean that it's attempting to compile with `vyper` rather than `vyper-json`, even though you're using Vyper 0.2.7.  I guess you somehow only installed `vyper` and not `vyper-json`?  Interesting.  Well, it ought to work with or without `vyper-json`, so this is still a bug either way.)\r\n\r\nAnyway like I said, I think I'm going to need a reproduction example here to find out just what's going wrong.  Would you be able to provide one?",

    "body": "Well, once we merge the PR above and do the release this week, ordinary `vyper` should work fine again.  But yeah, our documentation on using Vyper with Truffle is pretty sparse, no question.  To a large extent that's because until recently our support for using Vyper with Truffle was itself pretty bare!  We've been working on improving it lately but didn't really updated the documentation accordingly.  I guess we'll have to do that.  But yes, much of the various new stuff we've recently added with Vyper -- such as more versatile imports like we support with Solidity -- will only work with `vyper-json`.\r\n\r\nIn this case, I didn't notice the problem until you reported because for this particular problem to occur, you had to not only be using `vyper` rather than `vyper-json`, but also using a non-prerelease version of Vyper.  I forgot to test that case, because when installing Vyper via pip, it will install both if you specify a version that has them both, and so I only tested `vyper` proper with versions from before `vyper-json` existed.\r\n\r\nSo, uh, thanks for alerting us that this is a case to look out for.  Likely we should start making use of `vyper --standard-json` when that's available, to make things easier and more robust.  But for now yes things will work better with `vyper-json`.  And I suppose that will always be the case on older versions of Vyper that have `vyper-json` but not `vyper --standard-json`.",
