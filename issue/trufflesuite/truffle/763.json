  "body": "## Issue\r\nDeploying to mainnet via INFURA using Truffle is susceptible to breaking. Errors I've seen:\r\n\r\n`gas price too low`\r\nThis happens when a tx is in the mempool and you send another tx with the same nonce.\r\n\r\n`nonce too low`\r\nThis happens when a tx has been mined but you send another tx with the same nonce.\r\n\r\nThese things can happen when you talk to INFURA because they run many nodes behind a load balancer. Lets say you send a tx to node A, which later tells you the tx has been mined. Truffle now prepares to move onto the next tx it needs to send and queries INFURA for the nonce it should use for the sending address, and happens to get routed to node B. The block that node A saw hasn't propagated to node B yet, so node B tells you to use the nonce of the prior transaction!\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nYou can't reproduce it deterministically, and it really only happens on mainnet because the peering situation is apparently bad, but try deploying something with a few txs to mainnet. Use this repo if you like: https://github.com/skmgoldin/tcr\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe issue could be resolved if I could specify to Truffle a number of blocks to wait after a tx has been mined before sending the next tx.\r\n\r\nWhen the number of blocks has elapsed, Truffle should double check at that point that the original transaction was actually mined, since it's possible it got the original mined alert for a block that ultimately wound up uncle'd. If that block was in fact uncle'd, wait again for the tx to be mined and repeat.\r\n\r\n## Actual Results\r\n\r\nI can't specify a block depth to wait on. So I get these failures.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n* Operating System: Ubuntu 16\r\n* Truffle version: 4.0.5\r\n* Ethereum client: INFURA\r\n* node version: 8\r\n* npm version: 5\r\n",

We could have `truffle-deployer` expose Web3's new event emitter interface and the pattern for waiting might look something like:\r\n```javascript\r\nmodule.exports = function (deployer) {\r\n  deployer.then(function() {\r\n     return new Promise(function(accept, reject){\r\n       deployer\r\n         .deploy(MyContract)\r\n         .on(\"confirmation\", (number, receipt) => {\r\n            if (number === 10) accept(receipt);\r\n         })\r\n         .catch(reject)\r\n      });\r\n   }).then(function(receipt){\r\n      //... ready to deploy something else ...\r\n   }).catch(function(error){\r\n      // ... :/ ...\r\n   })\r\n});\r\n```\r\nFor record keeping, these are related:\r\n+ [PR](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/pull/1393) at Web3 to address issue with the confirmation handlers not firing repeatedly for test clients.\r\n+ [truffle-deployer 18](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle-deployer/issues/18) ",
