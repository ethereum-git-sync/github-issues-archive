    "body": "Hi there,\n\nThanks for the ticket. Accounts are no unique across blockchains. In fact, as long as you have the private key to an account, you can use that account on any Ethereum-based blockchain (Mainnet, Classic, Ropsten, Rinkeby) so long as someone sends you Ether to that account on that chain. When you have a mnemonic, you essentially hold information to derive the private key; so you can use that mnemonic on any chain. \n\nAs you can see, people have (likely accidentally) used the Truffle mnemonic on the main chain: https://etherscan.io/address/0x627306090abaB3A6e1400e9345bC60c78a8BEf57\n\nI'm going to close this as it's not a bug, but a property of private/public key encryption. Cheers!",

I want to make sure that we understand in depth what happened. There are certainly some obvious things we can be doing to improve, and we're working on those now, but I want to make sure that we're not missing the forest for the trees.\r\n\r\nIf you're willing, you can quickly/easily self-schedule a time to meet on [my calendly page](https://calendly.com/ben-burns/feedback-session). It'll block off 60 minutes from my calendar, but we can keep it brief if you have less time than that. Thanks in advance!",
