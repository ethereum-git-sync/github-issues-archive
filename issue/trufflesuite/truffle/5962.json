  "body": "## Issue\r\n\r\n@truffle/artifactor saves artifacts that include absolute paths. This is a security problem and also brittle, as identified in #2114. Moving forward, we should leverage our new `project:/` prefix, so that new artifacts being generated contain paths with this new prefix instead of listing the full absolute path.\r\n\r\nThis issue is blocked by #5961, since we'll need the resolver to support reading these paths before we can start outputting them.\r\n\r\nI believe this is not a breaking change to Truffle, but we should verify that before moving forward with this.",
