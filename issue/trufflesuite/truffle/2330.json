    "body": "Yes, I'm starting to see and agree. So two options seem most appealing now. One is to enable GitHub Sponsors and include an Ethereum address or name in the FUNDING.yml file. This is how it would look and I have tested it:\r\n\r\n```yml\r\ncustom: ['ethereum/truffle.eth']\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou could replace truffle.eth with the actual address if you wanted to. Also, a real URL might be better, but not necessary. What I have above seems the most project agnostic.\r\n\r\nAnother option that I'm working on getting standardized is essentially a field in the package.json under something like support -> backing -> donations. It's still nebulous but there is work being done as linked to above",

Show your support here: https://github.com/lastmjs/enable-cryptocurrency-in-funding-yml\r\n\r\nAlso, anyone interested in making this a reality, please email opensource@github.com and ask for cryptocurrencies in FUNDING.yml.
