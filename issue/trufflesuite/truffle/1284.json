  "body": "This is more of a documentation request around compiling contracts with the optimizer enabled.\r\n\r\n**tldr;** It would be very helpful to know when would be the best time to enable the optimizer.\r\n\r\n**Background**\r\nI wrote a contract that cost quite a bit to deploy on main net.  I recompiled it with the optimizer turned on, and the cost of the contract was cut in nearly half.  I am trying to understand why this wouldn't be enabled by default.  It seems like there are optimization parameters that tunes it for reducing cost of initial deployment vs tuning it for high frequency usage, so maybe that has something to do with it?\r\n\r\n**Add'l info**\r\nFrom chatting with a couple of folks from the Truffle team, it seems like there could be some concerns / unknowns in regards to the safety of the optimized code, but it wasn't certain.\r\n\r\nIt was also pointed out that there is a maximum contract size of `0x6000` bytes, which results in an OOG error if the contract exceeds that.  In that case, the only option is to optimize/compress. See [EIP170](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-170.md) for more details.",
