  "body": "I'm trying to go from using the `testrpc` to using `geth` to test my project.\n\nHowever, I have no idea where to start.\n\nI'm running `geth` with: \n\n`geth --identity \"MyNodeName\" --genesis CustomGenesis.json --rpc --rpcport \"8000\" --rpccorsdomain \"*\" --datadir \"~/blockchains/VPSChain\" --port \"30303\" --nodiscover --ipcapi \"admin,db,eth,debug,miner,net,shh,txpool,personal,web3\" --rpcapi \"db,eth,net,web3\" --autodag --networkid 1900 --nat \"any\" --dev console`\n\nCustomGenesis.json:\n\n```\n{\n    \"nonce\": \"0x0000000000000042\", \n    \"mixhash\": \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\", \n    \"difficulty\": \"0x4000\", \n    \"alloc\": {},\n    \"coinbase\": \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\", \n    \"timestamp\": \"0x00\", \n    \"parentHash\": \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\", \n    \"extraData\": \"Custem Ethereum Genesis Block\", \n    \"gasLimit\": \"0xffffffff\"\n}\n```\n\nI change the host in `truffle.js` and the port to `8000`. It seems to connect but says it has no accounts, which is pretty obvious, but how would I go about configuring `geth` to have some (test) accounts? And ones that are perhaps the same as the ones I use for `testrpc`?\n\nHow is this workflow imagined?\n\n(Also when I try to deploy a `.sol` contract it gives `Error deploying Contracts: undefined`)\n",
