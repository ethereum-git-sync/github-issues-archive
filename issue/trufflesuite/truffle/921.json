  "body": "- [O] I've asked for help in the [Truffle Gitter](http://gitter.im/Consensys/truffle) before filing this issue.\r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\n## Issue\r\n\r\nAccording to the [documentation](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.23/units-and-global-variables.html#block-and-transaction-properties), `block.timestamp` should be the timestamp of the last mined block.\r\n\r\nHowever, in `truffle test` environment, `block.timestamp` keeps increasing(seemingly the current timestamp) when returned in a view function.\r\n\r\nCalling the function manually through web3 interface, it returns the expected value(unchanged timestamp of last mined block).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nFork https://github.com/vzts/block-timestamp-test, setup local mining node(e.g. ganache), run `truffle test`.\r\n\r\nBelow is the minimum example code:\r\n(in a solidity contract):\r\n```solidity\r\nfunction test() public view returns(uint, uint) {\r\n    return (block.timestamp, block.number);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n(in a truffle js test case):\r\n```javascript\r\nit(\"test\", async function () {\r\n    for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {\r\n        console.log(await contractInstance.test())\r\n        sleep(1000) // pseudo code for sleep\r\n    }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nShould return the same timestamp and the number for the last mined block upon every request (in an environment where no new transaction is executed(no new block is mined))\r\n\r\nSample output:\r\n> [\"1524690793\", \"157\"]\r\n> [\"1524690793\", \"157\"]\r\n> [\"1524690793\", \"157\"]\r\n> [\"1524690793\", \"157\"]\r\n> [\"1524690793\", \"157\"]\r\n> [\"1524690793\", \"157\"]\r\n> [\"1524690793\", \"157\"]\r\n\r\n## Actual Results\r\n\r\nReturning the \"current\"(not sure what is happening, but it seems so) timestamp.\r\n\r\nSample output:\r\n> [\"1524690799\", \"157\"]\r\n> [\"1524690800\", \"157\"]\r\n> [\"1524690801\", \"157\"]\r\n> [\"1524690802\", \"157\"]\r\n> [\"1524690803\", \"157\"]\r\n> [\"1524690804\", \"157\"]\r\n> [\"1524690805\", \"157\"]\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n* Operating System: macOS High Sierra 10.13.4\r\n* Ethereum client: Ganache 1.1.0\r\n* Truffle version (`truffle version`): 4.1.7\r\n* node version (`node --version`): 8.4.0\r\n* npm version (`npm --version`): 6.0.0\r\n",

    "body": "@cgewecke Thanks for looking into it! I've just tested this with other ethereum client(testrpc), and it looks like the issue with ganache-cli! In testrpc(the fork before ganache-cli was rebranded), it worked as expected(constant timestamp of last mined block), however in ganache-cli it yielded the increasing timestamp.\r\n\r\nAfter doing some research, I found it may have something to do with this issue(https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli/issues/336). I guess there is something messed up in interface layer inside ganache-cli, since accessing it with `truffle test` and with web3 interface are yielding two different results.\r\n\r\nAccording to [this old Q&A](https://forum.ethereum.org/discussion/2452/block-timestamp-a-k-a-now-in-constant-functions), Gav(I guess Gavin Wood, the guy who wrote the yellow paper) said:\r\n\r\n> _The return of block.timestamp can only be given as a best effort as will all other external execution environment parameters. Fundamentally, they're impossible to \"know\", except on the final mine, and since **constant functions are never mined, they can never be properly defined. In cpp they take on values as they would if the client were about to mine them.** It's a misunderstanding of the execution environment to believe 'now' would be wall time; all language is taken from the perspective of the contract executing, not from the user authoring/running._\r\n\r\nSo basically I think the people who design the client needs to define how `block.timestamp` behaves for constant functions(now a view or pure function), but they need to be consistent in how they want to define it. Right now I'm not sure how the key contributers in ganache-cli want to define it, but it's working inconsistently as far as I tested. It would be great if we can set a consensus on how `block.timestamp`(a.k.a `now`) should be defined in `eth_call`s and make it consistent over all interfaces.\r\n\r\nPersonally I think the `block.timestamp` should be the timestamp of last mined block since it's clear that calls are never mined. Or I would suggest to see how real-rpcs(parity or geth), has defined it.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for maintaining this great project! If you think it's more proper to move the issue to ganache-cli repo, please feel free to do so.",

    "body": "@vzts Update, just had a chat with @benjamincburns, the engineer who writes ganache.  He suggested there's enough ambiguity about correct behavior here that we should really look at how geth **and** parity handle this. If they both let the clock tick, ganache should tick. If only one lets the clock tick, ganache should side with keeping `block.timestamp` fixed at the latest block because that's more intuitive (and more useful for tests ).",

    "body": "@cgewecke Thanks for the update! Absolutely agree on benjamin's opinion of how we should define \"correct behavior\". Since ganache is a test node, it is preferable to emulate well how real node behaves in such issues, so that users don't get confused in the wild when they actually deploy. So much for today, I will let you know if I have any new observation. Cheers!🍻",
