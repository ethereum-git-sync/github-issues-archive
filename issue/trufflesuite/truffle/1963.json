    "body": "Tricky! Let me see what I can find real fast: there's a [yarn issue](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/4725), which is still open, and it looks like the [npm issue](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/2974) was closed as too heated? Eep! Alas, it's another tricky monorepo quirk.\r\n\r\nHave you looked into using [`npm link`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link.html) or [`yarn link`](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/link/)? This functionality might not meet your use case, but figured I'd offer the suggestion just in case.\r\n\r\nIn my experience, to really make something behave like an NPM package, you have publish it to NPM. I usually do this with an NPM org account. Might want to read the [NPM org documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/orgs/), but it's relatively easy to set up and publish, once you get the hang of it.\r\n\r\nThe process is essentially:\r\n1. Set up the NPM org account. Note that your org name can't conflict with your username.\r\n2. Update the package.json to change the package name to `@<org-name>/<package-name>` (so, e.g., rename `truffle-contract` to `@chebykin-forks/truffle-contract`).\r\n3. Publish by running `npm publish --access public`. This last bit is necessary for org-scoped packages.\r\n\r\nNote if you have changes that you're testing out, I recommend keeping your package name/version changes on a separate branch from the core code changes, to make it easier to pull your changes in should you decide to PR it.\r\n\r\nHope this helps. As for this issue, not sure if this belongs in Truffle's development documentation somewhere, but it could certainly be helpful. Especially if we can flesh out the steps a bit more to make it easier. I'll leave this open specifically for the task of adding the relevant contributor docs.\r\n\r\nThanks for raising this concern! Let me know if either of the suggestions work out for you.",
