However, Windows PowerShell and [Git For Windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/) (aka Git Bash) do not have this issue. Since the Command Prompt is such an old tool, I'm hesitant to support it. \n\nHowever, I could be convinced to allow an optional `truffleconfig.js`, or similar, instead of `truffle.js`. Do you guys have a need for using the Command Prompt vs. the newer consoles?\n",

    "body": "Hi Tim, thank you for your prompt attention to this issue.\n\nThe fix that you've provided should resolve _my_ issue, because now I know that I can rename the file to `truffle-config.js`. But even with this fix in place, I'm concerned that this will still be a barrier-to-entry for Truffle users on Windows.\n\nConsider: If a new Windows user is following [the docs](http://truffle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/compile/), then when they run `truffle compile` they will still encounter the same inscrutable error. If they're tenacious, they may Google the problem and find this bug report, but they may also just get frustrated and give up.\n\nHave you considered swapping `DEFAULT_CONFIG_FILENAME` and `BACKUP_CONFIG_FILENAME` so that all new projects are created with \"truffle-config.js\" as the default? In theory, any existing projects would continue to work via the `BACKUP_CONFIG_FILENAME` mechanism, while any new projects would \"just work\" -- even for Windows users who are using cmd.exe.\n\nI don't have any special attachment to cmd.exe but it's kind of the _de facto_ standard for Windows. After this, I probably will switch to using PowerShell -- but I doubt I'll be the last Windows user to try running Truffle through cmd.exe.\n",
