  "body": "## Issue\r\n\r\n`Profiler.updated()` currently works by checking the timestamp on artifacts and comparing them to the timestamp on the source.  The problem with this approach is that artifacts correspond to contracts, not sources.  So this would create a problem for e.g. any source with no contracts, with possible further problems depending on the exact implementation (I haven't looked into it).  `Profiler.updated()` should use something that's source-based, not contract-based.\r\n\r\nThere are various ways we could do this, but the right way, I guess, is hooking it up to Truffle DB and having it use that.  This could either use compilation timestamps, or simple comparison of contents.  Either way, that's what should be used.  (There are other things that could be done that wouldn't be reliant on Truffle DB, but they'd basically be duplicative of our efforts there, so I don't think it makes sense to do that...)\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n* Truffle version (`truffle version`): 5.1.61",
