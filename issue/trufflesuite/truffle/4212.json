  "body": "From our conversation on Tuesday:\r\n\r\n[scaffold-eth](https://github.com/austintgriffith/scaffold-eth) has a lot of useful components built into one boilerplate app. One of these is subgraph boilerplate generation that automatically copies over addresses and ABIs on contract deployment and use the graph cli to generate the necessary schemas from there. It could be interesting to isolate this functionality from the scaffold-eth repo and build it into Truffle (either natively or as a run plugin).\r\n\r\nAs we discussed on Tuesday it can also make sense to extend this functionality to more The Graph integration or extended code generation, so we can drop any ideas in this thread.",
