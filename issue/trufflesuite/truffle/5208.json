  "body": "At the time of writing, it takes roughly 30 minutes to do a complete CI run. The bulk of this time is spent running the various test suites, with the scenario tests taking the most time of any of them.\n\nI don't have any specific proposals at how to improve this just yet, but I thought I might capture a few goals here, and assuming that everyone agrees with the goals, we can brainstorm ideas and raise tickets under this epic to address them.\n\nGoals:\n\n - Make it fast for devs to get feedback when testing their code locally\n - Reduce the total (wall) time of the CI build by a factor of 2 or more \n\nSome (potential) solutions:\n\n- Take advantage of parallel test execution when running tests\n- Optimize test suite for total wall-clock runtime while preserving the tests ability to run safely\n- Introduce a reduced set of smoke tests that execute quickly in a local environment before pushing a change for a PR\n  - If it's fast enough, this should likely run as a pre-commit hook\n- Reduce highly redundant coverage in the scenario test suite\n- Refactor tests to avoid opening network sockets (e.g. in use of Ganache)\n",
