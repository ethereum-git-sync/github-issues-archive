  "body": "- [ ] I've [opened a support ticket](https://trufflesuite.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) before filing this issue.\r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\n## Issue\r\n\r\nWhat the issue is, in broad strokes.\r\n\r\n1. We are using a upgradeable proxy contract in truffle suite to deploy and upgrade using proxy patterns, when we deploy new proxy contract it is getting successful, but when we upgrade any contract and try to deploy an upgraded contract, it is getting failed every time. \r\n2. We have tried deploying on both Polygon Mainnet and Testnet\r\n3. We have also tried by changing the RPC. Nothing seems to work.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Deploy a proxy upgradeable contract using Openzeppelin SDK\r\n2. Update the contract code\r\n3. Deploy the upgraded Proxy contract, error will thrown / [object Object] output will be displayed instead of deploying the contract\r\n\r\nPlease provide the shortest amount of steps to reproduce your issue.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nContract should be deployed and transaction hash and other summary should be resulted as output\r\n\r\nWhat you expected to happen.\r\n\r\n## Actual Results\r\n\r\nAttaching the error logs for the reference\r\n1. https://mclo.gs/29w2HoT\r\n2. https://mclo.gs/lhsa0Id\r\n\r\nWhat actually happened. Please give examples and support it with screenshots, copied output or error messages.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\nWindows Operating System Environment\r\n\r\n* Operating System: \r\n* Ethereum client: Polygon | Web3.js\r\n* Truffle version (`truffle version`): Truffle v5.4.16 (core: 5.4.16)\r\n* node version (`node --version`): Node v14.17.4\r\n* npm version (`npm --version`): 6.14.14\r\n",

People tend to have a hard time with deployments to Polygon mainnet, so this could be related to that. Also, we've seen similar errors to the one you're showing when people have connection issues.\r\n\r\nRegardless, @tenthirtyone will do some investigating on this issue. Thanks for opening it!",
