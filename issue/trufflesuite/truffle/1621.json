  "body": "## Issue\r\n\r\nHaving the exact same project on two different paths yields two different swarm hashes for the same contract.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nSet up a truffle project via `truffle init` and create a sample project with a small contract:\r\n```solidity\r\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\r\n\r\ncontract Single {\r\n  uint256 public value;\r\n  constructor(uint256 x) public {\r\n    value = x;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCopy the same project via `cp -a` to a different path, and run `truffle compile` on both project folders, and then compare the ending of the bytecode for both of them:\r\n```bash\r\n~/Projects/tmp$ jq .bytecode truffle1/build/contracts/Single.json | tail -c200 \r\n00000000900480633fa4f24514604a575b600080fd5b60506066565b6040518082815260200191505060405180910390f35b6000548156fea165627a7a7230582046c187cb0c8190f1380419de50c96cd3b50ead7d62a6db28356b11a3c2307fdd0029\"\r\n~/Projects/tmp$ jq .bytecode truffle2/build/contracts/Single.json | tail -c200 \r\n00000000900480633fa4f24514604a575b600080fd5b60506066565b6040518082815260200191505060405180910390f35b6000548156fea165627a7a72305820821c5e2c55d7ceaa5cbc01a24c3ef3fcf69d49c80e741bb75db59c6d96e4d5090029\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the ending (apparently the swarm hash) changes between them, and the only difference is their paths.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nI would expect that the same contract, compiled with the same compiler version, yielded exactly the same bytecode. **This is especially important now that EXTCODEHASH is around the corner**, since it means that there is no unique codehash for a given contract source+compiler, but the same contract will have different codehashes depending on which path it was compiled.\r\n\r\nMy gut feeling is that this may be caused by truffle-compile passing absolute paths to solc. Perhaps using relative paths may help?\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n* Operating System: Ubuntu 18.10\r\n* Truffle version (`truffle version`): v5.0.1 (installed globally with nvm)\r\n* node version (`node --version`): v10.13.0\r\n* npm version (`npm --version`): 6.4.1\r\n",
