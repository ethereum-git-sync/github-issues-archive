  "body": "## Smart contracts created using Truffle have several dependencies such as \r\n\r\n 1. Truffle framework\r\n 2. Solc compiler\r\n 3. OpenZeppelin library\r\n 4. Ganache/Ethereum Client \r\n 5. Node\r\n 6. Npm\r\n\r\nThese need to be constantly compatible with each other as each go through various stages of maturity and release new versions.                                                                                                                \r\n\r\n- The truffle-config.js file where we can specify the solc compiler version is a great option to have now. However most contract development happens by using the openzeppelin library and since openzeppelin did not release a v5 compatible library at that time, those contracts wont compile anymore till they recently came up with a truffle v5 compatible version.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n## Request\r\n\r\n-Is it possible to dynamically incorporate all dependencies in a configuration file such as truffle-config.js or package.json file where we can simply specify the version numbers of each of these dependencies and not have to install new versions every time a new version is released. This can be achieved only if all the other components are collaborated.\r\n\r\nFor eg. in order to use web3 with java we use the webj library.  This library can simply be specified as a dynamic dependency in a typical Java Maven project pom.xml file like so:\r\n`\r\n<dependency>\r\n\t<groupId>org.web3j</groupId>\r\n\t<artifactId>core</artifactId>\r\n\t<version>4.0.1</version>\r\n</dependency>\r\n<dependency>\r\n\t<groupId>org.web3j</groupId>\r\n\t<artifactId>abi</artifactId>\r\n\t<version>4.0.1</version>\r\n</dependency>\r\n`\r\n\r\n- Whenever we want to use a different version of web3j we simple change the version number and the library is included dynamically in the project because of its availability in org.web3j.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n## Suggestion\r\n\r\nIs it possible to do something similar in truffle such as perhaps in the truffle-config.js or package.json file include options for specifying versions of various components without having to install them explicitly.\r\n\r\n  // Configure your compilers\r\n  compilers: {\r\n    solc: {\r\n       version: \"0.5.2\",    // Fetch exact version from solc-bin (default: truffle's version)\r\n      // docker: true,        // Use \"0.5.1\" you've installed locally with docker (default: false)\r\n      // settings: {          // See the solidity docs for advice about optimization and evmVersion\r\n      //  optimizer: {\r\n      //    enabled: false,\r\n      //    runs: 200\r\n      //  },\r\n      //  evmVersion: \"byzantium\"\r\n      // }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\nlibraries:{\r\n   openzeppelin-solidity:{\r\n        version: 2.1 rc2,\r\n         source: \"https://registry.npmjs.org/openzeppelin-solidity/-/openzeppelin-solidity-2.1.0-rc.2.tgz\"\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nclient:{\r\n  ganache:{\r\n       version: version number\r\n       source: \"url to the client\"\r\n   }\r\n   geth:{\r\n        version: version number\r\n        source: \"url to the client\"\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n \r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThis way any component that has a new version released can be dynamically included in the truffle project without having to reinstall everything.\r\n\r\nHope I got my point across and hope it helps for future development.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
