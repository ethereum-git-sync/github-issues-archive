  "body": "## Issue\r\n\r\nTruffle Encoder is intended to be compatible with the current Truffle Contract interface.  However, it currently has no way to specify an optional block parameter for calls.  This should be fixed.\r\n\r\nNote that right now, Truffle Contract, for calls, allows for an additional argument to calls, which is the block; this can go either in place of the tx options (if they're absent), or after it (if they're present).\r\n\r\nNotes on this:\r\n1. This should only be allowed when explicitly turned on, much like tx options.\r\n2. The block should probably also be added to tx options, so it can be read from there; that would only require tx options to be turned on, not require this new additional flag.\r\n3. When this new additional flag is turned on, it should present the interface above, currently used by Truffle Contract; the block parameter would go in the output tx options.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n* Truffle version (`truffle version`): 5.8.3",
