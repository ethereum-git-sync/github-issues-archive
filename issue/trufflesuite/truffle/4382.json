  "body": "## Issue\r\n\r\nThis issue is intended to consolidate several related issues (#2194, #3147, #4807, #4327, #4114).  The basic issue is, if you're using `truffle develop` or `truffle test`, how can you set Ganache options in the Ganache instance they spin up (like with config settings), and also how can you know that you can do this?\r\n\r\nFor `develop`, well, actually, you can set a lot of Ganache options by setting them in the `develop` network config!  The problem is, none of this is documented (#2194, #4114).  So, that needs to be addressed.\r\n\r\nAlso, in `develop`, the `gas` option is used to set the *block* gas limit in Ganache.  That doesn't make sense, and @fainashalts recently changed the analogous behavior in `test` in #4323.  The `gas` option should not be used to set the block gas limit, and a new option (`gasLimit`?) should be introduced for that purpose.\r\n\r\nNote that `truffle develop` always checks the `develop` network setting, even if another network is set; but that might not be an error, that might just be how `truffle develop` works.\r\n\r\nOK, so for `truffle develop` the code is already there, and just needs to be documented, and have the `gas` thing fixed.  What about `truffle test`?\r\n\r\nIn `truffle test`, these options *cannot* be set, with only one exception.  Namely, you can set `genesis_time`, and only that.  But this isn't taken from the `test` network config, but rather the config's *top level*??  And no, this isn't some weird getter that exists in Truffle Config.  Of course, due to #4327, trying to have these options live in the `test` network config wouldn't really work at the moment; #4327 would have to be fixed first.\r\n\r\n(Note I say there's only one exception, but prior to #4323 there were two exceptions, in that `gas` would set the block gas limit; but of course #4323 removed this, because having `gas` set the block gas limit is pretty bad.)\r\n\r\nSo, for `truffle test`, the code *isn't* already there, and needs to be added.  (Except for `genesis_time`, which is there, and needs to be redone, although presumably without breaking backward compatibility.)  And also then once it's added it needs to be documented.\r\n\r\nEdit: I've now also added #4807 for the remaining non-documentation work here.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n* Truffle version (`truffle version`): 5.4.17",
