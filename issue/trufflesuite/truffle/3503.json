It leads to \"contract has not been deployed\" error.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nJust check [this repository](https://github.com/nicklatkovich/truffle-issue).\r\n\r\nTo verify that the problem is with the import, just comment out the first line in the first migration.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nJust successful migration.\r\n\r\n## Actual Results\r\n\r\nSecond migration drops with folowing error:\r\n\r\n```${CONTRACT_NAME} has not been deployed to detected network (network/artifact mismatch)```\r\n\r\nBut after migration drops, then address from firsts migration appears in artifacts.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n* Operating System: `Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS`\r\n* Ethereum client: `Ganache CLI v6.9.1 (ganache-core: 2.10.2)`\r\n* Truffle version: `Truffle v5.1.51 (core: 5.1.51)`\r\n* node version: `v11.13.0`\r\n* npm version: `6.7.0`\r\n* yarn version: `1.21.1`\r\n",

When you require `utils/index` at the start of migration 2, you get a cached version of `utils/index`, which has the old version of the artifact. Thus, `getContractA()` doesn't have any information about where it's deployed.\r\n\r\nLet us know if that fixes the problem! Thanks!",

    "body": "Oh, clear. I thought that getting addresses from the artifact folder is obtained when calling the `deployed()` methods, and saving addresses is immediately after the change. But if the receipt of addresses occurs at the time of calling `artifacts.require`, and the saving is strictly after the migration, then this explains the actual results of this issue.\r\n\r\nOk, so, if I need to use some file in migrations, I don't need to import artifacts there, but pass them as arguments. And this solution really works, uploaded the corrected code to the [fix branch](https://github.com/nicklatkovich/truffle-issue/tree/fix).\r\n\r\nThanks for the explanation of behavior.",
