  "body": "Today `@truffle/config` allows users to specify a list of target networks, and at runtime a user must select a specific network for most operations that they're looking to perform.\r\n\r\nThis was a great design back when dApp devs generally only cared about one L1 chain, but with the rise of the L2 ecosystem, many dApps are written to deploy to multiple chains. Naturally, the desire to deploy a dApp across multiple chains gives rise to a desire to perform actions (e.g. `truffle migrate`) that operate on multiple networks at the same time.\r\n\r\nWe refer to this second-order grouping as an \"environment.\" While the use of environments should not be limited to only this case, we expect that the most common usage of this feature will be to specify groups of provider definitions to be used for accessing different \"deployment tiers\" such as their local dev network (e.g. `ganache`), one or more testnet environments, and/or one or more production environments.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this being defined as a config feature, this will likely have very cross-cutting impacts on Truffle as a whole. As a result, this issue is being created as an epic so that this work can be scoped by key project area.\r\n\r\nNote: This was captured from an internal session where we discussed **potential** future breaking changes for major releases. Until the team assigns this ticket, this is merely a proposal, and not a commitment to make this specific change.\r\n\r\nNotes from meetings about this topic can be found here: https://hackmd.io/DW9pzTwUQkG1hof8iG2G4Q?both ",
