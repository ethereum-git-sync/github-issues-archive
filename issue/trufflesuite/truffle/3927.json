  "body": "## Issue\r\n\r\nIt's possible to have one contract link two distinct libraries with the same name.  Currently the linker operates based on name alone, so it will get these cases wrong.\r\n\r\nNote that fixing this will require a bunch of changes... in particular, it's not really possible to fix this in contracts made from artifacts, because the legacy bytecode format has no way to include more information about the library beyond its name.  So, we made need Truffle DB in more use before we can really do much of anything about this.  #3905 is intended as a first step toward remedying this, but just a first step.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n* Truffle version (`truffle version`): 5.2.4",
