  "body": "## Issue\r\n\r\nTruffle already provides an opt-in analytics system, but it requires running a specific command to turn it on. We know there are users who would be more than happy to let us collect these anonymous stats, but we haven't wanted to waste precious CLI screen real estate just to pester people about this.\r\n\r\nNow, with Truffle Dashboard, there are likely unobtrusive ways to leverage the significantly increased display resolution and put this ask on-screen in a way that encourages users to opt-in without being annoying noodges about it. This would allow us to collect more information about how people use Truffle, what errors they commonly face, etc... ultimately giving us on the team the power to make informed decisions about what to work on next.\r\n\r\nCouple thoughts:\r\n- We should only ask the user once, or at most maybe once every six months. Maybe we could even check back with opted-in users, like, \"hey, you still cool to share this data with us?\"\r\n- If a user declines to opt-in, could we ask a follow-up question, like, \"would you mind if we phone home to say you did not opt-in?\" I know some applications do telemetry to report this situation without user permission, but that's not really cool... it'd be nice to understand what the opt-in rate is, but not if it means loss of consent in the process.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n* Operating System: \r\n* Ethereum client:\r\n* Truffle version (`truffle version`): v5.5.3\r\n* node version (`node --version`):\r\n* npm version (`npm --version`): \r\n",

We need to modify the prompt to actually allow them to opt out",
