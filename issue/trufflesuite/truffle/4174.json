So, I'm filing issues to cover what remains.\r\n\r\nPR #4127 makes it possible to write scripts that will run at console startup... but it doesn't allow a lot of the things you'd want to do with such a script, because such scripts have no access to console globals (such as `web3`, `accounts`, and, most importantly, the various contract abstractions).  A lot of what you'd want to do with a console startup script involves the contract abstractions.  So, we should make console globals available in startup scripts to make such scripts more useful.\r\n\r\n(Alternatively, we could just make `artifacts` or something similar available.)\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n* Truffle version (`truffle version`): 5.4.0",
