Any minimal example might never trigger the issue it seems.\r\n\r\nBut basically I have a function that reverts if 5 minutes has not passed. I use `await time.increase(600)` to get passed 5 minutes. It works 99% of the time, but sometimes it randomly does not. also for some reason calling `console.log((await time.latest()).toString())` sometimes help.\r\n\r\nI'm using `@openzeppelin/test-helpers` for `time`",

    "body": "You can do this if you call `evm_mine` with Ganache manually, but this might not have a good answer right now if you want to stick with @openzeppelin/test-helpers and Ganache insta-mining. Maybe the root of this issue should be opened as a [ganache-core issue](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-core/issues) to add an enhancement to make this possible.\r\n\r\nNot sure what's actionable here in the meantime; leaving this in our Icebox for future consideration.\r\n\r\nThanks for raising an interesting question!",
