  "body": "- [X] I've asked for help in the [Truffle Gitter](http://gitter.im/Consensys/truffle) before filing this issue.\r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\n## Issue\r\nUpon contract consutruction I would like to be able to read the event logs to ensure an Event was emitted during.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nAt present there is no way I can see or is documented to be able to easily use something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nc = await MyContract.new();\r\n// this wont work...\r\ntruffleAssert.eventEmitted(c, \"ContractCreated\", (ev) => {\r\n        return ev.param === myInputParam;\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy contract constructor will emit a ContractCreated event. I want to assert that this happened and the values are as expected. The event itself and its content is irrelevant. Its more the process of asserting events were emitted and contract construction time is important.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nI would expect or want to know how I can do this assertion and use the `assertEventEmitted` function above.\r\n\r\nCurrently the only way I can see to accomplish this is so:\r\n```\r\n        let event = c.allEvents({fromBlock: 0, toBlock: 'latest'});\r\n        event.watch(function (error, result) {\r\n            if (!error){\r\n                console.log(\"Result: \", result);\r\n                // or some assertions similar to assertEventEmitted(...)\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Actual Results\r\n\r\nAs above, I can't find an elegant way to read the event logs emitted during contract construction using the truffle toolset.\r\n\r\nWhen you send a transaction in you get the result object you can assert, upon contract creation the object returned is different and as such the logs are not available to check for event emission.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n* Operating System: Mac OSX\r\n* Ethereum client: none at present, only inside ganache-cli: 6.1.8\r\n* Truffle version (`truffle version`): 4.1.11\r\n* node version (`node --version`): 9.2.1\r\n* npm version (`npm --version`): 6.4.0\r\n",

    "body": "@michaeljohnbennett The new contract instance has a transactionHash property which should allow you to fetch the receipt (which has a logs property). Truffle does some post-processing of the transaction return value (see [here](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/blob/develop/packages/truffle-contract/contract.js#L184-L187) ) so you might have to extract the logs from the receipt yourself for the truffleAssert library, not sure. \r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nc = await MyContract.new();\r\nconst receipt = web3.eth.getTransactionReceipt(c.transactionHash);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother thing you might be interested in is Truffle V5 (which is available in pre-release form from npm as `truffle@next`). It uses Web3 1.0 and lets you listen for `transactionHash` and `receipt` events per transaction. You could do something like:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nMyContract\r\n  .new()\r\n  .onReceipt( receipt => {\r\n     truffleAssert(..etc..)\r\n     done(); // Tell mocha you finished\r\n  });\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are draft release notes for V5 at #1129 with more detail about the new TruffleContract features and info about breaking changes.\r\n      \r\n                  ",

    "body": "@michaeljohnbennett Thanks for opening and apologies - after looking into this a bit I see it's not the easiest thing to do and the decoding utility isn't well exposed.  \r\n\r\nThe following worked for me: Install [web3-eth-abi](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/web3-eth-abi.html#).\r\n```\r\nnpm install --save-dev web3-eth-abi\r\n```\r\nThen:\r\n```javascript\r\nconst abi = require('web3-eth-abi');\r\n....\r\nc = await MyContract.new();\r\nconst receipt = web3.eth.getTransactionReceipt(c.transactionHash);\r\n\r\n// Decode\r\nconst inputs = MyContract.abi.find(item => item.name === 'ContractCreated').inputs;\r\nconst log = receipt.logs[0]; // Assuming you have a single constructor event\r\nconst data = log.data; // Non-indexed event data\r\nconst topics = (log.topics.length > 1) ? log.topics.slice(1) : []; // Indexed event data\r\nconst decodedLog = abi.decodeLog(inputs, data, topics); \r\n\r\n// Test\r\nassert(decodedLog.param === myInputParam)\r\n```\r\n\r\nTLDR; watching seems simpler? In Web3 1.0 all of this decoding happens automatically for the receipt and you can just access the `returnValues` field of a log item.  \r\n\r\nAlso agree this subject is not documented well enough although we're also the cusp of using better implementation so .... hopefully people will be able to find a solution to this more easily now that you've raised it. \r\n\r\n",

    "body": "@michaeljohnbennett The formal release will probably be in September. We're releasing as a `beta` next week and the prerelease is available right now. \r\n\r\nI don't *think* there will be substantial changes to the API for truffle-contract between now and formal release, so the only downside to upgrading is that there might be  bugs :) \r\n\r\nWe've done quite a bit of testing to try to make sure V5 works and we have a couple large projects already running it in their suites but there will likely still be a handful of issues to sort out. \r\n\r\nGoing to close this for house-keeping but thanks so much for opening.",

    "body": "Thanks @cgewecke super helpful feedback on this issue, I'm using this framework a lot for projects, looking forward to the next gen release. I'll take it onboard for the next iteration of our current project. I need to get this out the door for a MVP so jumping to Alpha release is just a bit too risky right now.\r\n\r\nI also linked this ticket to a stack overflow ethereum question I raised as well to hopefully give some breadcrumbs to people searching for an answer.\r\n\r\nI do a lot of TDD/BDD testing so this kind of stuff is always on my mind on how best to test and break stuff, handy in solidity I think.",
