I hope/think it won't take a lot of efforts to create this feature and I believe it will be very useful (not critical) to have it.  \r\n",

    "body": "@igor-dulger thanks for following up with this!\r\n\r\nJust a quick note: because `truffle test` reverts the blockchain after each `contract()` block, it won't be possible to use this log after-the-fact to debug transactions, at least until we can come up with a strategy to get around this issue.\r\n\r\nRegardless, we'll look into prioritizing this. It shouldn't be too difficult, but if you're interested in helping it along, maybe propose a JSON format to adhere to? Thanks!",
