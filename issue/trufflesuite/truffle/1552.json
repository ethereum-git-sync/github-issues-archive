  "body": "It would be awesome if truffle could elegantly use installed/configured plugins that bring their own web3 provider for any chain (or at least Ethereum-forked chains) to use in migrations & testing.\r\n\r\nThe various nitty gritty differences among enterprise/permissioned chains is a huge blocker for seamlessly enabling this right now. There is potentially a lot to consider when adding native support for each specific given chain.\r\n\r\nA short-to-mid-term solution is to use `truffle run` to experiment with and pave the way forward for enterprise integration. The biggest benefit of doing so – a part from the knowledge and familiarity gained while working on a plugin for a specific enterprise chain – is \"pluggability\" (i.e. the ability to not have to merge and maintain specific enterprise support as legacy code).\r\n\r\nOne idea is the ability to do something like `truffle run <chain> migrate` or `truffle run <chain> test` that uses plugin/chain-specific code to essentially mimic and/or do the same thing that `truffle migrate` and `truffle test` already does (using that chain's specific web3 provider).\r\n\r\n(Self-assigning to keep open, free for anyone to work on)",
