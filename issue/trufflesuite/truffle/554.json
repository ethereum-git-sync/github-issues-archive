  "body": "It would be nice if one could specify dependencies for which migrations are run when the project's migrations are run. For example, suppose there is a framework written in Solidity which requires certain contracts to be deployed. A project using that framework might specify its use using NPM or EthPM.\r\n\r\nIn a different project, maybe there is a configuration key which specifies the dependency migrations for which this project's migration depends. Basically, Truffle will `truffle migrate` those dependencies automatically before running the project's dependencies, and in the case of the aforementioned example project, the framework's migration will be run first.\r\n\r\nI dunno whether it would be better to require all dependencies including child deps to be specified in order, or whether the deps should be toposorted and migrated in that order.",

    "body": "I've started a branch containing a test scenario where this might take shape: https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/compare/develop...cag:migrate-deps\r\n\r\nI think that build artifacts for dependency migrations should exist in the package folder's build folder. This would help backwards compatibility and avoid name collisions between packages, as artifacts are not aware of the file they came from, so to speak.\r\n\r\nMaybe it would be good if the migrations can just be inferred from the `package.json`s of the projects? That would require a toposort and might break backwards compatibility, though I think this could be the easiest way to go, and I don't think any Truffle project in the wild relies on migrations in child dependencies not being run. We could introduce an opt-out configuration parameter in case a project's dependency migrations aren't supposed to be run.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we could make an opt-in configuration parameter for packages.\r\n\r\nHaving read the https://github.com/ethpm/ethpm-spec I think that that is maybe also something to strive for, though some differences about how ethpm is (a bunch of pointers to stuff on IPFS, mostly contracts and blockchain locations) vs how npm is (tarballs with build artifacts, migrations, scripts and tests in addition to the contracts) maybe should indicate that npm should be approached somewhat differently? It's reasonable to assume that the migration scripts are also shipped with the packages on npm.\r\n\r\nAlso there is a way to artifacts.require ethpm packages documented already. I admit I don't know terribly much about it though, but it uses a 'package/Contract' name format. I am using an '@org/package:Contract' name format in my fork. Dunno if that is a good or bad idea, but considering artifacts would be '@org/package/build/contracts/Contract' if migrations succeed, maybe that makes sense? I dunno, what do you think?\r\n\r\nAlso, I heard @cgewecke was working on this...\r\n\r\nAlso hi @gnidan ",

We were talking about this this morning and thought that you're probably in the best position to know what's needed because you have a real use case. \r\n\r\nI'm just eventing out the migrations so that they can have reporters and be made interactive, more informative, etc. And use async/await more intuitively.  \r\n\r\nThis work sound quite close to artifact level stuff that @gnidan is working on, which inevitably touches migrations. . . \r\n\r\nAnyway awesome!
