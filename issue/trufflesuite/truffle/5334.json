  "body": "## Issue\r\n\r\nI recently added raw data for events in the txlog (#5324).  This suggests that the same should happen for calls and returns (presumably just external calls/returns, the idea doesn't make a lot of sense for internal calls and returns).\r\n\r\nHow this would work would have to be figured out, though.  For calls it makes sense to attach it to the `callexternal` action.  But what about for returns?  One could attach it to the same action, but that doesn't mesh well with how txlog is designed -- consider where error decodings go; they don't go on the external call, they go on the internal call that threw!  This stems from the original intent that txlog would be used as the basis for a visualizer.\r\n\r\nSo assuming we're not redoing that (and I don't want to redo that!), we'd need to determine where the raw return data would go.  Although I suppose I could possibly implement raw call data without that...?\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n* Truffle version (`truffle version`): 5.5.22",
