  "body": "## TL;DR\r\nThis proposes making an error message more helpful with additional context information.\r\n\r\n## Issue\r\nI get the \"Could not connect to your Ethereum client\" error frequently, especially in load testing, regardless of Ethereum client being used.  I assume that what's happening (also in [issue 1461](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/issues/1461)) is that the client is just getting overloaded with too many pending requests, and stops responding to new ones.  \r\n\r\nIf the issue were **not** an overloaded server that had just successfully responded to several transactions, and really was a connectivity issue, it would be helpful to know what configuration information was being read and used. \r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\nSet up a basic Truffle project to work with Ganache, don't start Ganache, and run `truffle migrate --reset`.\r\n\r\n## Actual Results\r\nError message: \r\n>Could not connect to your Ethereum client. Please check that your Ethereum client:\r\n    - is running\r\n    - is accepting RPC connections (i.e., \"--rpc\" option is used in geth)\r\n    - is accessible over the network\r\n    - is properly configured in your Truffle configuration file (truffle.js)\r\n\r\n## Expected Results\r\nThe same error, but with more specific information about where it was trying to connect to.  \r\n>Could not connect to your Ethereum client at http://127.0.0.1:7545 (Network ID: 5777).\r\nPlease check that your Ethereum client:\r\n    - is running\r\n    - is accepting RPC connections (i.e., \"--rpc\" option is used in geth)\r\n    - is accessible over the network\r\n    - is properly configured in your Truffle configuration file (truffle.js), especially if the server information in the first line of this error does not match what you expect.\r\n\r\nI would only expect \"Network ID\" to be there if it had been specified. \r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n* Operating System: Windows 10 pro\r\n* Ethereum client: For this Issue, none\r\n* Truffle version (`truffle version`): 4.1.15\r\n* node version (`node --version`): 9.3.0\r\n* npm version (`npm --version`):  6.5.0\r\n",

    "body": "Great to close a comment without giving a resolution to the issue.  I am running Windows 10 pro and I am having the same issue.  Now you will see that the ip address is different that is because under ganache I have  tried three different ones with the same results starting with 127.0.0.1 then going to 127.19.0.1 and finally with 127.17.224.1  all with the exact same results.  The only thing that changed was the ip address.
