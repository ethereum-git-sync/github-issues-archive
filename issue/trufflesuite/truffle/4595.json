  "body": "## Issue\r\n\r\nI just realized we don't have an open issue for this (even though this has been a thing for a while)... I don't think it's particularly high-priority, but I figure it ought to at least be listed somewhere.\r\n\r\nSuppose you have a transaction with multiple failed contract creations, each of which was initiated was the `CREATE` opcode (as opposed to `CREATE2`, and as opposed to being the initial transaction).  Then the debugger will not distinguish their mapping keys from one another; any mapping keys in one will also be applied to all the others.\r\n\r\nNote that once we've done something about #2894, this issue should basically go away; and until we do something about #2894, I don't see any easy way of addressing this (although it's not necessarily impossible).\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nUse the `Tester` contract from the `creation-failure` test case in `solidity-test-cases`.  Run `mixup(2)`; be sure to give it a lot of gas, as otherwise it'll run out.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nIn the inner most constructor invocation before the result, the value of `mixup` ought to be displayed as `Map { 0 => 81 }`.\r\n\r\n## Actual Results\r\n\r\nInstead, it's displayed as `Map { 0 => 81, 1 => 0, 2 => 0}`, the mapping keys from other failed attempts to create this contract having been inappropriately applied to this one.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n* Truffle version (`truffle version`): 5.4.26",
