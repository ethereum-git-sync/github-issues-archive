    "body": "> Brother, I already install node using nvm, why do I need to install node once again? I don't get it.\r\n\r\n@lawweiliang As you know, Node.js requires a build system because large parts of it — and its dependencies — are written in languages that require compilation. See [NodeJS dependency page.](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/meta/topics/dependencies/#dependencies)\r\n\r\nThe error messages in the original ticket description, log the necessary runtimes could not be found for node-gyp to work, and suggest installing the latest version of Visual Studio with Desktop development with C++. [NodeJS' Windows installation](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installs this as part of its process, however, since you already have a node version manager installed, I recommend following [Microsoft's troubleshooting page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-windows#install-nvm-windows-nodejs-and-npm) to get your Node environment set up correctly.\r\n\r\nAlso, to help us better support Windows, which Node version Manager do you use? Is it Corey Butler's windows-nvm, volta, nvs, or another tool? Thanks in advance.\r\n",

I took your advice and installed node and npm with `nvm` and then was able to install truffle with the latest versions.

I install nvm for windows, but after running `npm i -g truffle` I still got the same error as mentioned in this issue, `gyp err`,\r\nI found some help from[ here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57879150/how-can-i-solve-error-gypgyp-errerr-find-vsfind-vs-msvs-version-not-set-from-c), I installed visual studio with c++ development tools, after that I ran `npm i -g windows-build-tools` and this worked for nvm version 12.18.3 in my case, then I installed truffle. For now I guess the error was from the build tools not present so this will work `npm i -g windows-build-tools`, although not sure what worked for me, but I followed these steps and I was able to install truffle without any error message this time.\r\n\r\n",
