  "body": "## Issue\r\nWhen attempting to use @truffle/contract in Typescript, the default types don't permit use as documented, and have assorted other redundancies and issues.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\nIn a new folder/project, \r\n`npm i @truffle/contract`\r\nCreate a file `example.ts` with the following contents:\r\n````typescript\r\nimport TruffleContract from '@truffle/contract';\r\nconst getDeployedInstanceFromContract = function(truffleContract: TruffleContract.Contract) {\r\n\treturn new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\r\n\t\ttruffleContract.deployed()\r\n\t\t.then(function(instance) {\r\n\t\t\t//Initial processing here which motivates use of a wrapper omitted for minimal example.\r\n\t\t\tresolve(instance);\r\n\t\t}).catch(function(err: unknown) {\r\n\t\t\t//Error processing here omitted for minimal example.\r\n\t\t\treject(err);\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t});\r\n};\r\n````\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\nBased on the [documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@truffle/contract), I would expect this to compile and run without a problem. \r\n\r\n## Actual Results\r\nThe call to .deployed() has a compilation error: \r\n>This expression is not callable.\r\n  No constituent of type 'string | number | boolean | any[] | { [k: string]: any; }' is callable.ts(2349)\r\n\r\nThe next line also has an error:\r\n>Parameter 'instance' implicitly has an 'any' type.ts(7006)\r\n\r\nThe second is more easily overcome but raises the issue that there should be a separate type for this (e.g. TruffleContract.Instance) and there doesn't appear to be one, though the \"Contract Instance API\" is broken out under a [separate heading in documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@truffle/contract#user-content-contract-instance-api) that presents a separate set of available functions.  The documentation there also notes that a function call returns an object that \"looks like this\" but doesn't have a Type specification available in the Truffle package.\r\n\r\n## Cause Analysis\r\nThe typings for @truffle/contract create a namespace TruffleContract with just one member: 'Contract', which is a renamed version of `@truffle/contract-schema/ContractObject` which is a passthrough from `@truffle/contract-schema/spec/ContractObject`.\r\nThe index.d.ts file there disables the linter and says the following:\r\n> This file was automatically generated by json-schema-to-typescript.\r\n> DO NOT MODIFY IT BY HAND. Instead, modify the source JSONSchema file,\r\n> and run `yarn prepare` inside your local packages/contract-schema\r\n\r\nThis typing file is not very useful.  It has a lot of repetition in typings, for example from `ABI`:\r\n````typescript\r\n//... \r\n | (\r\n      | {\r\n          [k: string]: any;\r\n        }\r\n      | {\r\n          [k: string]: any;\r\n        }\r\n    )\r\n  | (\r\n      | {\r\n          [k: string]: any;\r\n        }\r\n      | {\r\n          [k: string]: any;\r\n        }\r\n    )\r\n  | {\r\n      type: \"receive\";\r\n      stateMutability: \"payable\";\r\n    }\r\n  | (\r\n      | {\r\n          [k: string]: any;\r\n        }\r\n      | {\r\n          [k: string]: any;\r\n        }\r\n    )\r\n````\r\nThese typings also aren't very granular, e.g. `Abi` doesn't allow you to have a NormalFunction vs ConstructorFunction vs. EventABI type even though those are broken out in the spec.  Some are over-broad; e.g. the Solidity 'Type' string could be more strictly typed into an enum, though the tuple representation found in the json is more compact and having some scripting would help.\r\n\r\nThe absence of the documented functions is also an issue as noted above.\r\n\r\nAs a solution, I would suggest shifting away from the current script package used to generate the types file, and replacing it with either another script and/or manual generation of the file.  \r\n\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n* Operating System: Win10 Pro\r\n* Ethereum client: N/A\r\n* Truffle version (`truffle version`): node_modules/@truffle/contract/package.json shows version 4.4.10. In contract-schema it's 3.4.5.\r\n* node version (`node --version`): v16.13.1\r\n* npm version (`npm --version`): v7.24.0\r\n",
