    "body": "Ah @michael-spengler, what I mean by library is just \"something with a JS interface\". Truffle doesn't _really_ provide a JS interface, it provides a CLI interface. There are individual packages in the monorepo that _do_ provide JS library interfaces, but the main top-level entrypoints to Truffle itself (e.g. `truffle test`, `truffle migrate`) are not designed for use inside JS (for instance, they print colorized console output instead of returning JS values)\r\n\r\nYou might be thinking along different lines than I am, though, so would love to hear more of your thoughts!\r\n\r\n> Whether it is via truffle being a framework or whether exposed by single methods like in the current draft seems to me less important than the fact that it needs to be implemented in TypeScript (if I get things correctly).\r\n\r\nIf TS is required then this will certainly have to wait a long time - we've been converting things to TS here and there, but we're nowhere near close to having all of Truffle written in TS, and probably won't be done with that for years.\r\n\r\n> My feeling is that a strong simplification can come along with this.\r\n\r\nYou're probably right, but sounds like a challenge to implement :)",

    "body": "> Ah @michael-spengler, what I mean by library is just \"something with a JS interface\". Truffle doesn't _really_ provide a JS interface, it provides a CLI interface. There are individual packages in the monorepo that _do_ provide JS library interfaces, but the main top-level entrypoints to Truffle itself (e.g. `truffle test`, `truffle migrate`) are not designed for use inside JS (for instance, they print colorized console output instead of returning JS values)\r\n> \r\n> You might be thinking along different lines than I am, though, so would love to hear more of your thoughts!\r\n> \r\n> > Whether it is via truffle being a framework or whether exposed by single methods like in the current draft seems to me less important than the fact that it needs to be implemented in TypeScript (if I get things correctly).\r\n> \r\n> If TS is required then this will certainly have to wait a long time - we've been converting things to TS here and there, but we're nowhere near close to having all of Truffle written in TS, and probably won't be done with that for years.\r\n> \r\n> > My feeling is that a strong simplification can come along with this.\r\n> \r\n> You're probably right, but sounds like a challenge to implement :)\r\n\r\nThanks for these inputs. Let's see how this evolves. I'm also still getting used to the deno style :) In some sense the console / terminal became a kind of webbrowser with the deno approach - not for pages but for code --> and somehow in this sense any deno module can  be seen as a (remote) cli - leveraging this along the way could be a cool thing...
