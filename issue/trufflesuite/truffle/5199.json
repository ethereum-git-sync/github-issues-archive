    "body": "OK, since the current state of this is apparently unclear, I'm going to summarize what's currently going on with this.\r\n\r\nOur prettier settings are entirely standardized; there's a single `.prettierrc.json` at the workspace root and no others.\r\n\r\nESLint is a bit messier.  Here's how this is currently organized.\r\n\r\nFirst, there's the `.eslintrc.json` at the workspace root.  This applies to all packages.\r\n\r\nSecondly, some packages have their own `.eslintrc.json`, but these typically simply import the top-level file `.eslintrc.package.json`.  The point of these is to set up testing globals.  I guess all packages could have this, but currently they don't.  This could possibly be standardized a bit more, or moved into the top-level `.eslintrc.json`; however, it's worth noting that different packages organize their tests differently, and so it may not be possible to fully standardize this unless test organization is also standardized.\r\n\r\n(Actually, checking, I see that the packages that actually customize things are `dashboard`, `dashboard-message-bus`, and `truffle`.  The former two use theirs to set up some additional environments, while the last does so due to the unique way its tests are organized.)\r\n\r\nFinally, you'll notice that wherever in our codebase there's a Truffle project embedded, it will have its own `.eslintrc.json`, that imports the top-level file `.eslintrc.truffle.json`.  This is in order to set up environments and globals for Truffle tests and migrations.  (I had mistakenly thought that the `initsSource` was a special case here, but it's not.)\r\n\r\nAnyway, that's what's up with that at present!",
