  "body": "- [ ] I've asked for help in the [Truffle Gitter](http://gitter.im/Consensys/truffle) before filing this issue.\r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\n## Issue\r\n\r\nIf there are multiple sol files with the same name but under different folders in contracts, for example if there's 3 sol files in contracts\r\n\r\n- contracts/Game.sol\r\n- contracts/Game1/Game.sol\r\n- contracts/Game2/Game.sol\r\n\r\nOnly one artifact will be generated when running `truffle compile`, because it's overwritten by the last contract compiled, typically by the one with greatest lexicographic order in full path\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nMake 3 contracts in contracts folder, with any code, as long as the 3 contracts are different\r\n\r\n- contracts/Game.sol\r\n- contracts/Game1/Game.sol\r\n- contracts/Game2/Game.sol\r\n\r\nRun `truffle compile`, only 1 artifact is created in `build/contracts`\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe artifacts should be placed in folders too and not just overwritten. So there should be\r\n\r\n- build/contracts/Game.json\r\n- build/contracts/Game1/Game.json\r\n- build/contracts/Game2/Game.json\r\n\r\nWhich can be required by `artifacts.require(\"./Game1/Game.json\")` and such\r\n\r\n## Actual Results\r\n\r\nOnly one artifact is generated, `build/contracts/Game.json`, which is the artifact of the last contract compiled, in this case `contracts/Game2/Game.sol`\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n* Operating System: Linux 4.17.3-1-ARCH\r\n* Ethereum client:Ganache CLI v6.1.4 (ganache-core: 2.1.3)\r\n* Truffle version (`truffle version`): Truffle v4.1.13 (core: 4.1.13)\r\n* node version (`node --version`): v8.11.3\r\n* npm version (`npm --version`): 6.1.0\r\n",

    "body": "@gnidan that's a really nice document! \r\n\r\nI'm not sure I understood correctly, the idea is to use as part of the new schema new abstractions to differentiate between \"Contract types\" and \"Contract instances\" of it?\r\n\r\nI think this would solve this issue, but would it handle the problem of the \"name collisions\", I mean, if you depend on two projects that happen to use 2 contracts with the same name (i.e. Token), truffle will take those, compile them and put it in the `build/contracts`. So there we have a collision.\r\n\r\nDoes this solution solve this other issue?\r\n",

    "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nAs @Nanolucas mentioned, it would be awesome if Truffle could emit a warning if the json artifacts are corrupted because of a contract's name reused. \r\n\r\nWe had many issues in [Slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) when it is the case. We had to develop a specific [detector](https://github.com/crytic/slither/wiki/Detector-Documentation#name-reused) to know what contracts names are reused, but I think that a warning from truffle would help the users.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n",
