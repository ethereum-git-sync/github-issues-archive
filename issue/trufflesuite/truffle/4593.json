  "body": "## Issue\r\n\r\nSuppose you place a breakpoint at a function call `f()`.  You hit `c` to continue to that breakpoint, and reach it.  Then you hit `c` again, and find yourself again at the breakpoint.  You might think you've reached the second call to `f()`.  But no, actually, you've just reached the *return* from that first call, which hits that same point again.  This is confusing.\r\n\r\nIt's not entirely clear what should be done about this, though.  One possibility would be to (somehow) alter the behavior of `c` to skip over the breakpoint in such a case; another possibility would be to just make what's going on clearer.  In either case it would be necessary to somehow detect this situation, which it isn't obvious to me how to do.  Still, it'd be nice to do something about this if possible.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n* Truffle version (`truffle version`): 5.4.26",
