  "body": "## Issue\r\n`compile-solidity` depends on solc-js 0.6.0. This is an old version that had a bug that is the cause of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11489 / #4039. The bug has been fixed a year ago (https://github.com/ethereum/solc-js/pull/470) in 0.6.9 so an update to at least that version is needed. Preferably Truffle should always use the latest one.\r\n\r\nNote that Truffle used to depend on the latest solc-js from 0.6.x series but looks like it was changed to strictly 0.6.0 in #3975.",
