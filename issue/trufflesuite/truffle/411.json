    "body": "I think that _should_ do it, so I'm looking into that now (but I don't know if that covers all the errors in the installation log).\r\n\r\nI forked lock-me to see what would be involved in replacing fs-ext with a Windows compatible option. However, I'm noticing a discrepancy.  In the lock-me library, package.json defines fs-ext as **only** an optional dependency. However, when we install Truffle and navigate to truffle/node_modules/lock-me/package.json, fs-ext is listed under **both** dependencies and optional dependencies. I can actually install lock-me locally without problem because installation skips the optional dependency fs-ext! When installing Truffle, however, lock-me installation seems to think fs-ext is mandatory.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this is a result of some npm behaviour that I'm not aware of. Do you have any ideas why it might want to install the optional dependencies? We still might be able to get around this problem by replacing fs-ext entirely, so I'll continue looking at that option.",

For example, the following no longer works: `var Compiler = require('truffle/lib/contracts')`. Has this been replaced by truffle-compiler? Will this be the same for things like `require('truffle/lib/commands/migrate')`?\r\n- I forked Truffle and tried `npm install`.

    "body": "Hi all. These issues *should* be fixed in our latest version of Truffle, as the beta has now been pushed to production.\r\n\r\n@bvrooman Yes, that is a breaking change. You should now use the `truffle-core` repository instead if you need that functionality. The `truffle` repository has changed to become an distribution/bundled cli package and not a development package. \r\n\r\n@rfikki That issue should also be fixed. Also, consider [Truffle Boxes](http://truffleframework.com/boxes/). \r\n\r\nIf you all run into more issues, please open a new ticket and we'll address each issue individually. Thanks!",
