  "body": "Dear truffle community,\r\n\r\nCurrently, I am using the package `@truffle/hdwallet-provider` for interacting with the testnet of Binance Smart Chain (e.g. deploying contracts, invoking functions).\r\nTo do so, I have a `truffle-config.js` that looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst path = require(\"path\");\r\nconst HDWalletProvider = require('@truffle/hdwallet-provider');\r\nconst provider = new HDWalletProvider({\r\n  privateKeys: ['a private testnet-key that is stored within this file'],\r\n  providerOrUrl: 'https://data-seed-prebsc-1-s1.binance.org:8545/' // URL associated with binanceTestnet\r\n});\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  contracts_build_directory: path.join(__dirname, \"app/src/contracts\"),\r\n  networks: {\r\n    binanceTestnet: {\r\n      provider: () => provider, // Use the private key from HDWalletProvider for interacting with binanceTestnet\r\n      network_id: \"97\",\r\n      gas: 10000000\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the problem is that a private key is stored within my `truffle-config.js`.\r\nI could move the private key to an environment variable, but this would not solve the problem because I want to use my Trezor Hardware Wallet.\r\nI am talking about smart contracts with administrative privileges, and those \"admin-functions\" should be only invoked via a Hardware Wallet.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I would be grateful for hints on how to sign truffle-console-commands with a Trezor Hardware Wallet (Model T).\r\nAnd please don't tell me to write a fully-fledged frontend-app with MetaMask, because I don't want to write a frontend-app for admin-functions that I only need to invoke once in my lifetime :laughing:\r\n",

We found this from a while back, may be worth taking a look at to see if it helps: https://github.com/daonomic/trezor-web3-provider \r\n\r\nAnother option is to transfer some Ether to a separate mnemonic, if you are just trying to do this once. Sorry you've encountered trouble with this! We'll leave this open as a potential feature request in the future. ",
