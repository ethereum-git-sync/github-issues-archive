  "body": "When using the debugger, if you evaluate an expression that contains a variable name that doesn't exist, the debugger will output hundreds of lines of garbage output then throw an error. The example below shows me deliberately entering the name of a variable that doesn't exist; however, the error happens just as easily with typos, which ruins the debugging experience given that the debugger halts.\r\n\r\n![TruffleDebuggerError](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92629/120714652-55d3de00-c478-11eb-8d01-388ac04e6e30.gif)\r\n\r\n### To reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Start debugger with a transaction you have sources for, against Ganache\r\n2. When the debugger starts up, enter the text `:thisdoesnotexist`, or literally anything that starts with a `:`, so long as there isn't a variable name that matches what you entered\r\n3. Watch as the debugger outputs a lot of code (on my machine, it fills up my console buffer), finally halting and displaying an error.\r\n\r\n### Versions:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ npx truffle version\r\nTruffle v5.3.6 (core: 5.3.6)\r\nSolidity - 0.6.4 (solc-js)\r\nNode v12.18.3\r\nWeb3.js v1.3.5\r\n```\r\n\r\n",

Or, I think someone on the team managed to reproduce one once, but we never got back to it and found a way to do it consistently?  Anyway, for the moment I can't reproduce this, so could you confirm whether this still happens on latest Truffle?  Thanks!
