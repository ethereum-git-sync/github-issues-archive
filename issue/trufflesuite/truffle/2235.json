  "body": "- [x] I've asked for help in the [Truffle Gitter](http://gitter.im/Consensys/truffle) before filing this issue.\r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\n## Issue\r\n\r\nIf a truffle project is packaged as an NPM package, the relative location of `node_modules` is different whether it's being used directly or as a dependency.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n- In a truffle project, have a `.gitignore` file that excludes the `build` folder.\r\n- Have `truffle` and any NPM package that has solidity files in it (Eg `openzeppelin-solidity`.\r\n- In one of the contract, to import one of these dependencies, you have to reference `../node_modules/openzeppelin-solidity/whatever.sol`, given that your contract is in `/src`.\r\n\r\nThis works great as long as you're calling `truffle build` from the root of the project. However, if this project becomes a dependency of another project, `node_modules` will contain the project, and therefore the `../node_modules/...` import will fail.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nA way to reference dependencies without a leading path specifier, unless the files are part of the same package.\r\n\r\nIn many other languages (Eg C, C++, etc), these two statements resolve differently, there's a good reason for that.:\r\n\r\n`#include <stdio.h>` vs `include \"./stdio.h\"`\r\n\r\n## Actual Results\r\n\r\nHaving a `truffle build` in the `scripts.postinstall` section of the `package.json` fails when that package is listed as a dependency.\r\n",

    "body": "@eggplantzzz You are absolutelly right! Thanks for taking the time to answer.\r\nI think it's worth explaining that I was mislead by the VSCode extension that was signaling an error on the import, while `truffle compile` was indeed.\r\n\r\nTo make things work, I had to change a little bit of my VSCode configuration, so it probably matches the Truffle way of invoking the compiler.\r\n\r\nFor those interested, the interesting bits are `solidity.packageDefaultDependenciesDirectory` and `solidity.packageDefaultDependenciesContractsDirectory` VSCode extension settings:\r\nIt occured to me that the first one has a correct default of `node_modules`, but the second one has an incorrect default of `contracts` (So the VSCode extension does a weird string interpolation using both as explained [here](https://github.com/juanfranblanco/vscode-solidity), look for \"Openzeppelin\").\r\n\r\nWith these settings, you would be able to import things from `node_modules` properly during both project dev compilation and as a dependency itself.",
