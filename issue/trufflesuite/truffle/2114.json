  "body": "## Summary\r\nTruffle is compiling contracts from a directory way outside the project where the command is entered, to include the `\\contracts\\` directory of a different copy of the project elsewhere on the computer. \r\n\r\n## Issue\r\nI have a Truffle project on a Windows 10 machine, stored in a path like `Documents/repositories/myprojectname`.  In an update some months back, OneDrive decided to move the Documents folder and all subfolders under OneDrive, for automatic backup of files even when not committed to a version control system.\r\n\r\nWhen having some difficulties with OneDrive, I unlinked the computer and made a complete copy of the directory to a location outside of OneDrive syncing, prior to a re-initialization.  On the command line, I navigated to that copy and ran `truffle migrate --reset` which first runs `truffle compile`.  This output a list of files it was compiling, which included all the .sol files in the `.\\contracts\\` directory (as I expected), **as well as** all the files in the OneDrive folder's `\\contracts\\` directory, showing a file path going a few levels up `.\\..\\..\\`... and back down into that folder.  \r\n\r\nThis was highly unexpected. Why is that? \r\n\r\nMy Truffle config file only specifies a compiler version and a couple networks, with no directories mentioned. \r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I don't have a set of steps to reliably reproduce this issue handy at the moment.  The migration failed, on the grounds that a called function had the wrong number of parameters (\"Got 1 expected 2!\") which appears to be a [**separate** issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6977) I observe on occasion, that also appears to be a serious but intermittent compiler bug.  \r\n\r\nUsually the fix is to just run `truffle compile` again (sometimes first deleting the `\\build\\` directory manually), so I tried that.  This time, it reported compiling only the contract files I expected.  In both cases, the \"Artifacts written to\" directory was the `\\build\\contracts` directory of the project I was currently in, as expected.\r\n\r\nHowever, the first run remains concerning, because Truffle should not be compiling files outside the current project. \r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\nOnly the contracts under the current folder/project's `.\\contracts\\` directory get compiled.\r\n\r\n## Actual Results\r\nThe contracts in the current folder/project were compiled, *as well as* contents of the `\\contracts\\` directory of another (much older) copy of the project elsewhere on the same hard drive.  Other solidity files within the project (either version) but not in its `projectName\\contracts\\` directory were not compiled, nor were contracts from other projects under `\\repositories\\` or anywhere else on the machine.  Per expectation, copies of contracts in an unusually named directory's `\\contracts\\` subfolder (within the same project) were also not compiled.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n* Operating System: Windows 10 Pro\r\n* Ethereum client: Doesn't matter\r\n* Truffle version (`truffle version`): v5.0.14\r\n* node version (`node --version`): v9.3.0\r\n* npm version (`npm --version`): 6.9.0\r\n\r\nI am not aware of any shortcuts, junctions, hard links, mappings, etc. between the directory structure where I was editing and the other one where things were compiled from.

In our workflow, we are regularly moving those files around even between computers with very different file systems (and even different operating systems) for their ABI + deployed address information; some are even publicly served for in-browser use and the folder structure information revealed by absolute file paths unnecessarily reduces security.  From a user perspective, there's no communication or understanding of the reason for including that, and its inclusion is quite unexpected behavior in itself (plus it leads to even stranger behavior like what's documented at the start of this thread above). \r\n\r\nPerhaps using an IPFS CID (even if the file is not stored in IPFS) or other content-based file identification system would be better? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ",

    "body": "Currently Truffle uses that path to optimize compilation. It checks when the artifacts' were last updated and compares that to when the source files were updated to see which files require compilation and which ones don't. So it uses it to find source material for a given compiled artifact. Maybe there is a different way to do this without requiring the use of absolute paths?",

    "body": "A couple strategies come to mind: \r\n1) Use content addressing: compute the CID of each file in the contracts source directory, store those in the artifacts instead, and otherwise follow a procedure pretty similar to the status quo.  This is slightly slower but much more robust and solves the security + unanticipated behavior problems of the status quo.  It also allows for some interesting potential added functionality, e.g. if a dapp/wallet with access to the artifact (for ABI + deployed location information) is able to check IPFS for the source it can do its own verification and present [more usable UI for transaction confirmation](https://archive.devcon.org/archive/watch/6/human-friendly-contract-interactions/?tab=YouTube) without having to rely on another centralized service like [Sourcify](https://sourcify.dev/). Much of that can in theory be done today since the artifact contains the source, but optional IPFS pinning of particular versions allow for connections to endorsements, audit reports, trust-level certifications, easier Remix integrations, and other exciting potential expansions of functionality outside Truffle.  \r\n\r\n2) Use relative paths in the artifact files.\r\n\r\n3) Emit an additional file, perhaps a sibling to the truffle-config file, which lists relative paths and last-modified times, and remove in-artifact references to the source path. \r\n\r\n4) Drop the optimization and always recompile all smart contract source files.  Of these four, it's the slowest, but it is still strongly preferred over the unexpected behavior of the status quo.  This is probably also the only option that doesn't require a major version bump.\r\n\r\nIn our workflow, smart contracts are actually written by scripts as part of the build process, so their last modified dates will always be extremely recent and the `truffle compile` stage will always recompile them on that basis, so the first option is strongly preferred.  Use of absolute paths is definitely to be avoided, especially for collaborative development and review (incl. auditing) processes. \r\n\r\n",

Maybe not, if we continue to support the existing absolute paths, but new artifacts get output with `project:/` paths instead.)\r\n\r\nNote that this would require @truffle/resolver to be updated so that `resolver.resolve()` accepts these `project:/` style paths, which it currently does not. I'll make a new issue for that.",
