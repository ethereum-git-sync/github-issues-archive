  "body": "## Issue\r\n\r\nThe deployer's deferred chain, and the synchronous deployment syntax it supports, is a maintainability nightmare.  It's got a bunch of bugs and sharp corners (see: #3066, #3867, and #5225) and it's not clear how much of this is fixable while still supporting existing use cases.  Meanwhile the code behind it is horrifically opaque and almost totally devoid of comments.  So even if some of it may be fixable, there's no guarantee that any of us will be able to find said fixes.\r\n\r\nUnless cgewecke is willing to come fix it for us, I don't see how we can continue to maintain this.  Come some future major release, we should tear all this out and require all deployments to be async.  (Or to use whatever new declarative deployments syntax we come up with, see #5213.)",
