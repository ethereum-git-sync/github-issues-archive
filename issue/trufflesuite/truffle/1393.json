    "body": "Hello, thanks for reaching out! I am not able to reproduce this issue. Without any code to look at it's a difficult to figure out why you are getting this error. \r\n\r\nOn first glance, I wonder if you have required your Election contract appropriately. It may help to try this out with a Truffle box so you can see how all the pieces are supposed to work. Perhaps try truffle unbox metacoin in a separate empty directory and look at how metacoin is required, etc. \r\n\r\nI'm going to close this issue as I cannot to reproduce it, but if you are unable to resolve it or would like to provide more information, feel free to open a new issue in the future.",
