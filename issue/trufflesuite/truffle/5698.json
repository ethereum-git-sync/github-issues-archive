  "body": "- [ ] I've [opened a support ticket](https://trufflesuite.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) before filing this issue.\r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\n## Issue\r\n\r\nI'm trying to write test for a contract which internally interacts with various other pre-existing contracts. Both for debugging and for testing these interactions, I would like to decode events emitted by these contracts. However after reading through a lot of documentation, requests of people trying to do the same, some of the code, I am not getting any closer to actually make this work. \r\n\r\nIt seems to me this should be a rather simple thing, I have the contracts interfaces available, but I can't seem to figure out how to make truffle use them to decode events and/or associating them with addresses.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nDeploy contract which makes Uniswap transaction, neither Uniswap- nor Token-events are decoded.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThere should be some way to either tell Truffle to use all the interfaces I have for event decoding or at least associate their ABIs with addresses.\r\n\r\n## Actual Results\r\n\r\n\"Could not decode event\" for all events of third party contracts.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n* Operating System: Linux\r\n* Ethereum client: Ganache\r\n* Truffle version (`truffle version`): Truffle v5.6.5 (core: 5.6.5)\r\n* node version (`node --version`): Node v16.14.0\r\n* npm version (`npm --version`): 8.3.1\r\n",
