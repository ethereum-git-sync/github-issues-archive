  "body": "- [X] I've asked for help in the [Truffle Gitter](http://gitter.im/Consensys/truffle) before filing this issue.\r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\n## Issue\r\n\r\nThe .json build artifacts from Truffle are supposed to be put onto a web server, where in-browser dapps can download them and use them to interact with the blockchain.\r\n\r\nBut my contract files are all huge, ranging from 11 KB at the smallest to almost 2 MB at the largest. These are way too big to make my users download before my app can work, and way bigger than they need to be for what the client needs out of them.\r\n\r\nIt looks like this is partly due to the inclusion of the contract source, but mostly due to the inclusion of **two** syntax trees (`ast` and `legacyAst`). The contract source probably doesn't need to go out to clients (unless they are going to be deploying the contract and then verifying it on Etherscan), and the syntax tree *definitely* doesn't need to go out, and super definitely doesn't need to go out twice.\r\n\r\nAlso, in that syntax tree, I see full paths to the directories where Truffle found the source code. That's good for debugging, but that's not really something I want to be revealing to end users of my dapp.\r\n\r\nAm I missing something I need to do to prepare these .json files for distribution and strip out all this extra debug data? Is there some kind of \"release\" build I am supposed to be building?\r\n\r\nI'm using Truffle v4.1.3 (core: 4.1.3); has this been fixed in newer versions?\r\n\r\nIf not, the format needs to be revised to have less stuff in it (maybe by breaking out Truffle debugging metadata from what truffle-contract actually needs to see), or a concept of a \"release build\" for an artifact that is small enough to distribute needs to be created.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/NovakDistributed/macroverse.git\r\ncd macroverse\r\nnpm install\r\ntruffle compile\r\nls -lah build/contracts\r\ngrep $USER build/contracts/*\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe contract files prepared for distribution over the web should be about a few kb each, holding the contract ABI, addresses, and binary. The user name of the last person to build the artifact should not appear in any of them.\r\n\r\n## Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe contract files are ~7 MB total, and contain a bunch of syntax tree stuff that will be of no use in my Dapp front-end.\r\n\r\n```\r\ntotal 7.2M\r\ndrwxr-xr-x 25 anovak  800 Sep 13 19:37 .\r\ndrwxr-xr-x  3 anovak   96 Jul  5 21:56 ..\r\n-rw-r--r--  1 anovak  11K Sep 13 19:37 AccessControl.json\r\n-rw-r--r--  1 anovak  85K Sep 13 19:37 BasicToken.json\r\n-rw-r--r--  1 anovak  37K Sep 13 19:37 CanReclaimToken.json\r\n-rw-r--r--  1 anovak  49K Sep 13 19:37 ControlledAccess.json\r\n-rw-r--r--  1 anovak  39K Sep 13 19:37 ERC20.json\r\n-rw-r--r--  1 anovak  26K Sep 13 19:37 ERC20Basic.json\r\n-rw-r--r--  1 anovak  29K Sep 13 19:37 HasNoContracts.json\r\n-rw-r--r--  1 anovak  39K Sep 13 19:37 HasNoEther.json\r\n-rw-r--r--  1 anovak  24K Sep 13 19:37 HasNoTokens.json\r\n-rw-r--r--  1 anovak 505K Sep 13 19:37 MRVToken.json\r\n-rw-r--r--  1 anovak 1.5M Sep 13 19:37 MacroverseStarGenerator.json\r\n-rw-r--r--  1 anovak 300K Sep 13 19:37 MacroverseStarRegistry.json\r\n-rw-r--r--  1 anovak 1.9M Sep 13 19:37 MacroverseSystemGenerator.json\r\n-rw-r--r--  1 anovak  52K Sep 13 19:37 Migrations.json\r\n-rw-r--r--  1 anovak  49K Sep 13 19:37 MinimumBalanceAccessControl.json\r\n-rw-r--r--  1 anovak 603K Sep 13 19:37 OrbitalMechanics.json\r\n-rw-r--r--  1 anovak  57K Sep 13 19:37 Ownable.json\r\n-rw-r--r--  1 anovak 279K Sep 13 19:37 RNG.json\r\n-rw-r--r--  1 anovak 1.3M Sep 13 19:37 RealMath.json\r\n-rw-r--r--  1 anovak  64K Sep 13 19:37 SafeERC20.json\r\n-rw-r--r--  1 anovak  92K Sep 13 19:37 SafeMath.json\r\n-rw-r--r--  1 anovak 273K Sep 13 19:37 StandardToken.json\r\n-rw-r--r--  1 anovak  16K Sep 13 19:37 UnrestrictedAccessControl.json\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, my user name appears 66 times in the files.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n* Operating System: OS X\r\n* Ethereum client: N/A\r\n* Truffle version (`truffle version`): v4.1.3\r\n* node version (`node --version`): v9.4.0\r\n* npm version (`npm --version`): 5.6.0\r\n",

I could try and require them into the build instead of manually loading each file separately with a fetch, but all that will do is cram the JSON into my app's massive JS bundle somewhere; I don't think Browserify is actually clever enough to remove any of the unused information.\r\n\r\nMy intended deployment process is to put the resulting Browserify-built static site with Javascript up on a web server, and have that be the front-end for my Dapp. Users are supposed to use it with Metamask or Mist or some other web3-enabled web browsing solution.\r\n\r\nWhat build and distribution system/process are you using where there's no web server involved? Are you just writing a native app that talks to an Ethereum node?\r\n\r\n",
