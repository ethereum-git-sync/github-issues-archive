Both are connecting to the **same**  `testrpc`.\n\nNow, when I open the index.html in `development` I would expect, since both examples are using `account[0]`, that the balance I would see would be the same..\nBut somehow each instance shows its own META amount, _not the same_?\n\nTo recreate this, don't fill in any address, and fill in any amount, this will subtract an amount from the `account` ID, and update the `META` amount you have..\n\nEither this is a bug, or I'm fundamentally misunderstanding how ethereum works?\n",

It will show `0` meta, correct.\nBut I would expect when I transfer x amount of `META` from the other client (`account[0]`) to this second address, it should receive it?
