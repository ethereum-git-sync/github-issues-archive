  "body": "## Issue\r\n\r\nCurrently, Truffle Codec determines storage layout based on ASTs.  However, starting in version 0.5.13, the Solidity compiler began providing `storageLayout` output.  We should try to use this if possible.  Note that this would require requesting and capturing the `storageLayout` output from the compiler (which we don't currently do), and storing it in the artifacts.\r\n\r\nPreviously this issue has not been relevant, as there had never been any changes to storage layout.  However, Solidity 0.8.9 changed storage layout for UDVTs (which were introduced in Solidity 0.8.8).  Currently, we handle this by explicitly checking the Solidity version, and only using the 0.8.8 layout if you're using 0.8.8.  However, explicitly checking compiler versions is not a great way to do things; using `storageLayout` would be preferable, assuming that `storageLayout` does indeed contain sufficient information for our purposes (I do not know that it does; if it doesn't, this effort may have to be abandoned, or applied only partially).\r\n\r\nNote that because Solidity versions prior to 0.5.13 do not have `storageLayout` (and because older artifacts still would not include it), the old system would still need to be retained as a fallback.  Also, `storageLayout` has been labeled as experimental and unstable in the past, and I think it still may be, so we may need to account for different possible `storageLayout` formats, and we may want to talk to the Solidity team about their plans for it for the future.\r\n\r\n(There is also, of course, the question of where `storageLayout` would go in Truffle DB.)\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n* Truffle version (`truffle version`): 5.4.14",
