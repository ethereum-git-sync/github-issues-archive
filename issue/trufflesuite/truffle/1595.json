  "body": "Is it possible to dynamically update dependency artifacts such as openzeppelin library in our truffle project. We have install openzeppelin as an npm package each time we create a new project in truffle. As of now the current version of truffle 5.0.0 is not compatible with the current openzeppelin library because of the difference in the solc compiler version used. Hence we have to wait till openzeppelin releases a truffle 5.0.0 compatible version or downgrade truffle and solc version.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to dynamically include those dependencies in our project, similar to how we can set the solc compiler version now. If we could have an option to set the openzeppelin library version too in the truffle-config.js file without having to explicitly install it, it would be very neat. \r\n\r\nFor instance in a Java Maven framework, every dependency is specified in a pom.xml configuration file, and whenever there is a change in the dependency version we just have to update the version number in the xml file instead of installing it locally. \r\n\r\nHoping we could have that convenience too. \r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "@eggplantzzz  Thanks, I understand that. I was simply suggesting to possibly include such a feature in  a future truffle version wherein we just have to update the version number in a config file and the library is available to us. However I do understand that inorder to be able to do so Openzeppelin would also need to have their libraries available dynamically and not be installed everytime. Same goes for solc compiler version in Solidity. ",
