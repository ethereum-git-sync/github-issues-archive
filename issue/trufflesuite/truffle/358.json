  "body": "`migrate` is an unintuitive command, and not particularly beginner friendly. \r\n\r\nI had assumed I would start with `deploy` and then use `migrate` at some later date. This steered me in the wrong direction in the docs. \r\n\r\n**Suggestion**:\r\n\r\n* Create a `deploy` command aliased to `migrate`\r\n* add this line to the `--help` entry\r\n    \"deploy          => Same as migrations\"\r\n\r\nActually, it might be nice if `deploy` was equivalent to `migrate --reset`.",
