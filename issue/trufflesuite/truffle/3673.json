    "body": "Nick and I had a talk about this today.\n\nWe decided to have every loader and recipe specify what \"labels\" it requires and which \"labels\" it produces. An example would be that preserve-to-ipfs takes an \"fs\" value and produces an \"ipfs-cid\" value. Then preserve-to-filecoin takes that \"ipfs-cid\". But other plugins could also provide an \"ipfs-cid\" value.\n\nFor planning we look at the installed plugins and select the first plugin that produces the required label (default plugins last) - and warn when multiple options are found. \n\nAs results come in they are stored in a \"results\" object by label. These results are accessible to subsequent recipes.",
