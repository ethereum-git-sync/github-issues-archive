  "body": "`solc` terminates all bytecode output with a CBOR-encoded hash of the metadata, intended for use in contract verification (ref: [documentation](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.24/metadata.html)). Provided a commonly-used repository containing public contract metadata, wallet software should be able to perform contract verification natively, without relying on (or in addition to) centralized services such as Etherscan.\r\n\r\nTruffle should likely:\r\n- Allow outputting `solc`'s native metadata format as an artifact of compilation\r\n- Add a new configuration parameter, to enable users to specify a repository for uploading these metadata files\r\n- Add a command, or update the `publish` command, to publish these metadata files to the specified repository.\r\n\r\nWith this in place, wallet software can start downloading these metadata files from a given repository and perform contract verification at transaction-time.\r\n\r\nProbably lots of unknowns here to investigate, such as IPFS support (since `solc` currently only outputs the Swarm hash).\r\n\r\nThis comes out of a discussion with @chriseth. cc @danfinlay.",
