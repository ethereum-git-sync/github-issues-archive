    "body": "Ok I was able to get it working and reproduce your error! Thanks again for the steps.\r\n\r\nSo this is kind of problematic because `chainId` was added in order to make Truffle send transactions that were EIP-155 compliant. Geth recently made updates that disallowed transactions that weren't compliant. Without the chain id being available when sending transactions, Truffle will not play well with Geth out of the box. I wonder if there is some soret of option for ignoring options it doesn't expect... Passing `chainId` to web3 I believe is a bit non-standard (which is what openethereum is complaining about), offhand I'm not sure how web3 wants you to pass that info along.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what we need to do about this at present, let me talk with some teammates. Some more research may be needed to find the proper solution for this.",

    "body": "Thanks for the update!\n\nYeah it really felt like the communication between truffle/web3 and openethereum was the problem. \n\nSince openethereum is based on parity, do you think that the issue could be that parity didn't implement EIP 155 and doesn't know how to handle the request from web3? \n\nI assume that truffle already uses different handlers for different Ethereum clients since it supports multiple clients and that there are also tests for that. But maybe the issue is that truffle treats openethereum as a geth client instead of a parity one? Is infura based on geth? Because then it would makes sense why the error message mentions infura.\n\nIf thats the issue, then maybe the solution shouldn't be that bad right?\n\nJust my thoughts on this.",
