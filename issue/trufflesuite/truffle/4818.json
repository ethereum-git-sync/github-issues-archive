  "body": "## Issue\r\n\r\n@truffle/codec defines its [Format](https://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/codec/modules/_truffle_codec.format.html) for representing Solidity/ABI values and types, and we provide interface for presenting these values to humans via Node.js's `util.inspect`. This works great for the console, but there's no easy out-of-the-box way to display this kind of data in a webpage.\r\n\r\nWe should create a new package (perhaps called @truffle/codec-components) that will contain individual React.js components for the various types defined by @truffle/codec, as well as wrapper components to perform the dispatch.\r\n\r\nThe components this package provides should probably offer some default styles but they must allow users of the package to override style for their projects' needs. [reactspace/schema-form](https://github.com/restspace/schema-form) seems to solve this problem fairly ergonomically for a different domain... maybe we could borrow their code structure for this work.\r\n\r\nIt's probably also worth mentioning that MetaMask's tx-insight feature provides an initial implementation of these components with MM's style and layout conventions... this effort may prove a useful starting point. See [this transaction-decoding directory](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/tree/develop/ui/components/app/transaction-decoding) for the implementation over there.",
