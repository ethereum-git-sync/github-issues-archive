  "body": "## Issue\r\n\r\n[@truffle/resolver](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/blob/develop/packages/resolver) provides two main methods for external use:\r\n\r\n- `require()` (as in, `artifacts.require()`... `artifacts` just an instance of a resolver)\r\n- `resolve()`\r\n\r\nNow, the resolver's purpose is to load build artifacts, not sources, and so, when you do `artifacts.require(\"MetaCoin\")`, it reads it from `build/contracts/MetaCoin.json`, not the Solidity. This is true even if you do `artifacts.require(\"MetaCoin.sol\")`: Truffle finds the JSON file whose source was `MetaCoin.sol`, and that's what it loads.\r\n\r\nAnd so you'd think, that the `resolve()` function is just a lightweight `require()` that returns the artifact _path_ instead of the fully loaded contract abstraction from that path.\r\n\r\nBut that's not what `resolve()` does! Look: [the one place we use this function inside Truffle](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/blob/develop/packages/compile-solidity/profiler/index.js#L167-L194) (the profiler). The profiler uses it to figure out Solidity `import` statements. And it looks like it expects `resolve` to give the path _and_ the loaded contents.\r\n\r\nSo, why can't we contain this functionality entirely within the profiler itself? Well, we need to provide a means to inform the profiler of additional sources at runtime, e.g. with Solidity tests' `import \"truffle/DeployedAddresses.sol\"`. That source is generated from a template and never lives on disk. Truffle hooks this up to the profiler by means of the [TestSource](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/blob/develop/packages/core/lib/testing/testsource.js), injected into the TestResolver, so that the profiler can include that in compilation.\r\n\r\nThere **is** a package associated with sources, [@truffle/contract-sources](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/blob/develop/packages/contract-sources), but currently it only _lists_ available sources, and incompletely so. My first thought is that this is a better home for this functionality, although there are various limitations in the way:\r\n\r\n- That package is just a static function; it doesn't get attached to the config, and so it doesn't have the same extant utility as the resolver (which is available throughout Truffle, already instantiated)\r\n- How do we reconcile the duplication of \"sources\"? Does that get separated into its own package, out of resolver? What does that look like?\r\n\r\nBlech. This is sort of related to #2469, and it'd probably be worth solving both this issue and that one at the same time.",
