  "body": "## Issue\r\n\r\nCurrently, in Truffle Decoder, to decode a mapping, you have to manually watch individual mapping keys.  This is annoying.  We should add a decoder method where you would specify a mapping and an array (in the same manner that one specifies mappings currently), and it marks that array as the key list for that mapping.  Then, when attempting to decode that mapping, it decodes the key list first, and uses the resulting values as the keys for the mapping (in addition to any manually-watched keys).\r\n\r\nNote that the base type of the array would have to match the key type of the mapping.\r\n\r\n(...I also have a more powerful version of this in mind, but that would be a lot harder and I'm not entirely clear on all the details there, so that can be a separate issue later.)",
