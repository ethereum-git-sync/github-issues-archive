Create a test that uses one of the dependency contracts that's not required by any of the main project's contracts. Truffle will say it can't find the file, because it will look into the build folder and it won't find it there.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nTruffle tests should be able to use any dependency contract, not only those used by the project's contracts.\r\n\r\n## Actual Results\r\n\r\nCan't find the contract and test fails.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n* Operating System: Distributor ID:\tUbuntu 16.10\r\n* Truffle version:Truffle v3.2.5\r\n* Ethereum client: testrpc\r\n* node version: v8.0.0\r\n* npm version: 5.0.3\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "I can reproduce this (at least in migrations) on Truffle 4.1.3.\r\n\r\nI have a project with a dependency on the `macroverse` NPM module. In a migrations script I try to do:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar RealMath = artifacts.require(\"macroverse/contracts/RealMath.sol\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis does not work.\r\n\r\nI can add a `Workaround.sol` to my project's `contracts` folder consisting of:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport \"macroverse/contracts/RealMath.sol\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I do that and a `truffle compile`, the dependency's contract is built into `build/contracts/RealMath.json` and is available to the migration script.\r\n\r\nI *need* to be able to use the JSON files in `node_modules/macroverse/build/contracts/*.json` from my dependent project, however, as those files from the dependency contain the mainnet addresses of the deployed contracts which the dependent project's migration scripts are going to need to have available. I am pretty sure this workaround results in new artifacts being built in `build/contracts/*.json` with empty `networks` fields.\r\n\r\nI *used* to be able to get at the dependency's artifacts as just `artifacts.require(\"macroverse/RealMath.sol\")`, in about Truffle 3.0. Since updating to 4.1.3 that hasn't worked and I haven't been able to find anything else that does. `macroverse/build/contracts/RealMath.json` and `macroverse/build/contracts/RealMath` don't work, for example. Also, there's the syntax shown in [the documentation](http://truffleframework.com/docs/getting_started/packages-npm) for use in migration scripts:\r\n```\r\n// Note that artifacts.require takes care of creating an abstraction for us.\r\nvar SimpleNameRegistry = artifacts.require(\"example-truffle-library/SimpleNameRegistry\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat would be `macroverse/RealMath` for me, which also doesn't work.\r\n\r\nThe other approach suggested in the documentation is something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar contract = require(\"truffle-contract\");\r\nvar RealMath = contract(require(\"macroverse/build/contracts/RealMath.json\"));\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis lets me create *something*, but it's not the same type as what you get from artifacts.require, and in particular I'm not sure how to link or deploy it.\r\n",

The reason this isn't working as intended is due to this pesky [resolverintercept](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/blob/master/packages/truffle-migrate/resolverintercept.js) which aims to bring caching to the contract lookup functionality. ...however, this is only implemented for local contracts.\r\n\r\nTo bypass this, you can call require on the original resolver which resides at `artificats.resolver.require()`\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```\r\nartifacts.resolver.require(\"../lib/colonyNetwork/contracts/Authority\", \"../lib/colonyNetwork/build/contracts/\");\r\n```",
