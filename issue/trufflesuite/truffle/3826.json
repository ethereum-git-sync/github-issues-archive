  "body": "## Issue\r\n\r\nTruffle Test will output redundant decodings for \"ambiguous\" events that aren't really so ambiguous.  Basically you'll have a bunch of different contracts that declare the same event, and Codec will be like, well, I know what this event is, but I don't know which contract declared it!  So it's ambiguous!  This creates a bunch of annoying redundant output.\r\n\r\nSo, we'll need to figure out how to handle this.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n* Truffle version (`truffle version`): 5.1.67",

    "body": "Note: This problem is especially bad with proxies (see #3941).  This is because decoding proxy events requires the use of \"extras\", but this means that if you have an event that's defined in one contract, but two contracts that use it, each will get a distinct copy of this event in the \"extras\", and you'll get an \"ambiguous\" decoding that isn't really ambiguous at all.  This doesn't happen if you don't have to rely on extras because in that case we know what context it was emitted from, but when we have to rely on extras (e.g. for a proxy), we don't, so we include them both.",
