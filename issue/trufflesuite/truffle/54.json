    "body": "EtherPudding is a contract abstraction on top of web3's contract abstraction. The readme should do a pretty good job of explaining it: https://github.com/ConsenSys/ether-pudding . In case it doesn't, the main features are 1) Promises, for clean code, and 2) ability to keep your app's control flow in sync with the network (i.e., you don't get your callback until your transaction is mined). There are a few other features, but they're tangential.\n\nTestRPC and Ethersim are two solutions to the same problem (both of which I have contributed heavily). That problem is productivity: waiting 17 seconds per transaction to see if your code works is a productivity killer. So both of these projects run an Ethereum VM without mining or network and process transactions immediately, simulating the real effects of the blockchain, but much faster. TestRPC is written in Python, Ethersim in JS. \n\nI'm switching my efforts to Ethersim as the JS solution seems to be more stable (at least, my command of JS is greater). They're nearly feature equivalent, though Ethersim lags behind a few RPC calls. I hope to fill those out soon.\n",

EtherSim still has [its own related problems on OS X](https://github.com/iurimatias/EtherSim/issues/2) with outdated dependencies.\n",
