  "body": "When running migrations, there is some extra, unnecessary logging that gets left around in the terminal. \r\n<img width=\"1413\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-12-16 at 5 15 04 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14827965/146457130-bc5feb62-c320-4660-86f9-8e9d597c2433.png\">\r\n\r\nThe things to note in the screenshot are the extra \"Blocks: 0....\" and \"Saving migration to chain.\" at the end. You can also see that there is a \"Blocks: 0...\" in the second line of data under the \"Replacing 'MetaCoin'\" section which I don't believe should be there.\r\n\r\nThis comes from the migrations logging, and more specifically from [this bit of code](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/blob/develop/packages/migrate/Migration.js#L90-L105) and involves [this method](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/blob/develop/packages/reporters/reporters/migrations-V5/reporter.js#L426-L437) and maybe [this method](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/blob/develop/packages/reporters/reporters/migrations-V5/reporter.js#L443-L447).\r\n\r\nI'm also pretty sure that ora plays a role in this code getting left around as it doesn't really play well with other logs that get printed. You can often get some pretty weird, ugly results using this spinner package while logging other things. It might be just that the spinner is not stopped at the appropriate time during the logging of all this information or some other async nonsense that is not supposed to be occurring.",
