  "body": "## Issue\r\n\r\nUsers often use the default mnemonic that is hard-coded into the truffle develop console by accident, sending real funds to what is supposed to be an example wallet. Users would be well-served by a default mnemonic saved in their user-level configuration file, so that if they accidentally(or purposely) send Ether using it, they are able to retrieve their funds. \r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\nA user has their own unique mnemonic, which will help reduce the chance that their funds are lost. \r\n",
