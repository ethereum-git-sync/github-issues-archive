    "body": "The new recipe dependency system actually implements this, although in a different format than what we discussed earlier. A recipe specifies what \"inputs\" it needs, and the preserve system matches the correct downstream recipes that have that label as an output. \n\nCurrently the only dependency recipe is @truffle/preserve-fs, which outputs an \"fs-target\", but other recipes can be created that output e.g. an \"artifact\". By using a recipe that then requires an \"artifact\" as input, you effectively \"select\" that artifact-producing recipe as well.\n\nSo this issue can be closed, as there will be no explicit \"loader\" selection.",
