    "body": "Sounds like there's two problems here:\r\n- InternalCompilerError's shouldn't happen, so that's something going wrong with Solidity. If we can get to the bottom of it, hopefully we'll be able to isolate the problem to bring up with them.\r\n- Something inside Truffle must be triggering this issue. Is your repo online? And can you share the artifacts in the current state? Maybe we can figure out what's going wrong.\r\n\r\nThanks @Amxx!",

    "body": "EDIT: I managed to fix my problem - that said, i did hit `InternalCompilerError: Compiled contract not found.` with `npx hardhat compile`, by having a contract try to get its own `.creationCode`. I suppose this comment is on the wrong issue, since this is apparently for truffle, but I don't recall seeing another issue open for this error message, so I commented here.\r\n\r\nOrig text:\r\n\r\nI'm getting `InternalCompilerError: Compiled contract not found.` with `npx hardhat compile`\r\nSeems like there are still some issues.\r\nSince a repro was mentioned above, don't want to cut a minimal repro right now.\r\nThis issue has persisted even after i deleted `artifacts` and `cache` and even after I changed the part of the code that I thought may have been causing the issue.\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\nI've boiled this down to the issue - I want to use `create2` to put my contract at a specific address, and then i want other contracts to know the address I've deployed to. So I have:\r\n```\r\nContract A {\r\n    address public constant myAddr =\r\n      address(uint160(uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(\r\n        bytes1(0xff),\r\n        /* Addr to deploy with */,\r\n        uint256(/* Salt */),\r\n        keccak256(abi.encodePacked(type(A).creationCode))\r\n      )))));\r\n... }\r\n```\r\nBut naturally `.creationCode` can't really work since it hasn't been compiled yet.\r\nEDIT: I realized the way to fix this is to move `myAddr` out of the contract but into the same file as the contract.",
