The issue comes from \"@truffle/hdwallet-provider\", this lib will be crashed after query block.\r\nFor temporary solution: \r\n- 1: You can flat the contracts and deploy manually via remix. Btw it's fine if you interact directly with Metamask\r\n- 2: If you want continue with truffle, you need to older provider here: \"truffle-hdwallet-provider\" which response error msg too but no crash. =]] \r\n",

It's free. And replace to bscmainnet rpc in truffle config file. It should work without any error.",
