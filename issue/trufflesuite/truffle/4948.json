  "body": "- [ ] I've [opened a support ticket](https://trufflesuite.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) before filing this issue.\r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\n## Issue\r\n\r\nI am trying to deploy a contract to Rinkeby using the truffle dashboard. The first time I ran \r\n\r\ntruffle migrate --network dashboard\r\ntruffle console --network dashboard\r\n\r\nthe contract deployed perfectly. However, if I try to re-run these same commands without changing anything. I no longer get the option to process any requests in the dashboard. I simply get the following returned in the terminal \r\n\r\nCompiling your contracts...\r\n> Everything is up to date, there is nothing to compile.\r\nNetwork up to date.\r\n\r\ntruffle(dashboard)> \r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nSuccessfully deploy a contract to Rinkeby one-time using truffle dashboard.\r\ntry to duplicate the same deployment without changing any part of any file. Deploy using the following commands. \r\n\r\ntruffle dashboard\r\ntruffle migrate --network dashboard\r\ntruffle console --network dashboard\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat you expected to happen.\r\n============================\r\n\r\nTo see the option to process the deployment requests in the truffle dashboard \r\n\r\nWhat actually happened. Please give examples and support it with screenshots, copied output or error messages.\r\n=========\r\n\r\nMy Vscode terminal returns this\r\n\r\nCompiling your contracts...\r\n> Everything is up to date, there is nothing to compile.\r\nNetwork up to date.\r\n\r\nAnd the truffle dashboard has no change and no option to process any incoming requests. \r\n\r\n* Operating System: MacOS Monterey\r\n* Ethereum client: ?\r\n* Truffle version (`v5.5.6`): same issue with version v5.5.3 \r\n* node version (`v14.17.3`): same issue with v16.14.2 \r\n* npm version (`6.14.13`): \r\n",

My solution has been to delete the deployed contract.json files from the build/contracts folder..However, your solution appears to be the better way to go about this!",
