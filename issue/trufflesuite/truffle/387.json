Done \n\n<hr>\n\n__Work has been started__.\n\n\nThese users each claimed they can complete the work by 2Â weeks, 5Â days from now.\nPlease review their action plans below:\n\n\n**1) [jeremigendron](https://gitcoin.co/jeremigendron) has applied to start work _(Funders only: [approve worker](https://gitcoin.co/issue/trufflesuite/truffle/387/4251?mutate_worker_action=approve&worker=jeremigendron) | [reject worker](https://gitcoin.co/issue/trufflesuite/truffle/387/4251?mutate_worker_action=reject&worker=jeremigendron))_.**\n\nFigure out where contract compilation occurs, log the output from that and check to see if contracts with the same name aren't processed specially (which they should be, in this case with a warning to the console).\n**2) [antodp](https://gitcoin.co/antodp) has applied to start work _(Funders only: [approve worker](https://gitcoin.co/issue/trufflesuite/truffle/387/4251?mutate_worker_action=approve&worker=antodp) | [reject worker](https://gitcoin.co/issue/trufflesuite/truffle/387/4251?mutate_worker_action=reject&worker=antodp))_.**\n\nI've encountered this problem myself working with the Truffle Suite.\nI will search in the source code to find the moving parts and act as required.\n**3) [evgeniuz](https://gitcoin.co/evgeniuz) has applied to start work _(Funders only: [approve worker](https://gitcoin.co/issue/trufflesuite/truffle/387/4251?mutate_worker_action=approve&worker=evgeniuz) | [reject worker](https://gitcoin.co/issue/trufflesuite/truffle/387/4251?mutate_worker_action=reject&worker=evgeniuz))_.**\n\nWorked previously on Truffle project, this one should be an easy fix. Will add necessary changes.\n**4) [kichjang](https://gitcoin.co/kichjang) has been approved to start work.**\n\nThere are a couple of places where we can check for contract name duplicity:\n1. In compile-solidity. In the callback supplied to findContracts, we perform a duplicity check on the files parameter array.\n2. In contract-sources. Accept an additional parameter or config option that indicates whether or not to fail upon detecting multiple files of the same name.\n3. In workflow-compile. Under Contracts.compileSources, check the contracts variable and throw an error upon seeing two or more contracts with the same name.\n\nOne additional complexity here that needs to be solved is the limited \"view\" of the compilation targets under a `compile.necessary` run -- we may not have the visibility to see all contracts that needs to be compiled during a run, and so it may not raise an error on duplicate contract names because of its \"blindness\"  to unnecessary files.\n**5) [thecydonian](https://gitcoin.co/thecydonian) has applied to start work _(Funders only: [approve worker](https://gitcoin.co/issue/trufflesuite/truffle/387/4251?mutate_worker_action=approve&worker=thecydonian) | [reject worker](https://gitcoin.co/issue/trufflesuite/truffle/387/4251?mutate_worker_action=reject&worker=thecydonian))_.**\n\nCheck list of contracts during compilation. If multiple exist exist with same name, throw error.\n**6) [bobface](https://gitcoin.co/bobface) has applied to start work _(Funders only: [approve worker](https://gitcoin.co/issue/trufflesuite/truffle/387/4251?mutate_worker_action=approve&worker=bobface) | [reject worker](https://gitcoin.co/issue/trufflesuite/truffle/387/4251?mutate_worker_action=reject&worker=bobface))_.**\n\nI will make Truffle check for contracts with the same name during compilation and fail with an error if there are any. I will also add a flag to disable this check.\n\nLearn more [on the Gitcoin Issue Details page](https://gitcoin.co/issue/trufflesuite/truffle/387/4251).\n\n",
