    "body": "\t\t\t\t\nSome notes:\nFor any of the networks the dashboard can connect to, there is a disconnect between wallets. MM is bringing its own accounts; if you run ganache, it brings its own accounts; truffle develop brings its own accounts; how do we fund those MM accounts on the other networks? \nProposition: \n - In the dashboard UI there's a dropdown for list of truffle networks. User selects one of those, and that initiates the funding process. \n   - Note that we probably shouldn't have different behavior between switching networks in the dashboard UI and switching at the wallet. We need to be able to initiate this process when the user switches the network the wallet as well\n - The user will need to be able to re-fund those accounts on the truffle networks whenever they want\n\nNote: Ganache RPC method for setting balance may differ from other tools.",
