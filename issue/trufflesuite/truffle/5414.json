    "body": "Oh yeah, don't use `sudo` when installing Truffle. The best thing to do is re-install npm and Node using a Node version manager which is what npm recommends. This resolves these types of permissions errors. Using `sudo` can cause problems later on down the line and it is likely that is what you are experiencing here. Check out this article from npm which elaborates a bit more on using nvm. https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally",
