  "body": "## Issue\r\n\r\nIt seems that sometimes, a source map will skip over the node for the index of a mapping access, and instead be on the node for the mapping access itself at this step.  I think this is due to optimization; the example I've seen uses the optimizer with `runs` set to 100 (so, optimized, but not much; other than this one glitch I couldn't tell it was optimized).\r\n\r\nAnyway, the debugger has no idea how to locate the mapping key in this case, so it misses it.\r\n\r\nFor a reproduction example, try debugging mainnet transaction 0x0c0816f443cc8db9103dfeee6ba9fceed0ac5ca92c7bdb4c2f19983b5bca5b77 with `-x`.  You'll encounter the problem pretty quickly on line 198.  Note: I ran into crashes trying to reproduce this example with Node 12, you may need to use Node 14.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n* Truffle version (`truffle version`): 5.5.14\r\n* node version (`node --version`): 14.19.0",
