  "body": "I've asked about this on gitter and @gnidan suggested I open an issue.\r\n\r\nAs it is now, `truffle compile` compiles all the `.sol` files in the `contracts` directory. It would be great if we were able to give truffle the paths to the files we want compiled, or if there was an option to get the files from the standard input. So just something like\r\n\r\n`truffle compile path/to/MyContract1.sol path/to/MyContract2.sol`\r\n\r\nI have two contracts that I want to deploy from my project, but I want to flatten them both using `truffle-flattener` and then compile the two flattened `.sol` files. If `truffle compile` supported specifying the location of the files to be compiled, I would be able to cleanly do this in the build script. As it stands now, I have to mess around with renaming directories prior to compilation.\r\n\r\nBig thanks to everyone contributing to truffle!",

I think we'll have to add fixtures to the main repository's scenario testing to make these tests possible. (That work isn't within in the scope of this issue or PR fwiw). It might a little bit on this end before we could evaluate a PR in any case. \r\n\r\nAlso well worth checking out the `CONTRIBUTIONS.md` - it has instructions on how to set Truffle up to make pull requests.
