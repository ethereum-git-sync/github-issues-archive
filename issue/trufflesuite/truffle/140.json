  "body": "[EIP-20](https://github.com/ethereum/eips/issues/20) is a standard format for issued tokens, so that user interfaces can provide extra ways for users to exchange them.\n\nThe Mist wallet already supports them, so you can paste in your token address and see your token balance in your Mist wallet.\n\nLong term we'd like to at MetaMask as well.\n\nIt would be a great dev experience if they had the ability to issue standard tokens as their first hello, world project.\n\nThis would be a good first-time contributor contribution, since it's basically just about making a basic truffle application that can be generated with `truffle init`.\n",
