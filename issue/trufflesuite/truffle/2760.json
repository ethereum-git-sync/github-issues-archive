  "body": "- [ ] I've asked for help in the [Truffle Gitter](http://gitter.im/Consensys/truffle) before filing this issue.\r\nEverytime I try to unbox react through truffle, the following message appears, I've tried everything it says but the problem still persists.\r\n\r\n```\r\n> client@0.1.0 start C:\\users\\uddhav\\desktop\\w\\client\r\n> react-scripts start\r\n\r\n\r\nThere might be a problem with the project dependency tree.\r\nIt is likely not a bug in Create React App, but something you need to fix locally.\r\n\r\nThe react-scripts package provided by Create React App requires a dependency:\r\n\r\n  \"eslint\": \"^6.1.0\"\r\n\r\nDon't try to install it manually: your package manager does it automatically.\r\nHowever, a different version of eslint was detected higher up in the tree:\r\n\r\n  C:\\Users\\Uddhav\\node_modules\\eslint (version: 5.16.0)\r\n\r\nManually installing incompatible versions is known to cause hard-to-debug issues.\r\n\r\nIf you would prefer to ignore this check, add SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true to an .env file in your project.\r\nThat will permanently disable this message but you might encounter other issues.\r\n\r\nTo fix the dependency tree, try following the steps below in the exact order:\r\n\r\n  1. Delete package-lock.json (not package.json!) and/or yarn.lock in your project folder.\r\n  2. Delete node_modules in your project folder.\r\n  3. Remove \"eslint\" from dependencies and/or devDependencies in the package.json file in your project folder.\r\n  4. Run npm install or yarn, depending on the package manager you use.\r\n\r\nIn most cases, this should be enough to fix the problem.\r\nIf this has not helped, there are a few other things you can try:\r\n\r\n  5. If you used npm, install yarn (http://yarnpkg.com/) and repeat the above steps with it instead.\r\n     This may help because npm has known issues with package hoisting which may get resolved in future versions.\r\n\r\n  6. Check if C:\\Users\\Uddhav\\node_modules\\eslint is outside your project directory.\r\n     For example, you might have accidentally installed something in your home folder.\r\n\r\n  7. Try running npm ls eslint in your project folder.\r\n     This will tell you which other package (apart from the expected react-scripts) installed eslint.\r\n\r\nIf nothing else helps, add SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true to an .env file in your project.\r\nThat would permanently disable this preflight check in case you want to proceed anyway.\r\n\r\nP.S. We know this message is long but please read the steps above :-) We hope you find them helpful!\r\n\r\nnpm ERR! code ELIFECYCLE\r\nnpm ERR! errno 1\r\nnpm ERR! client@0.1.0 start: `react-scripts start`\r\nnpm ERR! Exit status 1\r\nnpm ERR!\r\nnpm ERR! Failed at the client@0.1.0 start script.\r\nnpm ERR! This is probably not a problem with npm. There is likely additional logging output above.\r\n\r\nnpm ERR! A complete log of this run can be found in:\r\nnpm ERR!     C:\\Users\\Uddhav\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm-cache\\_logs\\2020-01-15T03_47_18_452Z-debug.log\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\ntruffle unbox react\r\nPlease provide the shortest amount of steps to reproduce your issue.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\nunbox successful, sweet\r\n\r\nWhat you expected to happen.\r\n\r\n## Actual Results\r\nThere might be a problem with the project dependency tree.\r\nIt is likely not a bug in Create React App, but something you need to fix locally.\r\nWhat actually happened. Please give examples and support it with screenshots, copied output or error messages.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n* Operating System: Windows\r\n* Ethereum client:\r\n* Truffle version (`truffle version`): 5.1.8\r\n* node version (`node --version`): 12.14.1\r\n* npm version (`npm --version`): 6.13.8\r\n",
