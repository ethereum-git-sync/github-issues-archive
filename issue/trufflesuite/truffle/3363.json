  "body": "Not sure if this is feasible, but this might be a useful capability:\r\n\r\n## Enhancement\r\n\r\nAs a Truffle user, when connecting to a public network, I should not need to pre-configure Truffle with mnemonic password information.\r\n\r\nInstead, in such situations, Truffle should prompt me on the command-line to enter my password in a \"no echo\" fashion.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\nThere's likely gotchas here - what commands do we support? Certainly, we can't always guarantee access to stdin, and it might be tricky to enumerate all the edge cases. A better solution might be to add a new provider that runs a webserver + relies on MetaMask or WalletConnect or such.\r\n\r\nOpening this issue just for consideration.",

In my opinion, the truffle deployment/accounts config website docs are in need of much more detail regarding the full set of HDWallet-Provider constructors. But overall deployment and accounts management could use some freshening up. I have some ideas and will return at later time after figuring out why I keep receiving deployment timeout erros on live network at 750 seconds.",
