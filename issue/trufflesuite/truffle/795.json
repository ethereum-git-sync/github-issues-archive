    "body": "@rstormsf This problem has also been raised in #555 where a global event registry was proposed. The underlying issue is that `truffle-contract` looks at the contract ABI to decode events but X is not part of Y's interface. \r\n\r\nAs a stop-gap you could declare an abstract contract that defined a common event interface for X and Y?  If that doesn't work for your use case you could manually decode the raw logs on the receipt using a utility like [abi-decoder](https://github.com/ConsenSys/abi-decoder). \r\n\r\nAKAIK this behavior hasn't changed between Truffle 3 / 4 but I could be wrong about that. Do you have a view about what the best long-term solution for this might be? ",
