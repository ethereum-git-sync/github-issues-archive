  "body": "I was watching @kevinbluer demo the debugger for Teams, and we noticed that `stepInto` would apparently do nothing. This happens because it's apparently doing a `stepNext` if there's nothing to step into and we don't visualize sub-line highlighting yet.\r\n\r\nHowever, my experience with debuggers (JDB, GDB, LLDB, NodeJS, Visual Studio, VS Code, Eclipse, Android Studio) has led me to believe that it should not `stepNext` if there's nothing to step into, it should `stepOver`\r\n\r\nThis is required for us to release the debugger in Teams\r\n\r\nWhile I think this should be the behavior, yall can disagree, but we would at a minimum need a flag or separate function to call to achieve this behavior (and I don't think we need an overengineered solution here to solve every issue [i.e. a customer handler argument that determines the while loop behavior], just a quick one to solve this one [i.e. adding a boolean to let us switch to step over fallback instead of into, or preferably changing the step into logic to always fallback to over rather than into])\r\n\r\nTo further support this request, here is a gif of me using the NodeJS debugger:\r\n![Peek 2020-06-18 15-10a](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/549323/85078630-abd14800-b179-11ea-8591-8f955dbe0ece.gif)\r\n\r\nYou can see at line 22 where I press step into, but it steps over rather than next. A step next would have highlighted the `msg.sender` expression. You can also see at line 27 where I don't stop on line 28 at all when I step into, and go into the `canBeTrue` function\r\n\r\nI'm happy to provide more examples from other debugger sources if you're not convinced",
