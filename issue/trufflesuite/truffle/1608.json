In soldity contract names are case sensitive. While that is largely true with most modern OS's, there may still be some that treat filenames as case insensitive. \r\n\r\nFor example:, in a filesystem \"SimpleDAO.sol\" might be considered the same thing as \"simpledao.sol\". In solidity code contract SimpleDAO is definitely different than simpledao. \r\n\r\nDon't know if this is worth addressing though. ",
