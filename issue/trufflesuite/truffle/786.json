    "body": "Hi. I have been poking around the code and trying to figure out why the README is getting deleted. I figured I would give this a shot since it is just deleting a file. \r\n\r\nThe 'init' command is using 'bare-box'. https://github.com/truffle-box/bare-box/. In the truffle-box.json ignore property, it has README as one of the files to ignore (delete). First, yours gets overwritten by this one (I think) and truffle deletes it anyway when it is cleaning itself up.\r\n\r\nWhat you should do to avoid this is instead of creating a README first, run truffle init and then add a readme AFTER init. Another way you could avoid this issue is to rename your current README to something else like README_MINE and then run init. Finally, delete the truffle README and rename yours back to README. Voila! \r\n\r\nLet me know if that works. ",

For example, don't delete anything if there is any readme or other folders/files not related to truffle. \r\n\r\nSay you have a readme file, a folder named 'styles', a file named 'helloworld.js', another folder named 'contracts', a 'truffle.js' file, and 'truffle-box.js'.
