  "body": "## Issue\r\n\r\nThis issue is a followup to #6083.  Right now, debugger and decoder use ENSJS to perform ENS resolution (forward and backward).\r\n\r\nThe problem is that ENSJS will throw on forward resolution if the ENS name contains certain characters that are (under certain circumstances?) not allowed in a URL.  However, it is perfectly happy to *return* those characters when performing a reverse resolution.\r\n\r\nWe should figure out how to make it allow those characters, or switch to a different library that doesn't have a problem with this, or just do things ourself (although that's obviously a bunch of work).\r\n\r\n## Reproduction steps\r\n\r\nSee \"testing instructions\" in #6083.  The address `0xa39739ef8b0231dbfa0dcda07d7e29faabcf4bb2` appearing in the `TroveOwners` variable should have an ENS name listed of `üçëü™¥ü§ù‚öîüõ°.eth` (assuming forward really does match backward, which I didn't check).  Right now, it has none listed, due to the problem above.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n* Truffle version (`truffle version`): 5.9.4",
