  "body": "- [x] I've asked for help in the [Truffle Gitter](http://gitter.im/Consensys/truffle) before filing this issue.\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\n## Issue\r\n\r\nEvents in deployed contracts do not fire.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. truffle migrate --reset (in order to make sure that the contracts are deployed without errors)\r\n2. Call any function, in any of the contracts, which emits an event.\r\n3. Events are like they do not exist in the contracts' code.\r\n\r\nThe only way to see the events fire, is through Remix or Etheratom etc. where I redeploy the contract without Truffle.\r\nFor example, **if I just press \"Deploy\" in Remix**, call a function which has an emit in its code and run it, everything works as expected (see [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/tmksy5ohx03bpcz/only_Deploy.png) for an example).\r\n\r\nBut, **if I press \"Deploy at address\"** and set the address as my, already deployed (from `truffle migrate --reset,` contract's address, then I receive [this](https://www.dropbox.com/s/h626agu9575d8y7/with_Deploy_At_Address.png).\r\n\r\nThere are no error messages. Anything.\r\nGanache's **Events** tab just stays empty.\r\n\r\n[Here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/1d2y4hx4egpto8i/contract_deployment.png) is a picture of one of my contracts' deployment.\r\n\r\n## Code Example\r\nHere is a very simple example with an event that I am using in one of my contracts:\r\n```\r\ncontract someContract {\r\n  event newEvent(address indexed);\r\n  function someFunc(address _address) public {\r\n    new SomeContract(_address);\r\n    emit newEvent(_address);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Things That I Have Already Tried\r\n\r\n- Reinstalled Nodejs/npm\r\n\r\n- Tried in a different operating system (WIndows 10)\r\n\r\n- Tried to use Truffle's Pet-Shop Box - Added some events and the same issue exists\r\n\r\n- Tried using `ganache-cli`\r\n\r\nOne more thing that I'd like to mention, which I do not think that it has to do with my issue in any way, is that I can run Ganache Gui only by doing a:\r\n`sudo ./Ganache`.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n* Operating System: Ubuntu 18.04 (same issues with Windows 10)\r\n* Ethereum client: Ganache 2.1.0\r\n* Truffle version (`truffle version`): 5.0.31\r\n* node version (`node --version`): 8.10.0\r\n* npm version (`npm --version`): 3.5.2\r\n",

    "body": "**Update:**\r\nI tried using [this](https://kalis.me/check-events-solidity-smart-contract-test-truffle/) tutorial that I found in the \"truffle-assertions\" package.\r\n\r\nIt passed the test without any errors.\r\n\r\nI also tried to reproduce the problem through Remix.\r\nSo, I just added a simple:\r\n`event maxBet(uint256);`\r\n\r\nand changed getMaxBet() function to:\r\n```\r\n    function getMaxBet() public returns (uint256) {\r\n        emit maxBet(address(this).balance);\r\n        return address(this).balance / 100;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nand it worked. I don't really know how or why Remix now had the event in its logs (I used \"Deploy at address\" and put the truffle's migration of the contract address as the address). (Check screenshot [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/roj8oqcasa5l34d/remix_Casino_example.png))\r\n\r\nThe only issue, is that the event can not be seen in Ganache (see screenshot [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/li7ivb0bhry8bag/ganache_Events_Casino.png)).\r\n\r\nOkay, now I really do not know what is the problem.\r\nI will try to furthermore investigate the issue.

    "body": "@GeorgePals, this issue should be fixed in Ganache UI's [latest beta](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache/releases/tag/v2.1.1-beta.3). Do you mind giving this beta version a shot and letting me know if it does indeed fix the issue.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nPreviously, Truffle was (erroneously) including the event's signature in the event's ABI, and Ganache at some point began relying on the event's `.signature` property in order to filter events. Truffle fixed the issue, but it took me a while to figure out what happened and then finally apply a fix within Ganache. I'll likely release this latest beta to stable next week (pending the outcome of Hurricane Dorian, as I might be it's path and could lose power this week :-) ).",
