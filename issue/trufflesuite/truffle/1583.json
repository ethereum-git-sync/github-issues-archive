  "body": "Hi\r\n\r\nI'm using Truffle 5 and Geth 1.8.20.\r\n\r\nI have 2 test suites under my `tests` folder. These test suites are not related.\r\n\r\nIf I run my tests in one single command (`truffle test --network myprivategethnode`), the second test suite is reusing the states changed in the first test suite.\r\n\r\nI was thinking that each test suite is isolated from the others. This principle works well on Ganache but not on Geth.\r\n\r\nHave you notice this behaviour?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n\r\n",
