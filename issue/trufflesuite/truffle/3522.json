  "body": "- [X] I've asked for help in the [Truffle Gitter](http://gitter.im/Consensys/truffle) before filing this issue.\r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\n## Issue\r\n\r\nTruffle sends hundreds of eth_getBlockByNumbers requests **per second**, and the number grows along with how long the tests go (making it closer to thousands in big test scripts). Probably that is somehow related to txReceipt, await, or smth - I'm not sure.\r\n\r\nThe result of this is node getting incredibly slow, and finally the connection crashes.\r\n\r\nTried with different nodes (Ganache, Hardhat, Nethermind) - the behaviour is the same.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Clone any well-known repo with large set of tests (for example xDAI stake-token: [https://github.com/xdaichain/stake-token](https://github.com/xdaichain/stake-token))\r\n2. (you can skip or comment process.env lines in migrations - they load lists of tokenholders, and aren't needed for tests)  \r\n3. Run any node with logging on port 8545\r\n4. Run `truffle test`\r\n5. Wait and see how eth_getBlockByNumber requests number grows (best seen in Hardhat cause it groups similar requests)\r\n\r\n(It was reproducible on my project too, just giving xDAI as an open-sourced example anyone can clone and reproduce)\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nI have no idea why truffle would need so many eth_getBlockByNumber requests for one receipt.\r\n\r\n## Actual Results\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5636644/98945900-73008980-24f3-11eb-92fa-f62a8750c9d2.png)\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n* Operating System: MacOS 10.14.5\r\n* Ethereum client: Ganache, Hardhat, Nethermind - all latest. Web3.js v1.2.9\r\n* Truffle version (`truffle version`): v5.1.52 (core: 5.1.52)\r\n* node version (`node --version`): v12.19.0\r\n* npm version (`npm --version`): 6.14.8\r\n",

    "body": "I searched for truffle calling lots of superflous `eth_getBlockByNumber` and found this. I had the feeling the time the tests takes is exponential in the amount of tests that I wrote, in other words, with every new test that I write it gets worse, because later tests taking more time, because they call `eth_getBlockByNumber` increasingly more often.\r\n\r\nMy truffle version is \r\n\r\n```\r\n$ truffle version\r\nTruffle v5.3.1 (core: 5.3.1)\r\nSolidity v0.5.16 (solc-js)\r\nNode v13.14.0\r\nWeb3.js v1.3.5\r\n```\r\n\r\nand my ganache version is\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ganache-cli --version\r\nGanache CLI v6.12.2 (ganache-core: 2.13.2)\r\n```\r\n\r\nso at first I thought it cannot be this bug, because as far as I understood the linked threads it sounded like it was fixed by now. Anyway, I proceeded to use the workaround, e.g. using the above mentioned setting in `truffle-config.js`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmodule.exports.networks.development.disableConfirmationListener = true\r\n```\r\n\r\nand it reduced the time that my `truffle test` takes from 12 minutes down to 3 minutes. Without the workaround the last of my testes calls `eth_getBlockByNumber` ca. 405 times between two transactions; with the workaround it is called precisely once per transaction. So thanks for the workaround!",

    "body": "@kiview When you send a transaction, web3 provides a listener for the \"confirmation\" event which I believe fires when the tx is included in a block and then again for every new block where that the transaction is part of the history. If you don't use the \"confirmation\" listener then I think you should be fine disabling it. The whole reason this causes slowness is because web3 polls over and over to check for these new blocks if it knows you are listening for the event.",
