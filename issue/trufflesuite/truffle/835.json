    "body": "`meta`'s creator was/is part of ConsenSys, so I heard of it via his recommendation.\r\n\r\nI've been generally quite happy with the process for Truffle's use case. We looked at other tools / methodologies before deciding on `meta` and determined that it was the best option considering the existing code structure and processes. It's been a [perhaps tenuous] team belief that a \"poly-repo\" setup is worth a bit of engineering overhead, that it helps in the effort towards clean separation of concerns via small, cohesive libraries.\r\n\r\nOf course, there is still the engineering overhead, and certainly more to come. For instance, we had decided to expand on `meta` with `meta-pkgs` (to handle dependency graph traversal), and we'll likely continue to improve the process with additional plugins or improvements.\r\n\r\nSome known limitations / sticking points right now are:\r\n- Releases with changes in lots of repos take about 2 hours to complete.\r\n- There's been a handful of tweaking required since we set up the CI infrastructure, and there are still minor outstanding issues\r\n- It requires extra attention toward information dispersal / process documentation, which has introduced nonzero amounts of friction for community contributors\r\n\r\nAll in all though, I think we've all been pretty happy with the process. And once we set up good continuous deployment, we'll be a lot closer to \"ideal\".\r\n\r\nTo your question: yes it is \"as easy as described\", as far as getting cross-repo changes to link upâ€”just use the same branch name across repos. We specifically targeted this use case, so it should simply work.\r\n\r\nWould be curious to hear your thoughts on what is non-ideal and/or confusing, @lazaridiscom! Thanks for bringing this up.\r\n\r\nOh, by the way, some links:\r\n- [`meta-pkgs`](https://github.com/trufflesuite/meta-pkgs)\r\n- [CI repo](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ci), see [`bin/run_tests`](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ci/blob/master/bin/run_tests)\r\n- [Common .travis.yml file](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle-migrate/blob/develop/.travis.yml) that can be the same for all repos",
