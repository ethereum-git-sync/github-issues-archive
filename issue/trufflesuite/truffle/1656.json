  "body": "Truffle doesn't support Quorum's `privateFor` transaction parameter today. See [this wiki page](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum/wiki/Transaction-Processing) for details on this parameter and how it impacts transactions in Quorum.\r\n\r\nSupport for this field should be added to `truffle-contract` at a minimum, but also we should take a look at Truffle's migration and test subsystems to figure out how to allow users to handle private transactions in those contexts.\r\n\r\nI'm not certain that adding this to `truffle-contract` automatically adds support to Drizzle. As a result, I'd advise reviewing Drizzle's integration of `truffle-contract` and giving consideration to exposing user controls in Drizzle which more readily allow for private transactions.",
