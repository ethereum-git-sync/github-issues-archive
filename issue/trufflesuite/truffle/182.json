    "body": "@tcoulter - Having a regular backend could definitely be useful since you don't want all interactions to happen on chain. Or maybe I'm missing something and you could shed some light on it.\r\n\r\nLet's say you have a dapp that implements a standard buy-sell escrow contract. Wouldn't it be better if you could negotiate prices with the seller off chain, or any kind of communication really, and then place the final order using the contract? You don't want to be spending gas for discussions.\r\n\r\nYou could have a REST API on another server and use responses from there but it'd be great if there was an option to do this straight from truffle.",

    "body": "@rohithpr That was an old commit - things have changed a lot since then.\r\n\r\nYou can do this easily with Truffle 3. You'll use Truffle to write, deploy and test your contracts. Doing so will create `.json` files within your contracts `./build/contracts` directory. In your backend, if it's Javascript, you can use those `.json` files in conjunction with [truffle-contract](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle-contract) to interact with your contracts from the backend. If you write your backend in a different language, those `.json` files have everything you need in order to interact with them.\r\n\r\nWe don't have examples that show this, but if you build something that's public we'd love to see it.
