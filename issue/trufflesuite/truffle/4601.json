  "body": "## Issue\r\nDue to [this underlying issue](https://github.com/ensdomains/ensjs/issues/81), @truffle/contract is reporting a High severity npm audit failure. A PR which might fix it was submitted several weeks ago but has not been evaluated or merged, and the last commit to make it into that repo was more than a month prior. \r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\nRun `npm audit` with `@truffle/contract@4.4.2` installed in a project.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\nNo audit failures.\r\n\r\n## Actual Results\r\nSeveral audit failures, including a high-severity [Regex DoS stemming from use of glob-parent <5.1.2](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-ww39-953v-wcq6), and another high-severity [prototype pollution issue from y18n](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c4w7-xm78-47vh). There are also moderate-severity issues [in elliptic < 6.5.3](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-r9p9-mrjm-926w) and [in mem < 4.0.0](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4xcv-9jjx-gfj3) and [in yargs-parser <5.0.0 & 7.0.0](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-p9pc-299p-vxgp) which this should fix as well. \r\n\r\nRunning `npm ls glob-parent` gives \r\n```\r\n`-- @truffle/contract@4.4.2\r\n  `-- @ensdomains/ensjs@2.0.1\r\n    `-- @ensdomains/ens@0.4.3\r\n      `-- ethereumjs-testrpc@6.0.3\r\n        `-- webpack@3.12.0\r\n          `-- watchpack@1.7.5\r\n            +-- chokidar@3.5.2\r\n            | `-- glob-parent@5.1.2\r\n            `-- watchpack-chokidar2@2.0.1\r\n              `-- chokidar@2.1.8\r\n                `-- glob-parent@3.1.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning `npm ls y18n` gives \r\n```\r\n+-- @truffle/contract@4.4.2\r\n| `-- @ensdomains/ensjs@2.0.1\r\n|   `-- @ensdomains/ens@0.4.3\r\n|     +-- ethereumjs-testrpc@6.0.3\r\n|     | `-- webpack@3.12.0\r\n|     |   `-- yargs@8.0.2\r\n|     |     `-- y18n@3.2.2 deduped\r\n|     +-- ganache-cli@6.12.2\r\n|     | `-- yargs@13.2.4\r\n|     |   `-- y18n@4.0.0\r\n|     `-- solc@0.4.26\r\n|       `-- yargs@4.8.1\r\n|         `-- y18n@3.2.2\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is also a moderate-severity [issue in ansi-regex](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-93q8-gq69-wqmw) under this path, but that's not the only place it's found, an [update would also be needed in chromafi](https://github.com/F1LT3R/chromafi/issues/34) and pulled to Truffle's fork of it.\r\n\r\n## Response options\r\n1) Assist @ensdomains in addressing their own deprecated dependency\r\n2) Fork the patched dependency and maintain that separately, at least until @ensdomains comes back online\r\n3) Remove the dependency on @ensdomains/ensjs and replace it with something else if needed.\r\n4) Continue to ignore the issue and hope Truffle users generally don't care about security to the extent they'd care about npm audit failures.\r\n\r\nIn creating this Issue, I propose not #4.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n* Operating System: Win10\r\n* Ethereum client: geth\r\n* Truffle version (`truffle version`): @truffle/contract 4.4.2\r\n* node version (`node --version`): 16.13.1\r\n* npm version (`npm --version`): 7.24.0\r\n",
