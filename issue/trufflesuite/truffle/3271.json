  "body": "## Issue\r\n\r\nThe `contracts_build_directory` compiler option appears to not being handled properly on Windows.\r\n\r\nRunning `truffle test` always ends up converting my contracts build directory (where Truffle creates all JSON artifacts) from `'./<my_project_folder>/build/contracts'` (which is also the default BTW) to some temporary Windows directory, for example, `'C:\\\\Users\\\\LOCALC~1\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\test--12372-H5iUC1JGbek1'` (the suffix changes on every execution).\r\n\r\nThis, in turn, causes a full rebuild upon every execution (i.e., `truffle compile --all` is always executed automatically before the actual test begins).\r\n\r\nI have added some printouts in your code (file `cli.bundled.js`), and found out that the problem may be stemming from when function `prepareConfigAndRunTests` is called with this temporary directory.\r\n\r\nI believe that the problem might be here:\r\n```\r\n      Environment.detect(config)\r\n        .then(() => copyArtifactsToTempDir(config))\r\n        .then(({ config, temporaryDirectory }) => {\r\n          return prepareConfigAndRunTests({\r\n            config,\r\n            files,\r\n            temporaryDirectory\r\n          });\r\n        })\r\n```\r\nAnd since I know that this problem does not occur on neither Linux nor MacOS, I believe that it possibly stems from `Environment.detect`.\r\n\r\nWhat I don't get is, when printing all Truffle configurable directories (`contracts_directory`, `build_directory`, `test_directory`, `contracts_build_directory`, etc) in your code, why the only one which is replaced with a temporary directory is `contracts_build_directory`.\r\n\r\nAny help would be very much appreciated, as I am currently left to wait on compilation before every test.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n* Operating System: Windows 10\r\n* Truffle version (`truffle version`): 5.1.36\r\n* node version (`node --version`): 10.16.0\r\n* npm version (`npm --version`): 6.9.0\r\n",

    "body": "So it looks like this bug is caused by the way that Truffle compiles during testing. I think when it compiles, it only saves the artifacts to the temporary directory that it creates for the test run. This leaves the \"real\" project build directory with artifacts that are out of date. It seems like Truffle should instead check to see if a compilation is necessary before it creates the temporary directory and copies the artifacts.\r\n\r\nI would assume that if you do a regular `truffle compile` before you test, it will not re-compile those contracts.\r\n\r\nI think we should be able to have a patch out for this by the end of next week. Thanks again for reporting this @barakman!",

    "body": "@barakman Why do you say `truffle compile --all` is run? Internally, Truffle does not do that and only looks for sources that have been modified more recently compared with the built artifacts compilation time. If you think I'm wrong and know where it happens in the code, could you reference it here? It could do that, however, if you pass the `--all` flag somehow.\r\n\r\nOn mac, the behavior I can replicate is the recompilation of contracts that were out of date before running `truffle test`. If I modify a source, it will recompile EVERY time I run `truffle test` after that because the built artifact is not getting updated. This is because `truffle test` uses a temporary directory, recompiles modified sources, and saves them to the temporary directory used for testing. It never saves to the normal build directory in this flow. Every time you run `truffle test` again, it once more copies your out-of-date artifacts over to the temporary directory which causes it to recompile again.\r\n\r\nThe solution I worked out in #3438 was to compile artifacts before copying the built artifacts to the temporary directory. This will cause the copied artifacts to always be current with your source files.",

Isn't it going to be a different path every time I run `truffle test`?\r\n\r\nIf no, then can you please rephrase your suggestion?\r\n\r\nAlso, please note that it seem a bit odd for me to deal with this problem, which was not present prior to Truffle 5.x.\r\nI'm suspecting that it is indeed relevant only for Windows; would you be able to check this conjecture somehow?\r\n\r\nThank you for your help :)",
