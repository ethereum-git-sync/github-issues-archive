If I open truffle console, it makes no errors, so I understand is accessing the network. Also, I am able to acces web UI of quorum maker so in fact the network is created. \r\n\r\nHowever, when I tried to deploy a contract through truffle, I got: \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21060405/57374519-746c2b80-7171-11e9-843f-e4825474acc1.png)\r\n\r\nAlso, if I deploy the contract directly from quorum maker web UI, the contracts appears to be deployed but if form truffle console I run \"networks\", I get that no contract is deployed on the network, so something is generating that inconsistency and I don't understand the reason. \r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\nCreate Quorum maker network on centOS virtual Machine with IP 192.168.26.9 and RPC port 22000\r\nJoin node on same IP but different ports\r\nconfigure truffle-config.js to work with that network\r\nCompile contracts\r\nTry to deploy\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nGet my contract deployed and accessible over truffle console and stop getting inconsistencies with quorum maker\r\n\r\n## Actual Results\r\n This error got displayed: \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21060405/57375040-bf3a7300-7172-11e9-8b92-fb706023e2e6.png)\r\n\r\nAnd truffle console shows (the first output is about ganache, the second one is the one of Quorum Maker)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21060405/57375075-de390500-7172-11e9-962d-79712d24f0e8.png)\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n* Operating System: CentOS 7\r\n* Ethereum client: Geth - Quorum Maker network \r\n* Truffle version (`truffle version`):  v5.0.14\r\n* node version (`node --version`): v10.15.1\r\n* npm version (`npm --version`): 6.4.1\r\n",

Will need some time to explore Q Maker under the hood, but I have a hunch that unlike the Quorum 7nodes example (https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum-examples/tree/master/examples/7nodes), Q Maker doesn't handle minting of new blocks. It _looks_ like Q Maker confirms tx receipt, but that the pending block is never minted.\r\n\r\nIf you have more insight into how Q Maker handles block validation, would love to hear about it 🙏 ",

    "body": "@romisalve , following up on this. There are a couple of things going on.\r\n\r\n1) websockets definitely aren't working w/ Quorum, but I'm not sure if it's something that needs to be enabled on the Quorum Maker side, or if it's the version of `web3.js` we're using that is unable to converse with Q Maker using websockets. \r\n1) Since Quorum is a permissioned chain, we can expect standard `web3.js` methods like `web3.eth.isSyncing` & `web3.eth.isMining` to return false (no mining, only validating). Also, the web3 lib we're currently using (`web3.js`) [especially versions >1.0] is very EVM-specific.\r\n1) There appears to be a default timeout occurring on the Q Maker side of things. If I `migrate` and `migrate --reset` a bunch within roughly 5 mins of joining/creating a Q Maker network, everything works as expected. There _could_ be something we're not handling on our side of things. Will need to verify by modifying some of the Q Maker geth node start-up scripts.",

IIRC, Quorum has a super large block gas limit so I'm surprised you ran into that type of error. Can you share a link to your contract?\r\n\r\nRegarding the ABI, I'm not sure yet on the scope of Q Maker, but if you're able to provide reproducible steps (i.e. link to a repo) I can take a look.",

    "body": "https://github.com/romisalve/Quorum-POC.git There is my contract. There are a lot of commented lines due to the following reasons :\r\n\r\nWhen I tried to compile it I got \"stack too deep error\" and started commentig lines of returns (of course it was not the most intelligent decision but I didn´t how to solve it)\r\nI have a lot of internal functions which actually I believe I need them as public because as internal they can only be called inside the contract or I am wrong? But if I put them as public, I end on the same error of \"can´t store..\" \r\n\r\nNow I was trying through truffle console (from where I made the web3.eth.personal.unlockAccount and I was being able to deploy that contract). I was trying this: \r\n\r\nCrudAEOCreate.deployed().then(function(instance) { crud = instance;})\r\n\r\n crud.createMasterDataAEO(1234, \"primerFuncRefNum1234\", \"primerDocName\", \"receipType\", \"receiptName\", \"senderType\", \"senderAEO\", \"12456\" );\r\n\r\ncrud.associateMasterDataParty(\"primerFuncRefNum1234\",\"PrimerpartyNameAEO\",\"PrimerShortNameAEO\",\"PrimerBusinessTypeAEO\",2601,\"Peru\",\"PrimerRoleCodeAEO\");\r\n\r\n crud.readAEO( \"primerFuncRefNum1234\",\"senderAEO\",\"PrimerpartyNameAEO\", 2601, \"PrimerRoleCodeAEO\");\r\n\r\nAnd the two first don't give any error, but the third one gives the error of the image on the previous post.  The first two gave this outputs: \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21060405/57937231-e17f6f80-789b-11e9-8a26-a556c379ed82.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21060405/57937257-f0662200-789b-11e9-83ef-f6abd8b98d16.png)\r\n\r\nOn my contract, on the readAEO function, actually I need to have this on return: \r\nreturns(string endDateAEO, string memory recipientAEO,\r\n                                    string memory partyShortNameAEO, string memory businessTypeAEO, string memory identificationIssuingCountryAEO)\r\n\r\nBut with that statement, when I tried to call the function I got \" returned values aren't valid, did it run out of gas?\" so I try changing the return to an uint but anyway I am not being able to execute the function. \r\n",

Originally, the contract was a CRUD contract but due to this same error, I decided to split it up into smaller contracts. What happen with those arrays and mapping created on the first contract if I need them for my operations on the other contracts? If I deploy all the contracts on my network, are they reachable from other contracts where they are not defined? Or which would be te approach?\r\n\r\nAnd a final question, how can I expose my smart contract operations in order to consume them but no directly from truffle? I was planning to use Camunda BPM modeler to model some forms and consume smart contract methods. It is possible?",

    "body": ">In the read function may I add the return statement with some string output parameters and some uints?\r\n\r\nThat should be fine. IIRC, the problem with the read calls you were making were directly related to your read function definition in the smart contract. The definition had multiple parameters that were completely unused or inaccessible. It looks like that's why web3 was throwing that \"out of gas?\" returned value err. I _think_ as long as you make sure whatever parameters are being passed are used in some manner within the function, you should be fine.\r\n\r\n>What happen with those arrays and mapping created on the first contract if I need them for my operations on the other contracts? If I deploy all the contracts on my network, are they reachable from other contracts where they are not defined? Or which would be te approach?\r\n\r\nAny mappings that are public can be read from another contract.  I believe if you want to add to those mappings, they either need to be added via a method in that contract, or through a contract you deploy that inherits that contract.\r\n\r\n>And a final question, how can I expose my smart contract operations in order to consume them but no directly from truffle? I was planning to use Camunda BPM modeler to model some forms and consume smart contract methods. It is possible?\r\n\r\nOh, that's a really cool idea. You can probably use the Camunda BPM modeler with the contract json artifacts found after compilation in the `build` folder.\r\n\r\nYou might want to take a look at the abi spec (https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/tree/develop/packages/truffle-contract-schema#abi) since you're thinking specifically about contract methods. On that page you can also find the general contract json object schema although it needs to be updated since we now support NatSpec in Solidity contracts (https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/natspec-format.html). Using NatSpec you can have `userdoc` and `devdoc` auto-populated into your contract build artifact. That might be a better higher level choice than using the abi. This documentation is a more up-to-date higher level look at how contract object json's get defined and written: https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/tree/develop/packages/truffle-artifactor#artifactorsavecontractdata",
