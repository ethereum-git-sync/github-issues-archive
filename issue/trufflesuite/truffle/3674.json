  "body": "While preserve-to-ipfs and preserve-to-filecoin allow users to preserve their files to Filecoin, there are some tools/services that can make this easier.\n\nPowergate offers a friendly API around the Lotus client, which could be used in a preserve-to-powergate plugin, but since this still requires you to run a Lotus client, so imo this does not offer a significant benefit over the main preserve-to-filecoin plugin.\n\nOn the other hand textileio offers an S3 like wrapper around Filecoin called Buckets. This allows you to store files on Filecoin without having to run your own Lotus client. This has significant benefits and should be considered as an extension. For the current integration this is out of scope though.",
