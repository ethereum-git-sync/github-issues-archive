  "body": "- [x (kinda) ] I've asked for help in the [Truffle Gitter](http://gitter.im/Consensys/truffle) before filing this issue.\r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\n## Issue\r\n\r\nTruffle exec creates a very easy to use execution environment, but building additional functionality around it can be difficult since it can only be called from the command line.  If truffle exec was able to be imported as a javascript module it would make building things like a new CLI on top of this execution environment much easier.  It feels like a natural extension anyway since the truffle exec command effectively just takes in a javascript function as an argument.  \r\n\r\nA potential catch I could see popping up while implementing this feature is the issue of finding the artifacts location or maybe more generally the truffle config file location.  Obviously from the command line you have the execution context and can just look in the current directory.  But if I was building a tool or wrapper around this new exec module, using the current directory as the base location for finding artifacts would not be very useful a lot of the time.  If I were running exec as a javascript module I would expect to be able to pass in the location of the artifacts or config if possible.  This is more of a nice to have though, as it's totally reasonable for something built on top of truffle exec to have the same restrictions as the command itself.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nI'd like to be able to do something like the following:\r\n```\r\nconst exec = require('truffle-exec');\r\n\r\nexec.setConfigLocation('/config/location');\r\n\r\nexec.run(() => {\r\n    // My js code\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Actual Results\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n",
