    "body": "@redsquirrel For some reason your link is 404'ing for me. That said, @jeremyellis and @phuongvietle, you solve cyclic dependencies using abstract contracts: http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contracts.html?highlight=abstract#abstract-contracts\n\nImagine a scenario where contract A will create a new contract B (A depends on B). And B will use the contract A. Here, there's a cyclic dependency. You can resolve that by creating an abstract version of A and using that within B. Example:\n\nA.sol\n\n```\nimport \"B.sol\";\ncontract A {\n  B b;\n  function someFunction() {\n    b = new B();\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAbstractA.sol\n\n```\ncontract AbstractA {\n  function someFunction(); // No implementation!\n}\n```\n\nB.sol\n\n```\nimport \"AbstractA.sol\";\n\ncontract B {\n  AbstractA a;\n\n  function setA(AbstractA new_a) {\n    a = new_a;\n  }\n\n  function useA() {\n    a.someFunction();\n  }\n}\n```\n\nObviously this isn't a great example because B doesn't do anything useful, but you get around the cyclic dependencies using the abstract version of A. Note: You can't create new instances of an abstract contract (i.e., `new AbstractA()` will throw an error). If you need both contracts to create a new version of A, you should create a third contract called \"AFactory\" whose sole job it is to create A's. \n\nClosing as this isn't a truffle issue.\n",

If `C` did the creating and connected `A` and `B` to each other, then everything should technically work (but Truffle would still error). Only cyclic _creation_ dependencies are impossible.\n",

    "body": "Using this new version of Truffle, I have a simple contract that imports another contract (not a library).  When the imported contract is changed, it's not rebuilding the contract that imports it.  Using 'truffle compile --compile-all' resolves the problem by forcing a complete rebuild.  Hopefully this isn't an either / or situation where we need the cyclic dependency check in order to have dependencies built automatically.",

I'd recommend you create a new ticket instead. \r\n\r\nWhen doing so, it's very helpful to provide code and show us your directory structure, and tell us where you're importing from, say from npm, or ethpm, etc. If from npm or ethpm, that's a known issue.",
