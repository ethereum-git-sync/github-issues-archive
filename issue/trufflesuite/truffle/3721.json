development --reset```\r\n* Run tests (in order to debug a transaction which reverts): ```npx truffle test```\r\n* Debug transaction with Truffle Debugger: ```truffle debug <tx_hash>```\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nBeing able to debug the transaction.\r\n\r\n## Actual Results\r\n\r\n```\r\n❯ truffle debug '0x3057987b561313e620765f76842ed9334cdc27e0e31fecb4d872ebbce8da2a7e'\r\nStarting

We would have to change it for Open Zeppelin SDK in order to be able to upgrade Node and then Truffle.\r\n\r\nSo as you can imagine, it is a big deal of a change in a large project, and it is uncertain if we break anything else by doing these upgrades.\r\n\r\nIs there something else I could do about the error with Truffle?

    "body": "Hi @eggplantzzz, thanks for your reply. I'm afraid that updating Truffle and Node isn't a viable option, at least not for now (rest assured that we want to but it's not the right time).\r\n\r\nI tried a few other versions of Truffle (both older and newer), and I had the same problem (I can't remember which versions right now, I'm so sorry). I also tried on a virtual machine with Ubuntu 20.04 installed, and the same version of Truffle that I now have installed on my Mac, but I came across some different errors (i.e. it said the the transaction was not found, even though it exists and the hash was copied directly from Ganache).\r\n\r\nI would say that it used to work in the Ubuntu virtual machine I mentioned before, but not all the time. I had a bunch of different errors, but none of them looked like the one I reported. On my Mac, it never worked, no matter what I did.\r\n\r\nIn regards of what changed to make it break, honestly I'm not really sure. The environment changed (from Ubuntu to Mac), but it's not clear if this is enough to make it break. Besides, there have been many changes in the contracts' code, but again I don't think that this causes the problem because today I had to make changes in a really old branch, and when trying to debug a transaction I had the same error I reported.\r\n\r\nI'm just wondering if Truffle works the same way in every operating system, or if there are subtle differences that make it work completely different and are error-prone.",

    "body": "So sorry about this. I can't think of anything actionable here, since it'd be similarly unreasonable for Truffle to go back to supporting Node v8.\r\n\r\n> I'm just wondering if Truffle works the same way in every operating system, or if there are subtle differences that make it work completely different and are error-prone.\r\n\r\nOnce in awhile we get differences related to operating system, but usually not for Linux vs. Mac... usually only Windows causes problems. Certainly any OS-related Truffle problem is a Truffle bug, and we try to treat that as such.\r\n\r\nWe'll leave this issue open for now in case there's something we can do about it in the future.\r\n\r\nAgain, sincere apologies that you're in this tight spot with this issue. ☹️ ",

    "body": "Hi @gnidan, thanks for your reply. I understand that this is a tricky situation and it may be particular for this project.\r\n\r\nA few weeks ago I gave it a shot again and I tried to make it work (kinda). Let's say that my succeed rate was about 40%. Regardless, I would like to share the steps of my experiment in case it works for someone else:\r\n\r\n- Installed the latest version of Node available using NVM (in my case, Node v15): `nvm install node`\r\n- Switched to this Node version: `nvm use 15`\r\n- Installed the latest version of Truffle *globally* (this is important as I was using the Truffle version installled from the project): `npm install truffle -g`\r\n- Installed the latest version of Ganache *globally* (this is important for the same reason): `npm install ganache-cli -g`\r\n- Started an instance of the globally installed Ganache via command line: `ganache-cli --gasLimit 0xfffffffffff -i 1564754684494 --accounts 500 --defaultBalanceEther 100000000000000000 --port 8545`\r\n- Opened a new terminal and switched to Node v8: `nvm use 8`\r\n- Deployed the smart contracts to said instance: `npx truffle migrate --network development --reset`\r\n- Generated transactions to debug (in my case, running tests): `npx truffle test`\r\n- Opened another new terminal and switched to Node v15: `nvm use 15`\r\n- Entered the debug console using the globally installed Truffle: `truffle debug <tx_hash>`\r\n\r\nThese steps allowed me to debug *some* transactions but not all of them. Hope this helps.",
