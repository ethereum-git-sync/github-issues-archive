  "body": "The Ethereum provider API has changed a bit over the years, and as of June 2018 [EIP-1193](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1193) has standardized this API.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately Truffle internals still make use of the older `sendAsync` provider method. We should probably knock that off and get with the times.\r\n\r\nThis is labeled conservatively as requiring a breaking change, however it's open for consideration as to whether we force EIP-1193 compliance upon all providers that are given to Truffle (e.g. via a provider factory function in `truffle-config.js`), or whether we should detect when we receive an older provider type and wrap it (likely within `@truffle/provider`). If we do take this wrapper approach, we might want to consider printing a warning (likely as a deprecation notice), as it will be impossible for us to test rigorously that every possible type of provider will work under this scheme.\r\n\r\nNote: This was captured from an internal session where we discussed **potential** future breaking changes for major releases. Until the team assigns this ticket, this is merely a proposal, and not a commitment to make this specific change.",
