  "body": "## Issue\r\n\r\nSee also: #4779\r\n\r\nSo in addition to Etherscan, Sourcify, and Blockscout, [Subscan](https://www.subscan.io/) also supports contract verification.  At least, on some of its networks; not on most of them.  But it supports it on a few of them, and even some ones that Etherscan and Sourcify currently don't.\r\n\r\n(Note: One of these is Astar's Shibuya network, which uses chain ID 81, but which doesn't appear in any of the usual chain directories -- those list chain ID 81 as belonging to the Zenith testnet Vilnius...)\r\n\r\nNow, I haven't yet tried this out, so I don't actually know yet whether its API will suffice for our purposes.  But, I should try this out later and report back on whether it's good enough.  And if it is, then there should be a Subscan source fetcher!\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n* Truffle version (`truffle version`): 5.6.5",

    "body": "OK, I took a look at this because I didn't have time for much else tonight.  Conclusions:\r\n\r\n1. Unlike the Blockscout API, the Subscan API does seem to be good enough to be usable.  However...\r\n2. I wasn't able to determine how it handles linked libraries.  It clearly *does*, there's a field for this, but the docs don't explain it; the example in the docs doesn't use linked libraries, so I don't know how it works when there are any present.\r\n3. I'd determine the answer by verifying a contract myself and trying it out, but, Subscan only supports verification on a few particular networks, and most of those aren't testnets, so they don't have faucets.  The two that *are* testnets (Pangolin and Pangoro), I couldn't get the faucet to work.\r\n4. So my only way to get an answer to this question is to find a verified contract on Subscan that uses linked libraries.  I couldn't find a single one.\r\n\r\nNotionally we could exclude linked library handling -- they're a \"specialization\", after all -- but I'd really prefer not to.\r\n\r\nI can file an issue with them asking for an explanation; hopefully we get a response?",
