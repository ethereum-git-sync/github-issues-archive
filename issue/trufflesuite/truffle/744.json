  "body": "## Issue\r\n\r\n`truffle publish` chokes on the `gathering contracts...` step for some repos. It seems like it's failing to parse contracts that it doesn't have any issues with when you `truffle compile`.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone git@github.com:ConsenSys/PLCRVoting.git\r\ncd PLCRVoting\r\ngit checkout ecc6bf0799b9c0bb71a21e25aeaeaae5d79ba6b5\r\nnpm i\r\nnpm run compile\r\nnpm run publish\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nI expect the publication to succeed. (The particular thing you're checking out to reproduce should eventually fail because there's no `secrets.json` file, but the compilation step should not be failing, and it behaves the same if you do give it a funded `secrets.json`).\r\n\r\n## Actual Results\r\n\r\nCompilation fails. But compilation succeeds if you do `truffle compile`!\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n* Operating System: Ubuntu 16\r\n* Truffle version: 4.0.4\r\n* Ethereum client: INFURA\r\n* node version: 8\r\n* npm version: 5\r\n\r\n  ",

    "body": "@skmgoldin Hey, so this happens in `truffle-compile/parser.js`. When it merges all files into one `.sol` and sends it to `solc`, it does not filter by warnings. Therefore, all errors + warnings are seen as Exceptions and stop the publish.\r\n\r\nThe `compile` command has its `strict` mode off, which means it's filtering out warnings.\r\n\r\nA second issue is that the compiler can't resolve imports correctly, so if you actually use a function from an import, it will fail when doing `parse` like `truffle publish` does.\r\n\r\nSubmitted https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle-compile/pull/48",
