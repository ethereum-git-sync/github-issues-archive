  "body": "## Issue\r\n\r\nThis might be *too* breaking, @gnidan will have to say something about that.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the way that bytecode with library links is stored in artifacts is to have two underscores, followed by the library name, followed by underscores to pad it out to 20 bytes (40 characters, since it's basically in hex).  This format has a number of problems.  It can't handle long library names (#954).  It also can't handle multiple distinct libraries with the same name (#3927).\r\n\r\nNow Truffle DB is intended to handle problems like these, but, hey, if we're proposing breaking changes, I'll propose breaking this. :P\r\n\r\nIt's worth noting, btw, that this is *not* how we receive the bytecode from the compiler!  Either raw from the Solidity compiler or from our own `compile-solidity`.  The raw output uses a fixed-length hash rather than the name (and it uses the fully-qualified name, too, so multiple libraries with the same name don't get confused; worth noting it does use the characters `_` and `$`).  The output from `compile-solidity` zeroes out that hash, and also it loses the filename info (see: #3903, #4428, my failed PR #3905).  So it still has problem #3927 (which Truffle DB is intended to solve), but at least it doesn't have problem #954 with the names being too long.  However that format isn't just a string with bytecode, it carries the library links in a separate object...\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n* Truffle version (`truffle version`): 5.5.27",
