    "body": "@boorac What is likely happening here is you're receiving a refund from the EVM.\r\n\r\nThere are two reasons for a refund (below are excerpts from the EVM Yellow Paper):\r\n- `when the storage value is set to zero from non-zero` (refund of 15,000 gas)\r\n- `for self-destructing an account` (refund of 24,000 gas)\r\n\r\nIt looks like `deposited[investor] = 0` qualifies for the first.\r\n\r\nYour transaction is going to take X gas to execute, at the end of the executing the transaction, if you qualify for refunds, the account is refunded the gas. Unfortunately, it's reported as \"spending 24721 gas\" rather than reported as \"consumed 39721 gas and received a refund of 15000 gas, netting your account 24721 gas used.\" I would hypothesize that if you set your gas limit to 39721, it would succeed.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if anything is actually being done to handle this more gracefully. `ethereumjs-vm` (the EVM implementation that `(G|g)anache(-cli|-core)` uses) was updated to report how much was refunded https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-vm/pull/284 such that `ganache` could add it in the estimate provided when `eth_estimateGas` was called (still waiting on merge https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-core/pull/80) so that the estimate would include how much was actually needed to execute the transaction successfully.\r\n\r\nHope this helps clear things up.",

Some questions to ponder:\r\n- Does Metamask call `eth_estimateGas` to determine the suggested gas limit for a transaction?\r\n- If it does (rather than doing it's own estimation), then the follow up question would be what blockchain are you using to do this? I would suspect you're using `ganache` with `truffle migrate`.\r\n- If so, then the issue lies in solving https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-core/issues/26 which requires some discussion about how `eth_estimateGas` is perceived (which may have recently been discussed; I'll have to ping @benjamincburns  about that) so we can pick an implementation",

Regarding Metamask and eth_estimateGas, I suspect that Metamask uses some kind of heuristic since every time  I attempt to call a function which will be reverted the gasLimit in the transaction is automatically set to 0.\r\n\r\nI will try sniffing out the traffic using wireshark and report back.
