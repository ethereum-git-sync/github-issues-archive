  "body": "This came up in conversation with @elenadimitrova (I believe she came up with the idea)\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nStarting the debugger should not tightly couple it with a particular transaction. It should be possible to debug more than one transaction, or debug the same transaction multiple times, without restarting completely.\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\n\r\nThe debugger does a lot of preprocessing that doesn't relate to a specific transaction, and that adds substantial overhead. This is bad in Colony's case, where they have a significant number of contracts. The debugger was observed to take minutes to load for them.",
