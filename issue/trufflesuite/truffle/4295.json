  "body": "When analyzing transactions and debugging coding problems, I often need to perform \"one off\" debugging, usually for projects that aren't mine. I find that the Truffle debugger interface is the best around, and Remix is the second best. Currently, I'm debugging assembly and would love to debug a transaction without a config file. In fact, having to create a config file/directory to analyze a single transaction is cumbersome enough that'll I'll choose to use Remix instead. I'd rather do something like this: \r\n\r\n```\r\n$ truffle debug 0xabcd... --network http://localhost:8545\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would also be great if the debugger didn't try to compile anything during command. It would be alright if it attempts to compile and finds no code -- though again, there's no config file so the debugger would need to continue like normal. \r\n\r\nThoughts? \r\n\r\nBottom line: Creating a Truffle project is tedious and cumbersome when using the tool for analysis purposes. Would love a way to specify config options on the command line. ",

If that's broken, would you mind opening a separate bug report for that? There might be some kind of feature enhancement to detect this situation; maybe `--compile-none` is implied if there's no `truffle-config.js`? Not sure how it should work, but probably worth moving to another issue to discuss there.\r\n\r\nThanks for raising these! 🙇 ",
