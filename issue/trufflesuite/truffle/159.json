  "body": "I understand that truffle's deploy and test flow intentionally do not support contracts with parameters. It seems like this would still be double with a custom exec script. I am going to need be able to unit test the constructor for my contract since it is an important part of the dapp's overall functionality. Could you provide a basic example of how one might approach this, or give some suggestions for someone relatively new to Solidity/Truffle development? Thank you!\n",

    "body": "Hey @raineorshine,\n\nI apologize for not responding to this. The way I do it is to have the test set up a new version of the contract using `MyContract.new()`, passing constructor parameters, then I write tests against that contract using further transactions and calls. Let me know if you need a code example, and I can provide one. \n\nClosing for housekeeping, but I hope I helped (even though my response was way late!). Thanks!\n",
