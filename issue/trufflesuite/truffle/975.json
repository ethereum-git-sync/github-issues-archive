    "body": "@4000D Thanks for opening. Your idea about first showing the errors, then showing the warnings is a good one, although I think your work around is also pretty nice. \r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ truffle compile | grep Error # <-- Nice!\r\n```\r\n\r\nLeaving some notes / context here for further consideration:\r\n\r\n+ the recent spate of warnings is related to `solc`'s pending upgrade to a new version which will have many breaking changes. With v0.5.0 they will be errors. Sort of an idle question but: will warnings decrease (a lot) soon? \r\n\r\n+ my impression is that the Solidity engineers do not want warnings turned off or filtered out. Solidity is a special language case because its programs typically manage funds in a no-recourse financial transaction system - all warnings should be taken seriously. Given a mix of warnings and errors, it may be best to start at the top fixing each one in succession. . .\r\n\r\n+ Maybe we should colorize the solc output: warnings => yellow, errors => red. \r\n",
