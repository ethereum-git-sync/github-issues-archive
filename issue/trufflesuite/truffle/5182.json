  "body": "@eggplantzzz brought this up during review of #5158.  Currently all errors occuring during gas estimation are treated the same; with stacktracing turned off, we error out, but with stacktracing turned on, we ignore the error and continue forward with a default gas.\r\n\r\nTyler suggested that perhaps we might want to discriminate based on the particular cause of the error; in particular, he suggested that we might only want to continue for a revert error, and error out earlier for other sorts of errors.\r\n\r\nIt's not entirely clear to me if there exist cases where this would make a significant difference, but it may be worth thinking about?\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n* Truffle version (`truffle version`): 5.5.17",
