  "body": "## Issue\r\n\r\nCurrently the debugger has no way to view variables that are currently shadowed.  Basically this is due to the fact that the debugger's variable tracking is pretty crude; it doesn't really have proper first-class stackframes.  Some reworking of the system to allow that would be good.\r\n\r\nNote that on Solidity versions prior to 0.6.0, this would also include seeing inherited contract variables shadowed by other contract variables.  That could maybe be done without redoing the whole variable system (I had an idea for how), but it's not clear how high a priority that is given that it's basically a legacy feature at this point.",
