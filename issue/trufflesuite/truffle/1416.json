  "body": "## Issue\r\n\r\nThis is not really one singular issue; apologies for submitting a grab-bag, but separating this out would take some work, and I wanted to get written down all the oddities I'd noticed.\r\n\r\nIt's very possible all of this is fixed in the `decoder` branch; I'm not familiar with what's going on there.  But I wanted to get these oddities written down.  All of these were initially found while doing manual testing with my `ConstructorTest` contract on the `newvarids` branch but I've reproduced them on `next` as well; the examples given will *not* be minimal, sorry.  It's possible some of these problems may have been introduced in `stackframes`, but in that case I'd say they were more *uncovered* by the incorporation of that branch rather than *caused* by it...\r\n\r\nAnyway, I realize normally one should not submit an issue like this but I hope you will let me get away in this case with submitting this grab-bag of issues without proper minimal examples.\r\n\r\n1. Variables of contract type always decode to `undefined`.\r\n\r\nThis one is self-explanatory.\r\n\r\n2. Local variable updates early?\r\n\r\nIn the following code, where `secret` is a contract variable equal to `107`:\r\n``` \r\nfunction mangle() public view returns (uint8 mangled)\r\n  {\r\n    mangled = secret+1; //how dastardly!\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `v` command shows `mangled` as being equal to `108` while still on the line `mangled = secret + 1`.  (Unless that's how it *should* be, in which case other variables seem to update late.)\r\n\r\n3. Nonsense value for local variables\r\n\r\n*After* the above line is done, and we end up at the line corresponding to the function signature, we get the following values:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  mangled: 86\r\n   secret: 107\r\n```\r\n\r\nBasically, `mangled` still points to the same location on the stack, but that number is now nonsense; however, the variable hasn't gone away yet.  Ultimately the correct value (`108`) is returned, not `86`, but it sure doesn't look like it to the user.\r\n\r\n4. Contract variables \"forget\" their values until used again\r\n\r\nSame context, once again.  `secret` was set to `107` in the contract's constructor.  But on entering the function `mangle` above, `secret` displays as `0`.  Not until we are past (not *at*) the AST node of `secret` itself does `secret` read as `107`.\r\n\r\n(From what I hear I'm guessing `decode` will fix this, but, like I said, I'm just cataloguing stuff right now.)\r\n\r\n5. `index: NaN`\r\n\r\nThe following appeared as a `ref` object in `data.proc.assignments`:\r\n```\r\nref:\r\n  { storage:\r\n    { from: { slot: { path: 0, offset: 1 }, index: NaN },\r\n      to: { slot: { path: 0, offset: 1 }, index: NaN },\r\n      name: 'parent' } } }\r\n```\r\n\r\nProbably worth noting: This was for a variable of contract type.  As best I can tell, this consistently happens for contract variables of contract type?\r\n\r\n6. Contract variables redeclared as local variables??\r\n\r\nDisregard this one, I fixed it.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n* Operating System: Linux Mint 18.3 64-bit\r\n* Ethereum client: `ganache-cli`\r\n* Truffle version (`truffle version`): `next`\r\n* node version (`node --version`): 10.6.0\r\n* npm version (`npm --version`): 6.2.0",
