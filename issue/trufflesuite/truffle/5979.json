  "body": "## Issue\r\n\r\nWhen sending a transaction with Truffle Dashboard, users can use MetaMask to speed up or cancel a transaction. This poses a problem for tools like Truffle and Hardhat, which were both written with the expectation that whichever txHash gets submitted is the txHash that gets confirmed (or dropped). These tools don't provide a means of allowing replaced transactions (purely because they were not written with external signers in mind).\r\n\r\nSince there are a number of totally normal reasons for why users might want to replace transactions in this flow, esp. on testnets or on Polygon ([which enforces a minimum priority fee higher than tooling defaults](https://twitter.com/pcaversaccio/status/1597365974365532160)), we should consider how Truffle Dashboard can help here. (Of course, a proper solution would be for Truffle, Hardhat, et al. to incorporate the capacity for this \"replaced transaction\" state more fully, but that's another thing...)\r\n\r\nOne solution might be for Truffle Dashboard to offer a signature request mode that waits for full confirmation before responding to the message-bus. By using this toggle, users could speed up transactions however many times they want, and only the txHash for the final/confirmed transaction would make it back over the wire. (Right now, the provider response happens as soon as the user confirms or reject, which means that the message-bus response and Truffle/Hardhat/etc. will only ever see the initial/replaced txHash)\r\n\r\nWe could even possibly encode some network condition detection criteria to suggest this toggle when a speed-up is likely to be necessary. This detection might be tricky though, so we might have to rely on good UX design to offer this option without it being confusing/noisy. \r\n\r\n(This limitation was originally surfaced in #5967 by @pcaversaccio. Thank you for bringing this to our attention!)\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Send a transaction through Truffle Dashboard via Truffle or Hardhat\r\n2. Sign the transaction\r\n3. Speed up the transaction before it gets confirmed\r\n4. Observe an error on the Truffle/Hardhat side with a note about \"Transaction replaced\"",
