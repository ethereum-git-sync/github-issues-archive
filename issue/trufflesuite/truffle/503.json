  "body": "Guys, your idea with storing deployment state on-chain is just awful.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, this just does not help. There are many other much better ways to store info.\r\n\r\nAlso, this works only if all is working good. If smth was broken (code, Ethereum node, network etc.) - debugging becomes a nightmare. Manual excessive logging required from developers\r\n\r\nIt is much better to have a JSON file or SQLite database with migration state, with full logging of performed actions. And store this file in the git repo.\r\n\r\nAt least, make it possible to run arbitrary migration script manually. Not just `--reset` and run all migration scripts from the scratch\r\n\r\nAlso, consider making truffle a library, not a framework. It will be much easier to write tests and migration scripts, and just run them with node.js.",

I don't know who engineered this but it's the worst engineering thing I have seen:\r\n\r\n- You spend extra gas when you don't really need to do it, you can store current step localy\r\n- It is difficult to understand which transaction deployed the contract and which does update migration status. \r\n- You spend lot of time to understand what is this thing about when you learn how to use truffle, because it is hard to understand why someone may come up with such idea, because you tend to believe that \"migrations\" is sort of library included by truffle to enhance your own contract.\r\n\r\nHorrible, horrible, horrible. \r\nYou lowered the rating of your software by about 50% by including this nasty feature.",

    "body": "I think that it will be enough for truffle test to accept the \"-f\" (from) and \"--to\" flags, as interpreted by truffle migrate. \r\nAt this moment those flags are ignored.\r\n\r\nThere are very good reasons to skip deployments while executing tests. Functional test or integration test will require deployments to get sure that functional and/or integration tests work as expected. Unit-test have a real need to skip deployment to be able to test in isolation (vs test output dependent on random/non-specific JS deployments that could alter the test output).\r\n\r\nCan anyone guide where to patch in code this issue?",
