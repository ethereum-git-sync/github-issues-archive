    "body": "Hi there, I was not able to reproduce this issue. I do believe that the advice in #542 is correct regarding your need to fix the path setup to ensure you can access truffle appropriately. \r\n\r\nThis stackoverflow discussion should make things a lot clearer: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14803978/npm-global-path-prefix\r\n\r\nBasically, you'll need to check if your path is correct for npm and truffle. When I run` npm config get prefix` in my terminal I get `/usr/local`, which should be the default on a mac. If you are using a different operating system, I think the stackoverflow discussion above should be very helpful in figuring this out. \r\n\r\nI'm going to close this issue as it doesn't look to be a problem with the Truffle code, but if you find that is not the case or run across a different problem, please feel free to open a new issue. Thanks!",
