  "body": "### Description of the Issue\r\n\r\nThe logic for re-fetching the balances bails out if they have no tokens attached to their wallet. So if the initial scan fails, the try again button is a no-op. @dternyak had caught this in the wild a bit back, but couldn't reproduce.\r\n\r\nI took a stab at fixing it in branch `rescan` but haven't had a chance to do a thorough test before my machine started acting up. If the fix works, I think this should make it into the next RC.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Open a new address in the send view that you haven't scanned with before\r\n2. Initiate scan, cause it to fail somehow\r\n3. Click \"try again\" button\r\n4. Nothing happens",
