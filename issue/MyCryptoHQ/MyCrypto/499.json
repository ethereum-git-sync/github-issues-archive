  "body": "### Why?\r\nReleases should largely be automated, however due to security related concerns about completely automatic releases, I would like to propose a system that automates the boring parts while still allowing us to validate builds before release.\r\n\r\n### What?\r\nThis release management process would be completed via several components:\r\n\r\nComponent 1: Release Bot\r\nHandles building and PRing \"`dist`\" patches to a (new) repo that will be used exclusively for GitHub static site hosting (so that existing workflows are supported)\r\n\r\nIntegrate with sentry bot to provide a method of inputting expected changes that will be deployed in some timespan, and alert on all non-expected changes (includes both a release that is unexpected, as well as unexpected diff on an expected release)\r\n\r\nNote: We will likely have a separate repo for staging, so this bot should be configurable to handle building against multiple repos.\r\n\r\nIn total:\r\n    - MyEtherWallet (current)\r\n    - MyEtherWallet-Prod\r\n    - MyEtherWallet-Staging\r\n\r\nComponent 2: Verification Bot\r\nBy sharing logic from the release bot, this script will build locally and compare against change-set described above to ensure the diff is identical.\r\n\r\nWill be used to validate bot-created PRs against staging and production to ensure the expected diff is correct. Because the build is minified/mangled, human verification is not possible.\r\n",

    "body": "Researching and thinking on this issue, I think we can start with a CLI app that could both serve as a foundation for bot creation & allow for greater developer interaction. Here's a rough outline:\r\n\r\n- CLI app would take a MEWv4 release tag as input, pull down the corresponding repo, and build the project.\r\n- Depending on the CLI flags specified, it can then either:\r\n  - (1) calculate and report a unified hash of all the built dist files\r\n  - (2) hash another target directory and throw if the hash from (1) doesn't match\r\n  - (3) hash the staging/prod dist files in a PR and throw if the hash from (1) doesn't match\r\n  - (4) create and submit a pull request to the staging / production environments\r\n\r\nSome key features this structure would enable:\r\n- Developers could independently run the app in mode (1) or (3) to verify that the hash & version reported in any PRs is correct. This would allow for 'reviews' to take place, despite the minified code -- devs would reject the PR if the hashes can't be verified.\r\n- Travis could be integrated with (2), such that the CI in the staging / prod repos will throw if a PR's calculated hash/version differ from the reported hash/version. This would essentially assume the 'Verification Bot' role described above\r\n- The automated PR creation of (4) would serve as a basis for 'PR Bot' also previously described\r\n\r\nSo this would allow us to start off with a manual process that's still largely automated. Longer term, I think we can generalize Site Sentry bot so that it could assume various modes of task running. The 'PR Bot' would be one such mode, and the the CLI app would serve as the basis for this functionality.",
