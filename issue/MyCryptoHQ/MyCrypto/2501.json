That causes address valiation to fail, resulting in red outline and inability to make a transaction.\r\n\r\n### What exactly were you doing when you encountered this issue?\r\n1. Access mycrypto.com web wallet\r\n2. Paste \" 0x2a0c0DBEcC7E4D658f48E01e3fA353F44050c208\" into target address field\r\n3. Observe address validation failure\r\n\r\n\r\n### How were you accessing your wallet?\r\nIrrelevant\r\n\r\n### Description of Your Machine\r\n\r\nBrowser: Google Chrome\r\nBrowser version: Version 73.0.3683.103 (Official Build) (64-bit)\r\nOperating system: Windows 10 (version 1803)\r\nDevice: Reproduced on 2 different PCs\r\nMyCrypto.com\r\n\r\n\r\n### Console Logs / Screenshots\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1264210/56083513-51768200-5e26-11e9-84b5-f9b6d421b2cf.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n",
