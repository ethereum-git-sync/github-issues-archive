  "body": "I noticed that the translations require translators to edit the raw JSON, which might not be easy for some users. I use Crowdin in one of my projects and it couldn't be easier. Instead of translators trying to figure out GitHub, they can simply enter translations on a website. With GitHub integrations, it allows you to simply update the `en.json` in your repository, and it will automatically update the strings on Crowdin. When users make translations on Crowdin, the translations are automatically pushed to a branch of your repository and a pull request is open so you can merge them in. You can check it out at http://crowdin.com",
