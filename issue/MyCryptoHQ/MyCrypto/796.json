  "body": "While the estimate gas call is resolving during transaction generation in the send view, the generate transaction button is disabled.\r\n\r\nWhen the response is especially delayed, the user is given no feedback that they should continue to wait for the call to resolve.\r\n\r\nIn addition to providing the user guidance about why the generate button is disabled, we should consider providing a method for the user to override and stop waiting for the estimate gas call to complete.\r\n\r\nWe could potentially accomplish this by allowing users to craft transactions without waiting for the call to complete if advanced mode is toggled, however we would also want to add functionality so that users can manually trigger a gas estimate.\r\n\r\n\r\n- [ ] Show loading indicator during gas estimation instead of only disabling generate transaction button\r\n    - Timeout after `n` seconds (30?) and inform user that gas estimation is taking too long to resolve. Allow user to generate transaction by auto-toggling advanced, and inform them that we recommend waiting to ensure the gas limit will be set correctly.\r\n- [ ] Allow users to skip the wait for the gas estimation (potentially via toggle of advanced options)\r\n- [ ] Allow users to manually trigger gas estimation in advanced mode",
