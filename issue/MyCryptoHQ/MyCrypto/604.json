  "body": "[POA Network](https://poa.network) works fine with Ledger after supplying custom node `https://core.poa.network` and choosing ETH, but the transactions signed with Ledger will fail due to invalid chain id (1 instead of 99, see their [chain spec](https://github.com/oraclesorg/poa-chain-spec/blob/afd65c5cfb79fb115f4c5b9020755f9765cdffa0/spec.json#L24)).\r\n\r\n1. Is there a trivial fix for this? If I understand correctly choosing Custom will not include `chainId` at all. A better solution will be adding custom chain id field for such cases. \r\n2. Are you working closely with the POA team to add a better integration like with RSK, UBQ and EXP?",

    "body": "Hey @rstormsf, you don't have to use port 443 for SSL, any port can run SSL (443 is just a standard for when the port is not provided.) So it's likely that something on the server responds to the initial check against :443, but it's not actually the node.\r\n\r\nI think y'all will get the best support if you hop into our slack. As far as I can tell, custom chain ids are working here, I think it's just some configuration. Just shoot me an email (In my profile) and I can get you an invite.\r\n\r\nWill reopen if we find there's an issue with custom networks.",
