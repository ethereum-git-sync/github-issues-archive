  "body": "Below is a non-exaustive spec of the refactor that should be tested\r\n\r\n## Signing \r\n- [ ] Make sure the right wallet is selected when signing, as in local wallet vs web3 wallet \r\n- [ ] When a transaction sign fails, the state should stay the same except an error notification should be given\r\n\r\n## Validation\r\n- [ ] Any invalid fields should have that field's `value` property set to null \r\n- [ ] Validate `Data` input\r\n- [ ] Validate `To` input \r\n- [ ] Validate `Gas limit` input \r\n- [ ] Validate `Nonce`\r\n\r\n## Value Component \r\n### For Ether \r\n- [ ] Should display to the user the current ether value they've inputted\r\n- [ ] Should validate total ether + gasLimit*gasPrice against their input \r\n### For tokens\r\n- [ ] should display to the user the current token value they've inputted\r\n- [ ] Should validate total tokens + gasLimit*gasPrice against their input \r\n\r\n## To Component\r\n### For Ether \r\n- [ ]  Should display the current `to` value\r\n### For tokens\r\n- [ ] Should display the current `TokenTo` value\r\n\r\n## Nonce \r\n- [ ] Manual entry field should be displayed if any offline state is true\r\n- [ ] If network request fails, it should retry and/or display manual entry \r\n- [ ] Should be in a saga and tested, and grabbed when it's related component is mounted\r\n\r\n## Token / Ether swap \r\n- [ ] Swapping is done by the `UnitDropdown` component which changes the `meta` `decimal` and `unit` fields to the appropriate values\r\n- [ ] When swapping from one unit to another, the previously invalid `value/tokenValue` field may become valid for the new unit as long as its still a valid number. The `raw` value of the `value/tokenValue` field should be taken and converted into a `value` then validated against the user's balance of the new unit. Either `value` or `tokenValue` fields are selected depending if the current unit is a token or ether.\r\n\r\n### Ether -> Token swap\r\n- [ ]  should clear the `data` field then replace it with token encoded data\r\n- [ ] should change the `To` field to the token address, and set the old value of the `To` field to a meta `TokenTo` field (which gets encoded into the data)\r\n- [ ] Same thing as above applies to the `Value` field when swapping from ether to a token\r\n- [ ] `Value` field should be cleared\r\n\r\n### Token -> Token swap \r\n- [ ] should re-encode `data` with the proper decimal, and change the `to` field with the right contract address \r\n\r\n### Token -> Ether Swap\r\n- [ ] should clear the `data` field \r\n- [ ] should clear the `TokenTo` and `TokenValue` `meta` fields\r\n\r\n## Gas estimation\r\n- [ ] When any change in `data` or `to` or `value` is observed, gas estimation should be re-done\r\n- [ ] Gas estimation should be debounced, but the latest value should always be resolved \r\n- [ ] Failure of a network estimation call should have a offline-fallback and/or re-doing of the network call\r\n\r\n### Todo (spec out)\r\n- [ ] Test web3/metamask interactions\r\n\r\n",
