    "body": "I'm on Linux.\r\nThere is most probably something wrong with the network selector.\r\nAs I tried today with 1.61 the following happened:\r\n- Mycrypto is connected to Ropsten (infura)\r\n- I setup a custom network connection named \"Kovan local WS\" on 127.0.0.1:8546 and run a node (ssh tunnel) with `--chain kovan --jsonrpc-cors-all --ws-origins all`\r\n- in the UI, I select my newly created \"Kovan local WS\"\r\n- I instantly get the error message \r\n  >Could not connect to the node. Refresh your page, try a different node (upper right corner), check your firewall settings. If custom node, check your configs.\r\n  \r\n  although the network tab tells me the connection actually got initiated with a response from the node being: \"WebSocket interface is active. Open WS connection to access RPC.\"\r\n- Now if in the UI I select \"Kovan>Etherscan\".. it connects to my localhost (using WS) and if I stop my node MyCrypto rightfully throws error, but the UI shows that I'm connected to Etherscan!\r\n\r\nHere is a quick overview: https://imgur.com/ND3MrYH\r\n",

    "body": "@SharonManrique \r\n\r\n> Our node balancer Shepherd does not currently support WS, it can only handle http requests.\r\n> I believe the solution would be to update shepherd to include WS.\r\n\r\nBut Tbaut and I are both specifying port 8545 and the setup screen defaults to setting port 8545.  That is the RPC port that you can reach over http.  I tested this with this `curl` command:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -X POST --data '{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"method\":\"web3_clientVersion\",\"params\":[],\"id\":67}' 127.0.0.1:8545\r\n```\r\n\r\nShould I try a different `method`?",
