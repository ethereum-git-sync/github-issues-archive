  "body": "### Description of Issue\r\n\r\nThe https://www.mycrypto.com/tx-status page seems to be missing in the beta version. The purpose of this issue is therefore to put it back in place to avoid a loss of functionality in the new version and take advantage of it to improve it, especially in terms of UX.\r\n\r\nNotably, it would be interesting:\r\n- to make it possible to pass parameters to this page (blockchain used, tx address) - triggering automatically the \"Check Tx status\" just as the interact-with-contracts page\r\n- ideally, and especially when the tx is passed as a parameter, the end user would not have to scroll to see the tx information. The idea is that he accesses the desired information (e.g. the fact that the transaction is \"SUCCESSFUL\") as simply and directly as possible.\r\n\r\nOf course, the page would remain accessible without wallet as the \"interact with contracts\" page for read-only functions.\r\n\r\n### What exactly were you doing when you encountered this issue?\r\n\r\nJust trying to access the https://www.mycrypto.com/tx-status page on the beta version\r\n\r\n### How were you accessing your wallet?\r\n\r\nno wallet needed\r\n\r\n### Description of Your Machine\r\n\r\nBrowser: chrome\r\nBrowser version: 80.0.3987.149 (Official Build) (64-bit)\r\nOperating system: Windows 10\r\nDevice: Microsoft Surface Pro\r\nMyCrypto.com vs Desktop Application? MyCrypto.com\r\nMyCrypto Version Number: beta\r\n\r\n",
