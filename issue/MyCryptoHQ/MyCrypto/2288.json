  "body": "### Description of the Feature\r\n\r\ntl;dr: An option to save/reopen wallets that need the entering of private data.\r\n\r\nI talk about these types:\r\n* private key\r\n* mnemonic phrase\r\n\r\nThese are marked as insecure, but it's important to keep in mind that most people don't (and potentially won't) have a hardware wallet and some avoid them on purpose.\r\n\r\nUsing MyCrypto with these is not only cumbersome (having to store the data somewhere else and enter it every time), it is also dangerous because the private data may be intercepted while on the clipboard, or worse, if the user is inexperienced, they may develop a habit of storing private data in plaintext.\r\n\r\nTo this end, I propose the option to save these wallets in MyCrypto and offer to open them after the user logged out/exited the app.\r\n\r\nThe option to save the privkey/mnemonic would be offered as a button once the user entered the respective data and pressed the \"unlock\"/\"choose address\" button. This would open a new pop-up flow. In order to save a wallet, MyCrypto would require the user to name the wallet and define a password (plus enter it again to rule out typos). All the wallet's content would be encrypted with the password, the only thing accessible without the password would be the wallet's name. Once done, MyCrypto would save the encrypted wallet in the application directory, and the user could go on using the wallet or log out.\r\n\r\nOnce the \"View & Send\" screen is accessed again, MyCrypto would display the saved wallets either under a new section (\"Saved wallets\") or within the wallet type they correspond to (e.g. a drop-down list of saved wallets of a type would appear once you choose that wallet type). For the sake of privacy, as previously described, only the wallet name would be accessible and displayed before the wallet is successfully unlocked. Choosing a saved wallet would prompt the user for the password. Upon successfully unlocking the wallet, the UX would proceed as usual.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of privacy and reversibility, MyCrypto would allow the deletion of these saved wallets. This could be implemented in the form of a delete button next to the saved wallet's name in the list. A deletion would require entering the saved wallet's password. If someone gets stuck with a saved wallet which they no longer want to use but forgot the password of, it could be made possible to delete the wallet via some manual mucking-about in the application directory, or with ticking off an option upon uninstalling MyCrypto.\r\n\r\n### Example(s) of Feature\r\n\r\nNone yet in Ethereum -- so it's a great first-mover opportunity!\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?",
