If no more wallets have that custom token, it will be deleted from the global store.\r\n* Scanning for tokens will always scan custom tokens, and present the option to add them even if their balance is zero (But initially be unchecked.)\r\n* Scanning for tokens a second time will still present the tokens previously tracked, even if their balance is zero (But initially be unchecked.)\r\n* Token ticker symbol collisions should result in an error. If a user tries to enter a token that has the same symbol, don't allow them to save, and show a message explaining.",
