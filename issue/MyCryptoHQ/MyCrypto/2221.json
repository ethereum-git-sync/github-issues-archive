    "body": "I actually have this exact problem in an app of mine.\r\n\r\nIdeally `getTransactionCount` should also return the pending transaction count if you pass the `pending` block parameter, but it doesn't. It's a bug that [has been there for years](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/2880) and I am really not sure why it's not being fixed.\r\n\r\nI was considering searching the TX pool myself for pending transactions involving my wallet's address, but I couldn't find enough documentation on that anywhere. I guessed you guys might doing that, which is why I asked here 🙂 I'll definitely update you here if I am able to figure this out.\r\n\r\nps: I also asked MetaMask how they did it, but it turns out that they only keep track of the transactions you post using MetaMask itself.",
