  "body": "### Description of the Issue\r\n\r\nSlightly related to https://github.com/MyCryptoHQ/shepherd/issues/27\r\n\r\nWhen waiting for more than 5s on the MetaMask confirmation prompt, the transaction will be cancelled. This is due to the `timeoutThresholdMs` setting in shepherd, and the fact that it treats all calls with the same timeout threshold per provider. To alleviate this, we can either:\r\n1. Whitelist certain methods that metamask has confirmation prompts for like `signTransaction` and `signMessage` to have no timeout\r\n2. Implement per-supported method timeouts per provider, and set web3 hooked methods to a large value (e.g 5+ mins) \r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Go to `View & Send` tab\r\n2. Log in with MetaMask\r\n3. Create a transaction\r\n4. Continue until you get to MetaMask's popup confirmation modal\r\n5. Wait 5+ seconds\r\n6. Observe that you will get a failure notification even when nothing failed\r\n",
