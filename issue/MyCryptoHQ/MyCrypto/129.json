  "body": "As someone relatively new to crypto, I was a little confused about the current hardware wallet modal. Specifically the concept of derivation paths. The current modal, for reference:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"819\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-08-21 at 2 56 54 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/649992/29533716-2c287932-8681-11e7-823a-f256fb992991.png\">\r\n\r\nI had the following questions when I first saw this:\r\n\r\n* What is a derivation path?\r\n* Do I need to change this?\r\n* The one I selected mentions Jaxx, Metamask etc. Is that OK?\r\n* What happens when I click \"More addresses\"? How many are on here? Can I go back?\r\n\r\nAfter working on Trezor for a bit, I've realized that a lot of this stems from the re-use of the same modal for mneumonic wallets. I think it would be smart to keep that re-use, but tailor the modal for each hardware wallet via component props and make this a little simpler.\r\n\r\nI put together some wireframes (These are NOT designs, just wireframes) of what I think would keep it simpler, without sacrificing the abilities offered from the current one. I'm not sure I captured _every_ state needed, but this should be enough to go off of when we implement this.\r\n\r\n[select-address.pdf](https://github.com/MyEtherWallet/MyEtherWallet/files/1240030/select-address.pdf)\r\n\r\nI'm still a little hazy on the derivation paths and BIP44, so please let me know if I lost anything in this simplification.

    "body": "Yeah its a total shitshow. The problem is if you don't give them the ability to do derivation paths, you will have endless amounts of users unable to access their ETH they sent to an ETC path and vice versa.  There is no doubt a better way to handle it and we should handle it better. \r\n\r\nRight now the most common email regarding HD paths, surprisingly enough, is **not** confusion regarding which path‚Äîmost just leave it unchanged‚Äîwhich is why the modal itself has remained the hot mess it is *(if it ain't broke....)*\r\n\r\nThe most common email is: \"I sent my ETC to my Jaxx ETH wallet and now it's lost and they told me to contact you\" to which we tell them how to find their ETC and they are very happy campers and now use MEW. ü§∑ \r\n\r\nI would propose:\r\n\r\n- Making sure every path is best path depending on mnemonic phrase / hardware wallet / network. \r\n\r\n- Giving users the ability to select a different one via a dropdown\r\n\r\n- Placing a warning if they try to change it that they should be careful and email us if they need assistance or clarification. *(a brief overview could be where you have the ( ? ) icon and it could end with cta to email us if still confused)*\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we *can* choose to ping the node and get the balances of their accounts on each path or different paths if we wanted to. We would need to limit the number of requests but it would be doable. This would be a better user experience, but we need to tradeoff between (1) pinging multiple addresses for ETH balances (2) pinging 3 addresses for ETH + Tokens.\r\n\r\nWhich brings me to my next point: we should check the token balances in this modal dialogue. It irks me endlessly. However, 100 tokens x 5 address = 500 requests each time this modal opens. \r\n\r\nPerhaps we put this latter point on back-burner until we determine best way to efficiently check token balances first (in a new issue)",

But maybe I have too high hopes.\r\n\r\nNope, that's exactly what we do now (well, except we tell them usually that they need to change the node). Problem stems from other UIs actually. You cannot access your ETC or ETH on a different path. So people, not thinking or whatever, send their ETC to their ETH address and then they can't access that address on ETH and they can't access ETC on their ETH address and then we add another user to our collection. \r\n\r\nI think I've mentioned it before but one of the reasons our userbase numbers are so high is that all the other wallets send people to us for one reason or another. This is one of those. We specifically have an auto responded for Jaxx ETC people. üôÉ \r\n\r\nAnyways, I think we are totally on the same page and I'm.veey happy with your wireframes and understanding of the problem and your proposed solution(s). We can iterate if this creates misunderstanding or confusion. \r\n\r\nI haven't talked to you about this but we hope to add some basic usage analytics to v4 to get a better understanding of these sorts of things. Itll be interesting to see if 99% of our users don't select a different path or if a lot do. ",

    "body": "Some more things to consider:\r\n\r\nI think the derivation paths should not be visible by default.  There should be a button \"Find my lost coins\" that unhides the part where you select a different path.\r\n\r\nThis part should have two options:  1. wallet (Ledger/Trezor/Jaxx/Metamask/.../custom),  2. coin (ETH/ETC/Testnet/RSK/EXP/UBQ).  Everything initialized to sensible defaults.  Custom would not show the coin option, but give you the possibility to enter the BIP-32 path for people who know what they are doing (or were told so by support).  Is it currently the case that all wallets except Ledger always want to use m/44'/coin'/0'/0/x as derivation path?  Then the first field would only have the choices Ledger, All other, and custom.\r\n\r\nThe addresses should probably be numbered (starting with 0); this gives a little more reassurance that you can find your address if you remember its number.\r\n\r\nOne problem is that mnemonic can be used to recover from any wallet, so Ledger users would have to  press the \"Find my lost coin\" button to find their Ethers.  But this could be documented in the Ledger manual (what to do if I lose my hardware wallet).",
