However, the unit is still ETH on the testnets, so I don't know if we should rename the unit to the network. Maybe we could call the unit `Testnet ETH` or something to be more clear. I think that it says Ropsten on the sidebar is a bug (It looks to be using the `network.name` key, not `network.unit`.)\r\n\r\nThe [dropdown screenshot](https://github.com/MyEtherWallet/MyEtherWallet/issues/828#issuecomment-357810536) you show in that addresses modal isn't actually for network, that's for the derivation path for non-deterministic modals. It's definitely confusing though, good catch. We should be more specific with the wording there, or add a (?) to find out what that means.
