  "body": "When changing nodes, we ping the next node to ensure that it is available before switching with a timeout. In cases where network connectivity is slow, the node will be considered offline and the user will not be able to change nodes.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Consider various solutions for both:\r\n      - [ ] Not setting to a node that is unavailable \r\n      - [ ] Allow users with bad connectivity to switch nodesz\r\n\r\n@HenryNguyen5's shepherd could help us determine the nature of the users connectivity so we can set timeout's at runtime with more data.",
