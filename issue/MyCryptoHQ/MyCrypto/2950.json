  "body": "The desktop app just does not provide basic functions. I have launched `devnet` with parity, next I need to add it as a custom network, the default ID is `0x11`, well, there is a conflict with some scammy network and I have to create custom config and change ID so it will not conflict with predefined scammy networks which you decided to make mandatory without a chance to overwrite these junk.\r\n\r\nIt's a part of problem. Next is that I have deployed boilerplate ERC20 to play with, fine, let's add it to list, I see the metadata have been pulled from chain but after I click `Save` it never getting saved,, never appeared in a list of available tokens. Where to go? What log to watch? It's a fake desktop app where I have no clue how to look at js console.\r\n\r\nLet's go to mycrypto and give it a try, oh no way, I have to run node behind ssl proxy which is the most annoying snake oil \"security\" there. What a point of mandatory SSL there? Nothing private goes in and out.\r\n\r\nSeriously consider user experience, it's literally a clusterf* when you need to do something different than sending some junk from wallet and don't waste hours on setup. Meanwhile there are tons of annoying wizard and I see in `beta` it will be impossible to use just private keys to play with wallets. If you seriously care about brainless users please don't screw up the rest of \"community\" in their favour.",
