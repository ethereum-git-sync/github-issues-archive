    "body": "Likewise, this would be a good opportunity to clear out unused translations. I'd like to see the following things done as a part of this cleanup, please comment if you think any of these are out of scope:\r\n\r\n1. Wrap all user-facing copy in `translate` and `translateRaw` calls\r\n2. Identify as many common use string as possible, and re-key those as `x_NameOfString`. Some of our common use strings are in really weird keys, like `\"OFFLINE_Step2_Label_3\": \"Gas Price\"`. This should just be `x_GasPrice`.\r\n3. Create a way to pass variables to translations. Right now the way we do untranslated dynamic copy is usually something like `You are about to send ${amount}  to ${address}`, and for translated stuff, we usually just tack it on to the end. What would work 100x better for localization is if we allow tokens that get replaced in translations. For instance, something like `You’re sending $amount to $address\" so that other languages that have different grammar can re-arrange those tokens as needed. It could be called like\r\n  ```\r\n  translate('SEND_summary', {\r\n    amount: tx.amount,\r\n    address: tx.to\r\n  });\r\n  ```\r\n4. Allow for some kind of configurable way to highlight translated copy. This should help with visual auditing to make sure everything is wrapped. This probably doesn't need to be fancy, it could just be a dev-only query param.",
