All correct.\r\nThis account also holds tokens so I click \"Scan for tokens \"and immediately get \"No tokens found\".\r\nThen I click \"Add Custom Token\" and add:\r\nBUSD Token (BUSD) ERC20 Token in Binance Smart Chain Mainnet\r\nhttps://explorer.bitquery.io/bsc/token/0xe9e7cea3dedca5984780bafc599bd69add087d56/smart_contract\r\n\r\nApp queries an address, shows decimals value, symbol, and balance. All seems correct.\r\nUpon clicking \"Save\" nothing happens, and app still shows \"No tokens found\".\r\nAfter that, clicking Scan again yields nothing, as well.\r\nAnd then if I click \"Change Wallet\" and go back to main screen and try to load address again via \"View Address\" an app shows loading icon under Account Balance and gets stuck.\r\nRestarting app helps to get it back to working state except for token support.\r\n\r\n### How were you accessing your wallet?\r\n\r\nPrivate Key\r\nMnemonic Phrase\r\nin this case - View Address\r\n\r\n### Description of Your Machine\r\n\r\n- Browser: not applicable\r\n- Browser version: not applicable\r\n- Operating system: Windows 10\r\n- Device:\r\n- MyCrypto.com vs Desktop Application? Desktop\r\n- MyCrypto Version Number: 1.7.17\r\n\r\n### Console Logs / Screenshots\r\n\r\nOnce I entered address via View Wallet option.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54457203/138317500-429be2f1-da38-442a-b09c-a07098327260.png)\r\n\r\nRight before clicking \"Save\" on adding custom token.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54457203/138317664-64294108-52d0-4625-afde-a13aed3761a2.png)\r\n\r\nScan for tokens doesn't write anything to console.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Hey @ARZUMATA! Thanks for opening this issue, it's much appreciated. I was able to reproduce this behavior from my end.\r\n\r\nThis might be because BNB isn't officially supported by the desktop app at this time, but nevertheless, this isn't expected behavior. If you're able to, can you attempt to access your address (or view-only) with [app.mycrypto.com](https://app.mycrypto.com/)? Binance Smart Chain is supported there, by selecting \"Smart Chain\" upon adding your address to the dashboard.\r\n\r\nMy apologies for the inconvenience this must've caused, but I hope that using the MyCrypto Dashboard might resolve your issue for the time being!",
