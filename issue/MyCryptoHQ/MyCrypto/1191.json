    "body": "Alright, latest update on this: All of the necessary modules have come around to Webpack 4, so we've got builds completing. However, as far as I can tell, Webpack 4 might have changed the way cyclic dependencies resolve, because some of the imports are resulting in empty objects. However, this only happens in production builds, so I can't be sure if it's that or some minification issue. I've tried both babel minify, and uglifyjs, both have thier share of problems. I'll keep working on this.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of minification, I went ahead and measured build times and sizes, here are the results:\r\n\r\n### Build Times\r\n\r\n| Build                       | Old     | New     |\r\n|-------------------------------|---------|---------|\r\n| Initial dev run (no .cache)   | 33.043s | 28.852s |\r\n| Initial dev run (with .cache) | 8.530s  | 5.049s  |\r\n| First watch save              | 2.080s  | 5.164s  |\r\n| Subsequent watch saves        | 1.972s  | 1.577s  |\r\n\r\n^ New build doesn't yet use DLLs due to un-upgraded plugin.\r\n\r\n### Build Sizes\r\n\r\n| File   | Old    | New    |\r\n|--------|--------|--------|\r\n| Client | 6.79mb | 4.55mb |\r\n| Vendor | 2.28mb | 1.47mb |\r\n\r\nThis definitely shows that there are some decent savings with Webpack 4. Hopefully the build can get sorted soon.",

    "body": "After more tinkering, it looks like this is a result of the aggressive tree-shaking / export dependency graph in Webpack 4. I think all of our cyclic dependencies have exposed some kind of a bug. This is fixed by disabled `optimization.concatenateModules`, which uses `optimization.providedExports` and `optimization.usedExports` to determine which modules share sets of imported modules that aren't dependent on each other.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that some of the code (e.g. `common/store/configAndTokens.ts`) use other modules (e.g. `common/selectors/config/nodes.ts`), but for whatever reason Webpack is running the initial code before its required modules have resolved. I think this is because our dependency graph is totally fucked right now.\r\n\r\nSo I think we've got a couple of options:\r\n\r\n1) Switch to webpack 4 with these optimizations disabled. There' still savings in here (5.81mb client, 1.9mb vendor) but it's not quite as much as before. We can fix the dependency graph later.\r\n2) Fix the dependency graph by ducks-ifying a lot of our code (cc @HenryNguyen5) and revisit Webpack 4 then.",
