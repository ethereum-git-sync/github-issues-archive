  "body": "### Description of the Issue\r\n\r\nThis is a strange one that I can't replicate, reported from a user in Discord. On subsequent transaction attempts with a custom token (I believe in the same page load) they broadcast a transaction, get back a hash, but neither our node nor any of the explorers will acknowledge it. Initially I thought this to be a nonce issue, but as you can see from the screenshots below, they get back a tx hash, so the node for whatever reason came back thinking it had broadcasted the transaction. I double checked on all the testnets, so I don't think it's a mistake of which network. I also double checked the sender and receiver, neither sent or received the transaction in question.\r\n\r\nIt's possible that this is something intermittent and weird, or a bug with a node, but I'm logging it in case we see any more reports about it.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Add custom token that you have balance on\r\n2. Send a transaction\r\n3. Send another transaction(? same page load?)\r\n4. Get success message\r\n5. Verify on etherscan\r\n\r\n## Console Logs / Screenshots\r\n\r\n### Confirmation\r\n\r\n![artboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/649992/39461415-6cd6625a-4cd8-11e8-8c5c-3abd66d4679f.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Success!\r\n\r\n<img width=\"661\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-05-01 at 12 35 05 am\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/649992/39461335-e68d6b3a-4cd7-11e8-987a-b487c226b675.png\">\r\n\r\n`0x690bcb67adfe0c81d894fde2d6ebb2ca4b52a53cb2d98deba675f5ab971310ea` if you want to copy it\r\n\r\n### Or not?\r\n\r\n<img width=\"712\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-05-01 at 12 35 13 am\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/649992/39461339-eb7770c8-4cd7-11e8-8e05-9988924914d4.png\">",
