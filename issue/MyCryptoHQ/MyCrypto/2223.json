  "body": "### Description of the Feature\r\n\r\nPOA Network has been developing an open source EVM block explorer called BlockScout. BlockScout provides a better user experience for individuals who are searching for transactions, blocks, and many other aspects of POA. \r\n\r\nIt would be a great feature to have BlockScout included in MyCrypto to replace the community explorer poaexplorer.com\r\n\r\n### Example(s) of Feature\r\n\r\nHere is the homepage of BlockScout for POA Network: https://blockscout.com/poa/core\r\n",
