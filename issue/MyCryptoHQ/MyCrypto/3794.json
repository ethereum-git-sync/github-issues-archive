  "body": "_Github issues are primarily for reporting bugs or getting assistance with development-related items. If you have a question or need support with our product, please email support@mycrypto.com for faster attention._\r\n\r\n_If you are reporting an issue, please use the template below so we can reproduce, determine the cause of the issue, and fix it! If you are not reporting an issue, delete this entire thing and type away. Thanks!_\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Description of Issue\r\n\r\nWhen you click to create a wallet at the screen below, it says it will \"Generate your own private key\"\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2021-01-29 at 9 49 52 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6226175/106253204-4d219000-626b-11eb-96ed-abb2088a7c0d.png)\r\n\r\nThen on the next screen you can choose either Keystore File or Mnemonic Phrase. Let's assume you choose Mnemonic Phrase and you get given it and confirm it successfully.\r\n\r\nAnd lastly you get to choose your Wallet Address.\r\n\r\nThen you get logged in with that Wallet Address and it takes you to the \"View & Send\" page.\r\n\r\nSo at this point you know your Wallet Address and your Mnemonic Phrase, but where do you get the Private Key?\r\n\r\nIn the screenshot below there's a selection box (drop-down menu), with a label \"Select...\" \r\n![Screen Shot 2021-01-29 at 9 49 36 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6226175/106253208-4dba2680-626b-11eb-82b5-357e9d5cd07d.png)\r\n\r\nIf you click \"Select...\" then it reveals options including \"Wallet Info\". If you click that you can get your Private Key.\r\n\r\nI didn't find it easy to find this. But it can be important and convenient to get it, since if the user created it with Mnemonic Phrase, but didn't save the Private Key, they won't be able to seamlessly import their account into something like MetaMask, because MetaMask only allows you to import with your Private Key or JSON Keystore File (not with just the Mnemonic Phrase)\r\n \r\n![Screen Shot 2021-01-29 at 9 59 06 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6226175/106254238-99b99b00-626c-11eb-9c79-39f622cb92fb.png)\r\n\r\nIf you don't record your Private Key before you log out, you won't get that opportunity record it again.\r\n\r\nAlso, after you log out (by clicking a different menu item on the left in the UI, like \"TX Status\", and then clicking \"Logout\" when prompted), you can access your account again by going to the \"View & Send\" menu item, and then choosing \"View Address\" (as shown in screenshot below), where you can find your Wallet Address from the drop-down of recent addresses. \r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2021-01-29 at 10 02 01 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6226175/106254850-53b10700-626d-11eb-8042-4f080c2033c6.png)\r\n\r\nBut now when you go to \"Select...\", it still shows \"Wallet Info\" as an option, but it no longer allows you to click it. \r\n\r\n### What exactly were you doing when you encountered this issue?\r\n\r\nCreating a wallet\r\n\r\n### How were you accessing your wallet?\r\n\r\nMnemonic Phrase, Private Key",
