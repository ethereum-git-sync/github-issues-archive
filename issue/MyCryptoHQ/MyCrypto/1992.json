It works fine if logout and back in however**. ... it is just more alarming than anything else, since the red backgrounds are associated with anti-viruses stopping people from going on malicious websites”\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2018-06-27 at 4 15 48 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26891718/42004761-1bae4f48-7a26-11e8-931e-f4fcf5edfce1.png)\r\n\r\n**ADDITIONAL REQUEST:**\r\n\"No probs! Tell them make that error screen more friendly to! That thing nearly gave me a heart attack :D\"\r\n",
