    "body": "Hi @daferna. I don't have much experience using pre-filled transactions. But looking at the source code, it appears that the following query params are required: `gasLimit`, `to`, `data`, `nonce`, `from`, `value`, `chainId`\r\n\r\nYou would also need either `maxFeePerGas` and `maxPriorityFeePerGas` for a EIP-1559 transaction, or `gasPrice` for a legacy transaction.\r\n\r\nHope that helps.",
