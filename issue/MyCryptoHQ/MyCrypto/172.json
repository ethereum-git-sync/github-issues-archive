  "body": "### Bad UX 1:\r\n- [x] Case: After generating an invalid tx (e.g. attempting to generate a tx when your balance is lower than the amount you are trying to send), while having already generated a valid tx, the previous tx's rawTx and signedTx will remain shown after an error is displayed.\r\n- Solution: Clear rawTx/signedTx after generateTx button is clicked\r\n\r\n### Bad UX 2:\r\n- [x] Case: While the tx is being generated, the user has no feedback. Since the Tx is usually quick enough the user will not mind, however on slower devices or more complex tx generation, the UX will not be good.\r\n- Solution: Show spinner, with a minimum of 1 second, while generateTx is working.\r\n\r\n",
