  "body": "If you've experienced a bug, please provide the following information:\r\n\r\n### Description of the Issue\r\n\r\nBecause we only load MetaMask's network when the `MetaMask` wallet option is selected, the particular order contract interactions is done causes a UI issue where the network can be swapped last minute while generating a transaction without the user knowing.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Have MetaMask set to a different network then the current network selected in the dropdown\r\n1. Go to Contracts tab\r\n2. Go to Interact subtab\r\n3. Use a contract that has methods that require a transaction \r\n4. Use the a method that requires a transaction\r\n5. On wallet prompt, choose metamask\r\n6. Observe that the network has been switched, but the user has not been notified as such\r\n7. You can continue from here and finish sending the transaction, but it would be on a different network than the starting one\r\n\r\n",
