  "body": "The gas price component is one of the more confusing parts of the site:\r\n\r\n* It's located in the header, but affects things that happen in the body (Send transaction, interact with contracts.)\r\n* The help text explanation in it, while accurate, is a little verbose. We could probably simplify it, and provide more information via a help link.\r\n* Users cannot see how much ETH / fiat their transaction will cost\r\n* Users cannot set a specific gas price, they're limited by what the slider offers\r\n* Users get no estimate of how long their transaction will take, given the gas they allot\r\n* The default is static and doesn't take the network into account\r\n\r\nWhat I propose we do:\r\n\r\n* Create a form component for gas price that is both a slider _and_ a free-form text input\r\n* Place the form component in the send transaction form / contract interact form, remove from header\r\n* Slider should have hard coded defaults, but use [ethgasstation api](https://ethgasstation.info/json/ethgasAPI.json) to come up with better slow / fast / fastest ranges.\r\n* Component should also use the rates reducer for estimating how much the fee will be in fiat\r\n\r\nThis is currently blocked by `transaction-refactor` (#456) but will probably need some mockups to really get going. @HenryNguyen5 has already shown some progress on calculating eth cost of gas, so he may have ideas for how this should be implemented.",

    "body": "IMO priorities:\r\n\r\n1. Integrate with ETH Gas Station to pull recommended gas price. Display these number w/ human readable language. (Faster vs Cheaper, etc. If we didn't have such an international crowd: \"prioritize speed\" / \"prioritize cost\"). A user shouldn't have to even choose between 1 GWEI and 50 GWEI, they should choose between \"Almost Instant, but more costly\" or \"~10 minutes, but less costly\"\r\n\r\n2. Show ETH & USD value of Max TX fee (`gas price * gas limit`)\r\n\r\n3. Warn loudly if max tx fee is above X.\r\n\r\nThe reason it's in the header was to avoid placing it in every component and refactoring the entire thing when we added it. That's literally the only reason so moving it is a good idea.\r\n\r\nI'm strongly against a text input for gas price. We have issues as it is. People go to high, they blame us for high fees. If they go to low, they blame us for their TX taking forever. Advanced users can (and do) manually set via inspect element and while not ideal, our userbase is not going to get smarter and we must take steps to protect users from themselves. Moving forward, we are less and less the user and we cannot build a product for ourselves. A text input will undoubtedly lead to people putting 150000 in the gas price field instead of gas limit one, which leads to 1 ETH tx fees, which leads to (essentially) loss. It doesn't help that I hear \"increase the gas to 50 GWEI\" or \"increase the gas to 150000\" all the time.\r\n\r\nMEW used to set the gas price for the user and doing so was optimal, as long as we updated it with the network changes. The reality is: people don't know what gas is, the difference between gas price and gas limit, and they don't **want** to know these things. Aiming for not even seeing gas price is better than aiming for letting the user have all the options.",

    "body": "As of #743, the outstanding tasks for this are:\r\n\r\n* [x] Replace Contract Interact call function gas limit with gas slider\r\n    * If you're not sure how to test this, you can try calling a function with bogus data on a Ropsten contract, i.e. ENS Set Owner.\r\n* [x] Replace Contract Deploy gas limit with gas slider\r\n    * If you're not sure how to test this, you can try deploying a contract on Ropsten, like [your own ERC20 token](https://steemit.com/ethereum/@maxnachamkin/how-to-create-your-own-ethereum-token-in-an-hour-erc20-verified) (You could also use [this module](https://github.com/ConsenSys/Token-Factory))\r\n* [x] Remove gas slider from header\r\n    * This should only be done after replacing all other gas limit only fields. Except request payment, that stays limit-only.\r\n* [x] Put gas $ estimate in the confirmation modal\r\n\r\nWe'll punt on EthGasStation integration for another task.",
