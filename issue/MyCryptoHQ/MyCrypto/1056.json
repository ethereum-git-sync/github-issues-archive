  "body": "### Disclaimer\r\n\r\nThis is kind of an extension of: https://github.com/kvhnuke/etherwallet/issues/551\r\n\r\nAlso I'm actually happy to sit down and implement it myself, but I'd like to hear if it's something you'd be willing to include in the first place.\r\n\r\n### Description of the Feature\r\n\r\nParity has developed a Parity Signer mobile app a while ago, it's available both on [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/parity-signer/id1218174838?l=en&mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nativesigner). The app can be a low entry barrier alternative to hardware wallets (especially if you have an old phone that you can turn completely offline and run the app on it).\r\n\r\nThe app in combination with the Parity client UI allows you to store the private key on your phone, recover wallet from Parity phrases (which solves the MEW issue linked above for us), and sign transactions done in the browser via QR codes - the raw transaction is presented as a QR code, scanned by the app, signed in the app, and then a QR code with the signed transaction can be scanned by the browser via webcam.\r\n\r\nI reckon it should be reasonably easy to port the QR scanning code to MyCrypto, which would offer the users a more secure way of handling their private keys than using keystore files / phrases in the browser directly. It can also help with phishing since the app displays the transaction details from the QR code to the user (how much ether and to whom is going to be transferred, regardless of what the web UI displays).\r\n\r\nYay/nay?",
