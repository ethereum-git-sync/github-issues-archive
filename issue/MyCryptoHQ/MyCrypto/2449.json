Refresh your page, try a different node (upper right corner), check your firewall settings. If custom node, check your configs.\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice that your app is back on ETH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description of Your Machine\r\n\r\n(Your browser, browser version, operating system, device)\r\n\r\nUbuntu 16.04 running linux-x86-64_1.6.1_MyCrypto.AppImage and local custom Parity node.\r\n\r\nParity is started with toml file with this setting:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncors = [\"\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Console Logs / Screenshots\r\n\r\n(Console logs or screenshots go here, if applicable)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you're suggesting a feature, make sure someone hasn't already posted it. If\r\nno one has, please provide the following information:\r\n\r\n### Description of the Feature\r\n\r\nI suggest that \"local node\" should be one of the default choices.\r\n\r\n### Example(s) of Feature\r\n\r\nThis would work the way the deprecated Parity JS Shell worked.\r\n",
