  "body": "### Description of the Issue\r\n\r\nWe could avoid loading times and network requests by implementing a simpler version of the current modal that only displays addresses and does not perform any balance / token loading. Then the current version of the modal could extend that for cases where the user would want to know their balances.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Go to `Sign And Verify Message` Tab\r\n2. Log in with `Ledger` Wallet\r\n3. Observe that ETH balances and Token balances are still being resolved (and are entries in the table) when they might not be needed\r\n",
