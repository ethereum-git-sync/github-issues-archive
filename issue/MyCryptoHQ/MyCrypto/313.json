That seems like it is a number -> hex -> number issue? BigNumber issue?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Even if it's a super long number, show the whole outrageously long thing. To many (like me) e-14 doesn't mean anything. \r\n\r\n- [ ] Show nonce in decimals, not hex, and move to be second to last bullet point.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Modal currently shows the signed transaction, but perhaps should also check and warn about discrepancies between what modal is showing and what user filled into form?",
