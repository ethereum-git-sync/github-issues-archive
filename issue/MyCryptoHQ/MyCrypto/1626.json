  "body": "### Description of the Feature\r\n\r\nOne of the common cases mentioned when talking about EAC is sending a transaction for ICOs. However, with the current interface, a user might schedule the transaction, but have their tokens locked into the EAC contract. We'll need to implement an interface for proxying ICO tokens back to the user (or whatever address they choose.) You can see the function here: http://ethereum-alarm-clock.readthedocs.io/en/latest/transaction_request.html#proxy\r\n\r\nA big challenge here is going to be helping the user know what to pass as data to send the right thing. We may do well to provide a specific interface for scheduling specific ICOs, or come up with a generic way of entering the ICO's token type and contract address, and generating the data for the user.",

It's a method you can call after the scheduled transaction has passed the execution window, so users won't screw themselves over by setting up the scheduled TX wrong. We could add a form for proxying to the TransactionStatus component if we determine the transaction is a scheduled one. Or we can just provide the contract ABI on /contracts, and let them call it themselves.",
