    "body": "I think we should add a close button. Without it, it's more difficult for users with vision, motor, and mental disabilities to navigate through the onboarding flow. I'm concerned that if a user with accessibility issue uses incognito, it may slow them down significantly enough that they may need to stop using incognito or block the popup. The popup will still be prominent if we add a close button.\r\n\r\nIn the future, I'd like us to move away from modals and have this content inlined into the appropriate pages. For example in game design you'll often want to tell the player the combat buttons in the first fight that they need to use the buttons on an enemy, rather than having a large tutorial that can be too much information at once and slows down the player's self-discovery of the game. Having inline information also makes it easier to remember security tips without having to reopen the onboarding flow, while also interrupting user progress less.",
