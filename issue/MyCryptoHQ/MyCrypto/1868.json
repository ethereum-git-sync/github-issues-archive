  "body": "As part of an on-going goal of supporting Monero via Ledger's U2F support, we will begin building views while the logic (and especially signing) is getting researched and implemented.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Create a Monero specific view with Ledger, potentially soon to be Trezor hardware wallet support. Monero will be added to the dropdown as a new network option. This task is NOT for the JS logic/implementation, only the un-wired views.\r\n\r\nInitially, one view should suffice. In it, we'll include\r\n1. A method for viewing balance (or at least as much is possible via view-keys only)\r\n2. Receiving address\r\n3. Form for sending\r\n      - to address\r\n      - amount \r\n      - fee\r\n      - payment id\r\n4. Redesigned wallet unlock view specific for Ledger-only unlock.\r\n\r\nfor a live example of the form, https://mymonero.com/ might be a good reference. \r\n",
