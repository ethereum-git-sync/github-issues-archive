To avoid user confusion, we should display an inline error such as (`Oops, this is specific to Ethereum and it's testnets. You are currently on the ${network} network`)\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Go to ETC network\r\n2. Go to `View & Send` tab\r\n3. Type in `mewtopia.eth`\r\n4. Name still attempts to resolve, but displays 0x0 (as it should)\r\n\r\n",
