    "body": "@Engelberg No plans to add it back but that article obviously needs to be updated. Here's a brief rundown on how to send offline now.\r\n\r\n1. Go offline\r\n\r\n2. Unlock your wallet on the View & Send page\r\n\r\n3. Enter the information as you normally would\r\n\r\n4. The advanced panel is automatically opened as you will need to update the nonce yourself. The easiest way to do this is go to your address page on etherscan, click the most recent transaction hash, find that nonce, and increase it by 1. (meaning if your most recent transaction has a nonce of 14, you will use a nonce of 15)\r\n\r\n5. If you are sending tokens, you will need to increase the gas limit. I typically use a gas limit of 100000 for sending tokens as that's a pretty safe number. You can also find the gas limit by going to the token on etherscan, (e.g. https://etherscan.io/token/0xd26114cd6EE289AccF82350c8d8487fedB8A0C07) and clicking a recent transaction (e.g. https://etherscan.io/tx/0x209422997ecd2da2650f654b18d4a0030069437755d2d2f2f79b0d2c3d09c961) and seeing what gas limit they used and using that. \r\n\r\n6. You will now see a \"Sign Transaction\" button. Click it. \r\n\r\n7. Copy and paste the stuff in the \"Signed Transaction\" field.\r\n\r\n8. Go to https://mycrypto.com/pushTx on your online computer and paste the signed transaction (or you can use https://etherscan.io/pushTx)\r\n\r\n9. Send it!\r\n\r\nLet me know if you need me to clarify anything. We'll get that article updated right away.\r\n",
