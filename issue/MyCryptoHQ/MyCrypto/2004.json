  "body": "It was noticed that the only prevention of external naivation on the main windows of MyCrypto Electron desktop application is to ensure all <a> tags have the target=”_blank” attribute. This is little risky as it might happen that some <a> tags, or other means or navigation (e.g. JavaScript location change), navigate on the main window instead of opening on browsers. The impact of being able to navigate on the main window is considered high if not critical as MyCrypto supports importing private key and the Electron application has no address bar, thus users have no way to tell if they are still on MyCrypto and might give out their private keys to a third party phishing site.\r\n\r\nIt is recommended to listen on the will-navigate event and cancel any navigation on the main window.\r\n",
