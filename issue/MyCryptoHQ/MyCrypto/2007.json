  "body": "### Allow to save locally a list of ABI / Address pair\r\n\r\nWe have to interact often with a set of smart contracts with wallets stored in HD Wallets. Since doing scripts / dapps for this is not trivial we usually go for a quick MyCrypto contract page.\r\n\r\nIf we could store the address / ABI combination locally in the electron MyCrypto app, this would be really handy.\r\n\r\nTo save I propose a button aligned to the right of the \"ABI\" text field, and the stored contracts could be visible through a section of \"Select Existing Contracts\" \r\n\r\n\r\n",
