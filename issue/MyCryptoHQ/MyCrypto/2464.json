This user is requesting a setting that allows pop-ups to automatically dismiss after X seconds. \r\n\r\nThis would be a good addition to the future Settings page.\r\n\r\n**EXAMPLE OF POPUP THAT REQUIRES MANUAL DISMISSAL:**\r\n(I think this should remain manual until redesign is live)\r\n![ss (2019-03-28 at 10 11 27)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26891718/55210845-9784e200-51a6-11e9-98d5-daa164289087.png)\r\n\r\n**EXAMPLE OF POPUP THAT ALREADY IS AUTOMATICALLY DISMISSED:**\r\n(dismisses after ~4 seconds)\r\n![ss (2019-03-28 at 10 19 06)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26891718/55211045-8ee0db80-51a7-11e9-86d1-f6da9e2d3087.png)\r\n\r\n",
