  "body": "### Updated Trezor firmware breaks compatibility with MyCryptoWallet\r\n\r\nHello, I have tried sending a transaction recently with the latest firmware update on trezor, but for whatever reason I'm getting a safety check failed red notification error when running in the yarn electron:dev mode. I also tested this issue with a fully built version of MyCrypto application, and to no avail. I also tested this against an older trezor with older firmware, and it seems to be fine there. For whatever reason, it seems that the ethereum signing check on the trezor fails.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/trezor/trezor-mcu/blob/master/firmware/ethereum.c\r\n\r\nIf you want to check out the link above and go through it with a simple ctrl-f of \"safety check failed\" will show you where in the code the error is coming from. \r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Update trezor one to firmware version 1.8.0 \r\n2. Try to send a transaction\r\n3. Fail sending transaction due to safety check notification error.\r\n\r\n### Description of Your Machine\r\nRunning a 13 inch 2017 Macbook Pro with MacOS Mojave Version 10.14.3 (18D109)\r\n\r\n### Console Logs / Screenshots\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36312802/54560713-5405c900-4999-11e9-92dc-c9b9d12e5ff4.png)\r\n\r\nI modified the trezor.js node_modules to print out the request and responses going to the trezor, and here are the console logs\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36312802/54560901-c5de1280-4999-11e9-93cf-3a8f9da0635a.png)\r\n\r\n",
