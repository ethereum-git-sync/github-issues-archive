  "body": "The security model of relying on NPM's public registry allows for several attack vectors, especially since NPM does not enforce immutable packages.\r\n\r\nOnce a package is deleted, NPM will allow a package with an identical namespace to be published. [This](https://status.npmjs.org/incidents/41zfb8qpvrdj) incident caused significant amounts of packages to be re-published, any of which could have been malicious.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there is (admittedly low) risk in trusting the public NPM registry to serve the correct package.\r\n\r\nThis issue is largely a request for comment on potential mitigations, however I would like to propose that at a minimum we switch over to our own mirrored / private registry.",
