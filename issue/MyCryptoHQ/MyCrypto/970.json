  "body": "ðŸš¨ You need to enable Continuous Integration on all branches of this repository. ðŸš¨\n\nTo enable Greenkeeper, you need to make sure that a [commit status](https://help.github.com/articles/about-statuses/) is reported on all branches. This is required by Greenkeeper because it uses your CI build statuses to figure out when to notify you about breaking changes.\n\nSince we didnâ€™t receive a CI status on the [`greenkeeper/initial`](https://github.com/MyCryptoHQ/MyCrypto/commits/greenkeeper/initial) branch, itâ€™s possible that you donâ€™t have CI set up yet. We recommend using [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org), but Greenkeeper will work with every other CI service as well.\n\nIf you _have_ already set up a CI for this repository, you might need to check how itâ€™s configured. Make sure it is set to run on all new branches. If you donâ€™t want it to run on absolutely every branch, you can whitelist branches starting with `greenkeeper/`.\n\nOnce you have installed and configured CI on this repository correctly, youâ€™ll need to re-trigger Greenkeeperâ€™s initial pull request. To do this, please delete the `greenkeeper/initial` branch in this repository, and then remove and re-add this repository to the Greenkeeper Appâ€™s white list on Github. You'll find this list on your repo or organizationâ€™s __settings__ page, under __Installed GitHub Apps__.\n",
