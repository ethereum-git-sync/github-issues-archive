Go to Contracts tab\r\n2. Go to Interact subtab\r\n3. Use a contract that has methods that require a transaction + is a known token contract (such as DIVX)\r\n4. Use the a method that requires a transaction\r\n5. Try to form the transaction\r\n6. You'll get an invalid transaction error\r\n7. Repeat 1-5 but with a contract that isn't a token contract\r\n8. A transaction will be successfully formed\r\n\r\n",
