  "body": "### Description of Issue\r\n\r\nWhen trying to make a contract call from an account stored on a Trezor device, a different address is shown in the final confirmation window as the \"From\" address. The correct account is chosen when unlocking the wallet. Clicking confirm on the final window will send a transaction and give a hash. Looking for the hash on etherscan yields no results.\r\n\r\n### What exactly were you doing when you encountered this issue?\r\n\r\nUsing the latest MyCrypto wallet to make a contract call.\r\n\r\n### How were you accessing your wallet?\r\n\r\nTrezor\r\n\r\n### Description of Your Machine\r\n\r\n- Browser:\r\n- Browser version:\r\n- Operating system:\r\n- Device: MacOS\r\n- MyCrypto.com vs Desktop Application?
