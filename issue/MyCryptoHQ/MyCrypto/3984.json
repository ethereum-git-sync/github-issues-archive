    "body": "@Mrtenz  That's great, thanks. It would be nice if someone could update README with this information. Bcz now it seems like this is not an open-source wallet that you can run locally. But just a code-base for the website with an option to \"build for dev or production\" (which is a bit confusing). I know this wallet is for more advanced users, but since you spent so much energy/time making it... a more clear description in README would attract more \"less advanced, privacy-concerned users\" to use this open source wallet :)  I know you have a website hosting this code, but I bet a lot of less techy users would want to run it locally.\r\nThanks a lot guys üëç ",
