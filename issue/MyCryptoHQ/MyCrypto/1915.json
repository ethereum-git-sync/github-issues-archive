The user gets several error messages that should be silenced when the user is offline.\r\n3. The online status indicator takes a long time to resolve to the correct state (10-20 seconds, should be 1-2 seconds).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Load mycrypto.com or the electron application.\r\n2. Go offline.\r\n3. Login with your mnemonic / private key / keystore on the account view.\r\n4. Notice that spinners are still loading\r\n5. Notice that you are unable to sign a transaction due to signing being disabled\r\n\r\n### Description of Your Machine\r\n\r\nChrome, macOS\r\n",
