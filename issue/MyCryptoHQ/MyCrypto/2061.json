    "body": "### The change was due to feedback from our security audit:\r\n\r\n> MC-01-002 Web: CSP is Largely Ineffective against XSS (Medium)\r\n\r\n> It was found that the CSP on MyCrypto.com uses unsafe values for directive script-src, more specifically, unsafe-inline and unsafe-eval. The former allows the execution of unsafe in-page scripts and event handlers, while the latter allows the execution of code injected into DOM APIs such as eval(). As a result, an attacker with the ability to inject JavaScript into the context of the MyCrypto's origin will be not be hindered by the CSP in any notable way.\r\n\r\n> Current CSP Configuration:\r\n\r\n> default-src 'none'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; worker-src 'self' blob:; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; manifest-src 'self'; font-src 'self'; img-src 'self' data: https://shapeshift.io; connect-src *;\r\n\r\n> The CSP rules in their current stage must be mostly considered useless and they only add weight to the overall footprint tied to every HTTP request. It is recommended to remove the permissions for unsafe-eval and unsafe-inline. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Mozilla CSP bug tracker:\r\n\r\n- https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1267027\r\n\r\n### Examples of FF Extensions trying to fix the issue on their end (could be something we ask MetaMask to change, if we have a solid fix in mind): \r\n\r\n- https://github.com/violentmonkey/violentmonkey/issues/173\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadger/issues/1793\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/2823\r\n\r\n### I think the choice we have to make is:\r\n\r\n- Update our CSP to something that is still safe AND that still allows this to work in FF (unsure if this combination exists)\r\n\r\n- PR something to MetaMask so that it doesn't trigger CSPs (if we can figure out what that PR would be)",
