  "body": "### Description of the problem\r\n\r\nCurrently, when each tab mounts its responsible for clearing and setting up the application state. This ends up fragmenting the application logic into multiple places, making it hard to keep track of how and why pieces of our application state is being changed, and making it hard to make modifications to reset / modify state because of the multiple entrypoints. \r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\n\r\nHave our routing / subtab implementation fire off actions to allow for saga hooks such as `BEFORE_TAB`, `AFTER_TAB`, `BEFORE_SUBTAB`, `AFTER_SUBTAB` with payloads being the tabs names' in question. This would allow for centralised management of state in either the reducers or sagas. This would really help out for things like clearing transaction or wallet state depending on what tab you're on (or if you're switching subtabs). Right now, it's mostly components firing off `reset` actions from multiple places, so when watching logs its hard to see where these actions are originating from, and increasing debugging time when some of these actions cause unwanted state changes.\r\n\r\n",
