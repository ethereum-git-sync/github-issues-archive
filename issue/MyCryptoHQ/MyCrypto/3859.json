When you say that your camera doesn't work, does it not show you your webcam feed in the MyCrypto desktop app (showing a black/grey screen) when trying to sign this transaction?\r\n\r\nAre you experiencing any issues with using your webcam on other services? You might try to open your desktop app as Administrator, to see whether that might solve the issue.",
