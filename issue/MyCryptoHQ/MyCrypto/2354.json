  "body": "### Description of the Issue\r\n\r\nWhen a transaction is not found in RSK network the error message suggests to select another ETH node. This is an error. It shouldn't suggest that.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Generate a transaction with an incorrect nonce. So the transaction will be rejected.\r\n2. Go to \"Check Transaction Status\" or \"Recent Transactions\"\r\n3. Try to access to the transaction information.\r\n4. You'll get the message \"Transaction Not Found\"\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nIt shouldn't suggest to connect to another ETH node:\r\n\"Please use the dropdown in the top-right & select a different ETH node (e.g. ETH (Etherscan.io) or ETH (Infura.io) or ETH (MyCrypto)) and check again.\"\r\n\r\n<img width=\"837\" alt=\"screen shot 2019-01-11 at 16 14 19\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7558841/51056915-e1582600-15c2-11e9-8c99-9a97833af2a8.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n",
