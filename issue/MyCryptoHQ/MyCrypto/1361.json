Adding some kind of visual difference will help users fill out forms and correct mistakes. \r\n\r\nAlso in most* cases, I don't think buttons need to be disabled until all inputs are filled and valid. Instead 'submit' buttons at the end of a form should validate the inputs `onClick`, then highlight any skipped or invalid inputs. This provides the same level of validation, but makes it easier to correct mistakes when submitting forms.\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Distinguishing between required and optional inputs is definitely going to be addressed by this issue.\r\n\r\nI should have clarified earlier, adding `onClick` validation for 'submit' buttons in forms would only replace our current method of preventing incorrect form submission - disabling the 'submit' button until all inputs are valid. There would still be validation `onBlur` for inputs like there is now.\r\n\r\nLeaving the 'submit' button enabled and validating all inputs once more `onClick` would allow us to better direct the user's attention to an input they may have missed entirely.",
