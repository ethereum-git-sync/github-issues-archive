MetaMask and other wallets have some small blocking action (which i think should also be more prominent), but MyCrypto instantly reveals private key on first click.\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-03-31 at 13 59 56](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/361654/161148568-fefc2f3d-679e-4b6e-bc29-957ef56183a4.png)\r\n\r\nI would like to see a model/blocking message with something like \"It looks like you are extracting a private key. Keep in mind this is private and  should only be known to you. If you are currently screen-sharing or with another person, keep in mind that no trustworthy person would ever want to see this value.\r\n\r\nIf you are sure you are by yourself in a secure environment, click here to reveal your secret private key\"",
