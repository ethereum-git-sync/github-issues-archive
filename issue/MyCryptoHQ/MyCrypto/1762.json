  "body": "---\r\n\r\n### Description of the Issue\r\n\r\nWhen you want to connect to MetaMask you first have to be signed into the extension for it to work. I still forget that I need to log into MetaMask first before clicking the button and I've done this almost a hundred times already. Even the error you get when you click on the button to connect isn't clear that you first need to log in to MetaMask yourself. Error given: \"No accounts found in MetaMask / Mist.\" (Also why is Mist included in the Error, you're accessing it with MetaMask, thats confusing)\r\n\r\nIt should be made clearer that you first need to log into MetaMask yourself. At first clicking the \"Connect to MetaMask\" feels like it will automatically open up MetaMask for me so that I can sign in, but its the other way around. \r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nTry to log into MetaMask as if it was your first time. \r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n",
