  "body": "### Description of Issue\r\n\r\nCannot fetch Token Balance from Custom Node (specifically: Nethermind)\r\n\r\n**This issue happens on both the Desktop app AND `https://www.mycrypto.com/`**\r\n\r\n### What exactly were you doing when you encountered this issue?\r\n\r\n1. Run a Nethermind node, and optionally NGINX in front of it if you want to test with HTTPS\r\n2. Configure it as a custom node (either via `http://<node>:8545` or `https://<node>`, whatever)\r\n3. Try to scan or refresh token balances\r\n\r\nWhat then happens:\r\n1. It fails, you get the red banner that says \"You've lost your connection to the network, check your internet connection or try changing networks from the dropdown at the top right of the page.\"\r\n2. After a few seconds you'll get the green banner that says \"Your connection to the network has been restored\" but the token balances still fail to load.\r\n\r\nRefreshing the ETH balance of the account works fine. It seems to only be the token balance lookup?\r\n\r\nI tried HTTP and HTTPS (with trusted cert) on the desktop and HTTPS on the website, the connection seems fine, just the token balance that's broken?\r\n\r\n### How were you accessing your wallet?\r\n\r\nIn this case a Ledger but I assume that's unrelated\r\n\r\n### Description of Your Machine\r\n\r\n- Browser: Brave when using the website\r\n- Browser version: `Version 1.9.72 Chromium: 81.0.4044.138 (Official Build) (64-bit)`\r\n- Operating system: Windows 10 x64 build 2004\r\n- Device: `Desktop PC?`\r\n- MyCrypto.com vs Desktop Application? BOTH\r\n- MyCrypto Version Number: Desktop and Website are `v1.7.10`\r\n\r\n### Console Logs / Screenshots\r\n\r\nIf you would like logs reach out to me on twitter `@MysticRyuujin` or Discord `MysticRyuujin#8157` and I can provide packet capture or `.HAR` file from Brave Developer Tools. I can also provide you access to a Nethermind node if you don't have one to play with. I assume this is probably an issue in processing/parsing/dealing with the reply data from the node so I understand you might need a node to query\r\n\r\nHere is a screenshot of a random query from the Brave Dev Tools:\r\n![RequestData](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8877131/82734283-acdc9a00-9cdf-11ea-8287-94917748c699.png)\r\n\r\n![ResponseTab](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8877131/82734318-e31a1980-9cdf-11ea-8711-27c25494213e.png)\r\n\r\nHere is the `response` tab from the above screenshot (I formatted if for you)\r\n```\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\r\n    \"result\": \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\",\r\n    \"id\": \"28e1c81d5ed08395dd456270fa173678\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\r\n    \"result\": \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\",\r\n    \"id\": \"6fb3ee1056a7a6471dd8a7acb8ad3a7a\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\r\n    \"result\": \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\",\r\n    \"id\": \"473b186fc3270ab89def584e9ba8cfec\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\r\n    \"result\": \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\",\r\n    \"id\": \"213109cb4c6374eaa0be973d2a718807\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\r\n    \"result\": \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\",\r\n    \"id\": \"d0ae4368c34cb2c3c1f73db1c4e63047\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\r\n    \"result\": \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\",\r\n    \"id\": \"a4113450fa0a4203dc7f059969521223\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\r\n    \"result\": \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\",\r\n    \"id\": \"5013dfd228637b1ceffd9ce7455eddad\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\r\n    \"result\": \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\",\r\n    \"id\": \"e2ab9879f5ceefb20ad7e2e3ed8b4ba0\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\r\n    \"result\": \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\",\r\n    \"id\": \"3e586d1d275f844c8bbcfd5777884eb0\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\r\n    \"result\": \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\",\r\n    \"id\": \"eed8d9948ab675602a1336d2191554c8\"\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```",
