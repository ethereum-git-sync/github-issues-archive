    "body": "Hello.\r\n\r\n The whole point for me here is signing  a transaction offline, with private keys (cold storage) so using app.mycrypto.com to do anything other than broadcast an (already offline) signed transaction is not an option. This bug (or unhelpful \"behavior\") of the desktop app of constantly resetting all the fields makes it very error-prone and easy to send the wrong tokens to the wrong address.\r\n\r\nWhen are you planning to release this replacement? Until then, I suppose I will have to use an alternative like [myetherwallet](https://kb.myetherwallet.com/en/offline/using-mew-offline/) instead. And in the meantime it would be nice if you'd keep the issue open.\r\n\r\nThanks. ",
