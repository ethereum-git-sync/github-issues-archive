  "body": "When you've got a wallet open on send, and change networks, the page refreshes with the previous network still selected\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Go to /send-transaction\r\n2. Unlock (non-web3) wallet of your choosing\r\n3. Change network\r\n4. Wait, observer refreshed page network\r\n\r\nThis likely has to do with the mechanism we save to local storage with, and the way network is initially selected. We should probably do something more than hoping the new network ends up in LS before refreshing. With `transaction-refactor` putting everything in Redux, we also may be able to reset all state in sagas when you change network, preventing a refresh.",
