  "body": "### Description of the Issue\r\n\r\nWhen clicking on \"**Display address on Ledger**\" MyCrypto sends an incorrect ethereum address to Ledger Nano S device. Ledger device dispays and incorrect addres - the address derived from MyCrypto's default derivation path `/m/44'/60'/0'` -- even though I opened my wallet a custom derivation path (MetaMask's `m/44'/60'/0'/0`) and MyCrypto is displaying the correct address on the web interface.\r\n\r\nOn MyEtherWallet the same feature works correctly (i just tested it).\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n0. Connect to your computer your Ledger device (with Ethereum App runnung and web browser setting Enabled) \r\n1. Go to: https://www.mycrypto.com/account\r\n2. Click on \"Ledger - Connect & sign via your hardware wallet\"\r\n3. Click on \"Connect to Ledger Wallet\"\r\n4. From the \"Addresses\" dropdown menu select \"Custom\", then enter `m/44'/60'/0'/0` and click on green tick button.\r\n5. Select address `#1` (or any other) and click \"Unlock\".\r\n6. Click \"Display address on Ledger\".\r\n7. Compare the address displayed on Ledger device and the address on MyCrypto. **They are different!**\r\n\r\n### Description of Your Machine\r\n\r\nI am using: \r\n- Windows 10 Pro (64bit)\r\n- Google Chrome Version 66.0.3359.181 (Official Build) (64-bit)\r\n- Ledger Nano S, Firmware v1.4.2, MCU 1.5\r\n- The only app installed on my Ledger device is Ethereum App\r\n- On MyCrypto I am using a \"Custom\" derivation path: the MetaMask's `m/44'/60'/0'/0`. \r\n",
