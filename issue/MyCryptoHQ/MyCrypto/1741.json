Would prefer if it went to the next page where it asks to connect to MetaMask and says something to tell me that MetaMask is having connection problems. I had to manually open up MetaMask to see that it was having problems in order to figure out why MyCrypto wasn't taking me to the next page to connect to MetaMask. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Console Logs / Screenshots\r\n\r\n![sharex_2018-05-04_18-11-25](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25834495/39888767-d88c58f0-5463-11e8-9e0e-295ae6bf2bad.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25834495/39888782-e2e70782-5463-11e8-8772-cce3f67973ff.png)\r\nNothing happens, no warning, just sits here. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n",
