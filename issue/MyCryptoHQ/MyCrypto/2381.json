The integration of MyCrypto would be much easier if, in a single click, you can take the user to the page or desktop app of contract interaction with all fields already prefilled. Checking out any contract function would be just one click.\r\n\r\n### Description of the Feature\r\n- Add deep links to select existing contracts, functions and then prefill forms.\r\n- Add deep link to access custom contact, fetch ABI, select a function and prefill forms.\r\n",
