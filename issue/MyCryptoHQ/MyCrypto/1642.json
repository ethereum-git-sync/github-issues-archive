  "body": "### Description of the Issue\r\n\r\nWe have checks in the sagas to make sure the user does not send the same transaction twice. They would get a notification along the lines of `This transaction has already been broadcasted`. The signing status component is not aware of such check, so it still visually shows the spinner even when the user cant continue on anyway.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Go to `View & Send` tab\r\n2. Use ledger sign in\r\n3. Send a transaction\r\n4. Click `Send Transaction` again without changing anything\r\n5. Observe the `Signing Status` component still show up even though the user can't continue with broadcasting the transaction anyway\r\n\r\n",
