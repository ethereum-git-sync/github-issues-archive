You can find it over at [beta.mycrypto.com](https://beta.mycrypto.com/). It doesn't appear to give the odd \"Please enter a valid password\" error, but instead currently returns nothing at all. I agree it should return something more clear like \"Invalid Key file\".\r\n\r\nI'll add this to our internal project management system, thanks for the report! We really appreciate your feedback :)",
