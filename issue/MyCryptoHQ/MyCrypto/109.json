  "body": "Alongside raw private key and UTC wallet generation, it would be valuable for MEW to provide a mnemonic based wallet (potentially in the same format as MetaMask).\r\n\r\n# Misc Notes\r\n- [Metamask implementation](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-hd-keyring)\r\n- BIP 32 - core\r\n- BIP 39 - wordlist\r\n- BIP 44 - paths\r\n\r\n\r\nTo create a binary seed from the mnemonic, we use the PBKDF2 function with a mnemonic sentence (in UTF-8 NFKD) used as the password and the string \"mnemonic\" + passphrase (again in UTF-8 NFKD) used as the salt. The iteration count is set to 2048 and HMAC-SHA512 is used as the pseudo-random function. The length of the derived key is 512 bits (= 64 bytes).\r\n\r\n\r\nSo any passphrase you choose, gets concatenated with \"mnemonic\" and is used as a salt. ie. if your passphrase was \"Th1sI5mYp@ssphr@se\"... it would be \"mnemonicTh1sI5mYp@ssphr@se\" being used as the salt and an iteration count of 2048.\r\n\r\nAlso, as mentioned in the BIP, ANY passphrase provided will generate a valid seed... so an attacker would then need to check addresses for every generated/tested passphrase for coins further slowing down any attack.\r\n\r\n-- BIP 39?

    "body": "- I don't think the last step is overkill, I like it\r\n\r\n- I would remove the sidebar. I feel like it is too cluttered and distracting and prefer to keep the focus on the centerpieces you have created. \r\n    - We can re-address what to do with this info in a different fashion separately. Ideally, this information would be moved to the last step of the on-boarding popovers (or something). Users could then go to proper place directly from the last on-boarding slide, rather than from the generate page. (Sharon has some good ideas on this. This should probably be new issue and workshopped.)\r\n\r\n- I unsure about emphasizing that the mnemonic can be secured with a password on the first page. It's confusing as 1) most don't use a password and 2) the pw has plausible deniability so there is no \"wrong\" password (which makes it even more confusing) 3) it would make it incompatible with Metamask (I think).\r\n\r\n- I would love to make a paper wallet version. 💖  \r\n    - Word-phrase (labeled \"private\" in some fashion)\r\n    - BIP path (m/44'/60'/0'/0) (for recovering in super-long term if necessary)\r\n    - First address on that path (for cold storagers)\r\n    - The version number of the site (a big regret from current version of site)\r\n\r\n- In terms of language, we used `mnemonic` as that is what Jaxx used when we added mnemonic support. I'm not a fan of that word, but would like to hear from others on this.\r\n    - MetaMask uses `seed phrase`. \r\n    - I personally call it `word-phrase` or `12-word phrase` or `24-word phrase` when asking about it on reddit or in support. \r\n    - Ledger calls it your `seed` or `passphrase` or `24 word seed`. \r\n    - Trezor: `Recovery seed is a mnemonic code made of 12, 18 or 24 words depending on your choice. This seed is generated the first time you run TREZOR`\r\n\r\n- Generally speaking, I wish we could include the word `Private` with them. e.g. \"Private Keystore File\" and \"Private Seed Phrase\". This would emphasize these are private, and connect it back to the public / private key concept that people eventually learn about anyways. However, making up new names should not be taken lightly, so I'm unsure about how I feel about this. Would love other's thoughts.\r\n\r\n- The last step should probably start with \"Click your MEW bookmark\" or \"Check the URL\", just to re-iterate one more time to not be phucking phished. That makes it four steps, 4x1, which should be okay if we remove the sidebar. Can drop to 2x2 on tablets and 1x4 on mobile.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Copy recommends (if you don't love it, don't change it.)\r\n\r\n- Managing your own keys can be risky and a single mistake can lead to irrecoverable loss. If you are new to cryptocurrencies, we strongly recommend using MetaMask, or purchasing a Ledger or TREZOR hardware wallet. [Learn more about different wallet types & staying secure.](https://myetherwallet.github.io/knowledge-base/private-keys-passwords/difference-beween-private-key-and-keystore-file.html).\r\n\r\n**Keystore**\r\n- An encrypted JSON file, protected by a password\r\n- Back it up on a USB drive\r\n- Cannot be written, printed, or easily transferred to mobile\r\n- Compatible with Mist, Parity, Geth\r\n- Provides a single address for sending and receiving\r\n\r\n**Mnemonic**\r\n- A 12-word private seed phrase\r\n- Back it up on paper or USB drive\r\n- Can be written, printed, and easily typed on mobile, too\r\n- Compatible with MetaMask, Jaxx, imToken, and more\r\n- Provides unlimited addresses for sending and receiving\r\n\r\nNo strong feelings on the remainder of the copy. Great job!",
