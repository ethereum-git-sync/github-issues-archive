I'm wondering if you haven't added the account to the dashboard yet? also, maybe try a shift-reload after connecting? There seem to be a couple caching issues there, but we're supposedly using the same version of frame here.\r\n\r\nEdit: Please note that the messages regarding metamask are a seperate issue, (they're aware of the issue) and I was there when it was working at Devcon so I know it's in the pipe.
