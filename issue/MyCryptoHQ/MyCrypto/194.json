    "body": "It's to make phishing more difficult and to teach people that entering their private key on a website is not something they should do. There have been a steadily increasing number of commentsâ€”not anything to be concerned about yetâ€”pointing out that MEW has normalized people entering their private keys on websites. \r\n\r\nWe will never 100% not support keys, just make it a bitch to access via keys if you access them on a regular basis. This will enable folks who want to send from cold storage to do so without encouraging active use of keys. This will hopefully reduce the affect of phishers, but also encourage best-practices in the crypto space generally. It is not expected to make a tangible difference in phishing compromises in the short-term.",
