  "body": "### Description of the Feature\r\n\r\nThe current ways of using of Ethereum are ridden with privacy leaks. I propose adding an option to connect to the internet through Tor, routing *every* application request through it.\r\n\r\nAs a start, MyCrypto could detect an already-running Tor instance and use that, but properly, it should have Tor integrated into the application and use its own Tor circuit.\r\n\r\nThis setting could be placed in the \"Change network\" menu. It should persist after exiting the application.\r\n\r\n### Example(s) of Feature\r\n\r\n[Electrum](https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum) can connect through an existing Tor instance.\r\n[Bisq](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq) runs its own instance of Tor.",
