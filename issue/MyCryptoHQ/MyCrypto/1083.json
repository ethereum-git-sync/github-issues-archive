    "body": "So the mockups in #774 don't actually show what a history would look like, so design wise we'd have to start fresh.\r\n\r\nFull history for an address is actually a tricky subject. Nodes don't offer a way of requesting all of the transactions for an address, only the information of individual transactions. This means that given a user's address, we don't have an easy, node-agnostic way of collecting all of this information. This leaves us with a few choices:\r\n\r\n1. Leverage etherscan or some other explorer for getting this information. All we would need to grab is all the tx hashes for a given address, and we could let the node do the rest of the work.\r\n2. Set up our own infrastructure for tracking all of these transactions. I think this could be pretty lightweight as a redis set, but it would definitely be a non-trivial amount of dev work.\r\n3. Only track transactions sent through MEW, and store tx hashes in local storage. This is something I think I want to do as a part of #775 as-is, have a pre-filled dropdown of recent transactions for you to check, and we could extend that. However this may cause major user confusion, not seeing the same transactions that they see on Etherscan, if they've done some in a different browser / different client. Not very in favor of this one.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think. I think for our current use-cases, we can do the short-term same session transaction tracking for sweeper and check tx. But if we want a proper full history, we'll have to figure this out.",
