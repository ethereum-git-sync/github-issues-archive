  "body": "https://medium.freecodecamp.org/scaling-your-redux-app-with-ducks-6115955638be\r\n\r\nCurrently the way the app state is structured relative to file directories has a number of problems that introduces difficulties with code base maintenance and  productivity. \r\n\r\n## Current Folder structure:\r\n\r\n```\r\n├── actions - Application actions\r\n├── reducers - Redux reducers\r\n├── sagas - Redux sagas\r\n├── selectors - Redux selectors\r\n└── store.ts - Redux reducer combiner and middleware injector\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Makes it easy to introduce circular dependencies due to flat directory scheme ( hard to see what are base level files, and what files derive functionality from other files )\r\n\r\n- Hard to see context of the particular piece of state (if you're only working on actions related to configs, you need to still do repo-wide searching to find the files associated with each other)\r\n\r\nBy switching over to ducks architecture, all related files to a slice of state is always placed relative to each other, and files that derive functionality from other files are always at least one level higher than the base files. This eliminates the possibility of circular dependencies. It also makes it easy to see what selectors/reducers/sagas/actions are related to what slice of state as they'll always be in the same directory.\r\n\r\nThis has other beneficial implications such as state slice based re-hydration being much easier to implement (rather than the monolithic rehydration style we currently have), and the ability for in-directory unit tests for the related reducer/saga/selectors all in one place.\r\n## Proposed Folder structure example:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n├── ducks / root\r\n│   ├── transactions\r\n│   ├── DerivedSelectors.ts\r\n│   ├── CombinedReducers.ts \r\n│   ├── DerivedSagas.ts \r\n│   |   |── broadcast\r\n|   |   |   ├── BaseReducer.ts\r\n|   |   |   ├── BaseSagas.ts\r\n|   |   |   ├── BaseSelectors.ts\r\n│   |   |── fields\r\n|   |   |   ├── BaseReducer.ts\r\n|   |   |   ├── BaseSagas.ts\r\n|   |   |   ├── BaseSelectors.ts\r\n│   |   |── meta\r\n|   |   |   ├── BaseReducer.ts\r\n|   |   |   ├── BaseSagas.ts\r\n|   |   |   ├── BaseSelectors.ts\r\n│   |   |── sign\r\n|   |   |   ├── BaseReducer.ts\r\n|   |   |   ├── BaseSagas.ts\r\n|   |   |   ├── BaseSelectors.ts\r\n```\r\n\r\n",
