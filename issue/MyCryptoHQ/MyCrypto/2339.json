While the potential issues associated with invalid checksummed addresses on this view-only section of the app is small, it's probably better left alone as there are only a few small edge-cases where a user wouldn't use an address that is either lowercase or valid checksummed addresses.\r\n\r\nThe options are now: \r\n1) Should we leave this as-is so that people are used to using checksummed addresses in their current form?\r\n2) Or should we introduce the change to allow this, by casting all user-input addresses `toLowerCase()` (only on the view-only pages).",
