Obviously, this isn't possible when the computer is offline. @blurpesec may be able to shed more insight on how we also track the nonce locally to try to ensure nonces are in order and do increment. \r\n\r\nAnd yes, we have to do better.

    "body": "Insane - that's it! when broadcasting online MyCrypto software returns \"success\", then a message to check the tx status in the desktop app or with etherscan or etherchain.  So tell me how MyCrypto broadcasts an offline signed tx (with a gap in the latest nonce - e.g. '5' when the last 3 nonces were 1 2 3) and then says success?  Should nodes first check txs to see that the nonce was in order and incremented correctly before MyCrypto says success?  Could MyCrypto return a message to the user about a \"very bad nonce, bad nonce!\" so that they are not tricked/lulled into thinking that something is wrong with the network instead of the construction of their transaction?  Seem that there are already _some_ failsafe design mechanisms in place with your software to prevent the user from making a mistake.  _At the very least you ought to educate and provide the user with a '?' or word bubble near or next to the nonce field so that while generating a tx offline they are made aware of the nonce rules!_  Again, I knew they needed to be ordered and higher, but did not know that I could NOT skip a number....These things are not obvious.
