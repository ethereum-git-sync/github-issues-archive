When I try to send to the second address, the \"Send Transaction\" button is greyed out and it lights up back agin only when I shift tabs and return back. I do have funds in the account, so I found it a bit weird. Only a minor inconvenience, but still :)\r\n\r\n### Description of Your Machine\r\n\r\nSafari 11 on macOS 10.13.3",
