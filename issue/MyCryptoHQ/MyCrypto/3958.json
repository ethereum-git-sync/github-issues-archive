I was able to connect to Ropsten just a few days ago with no problems. (Ethereum mainnet is also showing POST issues in the Developer Tools at the moment.)\r\n\r\n### What exactly were you doing when you encountered this issue?\r\n\r\nWhen I try to switch from Ethereum mainnet to Ropsten, Kovan, or Rinkeby on the MyCrypto Desktop Application, I get the error messages \"Youâ€™ve lost your connection to the network, check your internet connection or try changing networks from the dropdown at the top right of the page.\" and \"Could not connect to the node. Refresh your page, try a different node (upper right corner), check your firewall settings. If custom node, check your configs.\".\r\n\r\n### Description of Your Machine\r\n\r\n- Operating system: Windows 10\r\n- Device: Laptop\r\n- Desktop Application\r\n- MyCrypto Version Number: 1.7.13\r\n\r\n### Console Logs / Screenshots\r\n\r\n![mycrypto_errors](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80047487/117930983-eba79d80-b2fe-11eb-8a51-3d48b46db41b.png)\r\n\r\n",
