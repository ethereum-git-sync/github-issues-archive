Is there a way to get prepared transaction but not send it (in view & send)? \r\nTIA \r\n\r\n### What exactly were you doing when you encountered this issue?\r\n\r\nClicked \"Broadcast Transaction\"\r\nPasted transaction produced in menu Sign&Verify, but no button with 'send transaction' appeared, I suspect it should be there from the start of  \"Broadcast Transaction\" anyway.\r\n\r\n### How were you accessing your wallet?\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Description of Your Machine\r\n\r\n- Operating system: Linux Mint 20.2\r\n- Device: laptop\r\n- Desktop Application\r\n- MyCrypto Version Number: 1.7.17\r\n\r\n### Console Logs / Screenshots\r\nhttps://ibb.co/C121tny\r\n",
