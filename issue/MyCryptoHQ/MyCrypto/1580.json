  "body": "### Description of the Issue\r\n\r\nBecause of a saga `takeEvery` effect when the network is changed, the entire transaction reducer state is cleared. But when this is done while the `Broadcast Transaction` field is filled with a valid transaction, it'll get invalidated as the state will be empty. This can either be fixed by:\r\n1. Adding exceptions to the sagas/reducers to only partially clear state on certain tabs on network switch\r\n2. Re-dispatching the field's data when the state gets cleared (little bit hacky)\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Go to `Broadcast Transaction` tab\r\n2. Fill field with valid transaction\r\n3. Change networks\r\n4. Field will become invalid\r\n",
