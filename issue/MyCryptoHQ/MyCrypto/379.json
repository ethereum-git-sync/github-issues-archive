  "body": "Currently we use `navigator.onLine` to check if the browser is in an offline state, but that might or might not mean we can access node RPC calls.\r\n\r\nAccording to: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NavigatorOnLine/onLine\r\nFor chrome / safari browsers, even if the browser does not have an internet connection but is just on a LAN it counts as being online. In this case any RPC calls made would fail anyway.\r\n\r\nAnother case is that the user has no internet connection, but has a local node running that the user is connected to. In this case they would still be able to broadcast a transaction despite no internet.\r\n\r\nIMO, the best way to check if they're online would probably to send a `ping` type request to the currently connected node to see if MEW is able to send RPC calls.",
