Would you mind opening this task back up on GitCoin to allow someone else to take a crack at it?\r\n\r\nWhat you're looking at in the screenshots is HTML, which isn't really what we'd consider \"the code\" of the app. The majority of the app's logic and functionality is done in Typescript (a dialect of Javascript,) using the React library. I'd suggest you look up some tutorials on how to write React code before trying to dive into the MyCrypto codebase.",

I've familiarized myself with the two codebases and am still invested in this but am visiting a family member in the hospital and am somewhat pre-occupied. I'm gonna toss this back in case someone else can get to it before the code freeze. I can provide insight into the two codebases if the next contributor is interested; have a conceptual solution of the components in mind. May be able to get back around to implementation but don't want to stake any claim that'd prevent this feature from fruition.",

As a request, when converting over to our new styles, I just had a couple of asks for the design / implementation:\r\n\r\n* Each \"helper\" should be its own component that's fairly self contained\r\n* I think it would look great if each helper was its own subtab (using our SubTabs.tsx component)\r\n* Each subtab should have its own route, e.g. `/helpers/ens-debugger`\r\n* Helpers shouldn't be in the nav, but instead be accessed by the link in the footer\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1233\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-04-13 at 11 45 22 am\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/649992/38744600-3f1490d8-3f10-11e8-9ccd-ccd1bd6f39f0.png\">\r\n\r\nIf there are any helpers you don't think you can pull off, just let us know, we can help out.

It looked like you were making steady (if a bit slow) progress so far, but I also saw you left a comment that went unanswered by myself. \r\n\r\nIt looks like @domalak has now claimed the task, so I just wanted to touch-base and make sure all of this is kosher, and if not, how we can fix things up. \r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nThanks for you interest @domalak! I'm hoping we can transition this bounty smoothly, and look forward to working together on solving this issue!",
