  "body": "### Description of the Issue\r\n\r\nThis has occured to me three times now. It was when I was tethering my laptop over a spotty cellular network.\r\n\r\nI use beta.mycrypto.com; Ussually I am funding an exchange address. I do a send with mycrypto, using a ledger, and it takes too long to get over the network. It gives me an error something about \"send took too long to respond\" and it appears as if the send didnt go through. The normal transaction links on the bottom left after a send, do no appear. I go to refresh mycrypto page entirely and try again.... now my funds DID get transfered and reflect on the account.\r\n\r\nSo basically, a send of tokens succeeded, but the local mycrypto client did not think so and reported that it didnt succeed.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nCreate a send on a spotty or VERY slow network. I am unsure how you can replicate this besides by forcing your phone to 2G or 3G and having maybe 1-2 bars of service. Super slow latency times might help to replicate it as well.\r\n\r\n### Fix ideas\r\n\r\nAssure that mycrypto waits plenty of time until it hears a response. I am unsure if the ether network is sending a false positive, or if mycrypto is assuming it didnt go through after a certain time period. Also, adding to the timeout error could help the user ex: give an etherscan link to check on the from address: \"You may wish to check your from address, to verify that the funds indeed did not send. There are occasional false positives.\"\r\n\r\n### Description of Your Machine\r\n\r\nChrome on Mac, latest version",
