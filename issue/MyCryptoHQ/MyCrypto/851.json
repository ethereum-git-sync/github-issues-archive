  "body": "I think we've squeezed out every bit of use from the old design. Unordered lists can only do so much and the modal has a lot of technical details which I don't think are suited for sticking in lists. \r\n\r\nIt may not be something that makes it in before audits, but It's a part of the site thats frequently used, and seems to be in need of an update\r\n\r\nI played around with some idea's in https://github.com/MyEtherWallet/MyEtherWallet/pull/850 but reverted and pushed them to a separate branch to push only what's required in this issue. \r\n\r\nCurrently\r\n- Clarity is an issue, everything is just thrown in a list\r\n- Technical details are mixed with important information\r\n\t- Nonce and transaction data should be displayed separately, most important information should come first \r\n- Instead of just not showing tx data when it isn't there, another `</li>` is added telling you there is no data\r\n- Copy is verbose\r\n\r\nProposal\r\n- Prioritize important information, like 'from', 'to', and 'amount / value being sent'\r\n- Separate technical details\r\n\t- add a 'details' area\r\n- Display usd conversions along side amounts & transaction fees\r\n- Update the copy",
