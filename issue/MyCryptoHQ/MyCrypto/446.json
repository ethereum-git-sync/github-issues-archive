    "body": "If it doesn't already, can the balance displayed in sidebar update when you press the \"Generate TX\" button. Right now on v3 it pulls balance in order to ensure the user has enough balance send but doesn't update the display in the sidebar. \r\n\r\nIf users are sending back-to-back and encountering errors, updating the display on generate would help them debug. \r\n\r\nIf WebSockets aren't ready yet, we could do a balance pull ~45 seconds after the user broadcasts a transaction without creating too much additional load on the backend. Mildly hacky but would get the job done in most cases.",
