    "body": "Thanks, I didn't know about the standalone version! I checked it out and no, I meant something different. I envisioned a version of the Windows application which, similarly to the Windows app, functions by starting an .exe, but instead of having to install it (\"bonding\" it to the operating system) and having the files it needs spread out over many different locations, everything is contained in one directory and can be moved anywhere, even to other operating systems, without any loss in security, function or data.\r\n\r\nOther advantages include:\r\n* No reliance on a browser. If you use the current standalone version, you either run it in your present browser (wouldn't recommend it to anyone due to security implications), or you dedicate a separate browser to it (still reliant on the browser's security, but much better -- however, you need to handle and maintain another piece of software, which is extra effort).\r\n* I suspect the \"stateful\" features I've outlined in #2288 wouldn't work with the current standalone version (although I may be wrong on it).\r\n\r\nIf the idea of portable apps seems tough, try using any app from PortableApps.com on Windows and it'll be immediately evident.",
