  "body": "### Description of Issue\r\nWhen attempting to access a custom derivation path for Ethereum like (m/44'/60'/2'/0), addresses with zero balance (if option is picked to display them) start with address index 1 (for example (m/44'/60'/2'/0/1)). The zero-th address is not shown (which has a zero balance). Derivation paths that do have a balance on the zero-th address are showing up automatically, like (m/44'/60'/1'/0/0) for example.\r\n\r\n### What exactly were you doing when you encountered this issue?\r\nTrying to enumerate addresses on my Ledger device that were added to Ledger live a while back and I have some public keys referenced referenced and not changable for which a balance is to be soon expected.\r\n\r\n### How were you accessing your wallet?\r\nLedger\r\n\r\n### Description of Your Machine\r\n\r\n- Browser: Chrome\r\n- Browser version: 93.0.4577.63 (Official Build) (x86_64)\r\n- Operating system: OSX 10.15.7\r\n- Device: Macbook\r\n- MyCrypto.com vs Desktop Application?
