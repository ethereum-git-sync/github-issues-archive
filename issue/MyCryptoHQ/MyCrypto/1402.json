    "body": "After some thought, I've realized that having the block height in the footer can indeed be confusing for the user, especially after the addition of Shepherd.\r\n\r\nHaving a non-updating block-height in the footer means that user's may incorrectly assume the values that they are seeing in the UI are related to the state of the blockchain at that height, which will nearly always be incorrect.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we can't effectively update the block-height state since block-height is not returned with our JSON-RPC calls, and independent requests have to be made just to retrieve it.\r\n\r\nIn addition, state will be retrieved from nodes at various different heights based on what node is being connected to from Shepherd, which makes this additionally confusing.\r\n\r\n@Balozar What are your thoughts on this?",
