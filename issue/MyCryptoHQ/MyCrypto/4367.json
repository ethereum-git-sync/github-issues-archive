  "body": "### Description of Issue\r\n\r\nI could not connect to my old ledger harmony one wallet address from the old chrome extension. \r\n\r\nI sent wrapped ONE from my ledger smart chain wallet on Metamask to my old Harmony ONE chrome extension wallet which was also connected through my ledger (there is no private key for that reason). I can't find a way to connect to my old harmony ONE address that I got through a ledger connection other than on the chrome extension which does not support the wrapped ONE I sent to my wallet from the smart chain, so I can't send it back.  I was going to try to connect to it by using the derivation path m/44'/1023'/0'/0 (found online) to connect through MyCrypto since it lets me enter a custom derivation path, but that didn't work, tried MyCrypto online and when I enter the custom path it freezes, on the desktop version it shows me other addresses that don't match the address I want to connect to. (ONE wallet also has an ETH address so I tried on the ETH network at first)\r\n\r\n### What exactly were you doing when you encountered this issue?\r\n\r\nI tried adding a custom Node and custom Network (Harmony Mainnet) with this info but got the \r\n\r\nerror: No static network config loaded\r\n\r\nNetwork name: Harmony Mainnet\r\nURL: https://api.harmony.one\r\nChain ID: 1666600000\r\nCurrency symbol: ONE\r\n\r\n### How were you accessing your wallet?\r\n\r\nI can only access the old harmony one wallet on the old harmony chrome extension, but it doesn't support wrapped ONE from the smart chain network so I can't send it back\r\n\r\n### Description of Your Machine\r\n\r\n- Browser: Chrome\r\n- Browser version: 112.0.5615.121 \r\n- Operating system: Windows 10\r\n- Device: Lenovo laptop\r\n- MyCrypto.com vs Desktop Application?
