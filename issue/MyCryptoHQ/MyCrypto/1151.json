    "body": "Spent the last couple hours at this, here are my initial findings:\r\n\r\n* Muon has no dedicated npm package, instead they rely on a [fork of `electron-prebuilt`](https://github.com/brave/electron-prebuilt) that just has you download binaries, rather than compile them yourself.\r\n* It doesn't look like there's any typescript support here. Despite removing the package `electron`, you still use it ala `import electron from \"electron\";`. However, typescript has no idea what's going on with this and complains. I've found no reference implementations of Muon + Typescript.\r\n* The documentation for switching is _really_ sparse, fortunately someone has a PR up with some guidance: https://github.com/brave/muon/pull/444\r\n\r\nIt's looking like there might be some fighting to do with this transition.",
