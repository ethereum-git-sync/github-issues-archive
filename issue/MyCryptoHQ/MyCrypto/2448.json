If\r\nno one has, please provide the following information:\r\n\r\n### Description of the Feature\r\n\r\nEthereum addresses on Ledger Live makes use of a different derivation path (m/44'/60'). Currently the option named \"Ledger ETH\" on MyCrypto is using the legacy derivation path and not the Ledger Live derivation path.\r\n\r\n### Example(s) of Feature\r\n\r\nA solution would be to do something similar to MEW and default the \"Ledger ETH\" option to the Ledger Live derivation path and rename the old one to \"Legacy ETH\".\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15937274/54801712-2b384900-4ca3-11e9-840f-8a878fa404f9.png)\r\n\r\nThe screenshot above shows an example from MEW that you guys can consider when adding the option.\r\n\r\nI believe there is an issue open on this specific problem from the Ledger team themselves on issue #2070 but there has not been any replies since Nov 2018. I hope someone can give an update on this issue.",
