Navigating to https://beta.mycrypto.com/account?network=etc for instance shows all the right visuals of trying to connect to the ETC network, but it will fail. Looking at the network requests, it looks as though it never actually pings any of the nodes. Hard to say if this is on the MyCrypto side, or the Shepherd side.\r\n\r\ncc @dternyak @HenryNguyen5 \r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Go to https://beta.mycrypto.com/account?network=etc\r\n2. Fail to connect",
