The page was functioning as expected. I then resized the window and started scrolling. It scrolled fine, then stopped scrolling. The page was basically frozen and all page elements were non-responsive. The File, View, and Help menus still worked.\r\n\r\nI was unable to reproduce this issue upon relaunch.\r\n\r\n### How were you accessing your wallet?\r\n\r\nLedger S Nano\r\n\r\n### Description of Your Machine\r\n\r\n- Browser: N/A\r\n- Browser version: N/A\r\n- Operating system: Windows 10\r\n- Device: Ledger S Nano\r\n- MyCrypto.com vs Desktop Application? Desktop\r\n- MyCrypto Version Number: v1.7.3\r\n\r\n### Console Logs / Screenshots\r\n\r\nThis is a screenshot of the CPU usage.
