  "body": "### Description of the Feature\r\n\r\nAs a developer I occasionally use MyCrypto desktop to send manual transactions via the contracts tab and my ABIs. I like that it generates a UI for me to interact with my own contracts, and I prefer it to remix (and ethfiddle) because I can use it locally and don't have to open my code in it.\r\n\r\nI would use it much more often for this purpose if I could generate a deep link into MyCrypto that would prefill certain values including:\r\n* network parameters\r\n* contract address \r\n* ABI \r\n* function signature + function parameters (or just tx.data) \r\n* value\r\n* private key to sign the tx\r\n\r\nTurns out that this was implemented in the MEW days:\r\nhttps://github.com/MyCryptoHQ/MyCrypto/issues/356\r\n* Does the MyCrypto rewrite still support this?\r\n* is it possible to activate it on Desktop?\r\n* the MEW version just prefills a tx with some data. is it possible to implement this to go to the Contracts tab instead?\r\n\r\n### Example(s) of Feature\r\n\r\nEIP-681 comes to mind:\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-681.md\r\n\r\nMinimal electron project with deep linking capabilities: \r\nhttps://github.com/oikonomopo/electron-deep-linking-mac-win\r\n\r\nTrust wallet supports something kind of similar:\r\nhttps://medium.com/@trustwallet/mobile-dapps-with-deep-linking-and-trust-wallet-6a4712b9b9a4",
