  "body": "### Description of Issue\r\n\r\nUnable to connect Ledger Nano S to MyCrypto.\r\n\r\n### What exactly were you doing when you encountered this issue?\r\n\r\nTried to pair my Ledger Nano S to MyCrypto. At the 'Select an Account' several confirmations are asked on the device, but no address is found.\r\n\r\nThe problem seems to be the wrong derivation path used on the device. This is the Avalanche Wallet interface, when logging into the same device:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"392\" alt=\"Screenshot 2021-05-06 at 21 48 48\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6398640/117362239-4c784580-aebb-11eb-9131-8e4052b37658.png\">\r\n\r\nNote the second derivation path: `m/44'/60'/0'/0/0`. That one is used for accessing the C-Chain. Same derivation path shown on the device at login used with Avalanche Wallet:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"901\" alt=\"Screenshot 2021-05-06 at 22 37 57\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6398640/117362591-babd0800-aebb-11eb-9be1-8d8f60402745.png\">\r\n\r\nBut MyCrypto has a shorter derivation path:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"755\" alt=\"Screenshot 2021-05-06 at 22 39 01\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6398640/117362700-e04a1180-aebb-11eb-9451-d14eac5a4b88.png\">\r\n\r\nWhich is also used on the device:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"901\" alt=\"Screenshot 2021-05-06 at 22 39 43\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6398640/117362799-ff48a380-aebb-11eb-824e-00b56e3d58d9.png\">\r\n\r\nAnd that results in:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"519\" alt=\"Screenshot 2021-05-06 at 22 40 55\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6398640/117362906-23a48000-aebc-11eb-8d7f-eb3c06ecd0d0.png\">\r\n\r\nAs a result, I am unable to pair the device with MyCrypto to access my Avalanche C-Chain wallet.\r\n\r\nThe funny thing is, I was the one that made [the PR to include Avalanche](https://github.com/MyCryptoHQ/MyCrypto/pull/3889) in the first place, and back then, after it was merged it all worked fine and there were no problems. So, sometimes between March 25th and today, something changed on the website that broke Avalanche access.\r\n\r\n### How were you accessing your wallet?\r\n\r\nLedger Nano S\r\n\r\n### Description of Your Machine\r\n\r\n- Browser: Chrome\r\n- Browser version: latest\r\n- Operating system: MacOS\r\n- Device: Nano S\r\n- MyCrypto.com vs Desktop Application? Web\r\n- MyCrypto Version Number: ea3aca5\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Yes, the derivation path for Avalanche's C-Chain is indeed `m/44'/60'/...`, that was deliberately chosen to be easier to port and integrate existing Ethereum solutions to Avalanche. For the X and P chains (exchange and platform chains), it's `m/44'/9000'...`.\r\n\r\nWhere can I find more information about that Ledger behaviour you mentioned? Haven't seen that before.\r\n\r\nFor what it's worth, both Ledger S and Ledger X work on the official Avalanche wallet with `m/44'/60'/...` path with no issues., all updated to the latest versions.",

Ledger has a list of possible derivation paths for each network here: https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-ethereum/blob/master/Makefile#L41\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if I understand what the issue is exactly. We use `m/44'/60'/...` for Avalanche C-Chain, which should be the standard derivation path for this network if I understand correctly?",
