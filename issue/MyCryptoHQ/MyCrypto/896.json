  "body": "Ethereum keystores have been added to hashcat. I'm not longer comfortable using a low of an n-value. Also, n values must be 2^n. In this case, 8192 is 2^13.\r\n\r\nhttps://stealthsploit.com/2018/01/04/ethereum-wallet-cracking-pt-2-gpu-vs-cpu/\r\n\r\n2^13 puts us at GPU-incompatible under 32 GB cards. 2^14 at 64GB cards. Both are sufficiently stronger than the current values and should be high enough for the foreseeable future.\r\n\r\nAttackers can still CPU brute-force but thatâ€™s a miserable undertaking and making them miserable is enough for me.",
