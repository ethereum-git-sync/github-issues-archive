  "body": "Hello.\r\n\r\nThe desktop app regularly resets its input fields (nonce, to address, amount..).\r\n\r\n**Typical scenario**: I want to transfer some funds to an exchange. \r\n\r\n- I fill out all the fields in the desktop app on an offline computer (but use only a very small amount of coins as  a test, first) \r\n- Sign the transaction\r\n- Go to mycrypto.com on an online computer and broadcast the signed transaction\r\n- Make sure  the coins arrived at the exchange, to verify I entered address, nonce, gas limits and gas price etc appropriately \r\n- Go back to my offline computer and the desktop app where I want to increase the number of tokens and nonce, _without changing receivers address_!, but as soon as i click into the nonce input field the whole form resets to empty! \r\n\r\nSo I effectively cant use the desktop to send a small amount first and then send the real quantity, which is very dangerous. Its very easy to make a mistake and doing a \"dry run\" first is a great precaution.\r\n\r\nMaybe this resetting is by design ,but it is very disadvantageous and dangerous in situations such as above. Please stop this resetting of the input fields, or at least make it possible to disable it as an option somewhere.\r\n\r\nMany Thanks in Advance\r\n",

Please accept my apologies for not getting back to you sooner, but I wanted to let you know that this issue has since been added to our internal project management system. At this time, we're working hard on creating a brand new version of MyCrypto, which you can find over at [beta.mycrypto.com](https://beta.mycrypto.com/). Unfortunately, we don't have the desktop app ready for this new version just yet, but I hope that once it's available, you won't have to experience this issue.\r\n\r\nAgain, we should've gotten back to you sooner. We really appreciate you opening this issue! As it has since been added to our internal system, I will be closing this issue here. Thank you so much!",
