  "body": "\n## Version 10 of Node.js (code name Dubnium) has been released! ðŸŽŠ\n\nTo see what happens to your code in Node.js 10, Greenkeeper has created a branch with the following changes:\n- Replaced the old Node.js version in your `.nvmrc` with the new one\n- The new Node.js version is in-range for the engines in 1 of your `package.json` files, so that was left alone\n\nIf youâ€™re interested in upgrading this repo to Node.js 10, you can <a href=\"https://github.com/MyCryptoHQ/MyCrypto/compare/develop...MyCryptoHQ:greenkeeper%2Fupdate-to-node-10\">open a PR with these changes</a>. Please note that this issue is just intended as a friendly reminder and the PR as a possible starting point for getting your code running on Node.js 10.\n\n<details>\n<summary>More information on this issue</summary>\n\nGreenkeeper has checked the `engines` key in any `package.json` file, the `.nvmrc` file, and the `.travis.yml` file, if present.\n- `engines` was only updated if it defined a single version, not a range.\n- `.nvmrc` was updated to Node.js 10\n- `.travis.yml` was only changed if there was a root-level `node_js` that didnâ€™t already include Node.js 10, such as `node` or `lts/*`. In this case, the new version was appended to the list. We didnâ€™t touch job or matrix configurations because these tend to be quite specific and complex, and itâ€™s difficult to infer what the intentions were.\n\nFor many simpler `.travis.yml` configurations, this PR should suffice as-is, but depending on what youâ€™re doing it may require additional work or may not be applicable at all. Weâ€™re also aware that you may have good reasons to not update to Node.js 10, which is why this was sent as an issue and not a pull request. Feel free to delete it without comment, Iâ€™m a humble robot and wonâ€™t feel rejected :robot:\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n<details>\n<summary>FAQ and help</summary>\n\nThere is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html). If those donâ€™t help, you can always [ask the humans behind Greenkeeper](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).\n</details>\n\n---\n\n\nYour [Greenkeeper](https://greenkeeper.io) Bot :palm_tree:\n",
