  "body": "This has been bugging me for a while, and I think it's worth doing. Right now we're doing a a 500ms transition on _all_ links and _all_ form elements, on _all_ attributes. I think we should do the following:\r\n\r\n* Set a `transition-property` to determine what attributes should be animated. `color, background-color, box-shadow, opacity, transform` seems like a good set. Width, height, margin, padding etc should not be animated on for performance and responsive breakpoint reasons.\r\n* Reduce the default timing. 500ms feels really sluggish, in my opinion. I'd say something like 150ms will feel snappier.\r\n* Give buttons the global transitions as well\r\n\r\nLet me know if this is an unpopular opinion.",
