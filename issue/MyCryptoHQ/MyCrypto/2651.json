  "body": "### Description of Issue\r\nWhen starting the Desktop App offline, it makes HTTPS requests to github, Infuria, Etherscan and MyCrypto's servers, even though only \"MyCrypto\" is selected by default under the \"Ethereum tab\" in the \"Change Network\" menu.\r\n\r\nIt then continuously attempts requests to Infuria, Etherscan and MyCrypto's servers, even though only one network provider is selected.\r\n\r\nThese requests include a HTTP User-Agent identifying the users app version and OS type.\r\n\r\nIf changing the network selection to e.g. Infuria, the app still attempts requests to Etherscan and MyCrypto.\r\n\r\nThe app was intentionally launched offline, the issue here seems to be that another (unselected) third party is called if the request to the selected party fails.\r\n\r\nSo this looks like a privacy issue in the sense that it would leak user IP, app version and OS type to an unselected third party provider if there are connectivity issues with the selected provider.\r\n\r\nWould recommend to rework the provider connectivity logic so that requests to an unselected provider can never happen, and also more clearly inform the user of provider choices as it impacts user privacy.\r\n\r\nWould also more clearly inform the user that e.g. github is called once on app startup now that M$ have acquired github and is not known for having the best history of user privacy/tracking.\r\n\r\nAs github appears to be called to check for the latest release, we can improve user privacy by tracking the latest app version on the blockchainâ„¢ and comparing against the local app version.\r\n\r\n### What exactly were you doing when you encountered this issue?\r\n\r\nStarted the desktop app offline and then selected different providers under the \"Change Network\" menu.\r\n\r\n### How were you accessing your wallet?\r\n\r\nThis is before accessing any wallet.\r\n\r\n### Description of Your Machine\r\n\r\n- Browser: N/A (desktop app)\r\n- Browser version: N/A\r\n- Operating system: Linux\r\n- Device: N/A\r\n- MyCrypto.com vs Desktop Application?

    "body": "Hey, thanks for bringing this to our attention. In attempt to resolve another unrelated issue, this became an issue. I didn't realize the scope of it but....ugh.\r\n\r\nWe are currently in the midst of a big update and the way we handle networks and nodes is different and handled in such a way that doesn't needlessly ping out, especially when a user is offline or have a custom node set up. We are working on the assumption that anyone that is working offline or with a custom node is an advanced user and doing so with intention, likely for privacy and/or security purposes. \r\n\r\nI'll have someone look into the github ping as that may need to be proxied or removed entirely moving forward to protect the privacy of end users.\r\n\r\nThanks again for such a detailed report and making your concerns known.
