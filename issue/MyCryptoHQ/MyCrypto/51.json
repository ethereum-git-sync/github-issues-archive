  "body": "Okay so I put this somewhere but basically for the confirmation modals it should always parse the signed TX and display:\r\n\r\n- From address + addressicon\r\n- Amount\r\n- Coin Type\r\n- To address + addressicon\r\n- Gas Limit\r\n- Gas Price \r\n- TX Fee in ETH + USD (USD situation is optional for now)\r\n- Data\r\n- Title / Message (e.g. \"You are about to send a transaction\" or \"you are about to resolve your ENS name\" or whatever is passed to it)\r\n- Current chain (ETH vs ETC)\r\n- Who node is provided by\r\n\r\nI think what you've built here is great for that and love the table. \r\n\r\nThis gives us a really reusable modal and acts as a final check for the user. One of the things I really don't like is, for example, the current contract page modal doesn't give you anything. No address, no idea how much its going to cost to deploy, etc.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Current issues with current conf modals**\r\n\r\n- People dont read them (had someone the other day literally tell me we need a confirmation for the confirmation....)\r\n\r\n- Too easy to miss the *coin* you are sending (e.g. ETH vs SNT)\r\n\r\n- Too easy to miss the chain you are on (ETC vs ETH), although the border I added has helped reduce those\r\n\r\n- Not the information the user wants / needs in an easily parsable / skimmible *thing* (table format will help)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSeparately, I hate how modals sometimes close all by themselves sometimes if you click twice or click outside. I do it on Twitter all the time and I think it's worse with bootstrap v4. I lose tweets ALL THE TIME when I'm trying to highlight something. \r\n\r\nIt shouldn't close unless you hit the X or the CANCEL button or hit the esc button (optional)\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nOther than that, I really like the success / error state inside the modal itself, but we'll have to decide how to handle alerts and things. While some successes and errors come from front-end validation, some are message returned directly from the node (e.g. a TX with that hash has already been imported). It would be safer to handle all alerts via the alerts handler, avoiding a potential situation where you sometimes show alert, sometimes put alert in modal, and if you aren't careful, accidentally don't show the alert at all. Making things fail-proof for our future selves is very important so we can build quickly with less worry. ðŸ˜‰\r\n\r\n",
