  "body": "This error has come up with a number of users using Hardware Wallets on contract functions. Upon search for this issue online, I found that the first occurrence of this error I could find online was around **June 14th** [here](https://blog.ethbits.com/2017/06/14/token-upgrade/). There's only a few people who have complained about it, and doesn't seem to have ever been solved. Additionally, it appears to be isolated to MEW, despite my conclusion that because this error message doesn't exist in the repo, it must be coming via RPC. \r\n\r\nAny ideas what this is related to?",
