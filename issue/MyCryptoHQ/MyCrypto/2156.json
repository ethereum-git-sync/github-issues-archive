  "body": "Embed a light client in the Electron app.\r\n\r\n### Problem\r\n\r\nFrom users' and developers' perspective, running a full Ethereum node is difficult. As a result, they rely on external services for their backend infrastructure. These services run at scale, which in some degree is a step towards centralization.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nLight clients. Make the MyCrypto desktop app a peer in the p2p network, instead of relying on [external services](https://github.com/MyCryptoHQ/MyCrypto/blob/963a4b588ef112ff574c6fa99230d0bc3fc1402d/common/libs/nodes/configs.ts).\r\n\r\n#### Concrete proposal\r\n\r\n- Talking with @hahnmichaelf, he was proposing a switch to choose between light client or remote backend.\r\n- If the user chooses light client, MyCrypto downloads Parity Ethereum in the background (~40MB).\r\n- Electron then spawns a Parity process with the correct flags (--chain name, --light)\r\n  - Side note: we also wrote [`@parity/electron`](https://github.com/paritytech/js-libs/tree/master/packages/electron), a library to download/run/stop Parity Ethereum from an Electron/node.js environment.\r\n- Because we [hardcode the block from which the light client syncs](https://wiki.parity.io/Light-Client), the light client will reach the top of the chain in a matter of seconds.\r\n- After that, the user can use the UI like before.\r\n\r\n#### Proof of Concept\r\n\r\nAt Parity we built a proof-of-concept of this idea, called [Parity Fether](https://github.com/paritytech/fether). Here is a small demo of the download+sync feature (original speed, on Kovan):\r\n\r\n![ezgif com-resize](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1293565/45254554-97dc9d80-b37a-11e8-976a-0ffcc802f191.gif)\r\n\r\nHowever UX is not our strong at Parity, and we would love to see other teams build on this idea.\r\n\r\n#### Some other notes:\r\n\r\n- The light client is not resource-intensive, and runs perfectly well on a consumer laptop.\r\n- Db takes ~10MB on disk, ~100MB with cache.\r\n- Concerning latency for JSONRPC calls: instead of the app making a network call to a remote backend, the light client will make a network call to its peers. I have not benchmarked the latency in both cases; qualitatively, on Fether, the UX is more than acceptable in this regard.\r\n\r\n#### Disclaimer\r\n\r\nI work at Parity, and am the main contributor of Fether.\r\n\r\nDepending on the resources you have, I'm happy to contribute anywhere between answering questions about this, to sit down and create a PR myself.\r\n",
