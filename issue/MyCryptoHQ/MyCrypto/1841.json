    "body": "I haven't dug deeply in to the MyCrypto code, but I would assume it's `common/components/WalletDecrypt/WalletDecrypt.tsx` that is the issue since when browsing using an interface like Toshi, the wallet is already unlocked and one shouldn't see the \"Unlock your Web3\" and \"Connect to MetaMask\" buttons.\r\n\r\nOversimplifying here, but it may just be an issue of detecting if the web3 wallet is already unlocked before prompting to Connect to MetaMask. There's also the added use-case of a web3 browser having multiple wallets and offering the user a chance to pick which one they'd like to use.",
