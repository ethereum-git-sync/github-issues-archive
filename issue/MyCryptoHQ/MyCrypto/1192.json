  "body": "### Description of the Issue\r\n\r\nRight now when you navigate pages, the entire template re-renders. This is because each container renders <TabSection> independently. This causes certain issues with losing state. For instance, if you're on mobile, scroll navigation, and click a link, you'll have the navigation reset to a scrollLeft of 0. This re-rendering is both needless from a performance perspective, and potentially confusing if anything else in the header or footer's state gets reset.\r\n\r\nWe should probably move `<TabSection>` into Root.tsx, and have it wrap the router. We may need to come up with a way to have routes define behavior of TabSection via props, possibly in some kind of master routes config.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Open a page on a mobile device\r\n2. Slide navigation\r\n3. Click a link\r\n4. See navigation reset to the left",
