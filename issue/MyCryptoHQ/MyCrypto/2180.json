  "body": "### Description of the Issue\r\nSlider for gasprice doesn't show a number inside the tooltip when using RSK. \r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n1. Open an RSK wallet with MyCrypto (I tried it with Trezor and Mnemonic in both, mobile and desktop versions)\r\n2. Move the slide for gasprice\r\n3. Look at the tooltip, it's entirely black \r\n4. Then, if you expand the Advanced options, you'll see that gasprice is calculating right \r\n\r\n### Console Logs / Screenshots\r\n![screenshot from 2018-09-18 14-42-07](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22835487/45974109-c8793400-c016-11e8-827d-24b0502db344.png)\r\n\r\n",
