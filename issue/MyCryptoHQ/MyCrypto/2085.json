It may be linked to ens addresses that have had the `changeOwner()` method invoked.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nNavigate to the ENS tab in either the desktop app or the web app. \r\n\r\nType in **administrative** in the ENS name field so that you can look-up **administrative.eth**. \r\n\r\nClick `Check Availability`. Note the Owner address listed. Look up the same ENS name on etherscan.io and notice the difference. \r\n\r\n### Description of Your Machine\r\nGoogle Chrome, Windows 10; This is present in both the Desktop Application and the WebApp.\r\n",

    "body": "Hi @hahnmichaelf. It looks like the difference is that etherscan.io is getting the name owner from the ENS registry, and MyCrypto is getting the deed owner from the Auction Registrar. \r\n\r\nIf you click on the _Winning Deed_ in the etherscan.io results for **administrative.eth**, and then select the _Read Contract_ tab, you'll see the owner of the deed is the same as the owner displayed by MyCrypto.\r\n\r\nFor **administrative.eth**, the deed owner used `setOwner()` a few days ago to allow another account to administer the domain/subdomains (this would be the account listed in the ENS registry). The deed owner still has the right to take back full control of the name at any time.",
