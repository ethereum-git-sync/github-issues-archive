  "body": "Hey there :) I just found an interesting edge case or bug when using the desktop version of MyCrypto..\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Description of Issue\r\n\r\nWhen creating a wallet using a mnemonic phrase there was a single word that showed up as duplicate, which caused an error in the confirmation screen.\r\n\r\n- \"Create New Wallet\" button in the menu on the left\r\n- \"Generate a Wallet\" button on the right\r\n- \"Generate a Mnemonic Phrase\"\r\n- I received a mnemonic phrase where two words were identical (is this even allowed?) .. I wasn't able to reproduce this even after regenerating the phrase 10-15 times..\r\n- \"Confirm Phrase\"\r\n- When clicking on the word that showed up as a duplicate, both words were selected, as shown in the screenshot:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1220\" alt=\"mycrypto-duplicate-word-screenshot\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/142297/110394936-8ec50800-806d-11eb-905e-49dc46186257.png\">\r\n\r\nI guess this should not occur as I was not able to finish the confirmation and had to restart the process. Maybe this is a pretty extreme edge case but maybe this can be prevented by simply checking for duplicates in the screen before ;)\r\n\r\n### How were you accessing your wallet?\r\n\r\nMnemonic Phrase\r\n\r\n### Description of Your Machine\r\n\r\n- Operating system: macOS Big Sur 11.2.2\r\n- Device: MacBook Pro (16\", 2019)\r\n- MyCrypto Desktop Application\r\n- MyCrypto Version Number: 1.7.13\r\n\r\n",
