  "body": "\r\n### Description of the Issue\r\n\r\nHey all, I'm sure you've all got tons to do, but I figured you'd want someone to point this out. The placeholder on the ENS page (accessed from the top bar) still references MEW (it's 'mewtopia').\r\n\r\nEDIT: This is also true for the 'Contracts' and 'DomainSale' pages\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nGo to https://mycrypto.com/#ens. Observe.\r\n\r\nPS - I dug around in the repo looking for the page myself, but I couldn't find it. Making a PR on this would've taken me less time than opening the issue, I know. But once I couldn't find it, I figured you'd want to catch it anyway.  Cheers, and thanks for the wallet.",
