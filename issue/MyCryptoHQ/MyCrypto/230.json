  "body": "## Why?\r\nWhile subjective, the team agrees that we don't need the additional complexity/boilerplate that comes with sagas. We would like to add side-effect libraries with smaller learning curves and are better suited for our simpler use-cases.\r\n\r\nThunks and promise-middle-ware have much less abstraction in comparison to sagas, which gives simple and concise code flow for more basic side effects. Sagas can and will still be used for more complex flows where their extra added power can be used effectively\r\n\r\n### Replacements\r\n1. [ ] `Thunks`\r\n\r\n2. [x]  `Redux-Promise-Middleware`\r\n     1. Handles dispatched promise instead of dispatched functions\r\n     2. Redux promise middleware comes with some extras that handles dispatching fail/succeeded actions based on the result of the resolution of the promise. \r\n\r\nYou can use thunks in-tandem with `redux-promise-middleware` for chaining promise.\r\n\r\nThe standard I would like to settle on is for using `redux-promise-middleware` for basic network requests, `thunks` for most async-effects beyond simple network requests, and `redux-saga` when all else fails.
