  "body": "• X-Frame-Options: This header specifies whether the web page is allowed to be framed, as explained in MEW-01-006.\r\n• X-Content-Type-Options: This header determines whether the browser should perform MIME Sniffing on the resource. The most common attack abusing the lack of this header is tricking the browser to render a resource as a HTML document, effectively leading to Cross Site Scripting (XSS).\r\n• X-XSS-Protection: This header specifies whether the browser’s built-in XSS auditors should be activated (enabled by default). Not only does setting this header prevent Reflected XSS, but it also helps to avoid the attacks abusing the issues on the XSS auditor itself with false-positives, e.g. protecting against universal XSS and similar. It is recommended to set the value to either 0 or 1; mode=block.\r\n• Strict-Transport-Security: Without the HSTS header, a MitM could attempt to perform channel downgrade attacks, as explained in MEW-01-001.\r\n• Content-Security-Policy: The presence of this header could improve the security of those web applications by preventing a wide range of XSS attacks. A sample policy that allows only same origin resources are as follows. Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'\r\n",
