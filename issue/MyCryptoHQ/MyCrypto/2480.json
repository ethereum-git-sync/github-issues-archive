    "body": "ok, so it appears that I pasted non-address text into the broadcast tx field, which is half of this issue. I did not notice initially because the  design of the field pushes my view of the text to the end of the line...not the beginning of the line where I had accidentally copy/pasted the bad text. therefore the send tx button did not appear.\r\nthe other half of the issue is design. I think it's better to have a field that is several lines of space so the user can see all of their text. this should be an easy-peasy fix. ;-) \r\n",
