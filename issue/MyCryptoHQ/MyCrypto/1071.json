    "body": "Unfortunately making a `tbody` scroll while keeping the `thead` is a bit of a nightmare, but we could work that out with flexbox. However, I think the UX of doing a ton of scrolling isn't _much_ better than clicking next a bunch of times. I'd like to learn more about how people keep track of their dozens of addresses, that might lead to a better solution. A few I can think of:\r\n\r\n1. A search bar for the address\r\n2. Select address by number alone\r\n3. Recent addresses / favorite addresses\r\n4. Optionally input the desired address or index along with mnemonic / password, instantly unlock that address, bypassing the modal\r\n5. (In the future) instantly get access by address, only input mnemonic when needed\r\n\r\nWould be great to get some more feedback about how to best solve this before we just bump the number.",
