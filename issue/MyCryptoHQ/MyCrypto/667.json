You will want to file an issue against the [existing project over here](https://github.com/kvhnuke/etherwallet/issues).\r\n\r\nHowever, when I look at etherscan now, while I'm not sure what a winning deed address is, it is showing your address as the **owner** of the domain. So I think it's all good!",
