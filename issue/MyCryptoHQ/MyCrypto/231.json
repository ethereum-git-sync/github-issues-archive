    "body": "Reducing the abstraction in the way the router is currently implemented will also be a benefit of switching over to v4. Currently `common/index.ts` renders Root from `common/components/Root`, which then renders Routing from `common/routing`. The routing can be simplified into 1 small component and be a bit more future proof thanks to react-router v4 and how it handles nesting routes.",
