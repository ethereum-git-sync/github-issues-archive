  "body": "I'm not sure how documentation stuff works so I'm going to write what I know.\r\n\r\n**We need documentation for new Web3 providers to add their extension as a default on MyCrypto. Right now we have MetaMask, but new providers are going to be arriving to the scene in the future.** \r\n\r\nFor example, [Blue Protocol](https://www.blueprotocol.com/) is working on an [extension](https://mywallet.blue/) and it would be valuable to support them and their community as well.\r\n\r\n_Similar to new tokens, **this does not mean we are promoting any Web3 provider** - if the user has decided on their own to install this Web3 provider, we will simply allow it to appear to them._\r\n\r\n**How it looks:**\r\nIf user has **no Web3 provider** installed: MyCrypto Web3 box shows \"Web3\"\r\nIf user has **MetaMask** installed: MyCrypto Web3 box shows \"[icon] MetaMask\"\r\nIf user has **Blue** installed: Mycrypto Web3 box shows \"[icon] Blue\"\r\nIf user has **MetaMask & Blue** installed: MyCrypto Web3 box shows whichever one loads quicker (would be nice to determine if this is true or if there is a clearer way to understand this)\r\n\r\nFrom my understanding, for a Web3 provider to integrate with us, they need to provide:\r\n\r\n- ICON (ie: import MetamaskIcon from 'assets/images/wallets/metamask.svg)\r\n- NAME (ie: lid: 'x_MetaMask)\r\n- What else do we need from them, and how do they make a pull request? Do they just pull https://github.com/MyCryptoHQ/MyCrypto/pull/1128/files#diff-369e176080133eeadf3a427bb5bc7ec6R108 ? \r\n\r\n\r\n",
