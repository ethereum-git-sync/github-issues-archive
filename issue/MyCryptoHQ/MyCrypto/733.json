My guess is that you have experienced this on the existing site at https://myetherwallet.com, where the issue tracker is found at https://github.com/kvhnuke/etherwallet.\r\n\r\nThe bad instruction warning you received is a fairly generic error message, but it's possible the gas limit was simply too low. You may be able to get additional help by emailing support@myetherwallet.com if this problem persists.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nDaniel\r\n\r\n\r\n  ",
