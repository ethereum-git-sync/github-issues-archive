All of those are really for advanced users and should be moved to the 'details' tab in the tx confirmation modal. \r\n\r\nAlso the 'generate transaction' button should be replaced with just the 'send transaction' button. Functionally it should behave the same, it'll ask for confirmation on hardware wallets before sending, and still generate the transaction, but it'll simplify the sending process.",
