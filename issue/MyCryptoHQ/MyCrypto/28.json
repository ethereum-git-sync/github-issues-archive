Using [team_join](https://api.slack.com/events/team_join) event.\r\n* Monitor messages triggered with `/remind` and delete them immediately if they were created by a non-admin/non-whitelisted user.\r\n* Auto-delete/change any channel topic change that wasn't issued by a team admin. Relevant APIs/events:\r\n [channels.setTopic](https://api.slack.com/methods/channels.setTopic) and [channels.info](https://api.slack.com/methods/channels.info)\r\n* Detect messages with spam/fake links impersonating established websites. Relevant event: [message](https://api.slack.com/events/message).\r\n\r\nThe Slack app itself will pass its logic to a 3rd party open-source project (https://github.com/409H/Slack-AdminOnlyReminders) that will publish (on its homepage) banned messages and users in real-time and store them in the database so we can start building metrics on the data and reporting.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCurrently, on my test slack team and application, I have the system monitoring and deleting `/remind` commands that were not set by admins. I am to tidy the code up a little, and setup the repo to have a \"deploy to heroku\" button and slack app to easy distribute. I think testing on this feature can commence late Friday (June 7, 2017) night (GMT timezone).\r\n\r\n\r\n(I've renamed the repo since the app will do more than SAOR. https://github.com/409H/Slack-ICO_Safe)",

    "body": "The issue we ran into is that an admin cannot delete any @slackbot IM channel reminders other than their own. We tested it on the API by checking reminders.list for any slackbot IMs other than our own – and had this confirmed by Slack.\r\n\r\nA bandaid we thought we could do is take a look at writing an incoming webhook that triggers a slackbot response in a user's @slackbot IM channel when any reminders are posted there.\r\n\r\nWe did it with 4 user accounts and sent various slackbot reminders to other users directly. We tested using reminders.delete to query the IDs of user slackbot IM channels - not public channels. We could not see, and therefore could not delete slackbot IMs that were not related to us, even as main admin. Slack confirmed it is not possible to delete other user's slackbot IMs, including reminders. They can only be deleted by the recipient or sender if sent as IM.",
