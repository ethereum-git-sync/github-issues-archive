    "body": "Had to reread what gas is, but basically.  One situation was recently I had long decimal-number of ether, but wanted to end up with whole/natural number (no decimals or decimals considered all zeroes; ) similarly let's say I have 3.14159265359ETH (forgot how far decimals in wallet go, but hopefully similar) but want to end up with 3ETH... I'd select 'send' only 0.14159265359 (including what is sent, and gas, as their sum)... doesn't really send quite that much rather than  0.14159265359 minus whatever gas for that amount.\r\n\r\nSome cryptocurrency wallets even let you send all you have, which of course is another situation (like in your case above if they only had 9 but want to send it all) where the user needs gas subtracted automatically, because errors would be common and they may end up with some left that's too little to use/send.\r\n\r\nI'm currently set to be doing days/weeks of re-setup after a couple OS reinstalls on my desktop and with more reinstalls/etc. coming up soon on several other workstations/servers, so may not get around to installing/rebuilding/opening any cryptocurrency programs to screenshot examples for some days but if I'm aware you want some, I'll make some (I've heard sometimes it's not good to discuss different cryptocurrencies in different areas, but though Ethereum was the first such system adding programming capabilities to it, so technologically superior design, it's the case the original--Bitcoin Core (and at least six of seven main forks or forks of forks)--has option to subtract transaction fee from what one sends... after things get back to normal for me, I can optionally screenshot that and/or  similar.)",
