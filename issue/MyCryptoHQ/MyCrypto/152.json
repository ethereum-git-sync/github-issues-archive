Holidays and extenuating circumstances will result in delayed releases.\r\n     - A staggered release schedule with a release candidate published live for 1 week before \"full\" release will be employed to allow relatively wide-scale testing \r\n         - Holidays / extenuating circumstances resulting in delayed beta releases will result in a similarly delayed production release to ensure that the beta release candidate is live for at least 1 week.\r\n     - A Header/Banner with solicitation for feedback via GitHub and Email will be shown on the beta site to ensure users are aware on how to provide feedback.\r\n\r\n2. Release Notes\r\n    - At a minimum, summarized release notes via [dternyak/GitHub-Project-Management](https://github.com/dternyak/GitHub-Project-Management) will be released alongside new releases.\r\n\r\n    - Particularly major releases can include a more technical write-up published to Medium to help with user engagement.\r\n\r\n3. Release Validation / Release Approval\r\n    - A QA Lead will be designated to validate releases before publishing to the beta channel. \r\n        - Release validation will include manual testing of user-facing functionality via workflow checklists, as well as static analysis on the the build. \r\n    - QA lead will be made a \"code owner\" on both the staging and production repo's as described in https://github.com/MyEtherWallet/MyEtherWallet/issues/499. \r\n    - QA Lead's approval will be required for merging \"dist\" patches to both staging and production.\r\n    - An approval by at least one other non-maintainer will be required for merge. \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  ",
