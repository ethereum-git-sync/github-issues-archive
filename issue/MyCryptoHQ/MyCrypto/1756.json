  "body": "---\r\n\r\nIf you've experienced a bug, please provide the following information:\r\n\r\n### Description of the Issue\r\n\r\nIf I want to send tokens, and I input in the advanced field more gas than I have, I'm told that I have insufficient funds in the \"amount\" field. And that it is wrong. The error should be pointed to the advanced gas inputs. The only error that pops up is when you click on the \"Send all\" arrow button. The error should be given before this point, it's also not that obvious that I need to click the \"send all\" button for this error to tell me what is wrong. \r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Unlock wallet\r\n2. Send a transaction of a token (any amount)\r\n3. Go to advanced fields\r\n4. Put in some random number for Gas Price to be more than ETH in the wallet - leave Gas limit to auto calculate\r\n    - Error tells me its from the \"Amount\" field and not the gas I input\r\n\r\n### Description of Your Machine\r\nWindows 10, Chrome\r\n\r\n### Console Logs / Screenshots\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25834495/39949643-118622ee-554a-11e8-9763-a58670fef651.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25834495/39949638-0972ffd2-554a-11e8-8ca8-33a42534ffac.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n",
