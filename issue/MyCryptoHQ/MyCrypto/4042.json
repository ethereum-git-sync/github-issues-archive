  "body": "### Description of Issue\r\n\r\nWhen I try to send ETH to the ENS name [brantly.art](https://app.ens.domains/name/brantly.art), it doesn't recognize the name and throws the error \"Domain brantly.art is not supported\".\r\n\r\nThis likely means that MyCrypto has a hardcoded list of domain suffixes in order to recognize an ENS name. This is incorrect. You should instead treat any dot-separated name as a potential ENS name and attempt a look-up. ENS is about to fully integrate the DNS namespace (adding ~1300 suffixes to ENS), and the DNS suffix namespace itself expands over time. So a hardcoded list will be constantly out of date. If you use a library like etherjs, it'll work correctly and be future proof.\r\n\r\n### What exactly were you doing when you encountered this issue?\r\n\r\n<img width=\"658\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-06-22 at 8 32 05 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30162762/123016717-37874100-d399-11eb-9b5d-334e9005bd94.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### How were you accessing your wallet?\r\n\r\nMetaMask\r\n\r\n### Description of Your Machine\r\n\r\n- Browser: latest Chrome\r\n- Browser version: latest\r\n- Operating system: macos\r\n- Device: Macbook Pro\r\n- MyCrypto.com vs Desktop Application?: Website\r\n- MyCrypto Version Number: latest\r\n\r\n### Console Logs / Screenshots\r\n\r\n...\r\n",
