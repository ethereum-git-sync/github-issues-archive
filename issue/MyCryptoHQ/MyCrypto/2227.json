  "body": "Hello MyCrypto team üëãüèº\r\n\r\nI would like to request for a feature.\r\n\r\n### Description of the Feature\r\n\r\n![mycrypto](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3416976/47380447-19706b00-d730-11e8-9edc-19d1e3106bd8.png)\r\n\r\nI'm using MyCrypto for my development, together with Truffle and Ganache. Having offline/desktop version MyCrypto is really useful for me.\r\n\r\nBut, in order to download the Keystore File, seems like MyCrypto is requiring users to enter password. Would that be possible to download without setting password? Maybe with a warning checkbox for users?\r\n\r\nHaving this will greatly helpful for developers like me because sometimes it's part of our test cases to not set the password of the keystore file.\r\n\r\nThank you. ‚ù§Ô∏è",

    "body": "Hey so are there keystore files without passwords anywhere else in the ecosystem? As far as I know Mist / geth require a password as well. \r\n\r\nI honestly dont think this is an issue that we would give priority to implementing as it's really a niche usecase. As much as I wish we could implement every feature, we've opted to focusing on doing things that improve \"average\" users lives in the short term. \r\n\r\nI would consider merging a pull request with this change, but it would have to be implemented very carefully so that the average user doesn't unintentionally make themselves more insecure.
