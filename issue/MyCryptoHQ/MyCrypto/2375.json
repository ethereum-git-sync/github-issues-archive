The current fields can be found [here](https://github.com/MyCryptoHQ/MyCrypto/blob/3074e50909495d171edff2ec63a3e30bbeeb335a/common/components/renderCbs/Query.tsx#L17), but I can't guarantee for them all to work correctly at this time.\r\n\r\nThe team was made aware of this, and full support should be added in the near future :)",
