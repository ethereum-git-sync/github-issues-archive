  "body": "### Description of the Issue\r\n\r\nBecause Metamask/web3 locks the current node to the current web3 provider, if the web3 provider is on a different network than the user's previously selected node, then when they sign a transaction and the `Check Tx Status` notification pops up they'll have their network switched back to the original network. This causes the `Check Tx Status` page to not have the entry they were looking for since it was broadcasted on a different network. This can be fixed by using #1496 when `Check Tx Status` is clicked.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Have your network be ETH\r\n2. Have your metamask network be Kovan\r\n3. Go to `View & Send` Tab\r\n4. Send a transaction\r\n5. Click on `Check Tx Status` button on the success notification\r\n6. Your previously broadcasted transaction will not be displayed (broadcasted on kovan, but you're checking mainnet ATM)\r\n",
