  "body": "Thanks first of all for the nice app. I am using MyCrypto to view my assets primarily - and use other wallets to actually run transactions.\n\nWhen working with the [L2 zkSync](https://v2-docs.zksync.io/dev/fundamentals/faq.html#which-wallets-are-supported) network, I realised that I'd very much like to see my L2 zkSync assets in MyCrypto as well.\n\nHowever, I couldn't find the network there in the list, so I am asking here regarding the [steps to add a new network](https://support.mycrypto.com/developers/adding-a-new-network/).\n\nI am surprised, that the list of networks is so long - but it still doesn't contain zkSync. Did I miss something?\n\nI would like to add the network to the list - but I wonder whether there is any reason, why it's not already added.\n\nWhat do the developers/maintainers think?",
