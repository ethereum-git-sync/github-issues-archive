  "body": "### Description of the Issue\r\n\r\nThere is a `color` property in every network in [`common/features/config/networks/static/reducer.ts`](https://github.com/MyCryptoHQ/MyCrypto/blob/master/common/features/config/networks/static/reducer.ts). Where is it used in the frontend? Is it used at all? When adding a network I came across this question when added a network ( https://github.com/MyCryptoHQ/MyCrypto/pull/2358 ) and I still don't know the answer.  I can just set some color for the network but it highly depends where it is displayed to decide which color to set. A good place to put an explanation would be in the Wiki Page [Adding a Network](https://github.com/MyCryptoHQ/MyCrypto/wiki/Contributing-%E2%80%90-Network-or-Node#adding-a-network).\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Read [Adding a Network](https://github.com/MyCryptoHQ/MyCrypto/wiki/Contributing-%E2%80%90-Network-or-Node#adding-a-network)\r\n1. Add network to `common/features/config/networks/static/reducer.ts`\r\n2. Be confused about what color to put there.\r\n",

It is a simple border color or small circle indicator color—never a background color or text color—which gives you a lot of flexibility in color choices.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the color was to give people an easy way to tell if they were on a different network, especially when sending transactions.",
