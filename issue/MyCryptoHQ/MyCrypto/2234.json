The spinning wheel underneath the \"Send Transaction\" button just keeps on spinning.\r\n\r\n![send-transaction-won t-complete](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41203384/47618180-f9420280-dac7-11e8-842d-dadddba00bf6.jpg)\r\n\r\nIf I then click the \"Change Wallet\" button in the upper-right hand corner of the MyCrypto desktop application to be taken back to the \"How would you like to access your wallet screen?\", and then I select the Ledger option again, I am then greeted with the following error message: \"Failed to Connect to Ledger\".\r\n\r\n![failed to connect to ledger error message](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41203384/47617885-31dfdd00-dac4-11e8-8489-7c326f609c5e.jpg)\r\n\r\nIf I close down the MyCrypto application completely and then run the MyCrypo application again, the MyCrypto application will let me either access my Callisto/Ethereum Classic wallet again or the MyCrypto application will get stuck on the \"Unlock Your Ledger\" screen.\r\n\r\n![won t unlock](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41203384/47617931-dd892d00-dac4-11e8-9c79-eeebb45855c3.jpg)\r\n\r\nI am using my Ledger Nano S with other desktop wallets such as Scatter, Fairy Wallet, and Ledger's own Ledger Live desktop application and my Ledger Nano S works perfectly with those applications.

In the \"About\" section of each app on My Ledger Nano S I can see that I have the latest version of the following apps: Ethereum (version 1.1.7), Callisto (version 1.1.7), and Ethereum Classic (version 1.1.7).\r\n\r\nI took your advice and uninstalled all the apps on my Ledger and then reinstalled them in the order you suggested and I am still having the same problem. I also tested the MyCrypto app on 2 other Windows 10 64-bit machines and I'm experiencing the same problem on those machines as well.\r\n\r\nLike I said in my original post, I am using my Ledger Nano S with other desktop wallets such as Scatter, Fairy Wallet, EOS Voter by Greymass, and Ledger's own Ledger Live desktop application and my Ledger Nano S works perfectly with those applications. The MyCrypto desktop application is the only desktop wallet that is giving me problems. My Ledger Nano S works perfectly on the MyCrypto website (https://mycrypto.com), it's just the Windows .exe version of the MyCrypto application that I am experiencing problems with.\r\n\r\nThank you for the help, but I have now uninstalled the MyCrypto desktop application from my computer.",
