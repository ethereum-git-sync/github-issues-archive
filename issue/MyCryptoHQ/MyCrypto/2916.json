I have confirmed that if I shut down the geth node, I can then use the Ledger. So it appears there is something about the geth node running that is causing a conflict.\r\n\r\n### What exactly were you doing when you encountered this issue?\r\n\r\n1. Start geth node\r\n2. Start MyCrypto Desktop\r\n3. Plug in Ledger and try to connect from MyCrypto Dekstop\r\n4. See error\r\n\r\n### How were you accessing your wallet?\r\n\r\nLedger\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description of Your Machine\r\n\r\n- Operating system: Linux Mint 19.2\r\n- Device: laptop\r\n- MyCrypto.com vs Desktop Application? Desktop\r\n- MyCrypto Version Number: 1.7.4\r\n\r\n\r\n### Console Logs / Screenshots\r\n\r\n![ledgererror2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9424721/70939452-4b205180-2016-11ea-9b54-49c38037c33b.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
