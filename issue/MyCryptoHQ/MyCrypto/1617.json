  "body": "Related to #1507\r\n\r\n### Description of the Issue\r\n\r\nAny zero value fields are still included in the resulting transaction JSON, causing some methods to fail on some providers #1507. This is because they expect that field be undefined if it was optional, and will throw an error if it has a zero value instead. This would require some refactoring of the transaction stack, and display components to handle `undefined` values instead of zero values.  \r\n\r\n### Example:\r\nGas estimation with metamask fails if the `to` address is `0x` (what we supply if the address is empty), but works fine if you send it to a parity node. On the contrary, if you dont include the field at all (or leave it as undefined/null value) then both the parity node and metamask will accept it as a contract creation transaction.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n#1507\r\n\r\n",
