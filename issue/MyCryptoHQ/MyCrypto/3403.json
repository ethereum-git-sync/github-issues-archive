  "body": "### Description of Issue\r\nI have a pending transaction, created with another app (although i doubt it matters?). It was not being mined, so i set the nonce correctly to the pending nonce, recreated tx, and bumped the gas price significantly above 12.5% required. I signed the transaction, but even after I confirmed it on Ledger, MyCrypto refuses to send the transaction to the RPC, instead saying:\r\n\r\n\"This transaction is very similar to a recent transaction. Please wait a few moments and try again, or click 'Advanced' and manually set the nonce to a new value\"\r\n\r\nMyCrypto is for some reason deciding not to send a valid transaction, instead looking into the pool and (falsely) deciding it isn't valid?\r\n\r\nI have looked into its communication with the RPC, it never even tries to send it. This error is originating in MyCrypto (and i have never had this problem before with MyCrypto)\r\n\r\n### What exactly were you doing when you encountered this issue?\r\n\r\n...Give us some steps to reproduce...\r\n\r\n### How were you accessing your wallet?\r\n\r\nLedger\r\n\r\n### Description of Your Machine\r\n\r\n- Browser: n/a\r\n- Browser version: n/a\r\n- Operating system: mac\r\n- Device: Ledger\r\n- MyCrypto.com vs Desktop Application? yes\r\n- MyCrypto Version Number: 1.7.11\r\n\r\n### Console Logs / Screenshots\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-07-30 at 12 42 54 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/361654/88967851-3752f400-d263-11ea-97fb-ebfd6d4a2491.png)\r\n",
