  "body": "Broken out of https://github.com/MyCryptoHQ/MyCrypto/issues/194\r\n\r\n\r\nUse case:\r\n\r\nUsers sometimes want to transfer all balances out of their account (new hardware wallet, paranoia about safety of key, etc.).\r\n\r\nCurrently, they have to manually make a number of token transfers while ensuring they have enough gas, and then follow-up with sending the remainder of the ether.\r\n\r\nProposal:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Create a \"sweeper\" button on the send view that:\r\n    1. Polls to see if there are any unscanned tokens\r\n    2. Calculates gas costs to send all tokens and ensures that user has enough ether to pay for gas.\r\n    3. Sends all tokens (crafting and broadcasting individual transactions for each)>\r\n    4. Sends all remaining ether.\r\n    5. Notifies user of error at any point during the process. Token transfers can fail, so it will be important to poll to see if transactions are confirming / if the \"sweeper\" completed successfully.\r\n    6. Provide user messaging around gas price so they understand this can be a lengthy process if they choose to set a low gas price. \r\n\r\n\r\nNote: This is not to be confused with the existing \"send everything\", which is purely for ether. \"Sweeper\" terminology should be used for this new functionality. \r\n  \r\n  ",

    "body": "Just a few notes I had on the implementation of this:\r\n\r\n* This will probably be a UI / UX heavy component to implement, so feel free to keep any visuals made for this quite minimal until we can nail down what the flow should look like, and what the messaging to the user should be. Of course, if you have a good idea of how it should look, feel free to give it your all. Just know that it's likely going to change a good bit before it goes live!\r\n    * Personally, I do **not** think we should try to shoehorn this feature into the current send interface. I think we should try and make something separate that locks user input in and reduces their ability to mess up the process.\r\n* We have to make sure that once gas cost(s) are calculated, the user _cannot_ change their gas price. To make this feature as snappy as possible, we should probably recommend the user set a high(er) gas price so that we can confirm each transaction back to back.\r\n* Once a transaction is sent, we'll want to make sure the correct nonce is set for subsequent transactions. I don't know that we do any bumping / invalidating right now.\r\n* ETH should be the last transaction signed & sent. That way, we can just reuse the \"Send entire balance\" functionality to make sure we get all ETH out. And if anything goes wrong along the way, they'll still have ETH left over for any outstanding token transactions.\r\n\r\nAfter this current sprint, I'd be happy to throw some wireframes together with what this might look like.",

    "body": "I've gone ahead and taken a quick pass at a design on the sweeper. I didn't mock up all of the possible error states (of which there will be many) but you can get a look at what I'm thinking of in this PDF:\r\n\r\n[sweeper.pdf](https://github.com/MyCryptoHQ/MyCrypto/files/1707956/sweeper.pdf)\r\n\r\nA few things I didn't mock up, or might not be obvious, but I think should be included:\r\n* The gas slider price should be gas price * all gas limits of checked-off tokens.\r\n* When you first go to sweep, we should re-grab all of your tokens, in case you haven't fetched them yet or there were new ones since you last fetched.\r\n* There should be a warning if you don't include all non-ETH tokens in your sweep. Something to the tune of telling them the tokens will be stranded unless the wallet has ETH for gas.\r\n* A sweep-in-progress should set a local storage item, and disable sending for that wallet while it's active. A user can cancel a sweep once they've started, which should clear out the LS item.\r\n* When a user comes back to a sweep in progress, we should let them reset the gas price and recalculate everything.\r\n* While sweeping, we should update balances so the user isn't concerned about what they see in the sidebar.\r\n* We should ask if they're sure the want to cancel the sweep (ala logout modal.)\r\n\r\nThe error states that I'm thinking will come up are:\r\n* Transaction fails to broadcast for some reason\r\n    * Nonce gets out of date somewhere along the way\r\n    * Balance gets out of date somewhere along the way\r\n    * User loses connection\r\n* Transaction fails to be mined\r\n    * Gas price too low (What's the time limit on unmined txs?)\r\n    * Gas limit too low\r\n",
