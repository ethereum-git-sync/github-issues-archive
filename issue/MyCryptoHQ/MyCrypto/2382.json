  "body": "### Description of the Feature\r\n\r\nAfter creating/signing a transaction on the MyCrypto Desktop app offline, I would like to be able to broadcast the transaction by scanning a qr code using a second device. Currently after signing an offline transaction, I have to copy the transaction onto an online device to broadcast it. This can be done with a usb drive, but it is a time consuming a process. Create a method to handle processing the signed transaction on the offline device so that an online device can scan and then broadcast it.\r\n\r\n### Example(s) of Feature\r\n\r\nXRP's Toast Wallet offers offline transaction broadcast support.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n**Thanks to [/u/chrivasintl](https://www.reddit.com/r/MyCrypto/comments/ap3zxu/suggestion_mycrypto_transaction_broadcasting/) for suggesting this feature.\r\n[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/MyCrypto/comments/ap3zxu/suggestion_mycrypto_transaction_broadcasting/)**",
