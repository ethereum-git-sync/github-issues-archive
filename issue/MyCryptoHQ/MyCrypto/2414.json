  "body": "### Description of the Issue\r\n\r\nWrong chainId when sending AQUA from a Ledger Nano S wallet using the Mac OS app.\r\n\r\nSending from a keystore wallet works fine. Sending from the Ledger Nano S wallet but using the website instead of the app works too.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nMake sure you're connected to the Aquachain network. Unlock a Ledge Nano S wallet with some balance. Try to send some AQUA. After confirming the transaction on the Ledger, and clicking on Details, the raw transaction will show:\r\n\r\n\"chainId\": 57\r\n\r\nwhile the chainId should be 61717561 and if you try to submit the transaction you'll get an \"invalid sender\" error.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, the same steps using a keystore wallet and the Mac OS app, or the same Ledger wallet using the website work (transactions are successfully submitted; the raw transactions also has the correct chain id).\r\n\r\n### Description of Your Machine\r\n\r\nMac OS 10.13.6\r\nMyCrypto app 1.6.0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
