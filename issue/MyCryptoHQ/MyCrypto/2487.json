If I try to press Send Transaction I get confirmation requests on Ledger. After confirming there is no usual \"Confirm Transaction\" popup in mycrypto.\r\n\r\nIf I remove contents from data field, I do get the popup. \r\nIf I populate data field again, no popup. Have to reload the page to get it working again.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How were you accessing your wallet?\r\n\r\nLedger Nano S (Firmware 1.4.2, MCU 1.6)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description of Your Machine\r\n\r\nBrowser: Google Chrome\r\nBrowser version: Version 73.0.3683.103 (Official Build) (64-bit)\r\nOperating system: Windows 10 (version 1803)\r\nDevice: Reproduced on 2 different PCs\r\nMyCrypto.com\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Thanks for the report! As with https://github.com/MyCryptoHQ/MyCrypto/issues/2485, it seems that this issue is resolved by updating your Ledger device, hence why I'm closing it here.\r\n\r\nWe're also working on a brand new version of MyCrypto, which you can find [here](https://beta.mycrypto.com/), which should no longer have this issue. Again, thank you so much for your feedback, it helps us a lot with improving our product!",
