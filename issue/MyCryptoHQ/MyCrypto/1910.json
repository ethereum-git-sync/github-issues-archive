  "body": "When changing from TOKEN_1 (e.g. VIU) to TOKEN_2 (e.g. ENJ), the entire form gets reset, including the address, amount, and currency. \r\n\r\n- The address should remain in the form so the user doesn't have to copy and paste it again and potentially make a mistake\r\n\r\n- The amount could be reset or we could just leave it. Not sure it matters\r\n\r\n- The currency should be whatever the user selected. In this case the user had to switch from VIU -> ENJ -> ETH -> ENJ when they should have been able to switch from VIU -> ENJ\r\n\r\n- Gas limit should change each time the address, amount, or currency is swapped\r\n\r\n- Nonce should be pulled again at some point so the user doesn't have to manually refresh it. (This is related to https://github.com/MyCryptoHQ/MyCrypto/issues/1702)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe above was composed from the video demo provided by the user here: https://app.hyfy.io/v/abDI1dq7frn/#!/player\r\n\r\nPlease ping Taylor/Jordan to update user via twitter when complete: https://twitter.com/scottmberry/status/1004481904148561920",
