    "body": "@wbobeirne \r\nOh nice, I didn't realize that. I'm suggesting that you go one step further though. Instead of just listing the Web3 provider, I'm recommending you list _only_ the Web3 provider (or display it in a more prominent way.)\r\n\r\nInstead of the current header, \"How would you like to....\", it could say, \"We noticed you're using MetaMask....\" Include copy around safety, convenience, etc . . .\r\n\r\nThe content of the MetaMask box could be the same: \"Connect & Sign via Your Browser or Extension\"\r\n\r\nThen for users that want to use a different method, they can press a link: \"Use a different method (hardware, private key, etc . . .)\"\r\n\r\nI believe this is optimal for several reasons:\r\n\r\n1. The more disconnected the user is from entering their private key, keystore, or mnemoinc, the better.\r\n2. Not only is the web3 provider safer, the flow is so much simpler & convenient, at least in the case of MetaMask. And I don't think the average user knows this. They likely created their wallet using your service (generated a keystore/mnemonic/privatekey), and naturally, they're going to use one of those three to access it in the future. \r\n\r\nJust my two cents! Love the improvements so far.\r\n",
