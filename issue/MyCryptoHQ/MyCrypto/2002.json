  "body": "It was found that MyCrypto Electron desktop application allows dragging and dropping any local HTML files onto the window. Since the file: URL in Electron has the privilege to read any local files or web sites, this leads to leakage of sensitive information if the user drags and drops a crafted local file.\r\n\r\nIn case the following HTML file is dropped onto the MyCrypto window, the content of /etc/hosts will be shown on an alert dialog.\r\n\r\nPoC.html:\r\n<!-- for Windows -->\r\n<iframe src=\"file:///C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts\" onload=\"alert(contentWindow.document.body.innerHTML)\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<!-- for Mac -->\r\n<iframe src=\"file:///etc/hosts\" onload=\"alert(contentWindow.document.body.innerHTML)\"></iframe>\r\n\r\nTo abuse this, an attacker needs to guide victims to drag and drop a malicious file by social engineering. Because of the unusual user interaction, the severity of this issue is considered “Medium”. It is recommended to disable the default behavior of the drop event by setting the event listener.\r\n\r\n",
