    "body": "Hi @ligi! This is the repository for MyEtherWallet v4, a complete rewrite of the project that's currently in alpha. You probably meant to open an issue on the production repo, [which can be found here](https://github.com/kvhnuke/etherwallet). \r\n\r\n`web3` providers don't allow for transactions to be signed and returned to the client. Instead, signing and broadcasting to the network occurs in one step, the result of which is a transaction hash. Since we can't grab this data, the `Signed Transaction` field has simply been stubbed out with the JSON that MetaMask will sign.",
