  "body": "### The Problem\r\n\r\nThe current Electron build can't unlock Ledger wallets because of the lack of U2F support (Digital Bitbox would also not work, once that integration is in.) It also doesn't do anything to improve security for generated wallets. While we could do some in-app node integration, this would open us up to a bunch of potential security holes, should someone get access to the Javascript in the Electron window context.\r\n\r\n### The Proposal\r\n\r\nWe come up with a protocol that allows for asynchronous private key actions, like generation, transaction signing, message signing, all that good stuff. This would not be dissimilar to Metamask or hardware wallets, where the private key is never externally communicated.\r\n\r\nUsing an [Electron custom protocol](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/protocol.md), we should implement a few methods that get communicated to via `mycrypto://` urls or some such. When you want to do anything that requires a private key, you'll shoot a POST request to something like `mycrypto://sign-tx`, and it'll open up a separate Electron window that allows the user to enter a password / unlock their hardware wallet, verify the transaction data, and send back a signed transaction to the request.\r\n\r\nBoth [Ledger](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledgerjs/tree/master/packages/hw-transport-node-hid) and [Digitial Bitbox](https://github.com/digitalbitbox/mcu/blob/master/py/dbb_utils.py#L66-L172) both have HID implementations that could work with `node-hid`. So we can go directly to the devices without the U2F middleman in the Electron node environment.\r\n\r\n### What We'd Need To Do\r\n\r\n1. Come up with a list of wallets that will move out of web context, and into this Electron protocol\r\n    * Private keys\r\n    * Mnemonic phrases\r\n    * Keystore files\r\n    * Ledger\r\n    * Digital Bitbox\r\n2. Draft up what methods the protocol will need, what the API looks like\r\n3. Figure out a way to conditionally use the protocol in Electron, but use the direct method for web\r\n4. Put together a new electron-side wallet-agnostic unlock and transaction verification UI\r\n    * Different wallets may need different unlock flows, but transaction verification can be uniform\r\n5. Potentially do another security audit on the new protocol once it's complete\r\n\r\nCredit where credit is due: This idea was inspired by [Aragon's blog post about their Electron app + integrating MetaMask](https://blog.aragon.one/electron-metamask-secure-easy-to-use-dapps-5a9987d21034).",
