  "body": "### Description of Issue\r\n\r\nCustom tokens don't get saved when the wallet has no balance of such tokens on networks such as Go. This is especially confusing to people who believe their wallet holds funds of said tokens, but are unable to find them as there is no clear indicator of there being none, it simply disappears. An improvement would be to show a zero instead, like on other networks.\r\n\r\nOn the ETH and ETH testnet networks, it works as intended, showing a 0 when there are no funds. I'm unsure why this doesn't appear to happen on other networks such as Go. I'm unsure if multiple networks are affected.\r\n\r\n### What exactly were you doing when you encountered this issue?\r\n\r\n1. Access Go network.\r\n2. View wallet address, any address will suffice.\r\n3. Add custom token, such as `0x5347FDeA6AA4d7770B31734408Da6d34a8a07BdF` as contract address.\r\n4. The fields will get populated, but the token won't get saved when clicking 'Save', it will simply disappear.\r\n\r\n### Description of Your Machine\r\n\r\nAny.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Console Logs / Screenshots\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11412480/58433317-fd162180-80b6-11e9-93ee-1376d07a0600.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11412480/58433323-01423f00-80b7-11e9-9baa-72cc3569330f.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n",
