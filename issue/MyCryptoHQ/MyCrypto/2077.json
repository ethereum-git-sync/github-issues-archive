  "body": "## MyCrypto Desktop App\r\nWhen we select a network and unlock the account, it still seems to ask for network type even though we selected that in the previous step. Sending a tx works without selecting that option, so I guess the button/dropdown could be removed? A side note in case this button has some other purpose I'm not aware of, we should remove `border-radius` for network type (notice the teeny weeny curvature in the bottom)\r\n\r\nGreat App btw, works flawlessly :)\r\n\r\n<img width=\"588\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-07-17 at 7 12 54 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18598959/42821140-82259496-89f5-11e8-8abf-9efb3ab03686.png\">\r\n<img width=\"592\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-07-17 at 7 20 23 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18598959/42821598-86e8a882-89f6-11e8-8693-3550ae83e976.png\">",

    "body": "Agreed. It makes more sense when the dropdown is ETH, Token_1, Token_2, Token_3, Token_4, etc.\r\n\r\n- Ideally the first choice would be automatically selected (especially makes sense for networks where tokens aren't really a thing).\r\n\r\n- The radius should indeed also be fixed. The selector is here but not sure why it would ever have a border or border-radius unless it's being used elsewhere. https://github.com/MyCryptoHQ/MyCrypto/blob/develop/common/sass/styles/overrides/react-select.scss#L68\r\n",
