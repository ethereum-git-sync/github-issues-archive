The interaction with smart-contracts leads to an error \"This request is not supported because your node is running with state pruning. Run with --pruning=archive.\"\r\n\r\nCustom RPC provider endpoint: `https://core-fullnode.poa.network`\r\nEthereum client: `Parity-Ethereum//v2.2.1-beta-5c56fc5-20181114/x86_64-linux-gnu/rustc1.30.1`\r\n\r\nPruning mode is disabled in configuration:\r\n```\r\n[footprint]\r\ntracing = \"on\"\r\npruning = \"archive\"\r\nfat_db = \"on\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis endpoint works with Ethereum JSON RPC directly, MEW, MetaMask, Nifty Wallet.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n- Add `https://core-fullnode.poa.network/` to the list of custom nodes for POA\r\n- Try to interact with any smart-contract in POA, for example, with [0x4316f704989157162de90997ce1a05cff3118680](https://blockscout.com/poa/core/address/0x4316f704989157162de90997ce1a05cff3118680/contracts).\r\n- The calling of any method will lead to the warning.\r\n\r\n### Description of Your Machine\r\n\r\nGoogle Chrome Version 71.0.3578.98 (Official Build) (64-bit)\r\nmacOS 10.13.6\r\n\r\n### Console Logs / Screenshots\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2018-12-19 at 16 35 52](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4341812/50223422-3a5de100-03ac-11e9-8376-9f53d9d07afc.png)\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2018-12-19 at 16 18 56](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4341812/50222632-ef42ce80-03a9-11e9-8995-a8b09fd93423.png)\r\n\r\n```\r\nMacBook-Pro-Viktor:~ viktor$ curl -X POST --data '{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"method\":\"web3_clientVersion\",\"params\":[],\"id\":67}' https://core-fullnode.poa.network/\r\n{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"result\":\"Parity-Ethereum//v2.2.1-beta-5c56fc5-20181114/x86_64-linux-gnu/rustc1.30.1\",\"id\":67}",

What exactly those settings are is beyond my paygrade unfortunately. ",

Also, we have no mixing `toml` config and CLI parameters. Actually, I opened an issue on Parity end https://github.com/paritytech/parity-ethereum/issues/10096 . Anyways, I guess this issue is related rather to Parity Ethereum client configuration, then to MyCrypto. Thus, this issue can be closed. I am just curious if you could point me out to why you are using `pending` state by default instead of `latest`.",
