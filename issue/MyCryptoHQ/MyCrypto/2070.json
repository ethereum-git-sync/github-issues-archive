  "body": "Hi, I'm gre from Ledger Live team.\r\nSince Ledger Live release, Ledger is now derivating Ethereum and Ethereum Classic accounts by following BIP44 standard.\r\n\r\n## what changes\r\n\r\nLedger Ethereum Chrome Wallet used to derive only one address at `m/44'/60'/0'/0` (NB: without the last `/0` of BIP44).\r\nMEW/MyCrypto have so far followed this idea that Ledger's \"root\" is at `m/44'/60'/0'` and therefore have chosen to derive pages of addresses by using `m/44'/60'/0'/x` (where x is a value from 0 to +inf)\r\n\r\nin Ledger Live instead, the idea is to follow BIP44, which means the first address is derived on `m/44'/60'/0'/0/0`, the second on `m/44'/60'/1'/0/0`, and so on,.. so in other words using the `account` field of BIP44. (`m/44'/60'/x'/0/0`)\r\n\r\n### rationale\r\n\r\nThe benefit of this is that, as we increment an \"hardened\" path so it's more \"secure\" in term of privacy. We also use the same BIP44 convention for all cryptocurrencies so it unifies our approach and codebase.\r\nThe main change from your side is that, is as it's not a public derivation, you can't derive like you do, without the device, you will need to always ask the device to derive each address.\r\n\r\n## current actions and workaround\r\n\r\nSince our release, we've seen some users a bit confused by this. To cover these issues, we have been scanning both the \"legacy\" paths and the new paths (1.0.0). Moreover, a second workaround was added (1.0.2): we will also always scan the first 5 addresses of MyCrypto even if there are \"empty\" accounts in the middle.. because, as we follow BIP44, when scanning accounts is to stop at first account without transactions. *(the fact MEW allow users to take any arbitrary address from the pages have a cost. our tradeoff is so far to assume a user don't paginate more than the first page unless he have finished its account, which might still be not true,.. past first page, if users don't leave \"empty\" accounts and use the address in order, they should be fine)*\r\n\r\nFinally, we are also helping our users discovering their new Ledger Live path in MyCrypto but this is getting a bit more hairy to explain to them. Basically you can use the \"Custom field\" and manually input: `m/44'/60'/0'/0` then select the first derived address (this is LedgerLive first account), then switch to `m/44'/60'/1'/0`, select the first address (this is LedgerLive second account), and so on..\r\n\r\nBut this is a temporary solution for now. I feel we should have a better option offered, right?\r\n\r\n### what you could do\r\n\r\nhere is suggestion of what you could have:\r\n\r\n- a new \"Ledger Live\" option that would derive the addresses using the hardened path. Not sure how reachable for you to paginate address like before you will always need the device and it can take some times to derive addresses (like 1-2s per page)\r\n  - if you do so, please also follow BIP44 spec part that says: *Software should prevent a creation of an account if a previous account does not have a transaction history (meaning none of its addresses have been used before).*\r\n- the previous Ledger option might be renamed as `Ledger (legacy)` ",

    "body": "So there are a few different things going on here. It should be noted this is for the ETH network only.\r\n\r\n1. When a user selects \"Ledger\" and is presented with the mnemonic modal, we should default to the new path (below in 4). It should be labeled `Ledger (ETH)`.\r\n\r\n2. We should make the old Ledger path available in the dropdown under `Ledger - Legacy (ETH)`\r\n\r\n3. If a user connects via Ledger, we should encourage them to check the `Ledger - Legacy (ETH)` path if they don't see their balance. This messaging should be placed in the modal itself.\r\n\r\n> If you don't see your existing Ledger address(es), please try selecting \"Ledger - Legacy (ETH)\"\r\n\r\n4. It's a bit more complex than just adding a new path and switching up the defaults though as the number that we iterate through on the path is changing as well, from `m/44'/60'/0'/x` to `m/44'/60'/x'/0/0`:\r\n\r\n> `m/44'/60'/0'/0/0`\r\n> `m/44'/60'/1'/0/0`\r\n> `m/44'/60'/2'/0/0`\r\n\r\nSo we will need to update how we derive for this specific path (but none of the others) as well.
