  "body": "I previously opened this issue under MEW but it was never fixed and still persists.\r\n\r\nIf you attempt to add a custom node with a decently long FQDN by typing it, the GUI and the entire tab will completely freeze. This happens in FireFox and Chrome.\r\n\r\nThe longer the FQDN the longer it freezes once you press the dot/period key.\r\n\r\nHow to Reproduce:\r\n1. Enter the following into the Custom Node URL:\r\n`https://00112233445566778899`\r\n\r\n2. Affix your cursor at the end of the url and manually type \".com\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as you press the period/dot key you'll notice the lag.\r\n\r\nThat length of an FQDN is just enough to be annoying w/o totally locking up my browser ðŸ˜„ but an even longer one locks up even longer...exponentially.",
