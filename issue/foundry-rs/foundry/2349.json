When call `vm.setEvn` within a test, it sets the environment for all currently running tests.\r\n\r\nThis essentially means it is unsafe to run tests that use `env` in parallel. I've tested tests in different files and they  are also not isolated.\r\n\r\nBecause test are not deterministically scheduled this can also lead to non-deterministic test failures, where one case will race another to set & read the env.\r\n\r\nAs a reference, this was found while trying to test `solenv`. To address this, all test cases had to be consolidated: https://github.com/proximacapital/solenv/blob/master/test/Solenv.t.sol#L46\r\n\r\nNot sure if we are expecting devs to regularly be setting and getting env in tests. I could imagine some integration tests using `setFork` would want to read env and may get tripped by this (if any test sets env)?\r\n",
