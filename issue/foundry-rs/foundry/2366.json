Tried with a bigger plan and no change in execution time: it's at least 20x slower with the most-recent version (compared to almost-instant execution time at https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/commit/1eb6756bd445443c40ebe1c4df1b8fc5d2dbd137)\r\n\r\nIt seems like caching is no more taken into account and thus tests are running full everytime...
