I'm currently trying to pin-point the offending commit by bisecting & building the commits from the last few days and will report back once I find the actual commit hash at which this starts occurring.\r\n\r\nThe test output still reports the same milisecond-level test performance but instead of all tests flying by and the entire test suite completing in a few seconds, it seems that every individual test case takes much longer to start (multiple seconds). So the slowdown appears to be not in the actual test execution but in the bootstrap phase.\r\n\r\n ",

    "body": "Oooooooooooookay... First of all, sorry for potentially wasting your time (maybe? there might still be something wrong here)... I just created the minimal repro - and while doing that, I realized that our old hardhat setup includes a .env file that might overlap with the combination of this PR and the one that recently added support for loading .env files (in https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/pull/2587). \r\n\r\nOur existing, foundry-unrelated .env file also has a `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` value.\r\n\r\nNow, when that value is set (.env contains `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY`), then the slowdown occurs when the `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` is actually not valid (in my case, it was set to a https://polygonscan.com/) API key.\r\n\r\nIf it's a proper and valid `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY`, it only delays `forge test` once before the entire test suite run very briefly before running the first test case. But if it's an invalid API key, it slows it down on every single test case.\r\n\r\nDoes that help?\r\n\r\nSo the repro is simply to put an invalid `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` in your `.env` file.",
