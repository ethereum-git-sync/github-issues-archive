The error will be\r\n\r\n```\r\nInvalid provider url: <alias name>\r\n\r\nIf you were trying to resume or verify a multi chain deployment, add `--multi` to your command invocation.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdding `--multi` (wich should not be necessary) yields a different error: \"Multi-chain deployment not found.\"\r\n\r\n ",
