    "body": "So after troubleshooting over DMs, two issues came out of here.\r\n\r\n* Contract 1: one of the transaction receipts had the wrong `transactionIndex`. I'm not sure how this could have happened. It's important, since we sort the receipts using that field. This lead to mismatched bytecode/contract/transaction/receipt. \r\n\r\n* Contract 2: we were comparing bytecodes of different compiled versions of the same contract. However, we didn't show any kind of information regarding that. We just skip that contract verification, since the bytecodes are different. We probably should do something of the kind if the contract address of the receipt is the same as the one from the transaction: \r\n   * Store the compiler version on the broadcast log, and if it has changed since then, try to compile with the correct one. Finally, resume the contract verification. If it fails, give a more meaningful error, instead of just skipping. `Source code has changed`, `Contract does not match`, `Receipt does not match the transaction on the log`....",
