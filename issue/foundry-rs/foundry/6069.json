While the compilation of sources is fine, the verify script is not able to interpret correctly the path to src/ if it is not in the main directory.\r\n\r\nIn this case remappings is external to the directory where 'forge init' was made, to keep sources separated from the workplace.\r\ntoml line:\r\nremappings = [\"@solidity/=../../../solidity/src\",\"@external/=../../../solidity/external/\"]\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/assets/103030189/2e090931-219f-4e91-a6a2-088ad418aef0)\r\n\r\n",
