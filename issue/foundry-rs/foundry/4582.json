I just set up a CI inspired by [foundry-rs/foundry-rust-template](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry-rust-template) but I can't satisfy both of them! If the output is rust-formatted, it fails the bind check, but if I pass the bind check, its not rust formatted.\r\n\r\nMy particular bind call looks like this:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nforge bind \\\r\n  --root ./contracts \\\r\n  --bindings-path ./crates/wallet/src/bindings \\\r\n  --module --single-file \\\r\n  --select \"^Spether$\"\r\n```",

It's arguably reasonable to not format generated code, so, definitely understand just closing this as won't fix.\r\n\r\nIf desirable I can open an issue or PR on the template repo with a `rustfmt.toml` and update the action to use nightly fmt.
