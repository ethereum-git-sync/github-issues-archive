    "body": "Okay, I debugged it a bit more and found out it's because I had a variable set above `RPC_URL` which has spaces in it. I realized variables with spaces are not parsed correctly, they need to be wrapped in quotes.\r\n\r\nFYI, in the very commonly used `dotenv` package for NodeJS, it parses anything after the `=` until a line break. I guess the `dotenv` rust crate parses it differently. I just wouldn't be surprised if this stumps other developers who are so used to the JS ecosystem around Ethereum. Maybe worth adding an example `.env` to the book or template?",
