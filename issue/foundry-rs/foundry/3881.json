  "body": "### Component\n\nForge, Cast, Anvil\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nProjects that rely on pinning development environments are getting constantly broken since the foundry project switched to keeping the last N nightly releases rather than permanent release tags.\r\n\r\nWe've been promised that foundry v1.0 and stable tags are coming any day now for several months now, and I get it--it's a big milestone to lock in.\r\n\r\nUntil v1.0 is released, could we please get some kind of persistent release snapshotting with nightly? Maybe an easy first take of this is don't delete nightly releases that were done on the 1st of the month? Or on a Monday if we prefer weekly?\n\n### Additional context\n\nRelated issue downstream: https://github.com/shazow/foundry.nix/issues/8\r\n\r\nThe other alternative we're exploring is maintaining yet another separate repo just for archiving foundry nightly releases, but introduces yet another point of trust, point of failure, point of complexity. :)",

I know you like to have a solid process for OSS, but a good starting point is just tagging v0.1 and incrementing periodically whenever you feel comfortable (or someone opens an issue complaining that it has been too long :sweat_smile: ), could even do calver with `v0.20221212` if you prefer. Technically still conforms to semver. :P Once you're ready to v1.0 then you can be more mindful about it.",
