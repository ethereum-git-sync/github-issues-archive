I found it in the `cast` command `basefee`.\r\n\r\nFirst, I ran:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncast basefee --block latest\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt returned\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n1000000000\r\n```\r\n\r\nOk, seems like this command works. So I then tried:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncast basefee --block pending\r\n```\r\n\r\nand it errored with:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nError: \r\n   0: block Number(Pending) not found\r\n\r\nLocation:\r\n   /Users/runner/work/foundry/foundry/cast/src/lib.rs:314\r\n```",
