Clone old bindings;\r\n1. Generate new bindings using `forge bind` and rewrite old ones if needed;\r\n1. Push new bindings to the `contracts-bindings-rs` repo;\r\n1. Create a new tag for the `contracts-bindings-rs` repo;\r\n\r\nThe problem is, that I'm not able to set a stable version of `ethers` because it constantly rewrites it to `default` branch when all the project uses the other one.\r\n\r\n#### Consideration\r\n\r\nIt could be some sort of `Cargo.toml` template that `forge bind` will fill if needed. Or just a flag that will set it's version",
