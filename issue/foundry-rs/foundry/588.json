  "body": "It'll be useful to have a command that prints out the contact sizes in kb. This would help optimise contract size and stay below the 24kb limit, especially while importing multiple libraries. The command could look something like this\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ forge size\r\n\r\nSampleContract       :      23kb\r\nAnotherContract      :       2kb\r\nNewContract          :      16kb\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternatively, this feature can also be part of forge build with a tag, something like\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ forge build --size\r\n\r\ncompiling...\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nSampleContract       :      23kb\r\nAnotherContract      :       2kb\r\nNewContract          :      16kb\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you think this could be a useful addition to forge, I can take this up.\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Absolutely, I created a script for dapptools-template and I remember it was widely accepted as a good idea. \r\n\r\nOn top of that, we could use a gas price API to show the approximate price of deploying the contract at current gas market conditions.\r\n\r\nHere is the bash script that did all of that: https://github.com/gakonst/dapptools-template/blob/master/scripts/common.sh\r\n\r\nAn easy hack is to count the chars of the bytecode and divide that by 2, since due to encoding every ascii character encodes 2 bytes. A hardhat plugin had some issue with proper size estimation when non-ascii characters were used in the contract (e.g part of some string)",
