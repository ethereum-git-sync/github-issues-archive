  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nIt is often the case that when switching between branches in a Foundry project, the dependencies in the `lib` directory get out of whack.\r\n\r\nThis has led me to add the following function in my shell profile:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nfunction reinit() {\r\n\tgit submodule deinit -f .\r\n\tgit submodule update --init --recursive\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function allows me to reinit the git submodules with one command (and allows me to not have to remember the git submodule syntax).\r\n\r\nI think that this use case is so often needed that Foundry should offer a command for it. [Several Foundry users](https://twitter.com/emo_eth/status/1611842681399017473) have a function like the one shared above, and there has also been a discussion about this in the Telegram support group:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1393\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-02-14 at 8 08 49 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8782666/218821399-82a84964-25d8-4cb2-b706-420229e92f03.png\">\r\n\r\nMy feature request: implement a new Forge command (called`reinit-deps`, `reinit-modules`, or just `reinit`) that would do the same thing as the shell function `reinit` from above.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
