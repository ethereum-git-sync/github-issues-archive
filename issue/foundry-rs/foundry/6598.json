I'm not sure when this change in behavior occurred, but the previous versions of cast didn't do this. This breaks scripts that expect a certain format. The old behavior was something like this:\r\n```\r\ncast call --rpc-url $ALCHEMY_URL  0x1f9840a85d5af5bf1d1762f925bdaddc4201f984 'balanceOf(address) returns(uint256)' 0x1f9840a85d5af5bf1d1762f925bdaddc4201f984\r\n78077338549235265036291\r\n```\r\n",
