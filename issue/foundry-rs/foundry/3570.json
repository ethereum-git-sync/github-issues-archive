I am trying to run coverage with a forked network and the coverage report generated seems incorrect. It says I have 100% line coverage (which is correct) but 83% function coverage, which doesn't even make sense. Generated lcov report also doesn't show any missed parts too. \r\n![Screenshot 2022-10-29 at 3 14 52 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76556605/198824990-c9698971-1ace-4b2e-ab16-0e5150ab7a01.jpeg)\r\n",
