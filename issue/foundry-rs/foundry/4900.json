I would think that hitting a contract would be a signal to invalidate the storage cache (make all storage slots cold) since that would indicate a separate transaction. However, what happens is SLOAD/SSTOREs are kept hot over the course of a test, presumably because it is a single function. Is there a way to work around this, or is this a bug?",
