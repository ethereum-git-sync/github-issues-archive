This doesn't seem to be doing anything.\r\n\r\nAm I doing something wrong or is this a bug? It seems like the code is there (https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/master/evm/src/executor/inspector/cheatcodes/mod.rs#L527) but I don't think it's getting hit.\r\n\r\nBesides this I also see that in the documentation it says that the `deal` function has 3 available signatures but I can only find code for the 1st option for setting eth balance and nothing for the ERC20 implementation.",
