  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nWhen deploying contracts to certain EVM-compatible chains, gas price can be poorly estimated. If one is using a device, such as a Ledger, which does not allow for fee customization, this can lead to `forge create` being unusable. Ideally `create` should accept the `--gas-price` flag, and `ETH_GAS_PRICE` environment variable, like `cast` does.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
