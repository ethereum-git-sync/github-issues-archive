  "body": "### Component\r\n\r\nForge\r\n\r\n### Describe the feature you would like\r\n\r\nThe use case is fork + fuzz tests - certain tokens like USDC have blacklists that prevent the transfer of assets between certain accounts (see lines 837 and 838 [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa2327a938febf5fec13bacfb16ae10ecbc4cbdcf#code)). When Foundry fuzzes a blacklisted account, the Forge test will fail because of the following error:\r\n\r\n> Blacklistable: account is blacklisted\r\n\r\nHowever, this is a false negative. The user's test should not have failed.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if there were two config options for filtering revert reason strings and custom errors.\r\n",
