    "body": "Hello @PaulRBerg , @gakonst ,\r\n\r\nSame problem here. However, I think this is not related to inheritance.\r\n\r\nI have two contracts:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncontract ContractX is ERC20, ContractY , IContractY\r\ncontract ContractY is AccessControlEnumerable, ReentrancyGuard \r\n```\r\n\r\nContractX is not tested but no coverage is displayed at all in the report. However, ContractY is tested and coverage is displayed in the report.\r\n\r\nWhen I saw this issue request I thought, ok, let's test it. I created a ContractY2 and used the same tests than for ContractY.\r\n\r\nThe result is that ContractY2 was not displayed in the report either.\r\n\r\nWhen I say \"not displayed\" I mean that both contracts ContractX and ContractY2 are displayed with everything in read and 0% as you can see in the second row of the next image:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4096108/235745810-a4fe9865-8810-4da6-9542-7346c19a7b77.png)\r\n\r\nHopefully it will be fixed soon. Thanks for the good work you are guys doing with Foundry ðŸ˜ŠâœŒ\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nPedro Reyes.",
