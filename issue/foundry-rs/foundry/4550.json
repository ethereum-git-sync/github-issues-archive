For instance with:\r\n\r\n```toml\r\n[etherscan]\r\nmumbai={key=\"${POLYGON_API_KEY}\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nif you run `forge script` locally without verification (and without broadcast) you will get:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFailed to resolve env var `POLYGON_API_KEY` in `${POLYGON_API_KEY}`: environment variable not found\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat was not the case before 93aa2d071b635a838030aa29ad85b52d361f5728. And it makes sense to lazy-load, you can have scripts in a project that will only be run on a local node (and some people will only use it this way). Those will not use some sections of the config file.",
