    "body": "@gakonst - I'm still getting familiar with the codebase, so IDK.\r\n\r\nI'm coming from Python unittest, and they utilize `setUp` and `setUpClass`. JS frameworks also use `setUp` from what I've seen. Technically `setup` is 1 word as a noun, but `set up` is 2 words as a verb or w/e that thing is called in English.\r\n\r\nI would expect the framework to follow Solidity conventions for functions names in Solidity code: https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/style-guide.html#function-names\r\n\r\nAnother option is to keep with community momentum with Truffle's `beforeEach` instead of `setUp`.\r\n\r\nWhichever way, we should probably aim for consistency, less confusion, and aligning with mental momentum from other frameworks for onboarding engineers.",

    "body": "As a reference point, the config file is somewhat case-insensitive, and allows hyphens or dashes. From my tests just now, when trying to override the number of fuzz runs:\r\n- `fuzz_runs`, `fuzz-runs`, `Fuzz-Runs`, and `Fuzz_Runs` all worked.\r\n- Any other combination such as `FUzz-Runs` and `FUZZ_RUNS` did not work.\r\n\r\nFoundry should probably be consistent in its approach to case sensitivity, so IMO there's two options:\r\n\r\n1. Change the config file to be case-sensitive and only support hyphens _or_ underscores, but not both (aesthetically I prefer hyphens, but underscores are probably the way to go for consistency with env var overrides)\r\n2. Allow `setup` (and maybe a few other variations like `Setup` and `SetUp`) to also be used, so it's consistent with the case-insensitivity of the config file. If more than one is found, throw an error. But then what if I use `setUp` in ContractA, then ContractB inherits from ContractA, and uses `setup` which then calls `setUp`? \r\n\r\nGiven the edge cases/weirdness that can come up around 2, I lean towards the following path forward:\r\n1. Show a warning if a setup method is found with any casing other than `setUp`\r\n2. Update the foundry config to be case-sensitive and require only underscores (or only hyphens)",
