The full RPC URL, which exposes API keys, etc.\r\n2. The full, absolute path to the user's project / broadcast file\r\n\r\nThe RPC URL is required for `--resume` on multi-chain deployments, so we should consider moving it to a different dedicated file that gets written to e.g. the cache folder? (since it's gitignored by default). I'm guessing the full absolute path is there for a similar reason (maybe @joshieDo can confirm) in which case we can use the same solution there",
