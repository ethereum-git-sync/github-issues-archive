    "body": "Hey @Sabnock01,\r\n\r\nSorry for not responding over Twitter. Devcon has been overly chaotic. \r\n\r\nThe cheatcode doesn't recognize bytes<x>. It will read everything as `bytes`, except if it's len=32, which is returned as a bytes32. The reason is that bytes32 is a very common structure while most bytes<x> are not.\r\n\r\nIt's not possible to know whether something should be a bytes[], where the len of the bytes happens to be 6 or bytes6[]. The only reason we make the explicit decision is with bytes32, for the reason I mentioned above.\r\n\r\nI would advise simply parsing it as bytes[] and then making a helper function (as I have created in forge-std for other things) that goes over the array and converts it to the type you want. \r\n\r\nI think it's better to keep the cheatcode as-is",
