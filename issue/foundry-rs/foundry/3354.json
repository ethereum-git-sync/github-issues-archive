  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nI now see forge uses sign.eth.samczsun as its Selector DB. However, due to recent latency observed on that endpoint, the traces now hang locally. \r\n\r\nIt would be very useful if we can disable this from being used, therefore negating the latency observed locally when showing traces, but also maybe we can configure this to use another source (if any). \r\n\r\nAt least initially allowing for disabling it seems like a good choice to mitigate. I think the development happening in #3352 will suffice for allowing this under certain conditions, and now allowing it under other conditions. \r\n\r\n*If this is being worked on already, please disregard*\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
