RIght now it is supported for rpc endpoints and etherscan API keys but not supported for libraries.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that one will have 2 same libraries deployed in two different blockchains. Current configuration format for libraries is following:\r\n`libraries = [\"src/MyLib.sol:MyLib:0x8De6DDbCd5053d32292AAA0D2105A32d108484a6\"]`\r\nThis format does not include blockchain configuration.\r\n\r\nIt would be a breaking change to replace this format with something like \r\n`libraries = [\"src/MyLib.sol:MyLib:<chain_id>:0x8De6DDbCd5053d32292AAA0D2105A32d108484a6\"]`\r\n\r\nAnd, considering that all other per chain configurations have non chain dependant alternative (e. g. eth_rpc_endpoint instead of rpc_endpoints section), the reasonable way would be to add one for libraries as well:\r\n```\r\n[libraries_addresses]\r\npolygon = [\"src/MyLib.sol:MyLib:<my_lib_in_polygon>\"]\r\nmainnet = [\"src/MyLib.sol:MyLib:<my_lib_in_mainnet>\"]\r\n```\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
