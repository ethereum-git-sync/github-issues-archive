    "body": "The issue is that with forge's compilation artifacts structure the data associated with top-level objects are missing (unless the top level objects are in a file that has a contract). \r\n\r\nIn this example, when I run `forge build --extra-output userdoc --extra-output devdoc`, in `cache/solidity-files-cache.json`, I see:\r\n```json\r\n    \"/tmp/tests_foundry/src/top_level.sol\": {\r\n      \"lastModificationDate\": 1653035419629,\r\n      \"contentHash\": \"6e6c34f5c3278ef99f3777de8ddf2601\",\r\n      \"sourceName\": \"src/top_level.sol\",\r\n      \"solcConfig\": {\r\n        \"settings\": {\r\n          \"optimizer\": {\r\n            \"enabled\": true,\r\n            \"runs\": 200\r\n          },\r\n          \"metadata\": {\r\n            \"bytecodeHash\": \"ipfs\"\r\n          },\r\n          \"outputSelection\": {\r\n            \"*\": {\r\n              \"\": [\r\n                \"ast\"\r\n              ],\r\n              \"*\": [\r\n                \"evm.bytecode\",\r\n                \"evm.deployedBytecode\",\r\n                \"devdoc\",\r\n                \"userdoc\"\r\n              ]\r\n            }\r\n          },\r\n          \"evmVersion\": \"london\"\r\n        }\r\n      },\r\n      \"imports\": [],\r\n      \"versionRequirement\": null,\r\n      \"artifacts\": {}\r\n    },\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I would expect to have access to the ast/devdoc/userdoc of the content in `top_level.sol`, but it's not available. It's the same with other top-level objects (i.e. if there is a top-level structure, I would expect to see its ast). The lack of AST for top-level objects will prevent Slither from working.\r\n\r\nIt's also unexpected imho that the top-level object artifacts are available if the objects are in a file with a contract, and are not available otherwise. \r\n\r\nI think that anything that can generate Solidity artifacts (ast/doc/etc ..) should be available in some format in the compilation artifacts.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
