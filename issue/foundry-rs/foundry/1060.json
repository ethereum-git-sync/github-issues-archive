Forge currently requires a key be provided, it does not wait/poll for the request to return/etc. At minimum forge should wait for a transaction receipt. This is how metamask support would work: it sends the transaction signing request via rpc to metamask, metamask will return a transaction hash to it. \n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
