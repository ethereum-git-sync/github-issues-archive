  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nForge snapshot is great, but you often have to write minimal tests of the form `testXGas()` to get accurate gas information about a function instead of just the broad strokes.\r\n\r\nYou can manually build something akin to `forge snapshot` that measures the gas usage you  actuallywant to measure by littering your test suite with `gasLeft()` calls... but why not build that into forge snapshot?\r\n\r\nI'm proposing a cheatcode like `vm.snapshotStart()` which under the hood would call `gasLeft()`, and then another call like `vm.snapshotEnd()` that would call `gasLeft()` again and do the math to determine how much gas had actually been spent. If a test doesn't include `snapshotStart()/snapshotEnd()`, then the current behavior would run.\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nfunction testExample() external {\r\n  memory bytes[] data = loadDataFromFFI();\r\n  \r\n  vm.snapshotStart();\r\n  contract.functionOne(data);\r\n  vm.snapshotEnd();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother fun possibility here would be to have this function take a `tag` argument, since if testing part of a contract requires a lot of setup, it is sometimes easier to write a more robust test with multiple assert statements and function calls. Something rougly like this:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nfunction testExampleTwo() external {\r\n    memory bytes[] data = loadDataFromFFI();\r\n  \r\n    vm.snapshotStart(\"With normal data\");\r\n    contract.functionWeCareAbout(data);\r\n    vm.snapshotEnd();\r\n    \r\n    memory bytes[] malformedData = loadMalformedDataFromFFI();\r\n    \r\n    vm.snapshotStart(\"With malformed data\");\r\n    contract.functionWeCareAbout(malformedData);\r\n    vm.snapshotEnd();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
