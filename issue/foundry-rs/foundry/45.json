  "body": "Accurate fuzzing of a contract should fuzz a string with pure bytes. The reason is rust's String is utf8, and most tooling (notable, abi encoder) expects the string to truly be a utf8 string. The issue arises that the evm *doesn't* actually care if its true utf8 - it just treats it as bytes. So an attacker could construct a non-utf8 set of bytes and pass it as an input of a string parameter. \r\n\r\nIf a contract *relies* on strict utf8 encoding, the fuzzer will always miss this. Issues arise because the abi encoder expects an utf8 string so its a bit of a pain to work around but should be done",
