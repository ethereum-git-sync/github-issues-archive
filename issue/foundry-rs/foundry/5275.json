The 1st one doesn't work (only `abi-decode` does), and the second works but is only an alias to `calldata-decode`\r\n\r\nThis also messes up the order of the sidebar commands, making it hard to understand that `abi-encode` has a corresponding decode command\r\n\r\n(apologies if this is duplicate, was a hard one to search for)",
