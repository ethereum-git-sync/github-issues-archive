I want coverage to ignore the fuzzed tests which Ive included in a separate folder inside the test folder (`/tests/fuzzing`). \r\n\r\nAny way around this? I've gone through the pruning of lcov and thats fine. But since `forge coverage` itself takes so long I want to reduce the time taken by ignore all fuzzed tests. cc @PaulRBerg ",
