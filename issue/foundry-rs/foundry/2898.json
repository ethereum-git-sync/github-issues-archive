I realized that it is because of issue I described in the headline. When I print the balance at the end of `setUp` it's 0. At the beginning of a test it's non-zero.\r\n\r\nThe bug was introduced in the latest release. Release nightly-7e9e6a5d6b30ad3f543857198234edcdbceb724a is working as expected.\r\n\r\nI am working on an open source project so the bug can be reproduced by running `forge test --match-contract Subsidy` on master branch in [this repo](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-connect-bridges).\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1436\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13470840/186116718-08a16141-d234-4f0a-abc4-955a3466a12a.png\">\r\n",
