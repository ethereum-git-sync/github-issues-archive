    "body": "Hey hey @oveddan & @iainnash — just wanted to let you know that we're fixing the rough edges we found, and I managed to reproduce your scroll deployment issue & patch it. As soon as ethers is bumped and merged into foundry this should be fixed. relevant pr: https://github.com/gakonst/ethers-rs/pull/2426 (cc @gakonst )\r\n\r\nFor the \"Deploying on a custom L2 chain and verifying on blockscout\" issue, I could not reproduce. What custom L2 are y'all using? Is there any chance you could provide some minimal repro example/command I could just run and hunt down? This one seems much easier than the blockscout issue we were having, just need something to work with.\r\n\r\nAlso, note that for recent nightlies you must have your EVM version set as `london`—it will fail otherwise as higher EVM specs right now are only available on ethereum mainnet/testnets.",

    "body": "awesome, thanks for that @kahuang. I've hunted down what seemed to be the last issue on blockscout-etherscan verification: https://github.com/gakonst/ethers-rs/pull/2453\r\n\r\nI've tested deploying quite a few contracts and verifying them across different chains including yours—but I can't seem to verify any contracts on your instance. The same contract with solc and evm version combo that works when verified on other chains doesn't work on yours. More accurately, it throws this error:\r\n\r\n```{ status: \"1\", message: \"OK\", result: \"Unknown UID\" }```\r\n\r\nI think it might be that the instance is not configured properly—there are also some other features broken (search, for example). Is it possible for you to check? Happy to follow up as soon as you do.\r\n\r\nAlso, note that you must not use a solidity version above 0.8.18, nor an evm version higher than london—verification won't work otherwise as your chain doesn't support these. I recommend setting these on your `foundry.toml`.",
