I believe this can be considered a bug since timestamps of blocks mined without `evm_snapshot` and `evm_revert` are always increased by 1.\r\n\r\nI think this may be the relevant part of the code:\r\nhttps://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/9a4bb7f54563d73b23b597098dcaf1e590905e85/anvil/src/eth/backend/mem/mod.rs#L625-L629\r\n\r\nThe current behavior is (described in [Woke](https://ackeeblockchain.com/woke/docs/latest/testing-framework/overview/) testing framework):\r\n```python\r\nfrom woke.testing import *\r\n\r\n@default_chain.connect()\r\ndef test_reverting():\r\n    t1 = default_chain.blocks[\"latest\"].timestamp\r\n    with default_chain.snapshot_and_revert():\r\n        default_chain.mine()\r\n\r\n    t2 = default_chain.blocks[\"latest\"].timestamp\r\n    assert t1 == t2\r\n\r\n    default_chain.mine()\r\n    t3 = default_chain.blocks[\"latest\"].timestamp\r\n    assert t3 == t2\r\n```\r\nwhile the expected behavior is\r\n```python\r\n    assert t3 == t2 + 1\r\n```\r\n",
