The issue is occuring locally on my M1 Macbook as well as in a linux docker container in CI. [Here](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-connect-bridges/pull/269) is the code and [here](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/AztecProtocol/aztec-connect-bridges/1510/workflows/a62bbc0c-908b-42a6-a13e-8211bb4ecb96/jobs/1646) is the log of a failing CI pipeline.\r\n\r\n### Update\r\nThe bug is not related to `forge-std` (the `forge-std` update simply made it occur more frequently). The bug is caused by overflow in smart contract execution.",
