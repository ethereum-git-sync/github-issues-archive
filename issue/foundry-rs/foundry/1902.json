However, if those transactions rely on data such as `blockhash(block.number - 1)`, forge will actually fail to simulate them, because no actual blocks and blockhashes are being created during that time. e.g., the following fails in a script, but works in a unit test:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {\r\n           vm.broadcast();\r\n           submitTransaction();\r\n            vm.roll(block.number + 1); // need to roll because `submitTransaction` didn't actually create a new block\r\n            console.logBytes32(blockhash(block.number - 1));\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe specific error I get is : \r\n```\r\nMessage:  Failed to get block hash for 10826800\r\nblock 10826800 not found\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be very useful to be able to request our forked instance (anvil?) to simulate a new block being mined, which is the behaviour necessary here, and what suposedly `--slow` should enforce\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nMy real-world scenario here is actually trying to solve [Ethernaut #03](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/level/0x4dF32584890A0026e56f7535d0f2C6486753624f) on-chain using a forge script.\r\nThe script must:\r\n* deploy the ethernaut level instance\r\n* solve it, which requires submitting 10 different transactions across 10 different blocks\r\n\r\nThe current blocker for this is that each call relies on `blockhash(block.number - 1)`, which doesn't seem to exist while simulating the script",
