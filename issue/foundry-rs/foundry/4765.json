    "body": "@mattsse yea I'm pretty sure the issue is that `forge inspect` compiles the full project. I often just do `mv test testt; forge inspect <contract> irOpt; mv testt test` and it's *significantly* faster. Even with that it's still compiling unnecessary src contracts, and ideally it should just compile the minimum set based on the `<contract>` specified",
