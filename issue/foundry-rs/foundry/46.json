    "body": "Thanks for flagging this. The test runner operates over compiled EVM bytecode and ABI, so we'd only need bindings to the compilers and calling them [instead of solc](https://github.com/gakonst/dapptools-rs/blob/e40621cbdfc1963995798cf78388dfe28914d3b7/dapp/src/multi_runner.rs#L43).\r\n\r\nHowever, I do think that right now we should be focusing on making the simple Solidity experience as great as possible, and we can think about other languages later.",
