    "body": "> Why not raising a warning by default when a compiled contract exceeds the contract size limit\r\n\r\nthis is very noisy, hence this error code is ignored by default, you can, however, configure this in the config:\r\n\r\n```\r\nignored_error_codes = [\r\n    \"license\",\r\n    \"code-size\",\r\n    \"init-code-size\",\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nre you're other points, this is a reasonable request and I think it would be beneficial to log this before we invoke solc\r\neither always or if verbosity is a certain value.\r\nBut I'm open to add support for this.\r\n\r\nbtw if you run with --build-info, you get the entire input/output for that run",
