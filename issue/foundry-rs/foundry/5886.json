It would be great if we could specify the name and location of this file via a flag. \r\n\r\nSuggested syntax: `--report-file /path/to/lcov.info` \r\n\r\nJust as another design thought, it might be a nice if this file flag could also work on the other report types as well, in the case of a summary report it could output the summary to a file instead of stdout. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nThis is documented as a [TODO in the codebase already](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/master/crates/forge/bin/cmd/coverage.rs#L345), didn't find a corresponding issue. \r\n",
