Either disable the Yul optimizer or do not use the instruction.\r\n```\r\n\r\nmy `foundry.toml` looks like the following:\r\n```\r\n[default]\r\nsrc = 'src'\r\nout = 'out'\r\nlibs = ['lib']\r\nremappings = ['ds-test/=lib/ds-test/src']\r\noptimizer = true\r\n\r\n[optimizer_details]\r\nyul = false\r\n```\r\n\r\nit seems as if forge is not respecting the `yul = false` option?",
