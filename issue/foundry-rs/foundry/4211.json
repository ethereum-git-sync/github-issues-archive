  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nWe have `vm.resumeGasMetering()` and `vm.pauseGasMetering()`. While useful, the functionality I really end up needing is setting the gas metering to `0`, after I have completed my setup to in order to accurately compare the gas costs of two functions. This would also allow to factor out the gas costs of the function selector, which is a pain to zero-out manually.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
