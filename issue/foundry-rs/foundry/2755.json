The reason we want to fail in this state is that it could otherwise lead to invalid state silently, which would *then* lead to very very hard to reproduce/fix bug reports\r\n\r\nDo you think the timeout might be on your end? I.e. Alchemy is not timing out but your connection is flaky or something like that. Anvil might be sending too many requests too quickly\r\n",

    "body": "@mattsse Results generally look better (a lot more tests passing!). One last request if possible. Any way for us to also do the original solution of \r\n\r\n1. specifying the timeout seconds \r\n2. maybe specifying number of retries (not as important).\r\n\r\nI think being able to specify the timeout would be useful in general. Maybe we only care about the retries and not so much about the timeout threshold, e.g 100s timeout seems long when that request itself might just be botched, and we only care about retrying it. \r\n\r\nHardhat has this as an explicit option so it makes sense for Anvil to also have it as well, as everyone's environments/needs are different.",
