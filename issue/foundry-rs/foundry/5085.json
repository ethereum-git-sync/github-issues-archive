Call address(0x64) `arbBlockNumber` to get l2 block number.\r\n\r\n```\r\ninterface ArbSys {\r\n    /**\r\n     * @notice Get Arbitrum block number (distinct from L1 block number; Arbitrum genesis block has block number 0)\r\n     * @return block number as int\r\n     */\r\n    function arbBlockNumber() external view returns (uint);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCreate arbitrum fork and call 0x64 with `arbBlockNumber()`, it wil revert with `\"EvmError: InvalidFEOpcode\"`. \r\nI think it's just because the foundry evm doesn't fulfill the precompile contract function, but there should be a way to get l2 block number on arbitrum fork. Fulfill it to compatible with arbitrum official implemtation would be great.\r\n\r\n\r\nA minimal test to reproduce it\r\n\r\n```\r\ninterface ArbSys {\r\n    /**\r\n     * @notice Get Arbitrum block number (distinct from L1 block number; Arbitrum genesis block has block number 0)\r\n     * @return block number as int\r\n     */\r\n    function arbBlockNumber() external view returns (uint);\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract ArbL2NumberTest is Test {\r\n    function testGetArbL2BlockNumber() public {\r\n        // <https://arbiscan.io/block/75219831>\r\n        vm.createSelectFork(\"https://rpc.ankr.com/arbitrum\", 75219831);\r\n\r\n        ArbSys(address(0x64)).arbBlockNumber();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n",
