  "body": "### Component\r\n\r\nForge\r\n\r\n### Describe the feature you would like\r\n\r\nadd a `--buffer` flag for `forge script` to adjust broadcast buffer size â€“ transactions are broadcasted in hardcoded batches of 100, introduced in https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/pull/1824. This is fine for most chains, but is still too big for some (eg Optimism Sepolia).\r\n\r\n`--slow` works, but can be excruciatingly slow with big scripts. Proposing `--buffer` as an optional flag (defaults to `100`) that customises this broadcast buffer size. This would enable somewhere between `--slow` and `buffer=100` and bigger buffer sizes for chains that support it\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nworking on a large testnet deployment on Optimism Sepolia (~2000 txes) and getting rate limited very quickly. Running a personal archive node, tracked down the issue to the central sequencer rate limiting after sending about 20-30 transactions at once\r\n\r\n`--slow` takes over 12h to run this script TT",
