    "body": "Hey @mattsse ,\r\nthanks for the quick fix. The panic doesn't occur anymore, but unfortunately vm.rollFork() called in the handler contract still doesn't change the state of the fork. When calling forge test on the repro I provided, the invariant assertEq(block.number, initialBlock) passes still after vm.rollFork(block.number + 1) is called by the fuzzer.\r\nAlso the application still panics if instead of vm.rollFork(block) we call vm.createSelectFork(API_KEY, block), which should be equivalent cheat codes from my understanding.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77360332/229027822-d9ccae2c-ccdf-4999-b8c5-da55bee58003.png)\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!",
