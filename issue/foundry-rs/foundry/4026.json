First introduced here: https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/pull/3730. \r\n\r\nAt Aztec we have an in-house dev net running on an anvil mainnet fork. When adding the `--state` flag, it currently fails as state dumping is not yet implemented for the anvil `fork_db` back-end. I've naively hacked the functionality together here (see: https://github.com/cheethas/foundry/pull/1/files) and it appears to behave as I would expect.\r\n\r\nIf the above is satisfactory I can open a pull request iterating on my naive solution, however I thought I'd first ask in an issue, as I think there's big gotchas I've overlooked which led to it not being implemented in the pr above.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nN/A",
