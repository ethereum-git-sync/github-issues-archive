I feel like having this built into `foundry` would be useful to many people. We use the following command:\r\n\r\n```\r\nforge snapshot && git diff --exit-code .gas-snapshot\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis ensures that there is no diff in the `.gas-snapshot` and exits non zero if there is a diff. The `forge snapshot --exit-code` could check if there is a diff and exit non zero if there is a diff\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
