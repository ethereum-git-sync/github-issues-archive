  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nThe `vm.stopAndReturnStateDiff()` cheat code currently returns a flat array of `AccountAccess` structs with no information on the call depth. This makes it difficult to analyze the results if depth is important for your use case. It would be helpful to add a `depth` field to the `AccountAccess` struct to cover this.\n\n### Additional context\n\nSince depth is already tracked internally, I would expect this to be relatively easy to implement.",
