I was not getting any feedback for why the script was taking so long but eventually narrowed it down to the requirement for many RPC requests.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if in a long-running script, after some time simulating (e.g. 15 seconds), a message was printed to let the user know the issue is that the simulation has lots of ongoing RPC requests. Perhaps a loader would be even better, because no feedback is received until the script has completed.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
