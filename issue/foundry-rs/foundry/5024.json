This is great, but if someone is trying to test smart contract logic that interacts with a custom precompile or some modified version of the EVM it prevents this.\r\n\r\nFor instance, we want to run unit tests that utilize precompile contracts in https://github.com/berachain/polaris and we cannot do so other than jankily writing a `forge script`.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
