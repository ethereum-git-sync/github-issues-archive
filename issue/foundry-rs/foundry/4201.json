Tonight our tests started breaking because our tests do check previous blocks (up to ~30 blocks of history).\r\n\r\nAfter digging a bit we found that `anvil` now only keeps a history of around 10 blocks after which it forgets all blocks and we can't fetch them anymore using `eth_getBlockByNumber` \r\n\r\nHere some debug output from our tests, showing {<method>, <params>, <result>} of the calls against anvil.\r\nWhen we reach block 0xf, the block 1 is already gone.\r\n```\r\n{\"eth_blockNumber\", [], %{id: 1, jsonrpc: \"2.0\", result: \"0xf\"}}\r\n{\"eth_getBlockByNumber\", [1, true], %{id: 1, jsonrpc: \"2.0\", result: nil}}\r\n```",
