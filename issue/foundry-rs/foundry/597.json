However, it downloads amd64 version of the binary even though I'm running aarch64 version of Linux.\r\n\r\nWhen I manually replace the binary with aarch64 version of the binary `forge test` puts amd64 version back.\r\n\r\nWhat could I do in this case to use `forge test` on aarch64 Linux?\r\n\r\nThanks!",
