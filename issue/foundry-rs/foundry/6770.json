  "body": "## Description\r\nEncountered multiple errors while initializing a Foundry project and compiling contracts using `forge` (version 0.2.0) on Windows, within Git Bash using MINGW64. The issues include submodule cloning errors with backslashes in paths and unresolved imports during compilation.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n1. Using Git Bash and MINGW64, run `forge init hello-foundry` to initialize a new Foundry project.\r\n2. Observe errors during submodule cloning (path issue with backslashes).\r\n3. Run `forge test` or `forge build` in the initialized project directory.\r\n4. Notice errors related to unresolved imports (`ds-test/test.sol` not found).\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\nThe `forge init` command should correctly clone submodules without path issues, and the `forge test` or `forge build` commands should resolve imports correctly.\r\n\r\n## Actual Behavior\r\n- During initialization: `error: filename in tree entry contains backslash: '\\'` and `fatal: No url found for submodule path 'lib/forge-std' in .gitmodules`.\r\n- During compilation: Import resolution errors like `Error (6275): Source \"ds-test/test.sol\" not found`.\r\n\r\n## Environment Details\r\n- Operating System: Windows (MINGW64 environment in Git Bash)\r\n- Forge Version: 0.2.0\r\n\r\n## Possible Solution\r\n- The path issue might be related to how paths are handled in the MINGW64 environment of Git Bash on Windows. Investigating this specific environment's path handling during submodule cloning could be a start.\r\n- The import resolution issue might be related to how `forge` handles file paths or project structure in the MINGW64/Git Bash environment.\r\n\r\n## Additional Context\r\n- The issue seems specific to the Windows environment, particularly when using Git Bash with MINGW64.\r\n- Including command line outputs for reference:\r\n![image](https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-std/assets/142411963/6f2d0302-c88c-4f86-82f6-445a449dca51)\r\n![image](https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-std/assets/142411963/965b5e69-c149-4305-9588-e8333f59e96c)\r\n![image](https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-std/assets/142411963/ea03717b-752c-4036-8c2c-04b959478f89)\r\n\r\n",
