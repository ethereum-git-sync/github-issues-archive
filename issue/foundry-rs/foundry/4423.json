This way I could fold setup trace and only see the test function trace when I copy the trace to a file and open in vscode.\r\n\r\nOne option would be to use tabs instead of `â”‚   â”‚` Vscode folds tabs automatically, but not the current `â”‚   â”‚` format. \r\n\r\n\r\n![out](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1083534/221327741-7c1e544a-cb5d-4dd6-837e-0e416d375dbe.gif)\r\n\r\nPS: It's easy to replace  `â”‚   â”‚` with tabs manually, so this issue can be a reference for other people who look for this feature.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
