Typical examples:\r\n- testEmitEvent\r\n- testRevertIfPaused\r\n\r\nWhen a test with a \"popular\" name fails, it's not immediately obvious what unit we should look at, so the next step after encountering the failure is almost always `forge test --match-test`. I would like to see the unit name in the output instead, for instance:\r\n> [FAIL. Reason: Log != expected log. Counterexample: calldata=0xe3ea2b1d0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000800000, args=[8388608]] UnitDeploySomething.testEmitEvent(int24) (runs: 10, Î¼: 89131, ~: 50072)\r\n\r\nPlease consider adding this.

Ctrl+f is not super effectie in that case because as I mentioned before, we tend to have similar names for tests that assert similar things. I hope this makes sense and sheds some light on the use case. Thanks again.",
