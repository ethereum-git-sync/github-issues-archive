    "body": "I might be misunderstanding the request here, but `ethers::utils::format_units` outputs a `string`, not a `uint`.\r\nAnd simply dividing a `uint` won't preserve decimal precision, so `0.1 ether / 1 ether` will just revert.\r\n\r\nUsing `console2` is also not ideal IMO because:\r\n1. Sometimes you wanna compose messages before logging\r\n2. `console2` only logs at the end of a script, while sometimes it's useful to write logs into a file for real-time logging\r\n3. Can't rule out the possibility it could be useful in non-logging scenarios\r\n\r\n@Sz0x I have an implementation of a `vm.formatUnits` cheatcode on my own Foundry fork. If you have your own fork as well, you can copy the implementation from my branch.\r\n\r\nAnd for Foundry team — it seems this is not something you'd want to merge but if you change your mind let me know and I'll happily open a PR :slightly_smiling_face: \r\nhttps://github.com/Tudmotu/foundry/compare/feature/vm.time...Tudmotu:foundry:feature/vm.formatUnits?expand=1",
