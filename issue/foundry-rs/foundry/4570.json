This can be mitigated by rerunning the command without the `--overwrite` flag, and then subsequent commands with the `--overwrite` flag should work here.\r\n\r\nWhat I assume is happening is that the `--overwrite` flag tries to do something like remove the files before continuing, but throws this error when a non-existent file cannot be removed.\r\n\r\nI would have guessed that the `--overwrite` would work if the generated code did not exist.",
