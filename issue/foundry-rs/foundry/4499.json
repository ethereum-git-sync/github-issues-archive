Where `deploy_addresses.json` would look like:\r\n```js\r\n{\r\ncontractDeploymentAddress: 0xfb3a......423c,\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe motivation for this for me personally is so that I can make complex deployment scripts where I can parse the address of the deployment to start calling its functions within the script without having to manually pipe output from `forge script` to a separate file and parsing it myself. \r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_",
