  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nI'd like to select contracts when running `forge build`. This would allow to apply different compiler options to different contracts. Specifically, I'd like to selectively apply `--via-ir` and `--optimization` to contracts that would benefit from this most, and I don't want to optimize test contracts. Implementing this feature would also mean that `forge test` doesn't re-compile the contracts that were compiled with different settings.\r\n\r\nWithout this feature, it's not possible to run `forge build --via-ir` in a project that has contracts compiled with an old Solc version (one that doesn't support Yul IR).\r\n\r\nAlso, it might be a good idea to add per-contract optimization settings to the TOML config.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
