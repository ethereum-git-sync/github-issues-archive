Multiple hexstrings can be concatenated with `:`\r\n- If `<data>` has no 0x prefix, read it as text\r\n\r\nInstead, we currently treat all input as text and convert it to bytes, which is incorrect. [seth](https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools/blob/1be7d796a468f52a5eb5b6830591d76a3b4b1c49/src/seth/libexec/seth/seth-keccak#L7-L10) and [ethers.js](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/) use the behavior above\r\n\r\nThis makes me concerned that there may be other commands where we don't distinguish between text vs. bytes inputs correctly, so the scope of this issue is:\r\n1. Review how that's handled for the relevant cast commands, using seth as the source of truth \r\n2. For ones that are incorrect, fix the input handing\r\n2. Whether correct or incorrect, ensure we have doctests for both text (no 0x prefix) and bytes (0x prefix)  on all relevant cast commands\r\n\r\nFor example, if we had a keccak doctest of `assert_eq!(Cast::keccak(\"0x1234\")?, \"0x56570de287d73cd1cb6092bb8fdee6173974955fdef345ae579ee9f475ea7432\");`, we would have noticed this error sooner",
