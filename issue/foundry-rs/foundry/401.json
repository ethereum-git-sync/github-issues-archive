  "body": "`forge install openzeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts` installs the master branch of the repository. We consider this a development branch, and request that people use our releases instead. On one hand it's a matter of stability because the master branch may receive breaking changes, but it's also a matter of security. Our release process involves release candidates, an open review period, and a call to participate in the bug bounty, so we discourage using code that hasn't been through this process.\r\n\r\nIdeally, for the OpenZeppelin Contracts repository, forge would fetch the tags and install the latest tag (according to semver) that is not a release candidate. This may not be a general enough solution since a git repository is not guaranteed to use tags in this way, and may even only have old tags that don't include the real latest version. There could be a flag to install the latest, but preferably this should be the default behavior for OpenZeppelin Contracts at least.",
