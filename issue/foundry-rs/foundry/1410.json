  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nA nice feature that is included in most dev tools is the generation of documentation using natspec. In the past there have been a multitude of tools that do this. OpenZeppelin has `solidity-docgen` to generate markdown form natspec solidity code and afaik this is also what `hardhat-docgen` is using.\r\n\r\nIdeally there would be a new subcommand for forge like \r\n\r\n`forge docgen` \r\n\r\nthat generates documentation from natspec to markdown (or other formats) that can be used to populate a gitbook, docs.rs, docusaurus or any other style documentation website. \r\n\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n`forge docgen --md`\r\ncould generate markdown from natspec like this:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n /**\r\n   * @dev Withdraws an `amount` of underlying asset from the reserve, burning the equivalent aTokens owned\r\n   * E.g. User has 100 aUSDC, calls withdraw() and receives 100 USDC, burning the 100 aUSDC\r\n   * @param asset The address of the underlying asset to withdraw\r\n   * @param amount The underlying amount to be withdrawn\r\n   *   - Send the value type(uint256).max in order to withdraw the whole aToken balance\r\n   * @param to Address that will receive the underlying, same as msg.sender if the user\r\n   *   wants to receive it on his own wallet, or a different address if the beneficiary is a\r\n   *   different wallet\r\n   * @return The final amount withdrawn\r\n   **/\r\n  function withdraw(\r\n    address asset,\r\n    uint256 amount,\r\n    address to\r\n  ) external returns (uint256);\r\n```\r\n\r\nto this: \r\n```md\r\n### withdraw\r\n\r\n'''solidity\r\n  function withdraw(\r\n    address asset,\r\n    uint256 amount,\r\n    address to\r\n  ) external returns (uint256);'''\r\n\r\n\r\n@notice here if there was one\r\n\r\n*@dev here: Withdraws an `amount` of underlying asset from the reserve, burning the equivalent aTokens owned\r\n   * E.g. User has 100 aUSDC, calls withdraw() and receives 100 USDC, burning the 100 aUSDC**\r\n\r\n#### Parameters\r\n\r\n| Name | Type | Description |\r\n|---|---|---|\r\n| asset | address | The address of the underlying asset to withdraw. |\r\n| amount | uint256 | The underlying amount to be withdrawn. |\r\n| to | address | Address that will receive the underlying... |\r\n\r\n#### Returns\r\n\r\n| Name | Type | Description |\r\n|---|---|---|\r\n| undefined | uint256 | The final amount withdrawn |\r\n```\r\nwhich could be used in the documentation services mentioned before.\r\n\r\nhardhat docgen gives additional options like `--output`, `--exclude` and a bunch of others which might also be useful here. \r\n\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

    "body": "There are some things I would like for a Forge documentation generator:\r\n\r\n- Structured file names and paths, like docs.rs. For example, docs for:\r\n  - Contracts would be something like `relative/path/contract.SomeContract.html`\r\n  - Structs would be `struct.SomeStruct.html`\r\n  - And so on\r\n- Support for rustdoc-style docs. Natspec is kind of annoying (imo), so it would be nice to have some sort of Rustdoc-like comment format where the first sentence is userdoc and the next sentences (after an empty line) would be devdoc or something similar\r\n- Docs for contracts, libraries, events and interfaces\r\n- \"Module-level\" docs like we have in Rust for `mod.rs` so you can create index pages\r\n- Output to HTML and Markdown\r\n- Easy linking to other parts of the code, like in Rust, where you can do e.g. [SomeStruct] and it would link to the struct if it is in scope, or [SomeInterface] and so on\r\n\r\nThis would allow us to build a docs.rs for Solidity",
