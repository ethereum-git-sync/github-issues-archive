    "body": "@QYuQianchen @rkrasiuk I have faced the same issue. In order to get `forge coverage` to work I updated the pragma in all ancient contracts from `^0.4.x` to `^0.5.0` (`WETH9` etc).\r\n\r\nNote that this requires a slight modification of the contracts, as some of the 0.4 syntax can not be used directly in 0.5. I wonder if there's a more elegant fix around.",
