Expected 2007 got 2006 from provider.\r\n\r\nThe issue seems to happen whenever we do selectFork within a script.\r\n\r\nHere i created a minimal reproduction:\r\n```solidity\r\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\r\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\r\nimport {Script} from 'forge-std/Script.sol';\r\n\r\ncontract Reproduction is Script {\r\n  function run() public {\r\n    uint256 previousFork = vm.activeFork();\r\n    vm.selectFork(previousFork);\r\n    vm.startBroadcast();\r\n    address(0x25F2226B597E8F9514B3F68F00f494cF4f286491).call{value: 1}(new bytes(0));\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe script is started with a mainnet rpc, calls selectFork witht he activeForkId which is 0 and i think should essentially just be a noop in that case?.\r\n\r\nThe trace looks as follows:\r\n```\r\nTraces:\r\n  [41465] Reproduction::run() \r\n    ├─ [0] VM::activeFork() [staticcall]\r\n    │   └─ ← 0\r\n    ├─ [0] VM::selectFork(0) \r\n    │   └─ ← ()\r\n    ├─ [0] VM::startBroadcast() \r\n    │   └─ ← ()\r\n    ├─ [7180] 0x25F2226B597E8F9514B3F68F00f494cF4f286491::fallback{value: 1}() \r\n    │   ├─ [55] 0x10c74b37Ad4541E394c607d78062e6d22D9ad632::fallback() [delegatecall]\r\n    │   │   └─ ← ()\r\n    │   └─ ← ()\r\n    └─ ← ()\r\n    \r\nScript ran successfully.\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead of being able to submit the txn though, i'm getting:\r\n```\r\n###\r\nFinding wallets for all the necessary addresses...\r\n##\r\nSending transactions [0 - 0].\r\n\r\nError: \r\nEOA nonce changed unexpectedly while sending transactions.
