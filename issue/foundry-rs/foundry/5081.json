The block's list of transactions is empty, and if I call `web3.eth.get_transaction_receipt`, I don't get a receipt.\r\n\r\nThis all was working not too long ago!\r\n\r\nHere is a repro kinda (using web3.py connected to Anvil via HTTP):\r\n\r\n```python\r\nserialized_txn = b\"...\"\r\ntxn_hash = self.web3.eth.send_raw_transaction(serialized_txn)  # Anvil gives me a hash\r\n\r\n# Wait for a while just in case (either via breakpoint or time.sleep)\r\n\r\nreceipt_data = dict(self.web3.eth.get_transaction_receipt(HexStr(txn_hash)))\r\n# ^ FAILS here with: *** web3.exceptions.TransactionNotFound: Transaction with hash: \r\n#  '0x2d7a9ecadf01e116ccfbf9421faeb5258c3528cbe5e853acf46eaad29090c7dc' not found.\r\n\r\n# Check the block maybe?\r\nblock = dict(self.web3.eth.get_block(1))\r\n# ^ returns block with NO txns.\r\n\r\n# Try repeating the steps to notice the block is indeed increasing in number each attempt at deploying, but the txn is never \r\n#  there and there is no reason as to why.\r\n```",
