  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nHere at Endaoment we leverage `forge script` for multiple processes and on-chain interactions. Given the relevance and care of what we do, it'd be great if before broadcasting the picked-up transactions from a script, forge offered an option of adding a prompt/confirmation that requires the user to see the output (if any) of the script and confirm they want to go ahead with the broadcast.\r\n\r\nI imagine this as a feature similar to `console`, whilst not being an original language construct, could be placed somewhere in code and pinpoint the spot you want the prompt/confirmation to happen.\r\nIf this proves to be too hard, a simple `\"confirm: y/n\"` after doing all the simulations would also be appreciated.\r\n\r\nHopefully this is useful for others likewise and props on this great project! ;)\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
