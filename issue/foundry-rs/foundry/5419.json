    "body": "Yeah sorry, I should have explained more. The issue is that `anvil_mine` with `interval` set performs busy waiting. It waits a given amount of seconds between subsequent block mines. Instead, it should set the next block timestamp using the same logic (or almost the same logic) as `evm_set_next_block_timestamp`.\r\n\r\nIn other words, if you call `evm_mine` with 10 blocks to mine and the interval set to 1_000 (seconds), you will wait 10 * 1_000 seconds for the request to finish.",
