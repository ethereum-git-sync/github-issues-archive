  "body": "### Component\n\nCast\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nBoth `forge build` and `forge test` internally call `forge install` if they detect that the dependencies aren't checked out. `cast create` on the other hand doesn't seem to do that, it requires manually running `forge install` or it fails. This makes writing scripts trickier, because the script dev will probably have the project fully installed, but the script operator may have a fresh clone without dependencies fetched, so the script will fail.\r\n\r\nIt'd be great if `cast create` internally called `forge install`.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
