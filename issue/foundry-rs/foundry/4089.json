  "body": "### Component\r\n\r\nForge\r\n\r\n### Describe the feature you would like\r\n\r\nSometimes I set the fuzz runs to a high limit and let it run for a while. It would be nice to not have all the fuzz effort wasted and be able to see the output of a longer run, if I accidentally set the fuzz runs too high. Currently when aborting via `CMD + C` the terminal just exits.\r\n\r\nAlways displaying all the information could be a bit annoying however, so ideally foundry would know to display the results regardless of the abort if say, over a 30 seconds have passed since fuzzing.\r\n\r\nRelated:\r\n- #990\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_",
