However I feel like it is hard to be very confident about it without knowing exactly what happened during a run. Right now the output prints runs, calls and reverts. If the distribution is similar across all function calls than that would give me more confidence then if one function only reverted and wasn't part of the simulation through a successful execution at all.\r\n\r\nAn output with calls + reverts per function would be very helpful\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
