The challenge's resolution necessitates the execution of specific transactions depending on the block's hash. \r\nRight now, I've given up on using a loop to resolve the challenge as this won't work since the block.number is not changing which causes the transaction to revert. I've now adopted the strategy of manually executing the script provided below ten times:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nvm.startBroadcast(deployerKey);\r\nuint256 blockValue;\r\nuint256 coinFlip;\r\nblockValue = uint256(blockhash(block.number - 1));\r\ncoinFlip = blockValue / 57896044618658097711785492504343953926634992332820282019728792003956564819968;\r\nrequire(CoinFlip(instance).flip(coinFlip == 1), \"guess failed\");\r\nconsole.log(\"Consecutive wins : \", CoinFlip(instance).consecutiveWins());\r\nvm.stopBroadcast();\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, I've noticed that a discrepancy has emerged between the simulation logs and the actual on-chain results:\r\n```plaintext\r\n[29877] CoinFlip::flip(true) \r\n    │   └─ ← true\r\n    ├─ [295] CoinFlip::consecutiveWins() [staticcall]\r\n    │   └─ ← 1\r\n    ├─ [0] console::f5b1bba9(0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001) [staticcall]\r\n    │   └─ ← ()\r\n    ├─ [295] CoinFlip::consecutiveWins() [staticcall]\r\n    │   └─ ← 1\r\n    ├─ [0] VM::stopBroadcast() \r\n    │   └─ ← ()\r\n    └─ ← ()\r\nScript ran successfully.\r\n\r\n== Logs ==\r\n  Using same instance\r\n  Consecutive wins : 1\r\n\r\nSKIPPING ON CHAIN SIMULATION.\r\n\r\n###\r\nFinding wallets for all the necessary addresses...\r\n##\r\nSending transactions [0 - 0].\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe logs say that consecutive wins = 1 but on sepolia.etherscan it says 0 (which mean the guess was wrong):\r\n![](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/assets/118286466/2a82d41b-bf25-4019-b275-c44f80678fd0)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis doesn't always happen, but still do often.\r\n\r\nHere's my guess, I believe that foundry fails to simulate block.number. Reasons :\r\n1. When executing the exact same piece of code on remix, everything works as expected.\r\n2. When executing the script in foundry in --slow slow mode, the result will be different from the actual chain results 100% of the time.\r\n\r\n## Desired Feature\r\nA tool or feature that accurately simulates the mining of a new block in Foundry, or ensuring that the --slow mode genuinely and consistently simulates increments in block.number.",
