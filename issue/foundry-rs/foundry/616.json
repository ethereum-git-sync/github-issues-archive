    "body": "that would make sense to store the releases, rn we query the endpoint to get all hashes for the checksum, \r\n\r\nthe 3 seconds turned out to be too optimistic, but I already added an offline mode in the solc rewrite, so this timeout will be phased out and could be replaced with a `~/.foundry/cache/solc-releases` lookup.\r\n\r\nHowever this is now a bit unsound if we're checking foundry paths from ethers-solc, which I guess is fine.",

    "body": "Would be amazing to add an offline mode. I feel that it's a bit of an anti-pattern to require internet access to run a compile step. Another case this may be problematic is if there is a build step behind an VPS firewall. Caching this or keeping it in a package / config would be great.\r\n\r\nIt looks like running with `--no-auto-detect` fixes the signature failure I'm getting when I attempt to run offline.",

Ideally, we want to make this offline first.\r\nthese are all ethers-rs issues and tracked there https://github.com/gakonst/ethers-rs/\r\n\r\n",
