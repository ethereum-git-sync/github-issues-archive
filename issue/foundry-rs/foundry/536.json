This means `mockCall` and `expectCall` work on for methods invoked via calls, not jumps. Having those methods behave the same regardless of how the function was invoked would be very helpful, and would result in less unexpected behavior (e.g. I mock response to `A.foo()` and now get hard to debug test failures because `A.foo()` gives different responses when called by `A` vs `B`\r\n- RPC functionality is a big one https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/pull/174\r\n",
