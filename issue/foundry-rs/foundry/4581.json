Something that looks like `vm.txGasPrice(...)` and sets the `tx.gasprice` of the next transaction would be great.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nHave some code that compensates an off-chain relayer by tracking gas used then compensating the relayer with `gasUsed * tx.gasprice`. Currently unable to set `tx.gasprice` and the default value is 0.",
