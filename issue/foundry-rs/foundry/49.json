  "body": "We use [svm-rs](https://github.com/roynalnaruto/svm-rs) by @roynalnaruto, which is used for managing the global `solc` binary's version, by installing each version under `~/.svm/4version/solc-$version`. For some reason, when running on CI the installation process seems to be flaky, e.g. below:\r\n\r\n![telegram-cloud-photo-size-2-5366071301866894295-y](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17802178/134912737-ae1f3389-ec6a-49b0-b279-aecbf587ae7a.jpg)\r\n\r\nWe should fix that. Maybe there's a bug downstream in `svm-rs` (e.g. there should be some sort of global mutex that says \"hey a solc version is being installed right now, wait for it to unlock before you try running solc\"\r\n\r\nI tried doing that manually with the [lock inside solc/lib.rs](https://github.com/gakonst/dapptools-rs/blob/master/solc/src/lib.rs#L118-L120) but it was not enough apparently.",
