  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\n`forge script` waits 7 seconds by default before asking for transaction receipts. It is not a good initial value for running tests since a local anvil node will be able to respond right away.\r\n\r\nAdding `--delay` parameter would do the trick. I was told that by default the delay is 100ms when the node is `localhost`, which I think comes from [these lines in anvil/src/lib.rs](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/8016f26e160cb574c8c4f6e97d76e1386f956902/cli/src/utils.rs#L211-L213). But what I'm talking about seems more related to the definition of [PendingTransaction](https://github.com/gakonst/ethers-rs/blob/master/ethers-providers/src/pending_transaction.rs#L73) and [DEFAULT_POLL_INTERVAL](https://github.com/gakonst/ethers-rs/blob/master/ethers-providers/src/stream.rs#L29). I don't know Rust at all though so I may be totally off. \r\n\r\nAn alternative solution would be to effectively implement the \"100ms delay in forge script for localhost\" rule.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
