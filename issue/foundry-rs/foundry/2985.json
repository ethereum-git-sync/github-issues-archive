Logging all sequences for all runs to a file with `vm.writeLine()`\r\n2. Skipping checks on `depth=0`, i.e. skip the \"invariant must hold at the start\" check. The use case here is testing that a variable monotonically increases and before any calls are made, since at the start \"last value\" and \"current value\" are the same.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
