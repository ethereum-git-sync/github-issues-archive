    "body": "This is very likely related to refunds. The numbers in the trace (bottom red circle) are raw gas values, and the top red circle includes refunds. The top red circle does not include the 21k + calldata gas, and it seems neither does the trace.\r\n\r\nThere is a chance refunds are not being applied correctly, see [EIP-3529](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3529) for details on how it should now work. So I can imagine a situation where we are (1) applying too many refunds, and (2) subtracting away the intrinsic gas cost, resulting in a zero value being shown",
