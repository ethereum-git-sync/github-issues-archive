    "body": "This is because of how certain distributions of Mac OS work with `bash`. Every terminal opened on mac is an interactive \"login\" shell. This means `.bash_profile` is run on every new terminal session (on other distributions, profile settings are loaded at first login only). Bash has an idiosyncrasy where it won't run `.bashrc` on login shells automatically, so you have to run it yourself.\r\n\r\nIssue is not unique to foundry. I would suggest modifying your `.bash_profile` to load `.bashrc`. Or consider other shells :)  This [stack exchange](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/119627/why-are-interactive-shells-on-osx-login-shells-by-default) goes into much more detail on the behavior. It is definitely weird.",
