  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Have you ensured that all of these are up to date?\n\n- [X] Foundry\n- [ ] Foundryup\n\n### What version of Foundry are you on?\n\nforge 0.2.0 (9b0575e 2022-08-04T00:04:01.463358166Z)\n\n### What command(s) is the bug in?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Operating System\n\nLinux\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nIt is my understanding that `vm.rollFork(N)` should change the current fork to block numbrt `N`. However, this does not seem to be the case because `vm.rollFork(N)` does not affect any RPC calls, and instead seems to behave the same as `vm.roll(N)`.\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nfunction testRollFork() public {\r\n\tuint256 fork = vm.createFork(MAINNET_RPC_ENDPOINT, 10);\r\n\tvm.selectFork(fork);\r\n\r\n\tassertEq(block.number, 10);\r\n\tassertEq(block.timestamp, 1438270128);\r\n\r\n\tvm.rollFork(11);\r\n\r\n\tassertEq(block.number, 11); // Works as expected\r\n\tassertEq(block.timestamp, 1438270136); // Fails because block.timestamp is still 1438270128 as before\r\n}\r\n```\r\nHere, `vm.rollFork(11)` has no effect on either `block.timestamp` or any RPC calls. The test succeeds if instead of calling `vm.rollFork(N)`, a new fork is selected that was created for block number 11.\r\n",
