  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nCurrently, Foundry test can access most traces of call execution, via `startStateDiffRecording()`, \r\nwhich eventually returns an array `AccountAccess[]`, with account references and storage access.\r\nHowever, the one thing that is not returned is the actual executed bytecodes.\r\n\r\nThis is something that we do need for [erc4337](https://ercs.ethereum.org/ERCS/erc-4337) implementation\r\n(in short: smart wallet contracts must perform validation while avoiding some code patterns. We have enough information for validation storage access, but we also need to verify opcode usage.\r\n\r\n### Suggestion.\r\nInstead of overloading the returned struct of `stopAndReturnStateDiff()`, we can add a new method \r\n```\r\nfunction getStateDiffOpcodes(uint index) returns (OpcodeAccess[] memory)\r\n```\r\nThe \"index\" parameter is the same index into the array returned by: `stopAndReturnStateDiff()`\r\nThat is, for each `AccountAccess` entry, we return a array of opcodes\r\n\r\n```\r\nstruct OpcodeAccess {\r\n  uint8 opcode;\r\n  uint pc;\r\n  uint gasCost;\r\n  uint gas;\r\n  uint depth;\r\n}\r\n```\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
