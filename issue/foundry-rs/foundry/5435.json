In the current nightly (0e72b71), I can do the following:\r\n\r\n> foundryup --commit 0e72b71\r\n> forge init\r\n> forge script --debug script/Counter.s.sol\r\n> \r\n\r\n..and where the source should be, it says \"Unknown contract at address 0x5b73...0519\"\r\n\r\nEarlier versions, for example 288ab2e from about 2 week ago, correctly show and step through the source.\r\n\r\nAlso, I have not been able to get any recent versions to show source code when stepping into on-chain contracts, even though I've set my ETHERSCAN_API_KEY in env and toml.\r\n",
