  "body": "### Component\n\nAnvil\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\n[`debug_traceCall`](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/rpc/ns-debug#debug_tracecall) is useful for getting a structured execution trace of `eth_call`, specifically when it comes to tx simulation. Unique challenges include the ability to enable users to leverage [custom tracers written in js](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/rpc/ns-debug#javascript-based-tracing) and state/block overrides, the latter of which is not present in `debug_traceTransaction`.  \n\n### Additional context\n\nI'm currently using a custom JS tracer, mostly to format data prior to a response as opposed to doing fancy stuff across multiple opcodes, but not leveraging state/block overrides.\r\n\r\nNot sure how many others would benefit from this feature. hardhat does not yet support `debug_traceCall` either, but does have support for `debug_traceTransaction`. I'm aware of #1737 but figured I'd put this out there as well. \r\n\r\nIf this isn't prioritized, an alternative could be to run geth in clique mode with a custom `genesis.json` and then execute traces accordingly (h/t @tynes for the idea)",
