So I have to add an `_ || true` to the `RUN` line which means I'll be ignoring real errors (I'm setting up the environment on the next line anyway).\r\n- [ ] Not many versions of `foundry` are being tagged, which means that pegging a specific version on CI will be difficult, which makes our development process more painful.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2022-07-13 20-07-42](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12721972/178882538-8755b5a8-a8a8-48f6-977d-6ef77757ec37.png)\r\n",
