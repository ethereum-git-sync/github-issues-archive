    "body": "@mds1 consider the following command:\r\n```console\r\n$ python -c 'import random; print(random.randomint(0, 200))'\r\n```\r\nThis will print a random number between 0 and 200.\r\nIt can be 1 character (0-9), 2 characters (10-99) or 3 characters (100-199).\r\n\r\nIf it returns a 2-character number, e.g. 42, `ffi` would decode it as a hex value, returning `hex\"42\"` as a result.\r\nIf it returns a 1/3-character number, e.g. 123, `ffi` would fail to decode it as a hex value, and will return `hex\"313233\"`, which is ASCII for \"123\". The decoding fails because a hex number has to have an even number of nibbles.\r\n\r\nNow if you try to `string(...)` it, you will get two very different results:\r\n1. `string(hex\"42\") == \"B\"`\r\n2. `string(hex\"313233\") == \"123\"`\r\n\r\nHere is a simple example test:\r\n```solidity\r\npragma solidity ^0.8.13;\r\n\r\nimport { Test, console2 } from 'forge-std/Test.sol';\r\n\r\ncontract FfiTest is Test {\r\n    function test_ffi () public {\r\n        string[] memory args = new string[](2);\r\n        args[0] = 'echo';\r\n        args[1] = '42';\r\n        bytes memory res1 = vm.ffi(args);\r\n        args[1] = '123';\r\n        bytes memory res2 = vm.ffi(args);\r\n\r\n        console2.log(string(res1));\r\n        console2.log(string(res2));\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n``` \r\n\r\nThe results:\r\n![image](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/assets/506487/5d234611-b01c-48bc-b495-fce3beefdb25)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe `autohex` flag I added simply skips the decoding attempt altogether and returns an ASCII string (encoded as `bytes`).\r\n\r\nEdit: to make it clear why this is problematic, consider that if you want to use the return value from the `python -c` command as `uint`, you'd try to call `vm.parseUint(string(vm.ffi(...)))`. But this would fail randomly (e.g. \"B\" will cause a revert).",
