When I opened the lcov report and read through which lines it was saying I had covered, I knew it something was wrong because there were some function considered covered despite me never writing a test for it. \r\n\r\nI commented out all my tests expect one function call to see if it still gave my 100% line and function coverage and it did. For some reason, one call to a contract gives me full Line, Function, and Statements coverage. However, the branch coverage result seems to be accurate. ",
