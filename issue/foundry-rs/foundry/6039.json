Not sure how or why, but we relied on the Oct 2nd release, which is still up, with hash `e0722a10b45859892ec3b998df958a9edc77c202`. Now when I go to that release it's the same, but targets hash `5be158ba6dc7c798a6f032026fe60fc01686b33b`.\r\n\r\nIs there any way, before the proper versioning starts, to use Foundry with static versions?\r\n\r\nref #3895 cc @gakonst @3ldarin\r\n",
