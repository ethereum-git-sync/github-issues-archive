It's a subtle cause for failing tests, which can result in long-winded debugging sessions.\r\n2. For complex code bases with many test contracts, it is frustrating to have to ensure that certain dummy contracts are never considered for reverts. The refactors required to skirt around this limitation can be non-trivial.",
