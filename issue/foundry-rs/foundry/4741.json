Many individuals have been\r\naffected, causing significant distress and financial loss. ETH and USDC recovery rates are\r\nlow at only about 4% and 14% respectively, which is unacceptable.\r\nNomad has a duty to address this situation and find a solution to compensate users. We believe\r\nthat the company should use its treasury to provide compensation to users. While this may not\r\nbe an ideal solution for Nomad, it is the right thing to do to demonstrate the company's\r\ncommitment to addressing the issue.\r\nWe also recognize that professional investors and partners have direct access to Nomad\r\nteam and hold a significant portion of the assets lost in the hack. These victims should be\r\ntreated differently, and claims should be converted into equity, rather than receiving external\r\ncompensation. This approach will ensure that the majority of the funds are directed towards\r\nindividual users who lacked professional tools, knowledge, and access to Nomad's team.\r\nCommunity working on simulations has developed plans to raise recovery rates of each coin to\r\napproximately 60% on 40% of victims. This would require approximately $30 million,\r\nwhich would serve as the first compensation. Nomad already raised $22.4M last year. We\r\nrequest that Nomad provide a timeline for when users/depositors can expect to receive\r\ncompensation, to alleviate uncertainty and fear that users are currently experiencing. Strong\r\nbackers of the company, including Polygon, Circle, OpenSea, Coinbase, and Polychain,\r\nwould be valuable in finding a solution to the current situation and ensuring that users\r\nreceive the compensation they deserve.\r\nIf Nomad decides not to pursue bankruptcy proceedings, then the same principle should\r\napply. As Nomad users are considered depositors, they should have preferential access to\r\nliquidation of any Nomad assets and treasury funds.\r\nWe anticipate your prompt response to address the concerns raised in this letter.\r\nSincerely,\r\nNomad victims and crypto community.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
