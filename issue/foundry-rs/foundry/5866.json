  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nThere are various requests and use cases for adding support for custom sections to `foundry.toml`:\r\n- [scopelint](https://github.com/ScopeLift/scopelint) is a tool for linting forge projects. Instead of having it's own config file, it would be nice to just let users define the settings directly in the forge config file\r\n- In https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/4808, there's requests to support parsing the config file so it can be extended to contain settings for [forge deploy](https://github.com/wighawag/forge-deploy) or Noir circuits\r\n\r\nCurrently, you can add a custom section to the config file, but it will trigger a warning:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ forge test\r\nwarning: Unknown section [scopelint] found in foundry.toml. This notation for profiles has been deprecated and may result in the profile not being registered in future versions. Please use [profile.scopelint] instead or run `forge config --fix`.\r\n```\r\n\r\nTherefore, I'd suggest requiring that unknown sections are prefixed with something like `external.`, which makes it clear they are for other tools that extend foundry and we'd suppress the warning for those sections.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```toml\r\n# Default foundry configuration\r\n[profile.default]\r\noptimizer = false\r\n\r\n[profile.ci]\r\noptimizer = true\r\n\r\n# Custom sections for other tools\r\n[external.scopelint]\r\nsome_flag = 1\r\n\r\n[external.forge_deploy]\r\nanother_setting = 123\r\n```\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
