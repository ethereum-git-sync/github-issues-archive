  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nI think a good feature to add to the debugger would be to see the optimized yul output if your file was compiled with `--via-ir` option.  \r\nThis is useful when you want a better view of what the compiler is doing to your code.\r\nMy preferred UI would have you able to swap between yul and solidity, like how dapptools' debugger lets you swap between the call trace view and the memory view.\r\nIf this is hard to implement then it could be a command line option, and yul would display *instead* of solidity.  \n\n### Additional context\n\nAssuming the solidity compiler is consistent, the implementation could follow these steps:\r\n\r\n1. Compile solidity `--via ir` which generates a `solidity --> bytecode` sourcemap\r\n2. Compile the generated yul which will output a `yul --> bytecode` sourcemap.   \r\n\r\n#759 is worth mentioning because yul compilation is required to do those steps.",
