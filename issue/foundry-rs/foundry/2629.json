    "body": "thanks for this, was able to discover the bug.\r\n\r\njuggling different evm states at a time is a bit complex.\r\n\r\nThe way this works with https://github.com/bluealloy/revm is, that there's a `Subroutine` that holds the \"hot\" accounts loaded from the underlying `Database` that feeds the Account/State data to the subroutine so it can apply changes to the state while the evm executes.\r\nIn a way the `Subroutine` is something like a cache that\r\n1. check if account is already loaded (hot)\r\n2. if not load from the `Datbase` (this will then retrieve the account via RPC in forking mode)\r\n\r\nwhen we created a fork, we only replaced the  `Database` object, so if the account was loaded (`1.`) previously, then wouldn't reach `2.` and the state is not updated on this new fork.\r\n\r\nthe fix is to adjust the `SubRoutine` when creating a fork.",
