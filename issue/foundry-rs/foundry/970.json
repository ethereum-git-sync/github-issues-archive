  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nForge implicitly assumes the configured `test` path is a subdirectory of the configured `src` path. It would be helpful if it supported any directory in the project path.\r\n\r\nI'm introducing forge and ds-test to a Hardhat project with an existing test suite, and I'd like to keep all the tests in one place. The Hardhat convention is a top level `/test` directory. \n\n### Additional context\n\nHere's a [minimal example](https://github.com/ecmendenhall/foundry-test-path). This is an out of the box Hardhat project, plus `foundry.toml` and two DSTest examples. ",
