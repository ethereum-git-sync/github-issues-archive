  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Have you ensured that all of these are up to date?\n\n- [X] Foundry\n- [X] Foundryup\n\n### What version of Foundry are you on?\n\nforge 0.2.0 (f21a775 2022-04-20T00:07:28.177553+00:00)\n\n### What command(s) is the bug in?\n\nforge test --gas-report -vvv\n\n### Operating System\n\nmacOS (Apple Silicon)\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nOccasionally `forge test` won't run my test files. 2 cases:\r\n\r\nCase 1) I haven't made any change to my contracts nor test file and I run `forge test --gas-report -vvv`. Occasionally no tests will be run and no gas reports outputted.\r\n\r\nCase 2) I have made a change to my contracts but not my test files. Same results as above, no tests run and no gas report produced.\r\n\r\nWe believe it is a cacheing bug as `forge clean && forge test` will run the whole test suite and output the proper logs. \r\n\r\nReproduction: Unfortunately this happens at random and I am not able to repro it on a consistent basis. This project is a typical `forge init` project. \r\n\r\nOther ppl have seem to run into similar issues https://twitter.com/0x_Beans/status/1525694826024296448?s=20&t=kDRzz8VahzMrLUxwUh3hqA\r\n\r\nSeverity: 2/5 - Whenever this happens, I simply run `forge clean` to fix this issue. However, it is somewhat cumbersome and annoying to do this and there is additional burden during tests because I have to think \"is this actually running my changes or cached versions?\". So I am running `forge clean` a lot more since Im paranoid. ",
