See also https://github.com/juanfranblanco/vscode-solidity/issues/335\r\n\r\nI have a monorepo that looks something like\r\n```\r\n.vscode/\r\npackages/\r\n    app/\r\n        ...\r\n    contracts/\r\n        lib/\r\n        src/\r\n        foundry.toml\r\n        remappings.txt\r\n```\r\nwhere `packages/contracts/` is a forge project.\r\n\r\nIf I open VSCode to that directory, my Solidity imports resolve just fine. If I open VSCode to the monorepo/workspace root, VSCode can't find the Solidity imports, even though I have `remappings.txt` set up and Solidity plugin pointing at it.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/508855/165661022-72e71350-83e4-46b0-9a85-65598e163f7a.png)\r\n\r\nI can set up a repo to reproduce this issue if helpful!\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
