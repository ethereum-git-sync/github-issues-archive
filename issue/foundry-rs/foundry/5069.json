  "body": "### Component\n\nForge, Cast\n\n### Have you ensured that all of these are up to date?\n\n- [X] Foundry\n- [X] Foundryup\n\n### What version of Foundry are you on?\n\nforge 0.2.0 (50756e5 2023-05-29T00:04:27.574210907Z)\n\n### What command(s) is the bug in?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Operating System\n\nLinux\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nMany commands require passing data of arbitrary size as program args:\r\n\r\n- cast abi-encode\r\n- cast access-list\r\n- cast call\r\n- cast calldata\r\n- cast disassemble\r\n- cast estimate\r\n- cast pretty-calldata\r\n- cast publish\r\n- cast rpc\r\n- cast send\r\n- cast wallet sign\r\n- forge create\r\n- forge script\r\n\r\nUsually these are Solidity function arguments, but sometimes these are raw transaction payloads or RPC JSONs. The problem is that Linux (other OS-es probably too) puts a hard limit on the size of the program args, throwing `Argument list too long` if violated. For regular kernel builds it's just 128KB per arg, which for hex-encoded data halves the limit to just 64KB, it's very easy to hit it and there's no workaround. \r\n\r\nThere are a few approaches for passing arbitrarily-sized args without limitations:\r\n- Stdin. Convenient to use, has no size limitations, but it'd put a hard limit of a single arbitrarily-sized arg per command, e.g. it may be tricky to support the interactive wallet.\r\n- Files.  Not very convenient to use, has no size limitations, wouldn't collide with any parameters. \r\n- Enviroment variables. Rather convenient to use, but does have some OS-dependent limitations, wouldn't collide with any parameters.\r\n\r\nAny of these solutions would need to work along the regular passing by args to keep the backward compatibility.",
