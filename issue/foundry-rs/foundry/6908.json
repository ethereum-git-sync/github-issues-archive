  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nIn solc version 0.8.24, [transactions compose differently than message calls](https://soliditylang.org/blog/2024/01/26/transient-storage/). While adding support for solc 0.8.24 (issue #6903) I think that it will be useful with a cheat code to clear the transient storage, so that we can model transactions with message calls.\r\n\r\nFor example a cheat code `function clearTransientStorage(address)` to zero the transient storage. This cheat code can be used to model a transaction `a.f(x)` with\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nvm.clearTransientStorage(address(a));\r\na.f(x);\r\nvm.clearTransientStorage(address(a));\r\n```\r\n\r\nand transaction composition of `a.f(x)` and `a.g(y)` can be modeled with\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nvm.clearTransientStorage(address(a));\r\na.f(x);\r\nvm.clearTransientStorage(address(a));\r\na.g(y);\r\nvm.clearTransientStorage(address(a));\r\n```\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
