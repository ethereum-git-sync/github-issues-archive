It would be nice so that me and other aarch64 Linux users won't need to rebuild from sources each time.\r\n\r\nIt should be just adding a few lines to [`release.yml`](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/blob/63644de7dccb05a42f04f2829fd4007049607788/.github/workflows/release.yml).\r\n\r\nThanks!\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

I decided to keep it simple and store binaries in the repo instead of Releases and uploaded `v0.8.*`, `v0.7.*`, `v0.6.*`, and some of `v0.5.*` binaries. I have experienced issues building `v0.4.*` and some of `v0.5.*` binaries. I'm gonna dig into it later.\r\n\r\nDoes the repo structure looks good for you? Any other comments?",

I wish to make an addition to your `solc` repository to add a `list.json` of all the binaries (for Linux Aarch64) and the tags that were used and an SHA256 checksum of the binary. Something similar to this:\r\nhttps://binaries.soliditylang.org/macosx-amd64/list.json\r\n\r\nI cannot see the `tag` value you used to build and publish the existing binaries, could you help me out with that?\r\n\r\nI'll wrap up the rest of the changes required and file a PR to your repo by tmrw :)",
