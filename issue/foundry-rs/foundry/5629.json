    "body": "Alright, two observations after some debugging: It only happens using the `ci` profile, even if I use the same configurations as in the `default` profile (the default profile always runs successfully). My `foundry.toml` is:\r\n\r\n```\r\n## defaults for all profiles\r\n[profile.default]\r\nsrc = 'src'                                                 # the source directory\r\ntest = 'test'                                               # the test directory\r\nout = 'out'                                                 # the output directory (for artifacts)\r\nlibs = ['lib']                                              # a list of library directories\r\ncache = true                                                # cache the builds\r\ncache_path = 'cache'                                        # where the cache is stored\r\nsolc_version = '0.8.21'                                     # override for the solc version\r\nevm_version = 'paris'                                       # set the EVM target version (prevent using the `PUSH0` opcode)\r\noptimizer = true                                            # enable the solc optimiser\r\noptimizer_runs = 999999                                     # the number of optimiser runs\r\nverbosity = 3                                               # the verbosity of tests\r\nfs_permissions = [{ access = \"read-write\", path = \"./\"}]    # set read-write access to project root\r\n\r\n## default overrides for the CI runs\r\n[profile.ci]\r\nforce = true                                                # always perform a clean build\r\nfuzz = { runs = 10_000 }                                    # increase the number of fuzz runs\r\nverbosity = 4                                               # increase the verbosity of tests\r\n```\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I found that the error is triggered by the following test:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nfunction testDeployCreateRevertNonPayable() public {\r\n    vm.expectRevert({revertData: abi.encodeWithSelector(CreateX.FailedContractCreation.selector, createXAddr)});\r\n    createX.deployCreate({initCode: hex\"01\"});\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I replace `hex\"01\"` with `abi.encode(hex\"01\")` it will run successfully (if I use `abi.encodePacked` instead it will revert; the function `deployCreate` uses `bytes` as input for the argument, which is the init code). So two questions @Evalir: why is this throwing only if I use the `ci` profile and why is there an issue with the `hex`/`abi.encodePacked` instruction?",
