Latest block number is always used when sending RPC requests to pulling related information for local fork.\r\n\r\nThis bug is confirmed by running the command with `RUST_LOG=trace` to see the requests sent to RPC provider. \r\n\r\nLooking into the code, when preparing evm config for the local fork. The `block` parameter passing from the cli is not used. So the local fork is either taking the `fork_block_number` from `foundry.toml` or leave it to be `latest`.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/67ab8704476d55e47545cf6217e236553c427a80/crates/cast/bin/cmd/call.rs#L181-L188\r\n\r\n**A possible solution** would be setting the `evm_opts.fork_block_number`, which is a `Option<u64>`, to the block number passing from the cli. \r\n\r\nI can make the change to fix this. But I'm stuck at how to convert a block hash into block number because the `block` parameter also accept block hash as input.  Lack of the understanding over the whole project, I don't know where to get a `provider` to get block by hash and extract the number. Of course, I can dig more to find a decent way to new a provider but it would be great if you guys have a quick answer for me so I can quickly make the fix.",
