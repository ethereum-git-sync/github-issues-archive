This is causing a problem including and not limited to when looking at the debug summary generating more information than necessary.\r\n\r\nan optional exclusion for libraries should also be included since some functions in a library wont be used and some branches, statements and lines won't ever be hit since the code is written to prevent hitting those conditions.\r\n\r\nthis would make it easier  to debug contracts and add more tests that should be added without any unnecessary data being added\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
