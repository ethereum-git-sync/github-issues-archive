Note the `test_successful_transfer` test, all that is needed to violate the invariant is to chain these two call:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        // must pass the current owner as the first arg\r\n        handler.transferOwnership(owner, newOwner);\r\n\r\n        // must pass the same newOwner as in the previous call\r\n        handler.acceptOwnership(newOwner);\r\n```\r\n \r\nHowever:\r\n- running `forge test --mc TwoStepOwnershipTest` yields no violation\r\n- same thing with 10k fuzz runs\r\n- tried with 100k fuzz runs but I ended up killing forge after 20 min\r\n\r\ncc @horsefacts who helped investigate (https://twitter.com/eth_call/status/1704304001292914782)\r\ncc @mds1 who asked for the issue",
