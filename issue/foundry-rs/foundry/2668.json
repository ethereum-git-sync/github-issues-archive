    "body": "Apologies my adhd got the best of me. \r\n\r\n> If there is a contract in that file that does not have a `test` function it will be considered a fixture and have a coverage report. If we just ignore all files in folders named `test` or `Utilities.t.sol` we would not be able to generate coverage reports for projects that build libraries (e.g. Solmate) since most of the functionality is tested using mocks.\r\n\r\nUnderstood\r\n\r\n> Does your project produce source trees with two different versions? I.e. one version uses Solc 0.7, one version uses Solc 0.8? In that case, this is expected, but we should probably mark that that is the reason\r\n Not my sources, but forge-std uses 0.7 to 0.9 . All my contracts expect 0.8.15\r\n\r\n> Can you elaborate what you mean by \"boilerplate code\"? If the contract is inherited, it will also generate a coverage report.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tests only contain signatures for now and are empty.\r\n\r\n```\r\n function test_Sell() public {}\r\n\r\n    function test_Buy() public {}\r\n\r\n    function test_CreateAuction() public {}\r\n\r\n    function test_Bid() public {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this , I get 100 % coverage for Marketplace.sol\r\n",

    "body": "@Genysys After #2927 the report looks reasonable to me on the branch you linked in https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/2668#issuecomment-1215692287. Remember to set the fork url for coverage too.\r\n\r\nThis is what I did:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ forge coverage -f $ETH_RPC_URL\r\n+------------------------------------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+----------------+\r\n| File                                     | % Lines         | % Statements    | % Branches      | % Funcs        |\r\n+=================================================================================================================+\r\n| contracts/src/LandBank.sol               | 0.00% (0/4)     | 0.00% (0/4)     | 0.00% (0/4)     | 0.00% (0/2)    |\r\n|------------------------------------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+----------------|\r\n| contracts/src/LandNFT.sol                | 77.27% (68/88)  | 79.21% (80/101) | 57.89% (22/38)  | 81.82% (9/11)  |\r\n|------------------------------------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+----------------|\r\n| contracts/src/Marketplace.sol            | 4.72% (5/106)   | 3.91% (5/128)   | 5.41% (4/74)    | 8.33% (1/12)   |\r\n|------------------------------------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+----------------|\r\n| contracts/src/test/utils/Utilities.t.sol | 0.00% (0/11)    | 0.00% (0/17)    | 100.00% (0/0)   | 0.00% (0/3)    |\r\n|------------------------------------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+----------------|\r\n| Total                                    | 34.93% (73/209) | 34.00% (85/250) | 22.41% (26/116) | 35.71% (10/28) |\r\n+------------------------------------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+----------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n`ETH_RPC_URL` is a mainnet node, and one of the tests are failing. Unsure if it is supposed to be a mainnet node or not.\r\n\r\nGenerating an LCOV report and opening it:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ forge coverage -f $ETH_RPC_URL --report lcov\r\n$ genhtml lcov.info -o report --branch-coverage \r\n$ open report/index.html\r\n```\r\n\r\nShows me that the only uncovered functions (for LandNFT) are `setDevFund` and `tokenURI` which I could not find tests for. There are some uncovered branches, and the ones I've checked so far seem to line up with missing tests.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, for `Marketplace.sol` it seems that the only covered function is `setLandBank` which lines up with the tests.\r\n\r\nLet me know if the report still looks wonky after the nightly tonight!",
