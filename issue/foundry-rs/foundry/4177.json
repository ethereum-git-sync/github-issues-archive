  "body": "### Component\n\nForge, Cast\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nI'm in the process of deprecating the closed-source services I'm hosting and moving them to an open-source brand. The first thing to go is [sig.eth](https://sig.eth.samczsun.com), which is now located [here](https://openchain.xyz/signatures). The [documentation](https://docs.openchain.xyz/) also got an overhaul.\r\n\r\nThere are two paths forward here:\r\n1. Update `forge` and `cast` to use the new API to query data online (the API changed slightly: lookups and searches are two distinct endpoints and importing only supports raw data now, both should be fairly easy to support)\r\n2. Update `forge` and `cast` to download the database export and query offline (the export is refreshed every 24 hours)\r\n\r\nOption 2 may be better for performance and privacy (see #3909) but option 1 will be more up-to-date.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
