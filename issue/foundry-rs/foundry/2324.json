    "body": "Unsure about this one, as I see it we would clutter Anvil by depending on more Forge stuff to save 1 command. I'm not entirely following the cheatcode usage point - scripts are not supposed to broadcast cheatcodes under any circumstance, and having a situation where that would be the case is a bit weird? At least, from my perspective, it would make it harder to reason about scripts since you would essentially have two separate environments with their own behaviors",
