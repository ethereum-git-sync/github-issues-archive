  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nIn foundry, we use the `invariant` keyword to describe \"stateful fuzzing\" which is where the final state of a previous fuzz run is the starting state to the next fuzz run. Using the word `invariant` is confusing terminology, because technically even \"regular\" fuzz runs are technically invariant tests. \r\n\r\nAn \"invariant\" is just a property of a system that always must hold true. Even regular fuzz tests meet that definition. \r\n\r\nThis has been brought up before like here: https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/4162.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Additional context\n\nI propose having an alternative name like `statefulFuzz` or `sFuzz`. Like so:\r\n\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// // instead of `invariant`\r\n// function invariant_myTest() public {\r\n//   // code\r\n// }\r\n\r\n// use `statefulFuzz`\r\nfunction statefulFuzz_myTest() public {\r\n// code\r\n}\r\n```",
