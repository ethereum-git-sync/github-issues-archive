This means that the user who forgets to set it to a different value usually gets no error and no output, and doesn't understand why. The default isn't mentioned in the `--help`, and the user needs to read the JSON RPC documentation to figure out the default.\r\n\r\nAt the very least the `--help` should list all the defaults coming from the JSON RPC specification. Ideally the user should be presented with the information about the range of the blocks that are queried. Alternatively the default could be set to `earliest`, because `latest` is very rarely what the user needs. ",
