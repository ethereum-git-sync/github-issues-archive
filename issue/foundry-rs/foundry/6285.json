But I am unable to do so as the the fork command has renderedmy terminal unresponsive.\r\nMy use case is that I am launching foundry fom a docker compose file and I am willing to send a few tx after forking in the following way:\r\n```\r\nimage: ghcr.io/foundry-rs/foundry:latest\r\n    restart: unless-stopped\r\n    volumes:\r\n      - ./init_wallet.sh:/init_wallet.sh\r\n    entrypoint: anvil --fork-url \"https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/xxx\" --host \"0.0.0.0\" --silent\r\n    command: [\"sh\", \"init_wallet.sh\"]\r\n```\r\nThanks for looking at this",

    "body": "So as it was suggested by @DaniPopes I added the \"&\" to run the entrypoint command in the background. But this didnt solve the issue:\r\n```\r\nentrypoint: anvil --fork-url \"https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/xxxx\" --host \"0.0.0.0\" &\r\ncommand: [\"sh\", \"init_wallet.sh\"]`\r\n```\r\n   \r\n   The error message I am getting is: \r\n```\r\n   For more information, try '--help'.\r\nerror: unrecognized subcommand 'sh'\r\n\r\nUsage: anvil [OPTIONS] [COMMAND]\r\n```\r\n I am a bit confused by the error message, because if I log into the instance, I can launch the command in the terminal and it works fine. I have also try to run the entrypoint command AND the init_wallet.sh command in the background without joy.\r\n \r\n I am not sure if the api key is relevant here but will try still. Thanks",
