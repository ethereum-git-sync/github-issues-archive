But I am unable to do so as the the fork command has renderedmy terminal unresponsive.\r\nMy use case is that I am launching foundry fom a docker compose file and I am willing to send a few tx after forking in the following way:\r\n```\r\nimage: ghcr.io/foundry-rs/foundry:latest\r\n    restart: unless-stopped\r\n    volumes:\r\n      - ./init_wallet.sh:/init_wallet.sh\r\n    entrypoint: anvil --fork-url \"https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/xxx\" --host \"0.0.0.0\" --silent\r\n    command: [\"sh\", \"init_wallet.sh\"]\r\n```\r\nThanks for looking at this",
