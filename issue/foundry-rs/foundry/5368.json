I am not sure if any spec (for either eth_feehistory or the EVM in general) either already does or SHOULD specify that 0 fees are nonsense. I suppose it takes a rather special invocation of anvil to cause this (`--base-fee 1`), and protecting 0 return values in certain fields is arguably more about protecting against naive calcs in the calling program (hardhat/cast/foundry scripts/etc)",

    "body": "I've realized that base_fee=0 could maybe be useful in testing scenarios where you want to be spending 0 fees so that your tests never fail due to insufficient funds. However, allowing calculated values of zero out in a testing scenario that is meant to emulate a \"real\" chain seems incorrect.\r\n\r\nI don't want to be bikeshedding this issue, as the easiest way to configure a dapp into \"test\" mode may be to point it to a chain that was started with `--base-fee 0` ... but such settings seem very specifically geared to *testing* vs *deployment*.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that hardhat and/or the foundry toolset has any guard rails as to behaviors that should be allowed \"for testing\" vs \"for deployment,\" this seems like one. And yes, I realize it's unlikely to actually cause any accidental loss of funds, as worst case we're just talking about a fake node emulating a production chain.\r\n\r\nI guess \"not a bug\"?",
