  "body": "Per #1237\r\n\r\n`toml-rs` stores numbers internally as `i64`, which means we're restricted to a maximum gas limit in `foundry.toml` of `u64::MAX / 2`, which is the default. Effectively, it is not possible to raise the gas limit this way\r\n\r\nWe should figure out if we can fix this with a wrapper type, or use `U256` instead or something similar",
