    "body": "Not a Forge bug: The ERC20 spec requires tokens to return a boolean for both `approve` and `transferFrom`, which USDT does not do. The issue here is that the OpenZeppelin ERC20 interface that you are using specifies that the functions are going to return, so as a part of Solidity's \"success check\" for the call it will attempt to parse the return data - since there is none, the call reverts.\r\n\r\nYou can fix it by using your own ERC20 interface that follows USDT's behavior:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\ninterface IERC20 {\r\n    function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) external;\r\n    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 value) external;\r\n    function balanceOf(address account) external view returns (uint256);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've tested this locally on your repository and it works as expected :) There's a bunch of tokens like this: https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20",
