I am unclear on if it is even possible to package up forge as a standalone binary   \r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nI would like to be able to download forge as a binary npm package for easier integration into Frontend and Node applications.   As an example, if forge is a part of a build pipeline it becomes very awkward to integrate it into a vercel build.  \r\n\r\nI am happy to contribute to making this happen but I would need some guidance on\r\n1. Is it even possible to package up forge into a binary?   Would I have to try to package up foundry-up and then execute foundry-up?\r\n2. A pointer to where to look in foundry to get started\r\n\r\nMy specific use case is Iam working to build a forge inspired ethers.js alternative.  User would be able to write forge scripts.  The API is similar to this\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { mutate } from 'ts-sol'\r\nimport { TransferEntireBalance } from './ERC20.s.sol'\r\n\r\n....\r\n\r\n<button onClick={() => mutate(TransferEntireBalance, { signer })} />\r\n```\r\n\r\nI want to reuse forge as much as possible but if I can't find a way to get forge on NPM I'm likely going to be forced to reimplement cheat codes into a javascript based VM or hardhat.",
