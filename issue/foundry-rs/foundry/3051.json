    "body": "Ok, so I try it again (after updating foundry), and now it's fails with `Execution reverted: environment variable not found`.\r\nAnother thing if you are using `--broadcast` it won't fail with the same error, it's just sad `No onchain transactions generated in script` which is a bit confusing and hard to debug. As you don't know which ENV is missing and why your script is not deploying something... Maybe it's make sense to fail with the same error.\r\n\r\nMinor thing will be to add EVN name in the error (this will simplify debugging without need to run `forge test`)",
