    "body": "https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/pull/4884 is implementing a cheat of `function readPrank() external returns (bool isPrankActive, address msgSender, address txOrigin)`\r\n\r\nFor now the cheat will be disabled in scripts, but ultimately it should support both script and tests, and return the broadcast info when in a scripting mode and prank info in a testing mode. I don't think separate cheats is the right UX since you can run a script file in a test, which results in broadcasts behaving like pranks (so we might want to rename the cheat once it supports both). Open to ideas if you want to move the convo to that PR",
