  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nThe title captures it pretty much.\r\n\r\nLike when the top-level function of your `forge script` calls into an external contract you also have the source to, mappings can be checked to put the source into the source window when the execution flow enters it.\n\n### Additional context\n\nMy current case has me using a script to hit a proxied contract I've upgraded on an anvil fork of a mainnet. I upgraded the implementation on the fork and then fire the script to test a complicated scenario. It would be great if I could debug, with source highlighting, the flow from the script into the upgraded logic (implementation) contract.",
