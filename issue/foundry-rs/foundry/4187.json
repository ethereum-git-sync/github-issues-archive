  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nBased on Lucas Manuel's guidance in https://github.com/foundry-rs/book/pull/760, it seems to me that there is a need for a config option that ignores all contracts that get deployed in the `setUp` function of a test contract that contains invariant tests.\r\n\r\nThe use case is bounded testing with handler contracts and the `fail_on_revert` config option set to `true` - in this context, it doesn't really make sense to automatically add all the contracts deployed in `setUp` to the list of targeted contracts for invariant testing purposes.\r\n\r\nInvariant users have to resort to manually adding all known contracts to a denylist (see [`_excludeAllContracts`](https://github.com/maple-labs/maple-core-v2/blob/00f01ae7175885f8d49ac201a1c72465e320b2f6/tests/invariants/BaseInvariants.t.sol#L496-L533) in Maple V2's repo), which must include both production contracts and test contracts. Maintaining this list is a chore, especially in sophisticated projects with lots of dependencies and test contracts.\r\n\r\nA much more ergonomic developer experience would be to have a config option in the `invariant` section of the Foundry profile that would disable this default behavior of Forge - i.e. *not* include all contracts deployed in `setUp` by default, and let the user manually add contracts with [`targetContract`](https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-std/blob/4a79aca83f8075f8b1b4fe9153945fef08375630/src/InvariantTest.sol#L46) and/ or [`targetArtifact`](https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-std/blob/4a79aca83f8075f8b1b4fe9153945fef08375630/src/InvariantTest.sol#L38).\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
