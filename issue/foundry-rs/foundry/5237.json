    "body": "I also get this error when fetching large amounts of data. For me the steps were:\r\n- Deploy a contract that fetches large amounts of data (around 5GB over 7M calls) on an anvil instance that forks from a node in my local network. \r\n- When fetching (forking) from the node in the local network with ~1ms latency everything is fine. \r\n- When connecting to an RPC provider via internet (or the same node over VPN) with significant latency, I get 'intrinsic gas too high' for every 10th-20th call.\r\n- When I rerun the calls, it executes 10-100 times faster as anvil doesn't have to fetch the data again. Nevertheless the data from the anvil instance is broken permanently, meaning I get the same error for the same calls every time. \r\n- Creating a fresh instance of anvil and running again on the 1ms latency forked node \"fixes\" the problem.\r\n\r\nNot a huge issue for me but maybe it helps in identifying the problem.",
