It may even be part of the return value of the call. In that case, rather than\r\n```solidity\r\nuint importantNumber = <figure out important number in a complicated way>\r\nexpectEmit(true,true,true,true,address(contract));\r\nemit Event(importantNumber);\r\ncontract.doThing();\r\n```\r\n\r\nit would be much easier to write:\r\n```solidity\r\nT memory ret = contract.doThing();\r\ncheckEmit(true,true,true,true,address(contract));\r\nemit Event(ret.importantNumber);\r\n```\r\n\r\nsince the purpose of a test like this is just to check that the important number does get emitted, it makes sense to grab it from the call's return value.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_",
