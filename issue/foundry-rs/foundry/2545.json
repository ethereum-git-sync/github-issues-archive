For instance, `Q.structName` does not become `structName`.\r\n2. Names that clash with other names defined in other imported files are not modified to be unique. For instance, if the struct `DataType` is imported (with qualifier) from two files, compilation will fail.\r\n\r\n## Suggestion\r\n`forge flatten` should strip all qualifiers, and rename definitions as needed (recursively).\r\n\r\n## Example:\r\n```solidity\r\n// contract.sol\r\npragma solidity ^0.8.13;\r\nimport \"./aux1.sol\" as A;\r\nimport \"./aux2.sol\" as B;\r\n\r\ncontract C {\r\n  struct Data { A.DataType a; B.DataType b; }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// aux1.sol\r\nstruct DataType { string s; }\r\n\r\n// aux2.sol\r\nstruct DataType { string s; }\r\n```\r\n\r\n`forge flatten` results in this (which fails to compile):\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\npragma solidity ^0.8.13;\r\nstruct DataType { string s; }\r\n\r\nstruct DataType { string s; }\r\n\r\ncontract C {\r\n  struct Data { A.DataType a; B.DataType b; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhen it should result in something like\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\npragma solidity ^0.8.13;\r\nstruct DataType1 { string s; }\r\n\r\nstruct DataType2 { string s; }\r\n\r\ncontract C {\r\n  struct Data { DataType1 a; DataType2 b; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: this is kind of a followup to #1440.",
