I get the error `CompilerError: Stack too deep when compiling inline assembly: Variable pos is 3 slot(s) too deep inside the stack.`. These repositories do compile with `aabfb0e - 2022-02-03`. \r\n\r\nAfter some investigation, I discovered the culprit is passing many args to `abi.encodePacked`, which is common in code for on-chain art. If you delete the last argument from here--22--it will compile. \r\n```\r\ncontract Contract {\r\n\r\n    function test() external pure {\r\n        abi.encodePacked(\r\n            '1',\r\n            '2',\r\n            '3',\r\n            '4',\r\n            '5',\r\n            '6',\r\n            '7',\r\n            '8',\r\n            '9',\r\n            '10',\r\n            '11',\r\n            '12',\r\n            '13',\r\n            '14',\r\n            '15',\r\n            '16',\r\n            '17',\r\n            '18',\r\n            '19',\r\n            '20',\r\n            '21',\r\n            '22'\r\n        );\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```",
