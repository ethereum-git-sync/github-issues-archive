This is okay (I'm rather indifferent about this).\r\n\r\nThe problem is that Forge also sets the release tag as the `branch` in the `.gitmodules` file. [Git tags cannot be used as a submodule `branch`](https://stackoverflow.com/q/1777854/3873510). Forge should instead not set the `branch`.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if we are to consider changing Forge's behavior to always install from the default branch of the submodule (`master` or `main` or whatever), then we could use that default branch for the `branch` config option in `.gitmodules`.",
