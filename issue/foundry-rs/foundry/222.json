  "body": "If we want to support dss' [spells-mainnet](https://github.com/makerdao/spells-mainnet), we'll need to support lib linking.\r\n\r\n# Problem\r\n1. We call into_inner here: https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/blob/master/forge/src/multi_runner.rs#L61\r\n2. Then we call `into_bytes`: and then https://github.com/gakonst/ethers-rs/blob/4c677933ce4407fb1307f9077aefc31b9e811cdb/ethers-solc/src/config.rs#L260\r\n3. But `into_bytes` returns `None` for unlinked objects\r\n4. So we'll need to somehow call [`link`](https://github.com/gakonst/ethers-rs/blob/master/ethers-solc/src/artifacts.rs#L778) before doing the deployment step.\r\n\r\n# Suggested Solution\r\n\r\n1. We should provide a manual way for somebody to link to an already deployed library\r\n2. We should auto-detect if there's library dependencies, deploy all the libraries first, get their addresses, and then link them in all the bytecodes necessary.",
