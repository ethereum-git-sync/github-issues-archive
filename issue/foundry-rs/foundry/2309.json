So this makes it so I have to have a solc specific code path and a foundry specific code path for dealing with build artifacts in the above linked code, which is minorly annoying. It would be nice if Foundry used the same output format as solc exactly.",

That way other tools have an easier time integrating with Foundry if they already have solc integration. Here I went and adapted my solc integration to the foundry output, and then had to spend about 20 minutes hunting down this breakage. Then I had to confirm for myself that the different structure indeed did have all the data I needed.\r\n\r\nThe actual code change (linked above) is small, but I can imagine that less brave developers (not that I'm very brave) would have just stopped at \"well, it doesn't work with my tool that reads solc output, might as well give up.\"",
