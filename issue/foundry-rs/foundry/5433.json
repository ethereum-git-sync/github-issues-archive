We recently noticed that our hardhat tests break when executed against code generated by the latest nightly (nightly-0e72b71580da73d3d89c9b9aaa1bc832831e0da7) : \r\n\r\n```\r\nRun yarn hardhat test --network hardhat\r\nyarn run v1.22.19\r\n$ /home/runner/work/IPNFT/IPNFT/node_modules/.bin/hardhat test --network hardhat\r\nDownloading compiler 0.8.18\r\nAn unexpected error occurred:\r\n\r\nError: Content for lib/token-vesting-contract/lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/access/Ownable.sol not available\r\n    at getSource (/home/runner/work/IPNFT/IPNFT/node_modules/@openzeppelin/upgrades-core/src/src-decoder.ts:25:15)\r\n    at /home/runner/work/IPNFT/IPNFT/node_modules/@openzeppelin/upgrades-core/src/src-decoder.ts:33:31\r\n    at extractStorageLayout (/home/runner/work/IPNFT/IPNFT/node_modules/@openzeppelin/upgrades-core/src/storage/extract.ts:50:19)\r\n    \r\n...    \r\n```\r\n\r\nthey work fine with the build from July 2(nightly-d369d2486f85576eec4ca41d277391dfdae21ba7). We're not exactly sure which of the intermediate builds introduced the breaking change but it must be one between July2 and July19 2023.\r\n\r\nHere are 2 or our workflow runs for reference:\r\n\r\nbreaks: https://github.com/moleculeprotocol/IPNFT/actions/runs/5597735526/jobs/10236488893\r\nworks: https://github.com/moleculeprotocol/IPNFT/actions/runs/5598108479/jobs/10237312810\r\n",
