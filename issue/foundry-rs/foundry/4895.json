    "body": "Just to clarify the scope of this issue, I think this is referring only to forge-std's `StdChains`, and nothing in foundry/forge?\r\n\r\nLooking at e.g. https://github.com/ethereum-lists/chains/blob/master/_data/chains/eip155-42161.json, presumably it's the `shortName` field you are suggesting that should match? (We can't use `name` since spaces are not allowed in TOML keys). Given that, TBH those short names feel obscure/unused. In all the config files I've seen, people refer to ethereum mainnet as `mainnet`, not `eth`. Similarly they use `arbitrum` or `arbitrum_one`, not `arb1`. Where are these short names used?\r\n\r\n[Seems](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/forge-std/#forge-stds-test) the `StdChain` features are not documented in the book, so documenting them and listing the aliases currently feels like the best path forward here\r\n",
