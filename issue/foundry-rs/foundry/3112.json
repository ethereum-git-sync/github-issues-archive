Would it be possible to implement `anvil_enableTraces`?\r\n\r\nIt is listed in the Foundry book, but it isn't currently implemented.\r\n\r\nWe at https://github.com/Ackee-Blockchain/woke are developing a testing framework and want to return return_data of the transaction to the user. We need to execute the transaction and then query the traces using the tx_hash. We would like to do it in one step.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
