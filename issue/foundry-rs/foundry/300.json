    "body": "I think they match. If you count up the gas cost of some subtraces and add them up, and then compare it to the parent trace's gas cost, there might be a small-ish discrepancy. This discrepancy is most likely the `CALL` opcode itself + some other logic in that function that is not captured by a subtrace (i.e. ifs, arithmetic etc.).\r\n\r\nNot sure how else we can verify other than literally just deploying something I suppose and check the gas cost. Any insight on this @transmissions11? If you have deployed something with Foundry, do the gas costs line up?",
