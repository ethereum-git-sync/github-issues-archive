This EIP introduced cost changes to storage and account accessing opcodes, including (but not limited to): `SLOAD`, `SSTORE`, `CALL`, `BALANCE` etc. Specifically these opcodes received an additional cost the first time they are used to access storage slots and/or accounts within a transaction. These costs are however not always properly accounted for in foundry solidity tests. Specifically addresses and storage slots seem to remain warm between calls within the context of a single test, falsely reducing the cost of calls and certain contract executions. This not only leads to inaccurate traces but gas usage dependent tests may also incorrectly fail / pass.\r\n\r\nThis bug may or may not be a feature. It is likely more useful / straightforward if accounts and storage slots do not remain warm between calls within a single test by default. Cheat codes may be added to purposefully keep accounts and storage slots warm or potentially even pre-warm to simulate transactions with access lists ([EIP2930](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2930)).\r\n\r\nEDIT(onbjerg): I am requesting a `vm.cool(address)` cheatcode to cool off warm accounts",

    "body": "If you call the same contract multiple times within a single test, then the storage slot remains warm. This is intended, and largely a very very very hard fix, so I don't think the cost of changing this behavior is worth it. In some cases, it might even be the preferred behavior, further complicating the change, since we would probably need a way to switch between one or the other\r\n\r\nHowever, the first time you call a contract within a test, that gas usage should be correct.
