But on running `delete mapping[index]` the index value does not get deleted. Here's the snippet:\r\n```zsh\r\nWelcome to Chisel! Type `!help` to show available commands.\r\n➜ mapping(address => address) public token2token;\r\n➜ token2token[address(1)] = address(2)\r\nType: address\r\n└ Data: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000002\r\n➜ delete token2token[address(1)]\r\n➜ token2token[address(1)]\r\nType: address\r\n└ Data: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000002\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected output:\r\n```zsh\r\n➜ token2token[address(1)]\r\nType: address\r\n└ Data: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\r\n```",
