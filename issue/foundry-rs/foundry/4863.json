The speed is amazing :). \r\nI have a contract that I deploy on a fork (using `anvil --fork-url ` to properly test it (as it interacts with existing contracts). Then I sent a thousand transactions through the contract using `cast send`. This often gives me messages like:\r\n```\r\n    Transaction: 0xa9f8642e6a769564611cea7ff787d3376e224121991ae3612f3564941cc18d52\r\n    Gas used: 299468\r\n    Error: reverted with custom error: \r\n\r\n    Block Number: 17169631\r\n    Block Hash: 0x90b18ed8be59213823795b5c393a4efcc21902e8797f69089838a6555f4d2460\r\n    Block Time: \"Tue, 02 May 2023 06:25:53 +0000\"\r\n```\r\nI don't understand why the `Error: reverted with custom error` is empty? \r\n\r\n(P.s. maybe I could do this with `forge` but couldn't see how that would work with a fork + own transaction sequences)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
