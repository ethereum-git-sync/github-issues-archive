    "body": "Just curious, why do you use `testFail`? IMO this is an antipattern, mainly supported for backwards compatibility with dapptools which did not have `vm.expectRevert`. My suggestion would be to never use `testFail`, since it will cause the test to pass on any failure, not just a specific revert reason. Per the WIP best practices (https://github.com/foundry-rs/book/pull/686), you can use a naming convention like `test_RevertIf_Description` to make it easier to identify and filter on revert tests",

    "body": "In this particular case I considered it, but I was testing that a function reverted if the contract wasn't initialized. Since the initialization set some addresses, it meant that the function would fail anyway by making a call to address 0 and so an explicit `require` is not needed.\r\n\r\nThe revert in this case has no message, so I could use `vm.expectRevert(\"\")`. I guess it is better than `testFail` because at least the test won't pass if failing for something that has a message. I will make this change!\r\n\r\nCould be a good addition to the best practices also!",
