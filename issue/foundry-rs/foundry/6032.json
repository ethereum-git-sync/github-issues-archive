Here are steps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. `forge init hello_foundry`\r\n2. Navigate to `script/Counter.s.sol`, then replace its contents with:\r\n```\r\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED\r\npragma solidity ^0.8.13;\r\n\r\nimport {Script, console2} from \"forge-std/Script.sol\";\r\nimport { StdCheats } from \"forge-std/StdCheats.sol\";\r\nimport { Counter } from \"../src/Counter.sol\";\r\n\r\ncontract CounterScript is Script, StdCheats {\r\n    function setUp() public {}\r\n\r\n    function run() public {\r\n        Counter counter = new Counter();\r\n        counter.setNumber(42);\r\n\r\n        vm.createSelectFork('http://127.0.0.1:8545');\r\n        // `Counter` is not deployed on the fork, which is expected.\r\n        assert(address(counter).code.length == 0);\r\n        // Deploy `Counter` to the same address as the local one.\r\n        deployCodeTo(\"Counter.sol:Counter\", hex\"\", address(counter));\r\n        // `Counter` is now deployed on the fork.\r\n        assert(address(counter).code.length > 0);\r\n        // Logs 42. This should be 0 since the contract should have a fresh state on the fork.\r\n        console2.log(counter.number());\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n3. In a new terminal window: `anvil`\r\n4. `forge script script/Counter.s.sol`\r\n\r\nThe comments in the file above describe what appears to be incorrect behavior.",
