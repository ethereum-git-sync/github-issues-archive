  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nI would like invariant tests (foundry's stateful fuzz tests) to be a bit more performant. While recently doing a larger fuzzing campaign on my local computer I noticed that foundry did not utilize all the threads of my CPU to perform the fuzzing. It would be great if I could select or set a flag to just use all available threads on my computer. Furthermore other performance improvements would be appreciated.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
