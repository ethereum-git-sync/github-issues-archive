    "body": "Expanding on what @DaniPopes said:\r\n- The internal method works because the code gets inlined, so it's as if that logic lived directly in your script. As a result, the `prank` takes place on the `_storage.set` call\r\n- The public method delegatecalls to the function. While this should have the same effect in solidity since it preserves context, I believe this doesn't work with `prank` because delegatecalls change the depth of execution, so the `_storage.set` call happens at a different depth, and as a result the prank does not occur in the delegatecall contract.\r\n\r\nI'd recommend always using internal library functions unless you have a reason to use public (i.e. deploying a contract to production, using `public` library methods can shrink code size). But for tests/scripts, you can always use internal",
