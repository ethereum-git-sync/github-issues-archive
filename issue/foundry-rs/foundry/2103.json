    "body": "Ah, right. So, we choose the anchor based on each contract's own source map, which means that instruction #51 in one source map might map to one source range, and in another source map it maps to another source range. When we apply the hit data we just check all anchors for a specific source ID not caring what source map it comes from.. sorta. So I think the fix is to also discriminate based on contract name(?)",
