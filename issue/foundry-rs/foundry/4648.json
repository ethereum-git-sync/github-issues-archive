  "body": "### Component\r\n\r\nForge\r\n\r\n### Describe the feature you would like\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\nzkSync deployments use an EIP-712 style transaction for contract deployments rather than the standard EIP-1559. As far as I know this is only used by zkSync but it would be very helpful to have for deployments. Without support for this transaction type, deployment to zkSync with foundry is not possible other than deploying from L1 through the bridge.\r\n\r\n## Details\r\nThe EIP-712 transaction type defined by zkSync follows the format below:\r\n```js\r\nconst EIP712_TYPE = \"0x71\";\r\nconst data = EIP712_TYPE + RLP.encode([\r\n   nonce,\r\n   maxPriorityFeePerGas,\r\n   maxFeePerGas,\r\n   gasLimit,\r\n   to,\r\n   value,\r\n   data,\r\n   chainId,\r\n   0x,\r\n   0x,\r\n   chainId,\r\n   from,\r\n   gasPerPubData,\r\n   factoryDeps[],\r\n   customSignature, // EIP712 signature\r\n   [paymaster, paymasterInput]\r\n]);\r\nsendTransaction(data);\r\n```\r\nwhere `customSignature` is a signature of the following struct:\r\n\r\n\r\nField name | Type\r\n-- | --\r\ntxType | uint256\r\nfrom | uint256\r\nto | uint256\r\ngasLimit | uint256\r\ngasPerPubdataByteLimit | uint256\r\nmaxFeePerGas | uint256\r\nmaxPriorityFeePerGas | uint256\r\npaymaster | uint256\r\nnonce | uint256\r\nvalue | uint256\r\ndata | bytes\r\nfactoryDeps | bytes32[]\r\npaymasterInput | bytes\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\nImplementation wise it would not make sense to add support for this specific transaction type, but it may be feasible to add a cheatcode for generic `sendTransaction` or any other RPC calls. \r\n\r\nLeaving the proper implementation open to discussion.",
