  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nIt will be beneficial to have a feature where we can filter the logs based on the selector.\r\n\r\nThe use of `getRecordedLogs` is generally done when the first emitted event is not the one that you want to match.\r\nBut the problem is sometimes the event to be matched is deep inside multiple other logs, which makes the developer either run a loop or have to \"guess\" the correct index! \r\n\r\nSo, having a filter to get only the logs the user wants will eliminate the problem.\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nfunction getRecordedLogs(bytes4 selector) external returns(Log[] memory)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI will happily contribute by opening the PR.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
