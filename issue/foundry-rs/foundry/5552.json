  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\n### **Description:**\r\nHi there! While auditing some projects using Foundry, I couldn't find a feature that could be incredibly beneficial to many users. Specifically, I noticed the absence of a way to compare gas snapshots for quickly assessing the overall effects of gas optimizations in test cases.\r\n\r\nTo fill this gap, I've created some bash scripts that perform this analysis. You can find the code and an overview of the functionality in my repository:\r\n[Forge-Snapshots-Analyzer](https://github.com/CarlosAlegreUr/Forge-Snapshots-Analyzer)\r\nhttps://github.com/CarlosAlegreUr/Forge-Snapshots-Analyzer\r\n\r\n### **Proposed Enhancement:**\r\nI propose rewriting my analyzer in Rust and integrating it directly into Forge. This would provide a native, efficient way to perform gas comparisons within the framework. Such a feature could help developers to quickly asses the impact of their changes.\r\n\r\n### **Benefits:**\r\n- Faster insight into gas consumption across different code versions or optimizations.\r\n- A unified toolset within Forge for gas analysis, enhancing usability.\r\n- Encouraging best practices in optimizing gas consumption.\r\n\r\n### **Next Steps:**\r\nI would enjoy contributing with this feature to Forge and would be happy to collaborate on the design and implementation if there's interest.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts?\r\n\r\nLooking forward to hearing from you, and happy to provide more details if needed!\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nCarlos Alegre Urquiz√∫\r\n\n\n### Additional context\n\nThis is how my analyzer currently displays results\r\n![net-zero-snapshot](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/assets/88899281/1cea3916-0196-40df-a759-771d56df7c5b)\r\n![not-optimized-snapshot](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/assets/88899281/ec23580c-2361-4643-9114-b29e075edbbb)\r\n![optmized-snapshot](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/assets/88899281/654dd698-c219-40b0-888e-f8ce8f8baed0)\r\n",
