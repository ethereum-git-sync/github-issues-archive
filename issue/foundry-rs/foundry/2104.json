    "body": "I have a similar use case of needing to initialize a proxy's implementation contract after deploying it with create2, and it'd be ideal to do that in the same tx. Suggested implementation path for this issue:\r\n\r\n- Fork https://github.com/Arachnid/deterministic-deployment-proxy (into the `foundry-rs` GitHub org?) and update the Yul contract so it makes a call on the newly provided contract if given data.\r\n- Deploy it on a bunch of chains with a fun vanity address. My suggestion is to use the old-fashioned same private key + nonce approach so we don't need to wait for an administrative deploy to place the contract at the right address on arbitrum (this was done with 0x4e59b44847b379578588920cA78FbF26c0B4956C since it was deployed with Nick's method)\r\n- Make sure this isn't a breaking change for anyone relying on the old address\r\n\r\nLast part is figuring out the UX. Some options:\r\n- Auto-detect if the next call after a create2 deploy is a tx sent to the newly deployed contract. If so, automatically include it that call in the same tx.\r\n- Add a forge-std helper method such as `deployCreate2(string contractName, bytes32 salt, bytes memory constructorData, bytes memory initData)` which constructs and executes the tx",
