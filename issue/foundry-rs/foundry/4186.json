See, for example, the [`numCalls`](https://github.com/lucas-manuel/invariant-examples/blob/d6b4f06d7ebe0bbaebcfd666fb00433d30ab28da/test/handlers/LpHandler.sol#L23) mapping defined in Lucas' `invariant-examples` repo, and also his [`invariant_call_summary`](https://github.com/lucas-manuel/invariant-examples/blob/d6b4f06d7ebe0bbaebcfd666fb00433d30ab28da/test/WrappedTests.t.sol#L87-L101) function.\r\n\r\nThis is something that should be done by Forge, which is in charge of orchestrating the invariant tests anyway.",
