  "body": "### Component\r\n\r\nForge\r\n\r\n### Describe the feature you would like\r\n\r\nSetting the optimizer's `--optimize-runs` count to 1 results in the smallest contract size, but higher runtime gas costs. As that number increases, contract size increases and gas costs decrease.\r\n\r\nTherefore, a useful method would be `forge build --optimize-size`. This would basically be a binary search that keeps re-compiling the contracts until they exceed the size limit. Specifically:\r\n- The maximum number of optimizer runs is 2^32 - 1. Start by compiling the contracts with the number of runs set to half this value.\r\n- If the contracts are above the size limit, reduce the optimizer runs by half and re-build.\r\n- If the contracts are below the size limit, increase the optimizer runs to `mean(2^32 - 1, (2^32 - 1) / 2)` and re-build.\r\n- Repeat until we find the maximum number of optimizer runs that results in all contracts being below the size limit, and print that number of runs\r\n- If all attempts fail and are over the size limit, exit with an error\r\n\r\nIn practice I've noticed diminishing returns as you increase the runs very high, with 10M+ runs all typically giving the same results. Therefore we can speed up the above search by assuming the max number of runs is smaller, such as 10M or 100M\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nPulled out of https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/992",
