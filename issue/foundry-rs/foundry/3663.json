The error is : \r\n\r\nNo associated wallet for addresses: {0xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx...(my test wallet address}. Unlocked wallets: []\r\n\r\nthe script command I run is: ` forge script ForkDeploy.s.sol --broadcast -vvvv `\r\n\r\nin regarding no privateKey provided in the command, I'm using .env and mnemonic to ge the key in side the .sol file\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\ncontract ForkDeploy is Script {\r\n    function run() external {\r\n        string memory MAINNET_RPC_URL = vm.envString('MAINNET_RPC_URL');\r\n        uint256 mainnetFork = vm.createFork(MAINNET_RPC_URL);\r\n        vm.selectFork(mainnetFork);\r\n        string memory mnemonic = vm.envString('MNEMONIC');\r\n        uint256 privateKey = vm.deriveKey(mnemonic, 0);\r\n        address deployer = vm.addr(privateKey);\r\n\r\n        vm.startBroadcast(deployer);\r\n\r\n        AmmalgamFactory factory = new AmmalgamFactory(deployer);\r\n        factory.setFeeTo(deployer);\r\n\r\n        vm.stopBroadcast();\r\n\r\n        console2.log('Factory Address:', address(factory));\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt has been working until yesterday foundryup. The current one remains in the same issue.  \r\n\r\nI'm hoping a fix will also solve another problem with the external library that I reported here: #3646\r\n\r\n",
