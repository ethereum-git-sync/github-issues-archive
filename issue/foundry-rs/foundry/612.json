This worked fine before because we only decoded based on *known* contracts. Now we do it based on all functions. This causes an issue when two function have the same signature but have different outputs, i.e.: `transfer() -> (uint256)` and `transfer() -> (uint256, uint256)`. One of these will fail and the trace will panic",
