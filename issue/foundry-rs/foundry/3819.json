Before this commit, traces for `CREATE` and `CREATE2` were included at the end of `structLogs`. Now, it seems that traces for  `CREATE` and `CREATE2` are completely missing.\r\n\r\nMinimal example:\r\n```solidity\r\n\r\ncontract Foo {\r\n    event ConstructorCall();\r\n\r\n    constructor() {\r\n        emit ConstructorCall();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract Bar {\r\n    event Deployed();\r\n\r\n    function deploy() public returns(Foo) {\r\n        Foo ret = new Foo();\r\n\r\n        emit Deployed();\r\n        return ret;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function deploy2(bytes32 salt) public returns(Foo) {\r\n        Foo ret = new Foo{ salt: salt }();\r\n\r\n        emit Deployed();\r\n        return ret;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`LOG1` for `ConstructorCall` now does not appear in traces. Before the commit https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/commit/f7bf1d5e53b89528c0e5705ce0af505dc59b6c3a it was present but in an incorrect order.\r\n\r\nRunning anvil with `anvil --prune-history --port 8545 --gas-price 0 --base-fee 0 --steps-tracing`",
