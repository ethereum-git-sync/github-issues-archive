Usually the way it manifests like this:\r\n\r\n - Everything has been compiled before, a test is failing\r\n - I change a contract implementation which should fix the test\r\n - I run forge test, I see solc recompiling all dependent contracts, but when the tests run the test result is the same, as if the test contract that is run, is the old one.\r\n - I run `forge test --force`, and everything works.\r\n\r\nA minimal reproduction should hopefully be just one test contract, and one contract under test, then going through the above steps.\r\n\r\nI have not experienced this lately, but had issues with this around November/December.
