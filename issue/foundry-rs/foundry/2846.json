  "body": "### Component\r\n\r\nForge\r\n\r\n### Describe the feature you would like\r\n\r\nFor certain transactions (especially related to DAO governance processes) it makes sense to diff the chain state from before and after a certain tx execution to have a reasonable preview of what the outcome/side effects of a certain action are.\r\n\r\nI'm aware this feature can grow to infinite complexity when trying to decode the stateDiffs accross proxy implementations or similar, so for a first iteration i'd suggest to keep it as simple as possible and just track `address.key.before/after` values and see where we can go from there.\r\n\r\nNot quite sure if diffs over multiple txn or overlapping diffs are needed.\r\nA simple api could be sth like `vm.diff(identifier)` which would track state changes of the next txn executed. The identifier could be the file to log to.\r\n\r\nAs for a more complex api I would imagine sth similar to startPrank api but allowing overlaps.\r\n```sol\r\nvm.startStorageDiff('execution');\r\ncontract.doSthAwesome();\r\nvm.startStorageDiff('partial');\r\ncontract.doSthElse();\r\nvm.stopStorageDiff('partial');\r\nvm.stopStorageDiff('execution');\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n`tenderly` has a great feature called \"State changes\" used in aave/unswap seatbelt, which does exactly that (diff the state between before and after a simulation). Would be cool if sth similar or a slimmed down version of this could exist within foundry as foundry & tenderly don't work very well together. For complex scenarios tenderly would probably still be the go-to as they solved state decoding in a relatively reliable way, but for more simple cases it would be cool if one could resort to foundry.",

For forge test it'd be the state changes of that test, and for `cast run <tx>` you get the state changes of that tx. \r\n2. Within a test, using `vm.diffSnapshot(id)` (though I'd probably name it `vm.stateDiff(uint snapshotId)`). We can update `console2.sol` to support this type and add a forge-std method like `[log|print]StateDiff(uint snapshotId, string memory name)` (second arg is optional) to simplify the process of snapshotting/logging. I think having it displayed in-line in the trace would be very hard to read and clutter the trace",
