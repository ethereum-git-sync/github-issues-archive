  "body": "### Component\n\nCast\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nI find it weird that this command is called `4byte-event` because it actually only accepts 32-byte hashes, which are the `topic0` of logs. Wouldn't it be more technically correct to call it something like `32byte-event` or `topic0-event`? I'm not suggesting any specific alternative, but I do think we need to rename this command to avoid confusion.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
