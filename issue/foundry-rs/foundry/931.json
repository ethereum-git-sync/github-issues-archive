  "body": "### Component\n\nCast\n\n### Have you ensured that all of these are up to date?\n\n- [X] Foundry\n- [X] Foundryup\n\n### What version of Foundry are you on?\n\nforge 0.1.0 (0f58c52 2022-03-14T00:08:32.530471551+00:00)\n\n### What command(s) is the bug in?\n\ncast abi-encode\n\n### Operating System\n\nLinux\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nThis took about 4 hours out of my day today, but I finally figured out why all of my contracts weren't verifying. I was using an inline shell command to pipe the encoded constructor arguments to the `verify-contract` function of forge. I tried everything, multiple chains, new projects, different versions of solidity, etc etc.\r\n\r\nI eventually tried word for word the example on the Forge book, and it worked. I realised I'd manually pasted the abi this time, so I tried printing the output of abi-encode directly to the terminal. It looks like there are two errors that will break almost any block explorer. I didn't try etherscan itself, so it's possible it works there, but it breaks on avalanche testnet (tried this over and over), bsc testnet, and manually deploying an explorer (and using geth).\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce:\r\nRun `cast abi-encode` and observe the output.\r\n\r\nThe initial `0x` is not present in earlier examples so I imagine the tool didn't always output like this. Newlines also silently cause the deploy to fail and only part of the contract is uploaded (?!). Very strange behavior.\r\n\r\nSince most people are deploying forge contracts with shell scripts I'm surprised it hasn't come up before.",
