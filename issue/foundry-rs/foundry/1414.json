    "body": "I'm not sure I totally follow the suggesting aliasing and how it would affect config options/defaults, but:\r\n- Allowing users to specify `fork_url` in the config as an alias for `eth_rpc_url` seems reasonable to me.\r\n- Automatically forking if a `FOUNDRY_FORK_URL` env var is found also seems ok.\r\n- The main thing we want to prevent is: the presence of an `ETH_RPC_URL` env var _should not_ lead to tests forking from that URL. Having a globally defined `ETH_RPC_URL` is common for cast users, so we don't want that to affect tests.\r\n\r\nNow that cast supports config files though, I wonder if this alias puts us in a weird spot: I might want tests to not fork, but cast to use e.g. Optimism by specifying an Optimism RPC in the config file's `eth_rpc_url`. AFAIK that is not currently doable because specifying  `eth_rpc_url` will result in tests also forking?\r\n\r\nSo perhaps we want to decouple the two and have something like this?\r\n- `fork_url` used to determine the network for forge\r\n- `eth_rpc_url` to determine the network for cast, which defaults to `fork_url` if present, and `ETH_RPC_URL` env var if `fork_url` isn't present\r\n\r\n",
