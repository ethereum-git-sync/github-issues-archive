However, if I understand correctly. Every command that interacts with a chain requires the `--rpc-url` flag. Also, every deployment requires `--private-key`. \r\n\r\n## Suggestion\r\n- Allow setting --rpc-url and --private-key globally and locally via toml profiles\r\n  - global foundry.toml (`~/.foundry/foundry.toml`)\r\n  - local foundry.toml \r\n- forge & cast to read from the first `foundry.toml` in the directory tree, fallback to global `foundry.toml` if no local config was resolved\r\n \r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nThe mentioned should allow more convinient access to forge and cast capabilities. \r\n\r\neg:\r\n\r\n```\r\nforge create Stake.sol:Stake --profile polygon\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice how the command is much shorter than it's counter-version with **--rpc-url**  and **--private-key**.
