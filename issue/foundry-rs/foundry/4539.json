For example, Prettier auto-formats one end line to an empty space.\r\n\r\nTake this example:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n/// @notice Transfers the admin of the contract to a new address.\r\n///\r\n/// Notes:\r\n/// - Does not revert if the admin is the same.\r\n/// - This function can potentially leave the contract without an admin, thereby removing any\r\n/// functionality that is only available to the admin.\r\n///\r\n/// Requirements:\r\n/// - The caller must be the current contract admin.\r\n///\r\n/// @param newAdmin The address of the new admin.\r\nfunction transferAdmin(address newAdmin) external;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe Markdown generated by `forge doc` is the following:\r\n\r\n```md\r\n### transferAdmin\r\n\r\nTransfers the admin of the contract to a new address.\r\nNotes:\r\n- Does not revert if the admin is the same.\r\n- This function can potentially leave the contract without an admin, thereby removing any\r\nfunctionality that is only available to the admin.\r\nRequirements:\r\n- The caller must be the current contract admin.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would like `forge doc` to keep two end lines between \"to a new address.\" and \"Notes:\".\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_",
