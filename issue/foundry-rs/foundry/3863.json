I'm running a contract function given below, and a simple step between two calls of `gasleft()` causes the returned values change for more than 0.14ETH from `9223372036854754539` to `9079256848778892941`. A few questions here:\r\n1. `gasleft()` should return gas amount in Gwei which is 1e9 wei/Gwei, but the returned values seem to be in wei.\r\n2. The returned values just don't seem to be right.",

    "body": "@mattsse @rkrasiuk @rakita Thanks for the comments and answers. It turns out that `9223372036854754539` is the nominal value returned by `gasleft()` and looks a bit too large to me and somehow I thought it should be scaled to be in gwei instead. I'm getting a better picture now. I'm also wondering if it's possible to control the amount of gas used for a transaction in a test. In some cases, it's desirable to have a better control of the amount of gas available, for example, `vm.gasavail(1000000)`. Thanks. ",
