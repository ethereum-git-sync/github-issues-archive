In the end, it was because somewhere deep in my test setups I set `vm.warp(1 hours);`, and in the test I wrote I set `vm.warp(1);`, and this lead to a underflow error.\r\n\r\n**Proposed solution:**\r\n\r\n- When tests detect a warp that decreases the blocktime AND when tests fails, a hint is given that the blocktime was reduced.\r\n\r\nIf this is a bad idea, just close :-) \n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
