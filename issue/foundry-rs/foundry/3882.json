  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nI am planning to use `vm.store` in my differential fuzz testing contracts, to test for bugs that could be caused by some alternative state (relative to the fork I'm fuzzing on). But a lot of the relevant state in the contract I'm testing is stored in mappings, and `vm.store` requires the exact storage slot. I could use `ffi` to run \"`cast index` key_type key slot\", but `ffi` should only be used as a last resort, right? So it seems to me that something akin to `cast index` would be a useful cheat code, i.e., `vm.compute_index(key_type, key, slot) returns (bytes32)` (or perhaps drop the key_type argument and provide overrides for each type). That way, given a key of an arbitrary type as fuzzing input along with some knowledge about where the mapping is located, I could modify the value for the key without using `ffi` and `cast index`.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
