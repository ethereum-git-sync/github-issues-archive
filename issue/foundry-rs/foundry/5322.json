For example:\r\n\r\n`forge init my-awesome-vulcan-project --template https://github.com/nomoixyz/vulcan-template`\r\n\r\nTo enhance the user experience, it would be fantastic if there was a way to set a default value for the template using a command such as:\r\n\r\n`forge defaults --template https://github.com/nomoixyz/vulcan-template`\r\n\r\nOnce a default value is set, users could simplify the process by using a command like this:\r\n\r\n`forge init --template` \n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
