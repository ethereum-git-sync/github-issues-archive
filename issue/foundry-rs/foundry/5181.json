Closing!\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @Evalir in https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/3621#issuecomment-1576745932_\r\n\r\nIt is not a deserialization issue, it is a rate limit issue, as foundry exceeds 5 API requests x second!!\r\n\r\nThe monthly subscription for Etherscan is $200 a month for 10 API calls per second, this is a major issue for developers, I haven't been able to verify contracts manually either due to bytecode mismatch (I tried all I could), forcing me to pay for Etherscan; could you just lower the API calls rate on the Foundry side?",
