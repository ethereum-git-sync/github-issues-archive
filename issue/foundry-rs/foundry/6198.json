  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nCurrently, it is not possible to run a script that uses multiple broadcasts with various accounts (those that use the overloaded `vm.broadcast` function that takes a private key) with `cast` wallets. You can provide a single wallet in the form of a keystore to the command that executes the script (`--keystore`) but there's no way to use multiple wallets with one script. \r\n\r\nThat is unless there's a way to derive the private key in Solidity (such as with `vm.deriveKey`) from a `cast` wallet that I'm not aware of. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure as to what form this would take. Perhaps another overloaded `vm.broadcast` that takes the path to the JSON keystore?\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
