For example this:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nimport \"forge-std/test.sol\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nWorks perfectly fine on a Mac even tho it should be `Test.sol`, while in CI it will yield this message:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nRun forge build --sizes\r\nError: \r\nFailed to resolve file: \"/home/runner/work/athena/athena/lib/forge-std/src/test.sol\": No such file or directory (os error 2).\r\n    --> \"/home/runner/work/athena/athena/test/Athena.t.sol\"\r\n        \"forge-std/test.sol\"\r\n    Check configured remappings.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis error message had me pretty confused for a while (it's only off by 2 characters), esp since it worked on Mac. \r\n\r\nThe error message isn't necessarily at fault, but this whole flow was a little confusing to debug for multiple reasons. I'd argue it's a small footgun that it wouldn't hurt to mitigate somehow, maybe by:\r\n\r\n- Ensuring foundry is case insensitive on linux\r\nor\r\n- Ensuring foundry is case sensitive on OSX\r\n\r\nand/or\r\n\r\n- Augmenting this error message to note if there's a similar file with different caps",

For example backslashes in a source unit name can be interpreted as directory separators or not and the lookup can be case-sensitive or not, depending on the underlying platform.\r\n\r\n> For portability it is recommended to avoid using import paths that will work correctly only with a specific import callback or only on one platform. For example you should always use forward slashes since they work as path separators also on platforms that support backslashes.",
