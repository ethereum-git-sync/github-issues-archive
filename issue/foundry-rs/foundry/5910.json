I ran the same command with an older version `forge 0.2.0 (6676e81 2023-08-22T00:28:15.086036000Z)`. It ran successfully. And after I upgrade forge to the latest version `forge 0.2.0 (35b6c01 2023-09-25T18:05:31.308398000Z)`, the same command failed with the following error message.\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nThe application panicked (crashed).\r\nMessage:  Mismatch between definition and access of `with_gas_price`.
