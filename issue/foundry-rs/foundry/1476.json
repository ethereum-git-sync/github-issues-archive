Can accept multiple values.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nThere are two primary uses for `forge cache clean`:\r\n\r\n- You have an error you can't grok, so you try to clean the RPC cache to see if that is the issue\r\n- You want to clear disk space, in which case `forge cache ls` is helpful in determining what you want to keep and what you don't want to keep",
