Usually I see something like this No files changed, compilation skipped Deployer: 0x645efC03Af16a2D8D9F67587be502830E80627A2 Deployed to: 0xcd0db8884A9EAcC5A5DAd1E4537DC8197EB5794C Transaction hash: 0xf514a9601ac7fc54336fae740a96ed1f25231d7380de789fc087b7588a4b5c68 . But with legacy there is nothing, no response although the deployment is successful. I would need the response since I run a post deployment script, so I'll need the contract addresses that were deployed. Is there a way better way to deploy multiple contracts and get their addresses ?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/934#issuecomment-1191160766\r\n\r\n@yohanelly95 could you please describe what commands you're running, I'm assuming `forge create`?",
