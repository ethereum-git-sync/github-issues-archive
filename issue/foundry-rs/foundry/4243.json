Here's an example with deploying using artifact bytecode (generated in hardhat) of `UniswapV3Pool`\r\n\r\n```\r\naddress pool_ = deployCode(\"src/build/UniswapV3Pool.json\");\r\nIUniswapV3Pool pool = IUniswapV3Pool(pool_);\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich will complain with: `[FAIL. Reason: Setup failed: StdCheats deployCode(string): Deployment failed.]`\r\n\r\nI think the reason is external contracts being called at the runtime in `UniswapV3Pool`, here: https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/05c10bf6d547d6121622ac51c457f93775e1df09/contracts/UniswapV3Pool.sol#L119\r\n\r\nNotice that `deployCode` works fine for `UniswapV3Factory`, which doesn't perform any external call during runtime, here's the constructor for reference: https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/05c10bf6d547d6121622ac51c457f93775e1df09/contracts/UniswapV3Factory.sol#L22\r\n\r\n",
