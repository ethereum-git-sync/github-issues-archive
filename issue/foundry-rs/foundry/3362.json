    "body": "Yea a `vm.rpc` cheat seems useful, in the past I've used ffi to deal tokens on anvil as part of a forge script but this would definitely be more convenient. Two questions:\r\n1. What would be the UX? `vm.rpc(string memory urlOrAlias, string memory method, string memory params)`?  You'd have to format the JSON string manually which is a bit clunky but not terrible.\r\n2. Should this be disabled by default? ",
