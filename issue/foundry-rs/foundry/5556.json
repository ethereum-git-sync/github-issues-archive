Simple access gating. In my test called `testProtectableTokenAssetProtectionRoleSet`, I set `assetProtectionRole` and verify that it matches `msg.sender`, however when the modifier comparing these two is engaged when calling a function that utilizes it, the very same condition a previous test is verifying appears to exhibit the opposite behavior. I've used `console2.log()` to dig deeper and have confirmed `msg.sender == assetProtectionRole`, so why does the opposite condition appear to be true instead?\r\n\r\n![VirtualBoxVM_4yBRlwQwSP](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/assets/114717981/497d4143-eaa1-4aa7-8e69-a2ee8dbca76d)\r\n\r\nThe project I'm working out of is at https://github.com/Zodomo/pyusd-contract\r\nYou can replicate the behavior I'm seeing by running `forge test -vvvvv --match-test testProtectableTokenFreezeAddsFrozenAddress`",
