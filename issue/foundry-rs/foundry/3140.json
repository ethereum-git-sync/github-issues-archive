  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Have you ensured that all of these are up to date?\n\n- [X] Foundry\n- [X] Foundryup\n\n### What version of Foundry are you on?\n\n_No response_\n\n### What command(s) is the bug in?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Operating System\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nHi, \r\n\r\nI was working on https://github.com/nicolasgarcia214/damn-vulnerable-defi-foundry and recently (today) updated foundry using foundryup. This broke previously working commands like https://github.com/nicolasgarcia214/damn-vulnerable-defi-foundry/blob/c5e4289b62ad4788afba244aaaa0c52fb1d1a185/test/Levels/puppet/Puppet.t.sol#L72:\r\n\r\n`uniswapV1ExchangeTemplate = UniswapV1Exchange(\r\n            deployCode(\"./src/build-uniswap/v1/UniswapV1Exchange.json\"));`\r\n\r\nwhich now returns an error that the path \"is not allowed to be accessed for read operations\". No matter which path I give it, the error is still here. \r\n\r\nI downgraded foundry to a commit from 25 days ago (using `foundryup -C 6fc06c5539efb86b0204331f8a5749a60390389a`) which fixes the issue. It might be related to https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/pull/3007. ",
