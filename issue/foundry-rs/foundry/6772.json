The required version ^0.1.0 is not available on crates.io, which leads to a failure when building my project.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n1) Add chisel as a git dependency in my project's Cargo.toml:\r\n\r\n[dependencies]\r\nchisel = { git = \"https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry\", package = \"chisel\" }\r\n\r\n\r\nRun cargo build.\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\nThe project should fetch the required alloy-* crates from the specified git repositories and build successfully.\r\n\r\n## Current Behavior\r\nCargo fails to find the required ^0.1.0 version of alloy-rpc-types, as it seems to be unavailable on crates.io. The error message suggests there might be a version that was updated and not re-vendored.\r\n\r\n## Error \r\n```\r\nerror: failed to select a version for the requirement `alloy-rpc-types = \"^0.1.0\"`\r\ncandidate versions found which didn't match: 0.0.0-reserved\r\nlocation searched: crates.io index\r\nrequired by package `foundry-common v0.2.0 (https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry#b320027a)`\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Possible Solutions\r\nIf alloy-rpc-types is an internal dependency or is located in a different repository, could you please advise on how to include it correctly?\r\nIf the version ^0.1.0 is supposed to be available on crates.io, could there be a missing publish step?\r\nIf this is an issue with vendoring, would it be possible to get instructions on how to vendor the necessary crates for chisel?\r\n\r\n",
