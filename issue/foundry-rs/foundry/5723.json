A CLI flag can be added to load the `.env` file from another directory. This will be helpful if Foundry is used within a monorepo that uses a single `.env` file.\r\n\r\nThe lines that load the `.env` file can be seen here:\r\nhttps://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/95a93cd397f25f3f8d49d2851eb52bc2d52dd983/crates/cli/src/utils/mod.rs#L189C13-L204\r\n\r\nI would also like to work on this.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nThe code can be seen below:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\npub fn load_dotenv() {\r\n    let load = |p: &Path| {\r\n        dotenvy::from_path(p.join(\".env\")).ok();\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    // we only want the .env file of the cwd and project root\r\n    // `find_project_root_path` calls `current_dir` internally so both paths are either both `Ok` or\r\n    // both `Err`\r\n    if let (Ok(cwd), Ok(prj_root)) = (std::env::current_dir(), find_project_root_path(None)) {\r\n        load(&prj_root);\r\n        if cwd != prj_root {\r\n            // prj root and cwd can be identical\r\n            load(&cwd);\r\n        }\r\n    };\r\n}\r\n```",
