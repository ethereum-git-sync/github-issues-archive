It's gotten up to 2GiB (and because I'm running these in k8s they oom and restart), but shows no signs of leveling out.\r\n\r\nThis repros on linux and mac, and I have some traces below which were generated on mac. I used https://crates.io/crates/cargo-instruments to generate these traces. Here was the exact command, run in the foundry repo:\r\n\r\n`cargo +nightly instruments --time-limit 60000  --template Allocations --bin anvil -- --block-time 1`\r\n\r\nWhich generated the below trace.\r\n\r\n[anvil_Allocations_2022-08-22_104618-550.trace.zip](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/files/9395570/anvil_Allocations_2022-08-22_104618-550.trace.zip)\r\n\r\nIt seems a lot of the memory is being held in the in-memory-db from block creation.\r\n<img width=\"390\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-08-22 at 11 01 48 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1594551/185957395-6ba64fc9-a7c5-4888-b296-c0e118fb7c6d.png\">\r\n\r\nIt'd be great if there were some limit here (and maybe persisting to disk if necessary?) that could be configurable\r\n",
