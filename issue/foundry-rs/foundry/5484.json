  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Have you ensured that all of these are up to date?\n\n- [X] Foundry\n- [X] Foundryup\n\n### What version of Foundry are you on?\n\n_No response_\n\n### What command(s) is the bug in?\n\nforge test\n\n### Operating System\n\nLinux\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nI was trying to run write and run some unit tests for the custom token when I got an issue that tests never finish. I tried to find the reason for this empirically, by commenting out the newly added tests. I found out that the following method was the problem, without previously running it after deployment:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n    function ownerOfBatch(uint256[] calldata ids) external view returns (address[] memory owners) {\r\n        owners = new address[](ids.length);\r\n        for (uint256 i; i < ids.length; ) {\r\n            owners[i] = _owners[ids[i]];\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nTest for this method was:\r\n```solidity\r\n function test_ownersOf_userTokenOwner() public {\r\n        address to = makeAddr(\"to\");\r\n        erc1155d.exposed_mintBatch(to, ArrayUtils._asUint256Array(1, 1), \"\");\r\n\r\n        assertEq(\r\n            erc1155d.ownerOfBatch(ArrayUtils._asUint256Array(1, 1)),\r\n            ArrayUtils._asAddressArray(1, to)\r\n        );\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs can be seen above, this is an infinite loop, as `i` is never incremented. When I tried to run it locally after deployment to a localhost, the output was the following:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n cast call 0xe7f1725E7734CE288F8367e1Bb143E90bb3F0512 \"ownerOfBatch(uint256[])\" [1]\r\nError: \r\n(code: -32603, message: EVM error OutOfGas, data: None)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is working as expected, the transaction will eventually run out of gas, but following this error, I would expect the test to revert in case the transaction runs out of gas for whatever reason.\r\nWithout a revert, I assume it would be really hard to find what causes the test suite to be stuck.",
