The issue can be reproduced in Chisel with\r\n```\r\nbytes memory v = \"0xababab\"\r\n```\r\nwhere `v` returns the following:\r\n```\r\nType: dynamic bytes\r\n├ Hex (Memory):\r\n├─ Length ([0x00:0x20]): 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000008\r\n├─ Contents ([0x20:..]): 0x3078616261626162000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\r\n├ Hex (Tuple Encoded):\r\n├─ Pointer ([0x00:0x20]): 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000020\r\n├─ Length ([0x20:0x40]): 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000008\r\n└─ Contents ([0x40:..]): 0x3078616261626162000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe issue seems to persist in Forge as well, as the automated tests fail in [this repo](https://github.com/alexotsu/pelusa) but pass if I copy the steps manually in Remix.\r\n\r\nI try to pass a long bytestring beginning with `0x60a06040523480156100` as a function into an argument that calls `create2` under the hood, and you can see in the stacktrace that it is handling bytes in the same way as Chisel. This issue can be reproduced with `forge test -vvvvv`.\r\n\r\nRelevant part of the test:\r\n```\r\naddress _exploiter = exploiterDeployer.deploySimple(\"0x60a0604052348015610010...)\r\n```\r\nRelevant part of the stacktrace:\r\n```\r\n[8937393460516208730] ExploiterDeployer::deploySimple(0x307836306130363034303532333438303135363130303130...)\r\n```",
