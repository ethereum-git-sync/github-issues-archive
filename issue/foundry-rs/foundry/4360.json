  "body": "### Component\r\n\r\nAnvil\r\n\r\n### Describe the feature you would like\r\n\r\nWhen sending an EIP-1559 transaction, strictly speaking, both `maxFeePerGas` and `maxPriorityFeePerGas` fields should be set. However, many clients (including Anvil) allow setting only `maxFeePerGas`  or only `maxPriorityFeePerGas`. In the case of Anvil, `1000000000` seems to be the default value for `maxFeePerGas` if the transaction does not have this field.\r\n\r\nWhen validating an EIP-1559 transaction, it is checked that the sender has enough funds, i.e. `sender.balance >= maxFeePerGas * gasLimit`.\r\n\r\nNow consider the following scenario:\r\n- we want to send an EIP-1559 transaction from an account that does not have any funds (either through impersonating or sending an unsigned tx)\r\n- we are working on a chain with the base fee set to 0\r\n- we only want to specify `maxPriorityFeePerGas` in the transaction (it will be set to 0)\r\n\r\nIn this case, the actual price of the gas consumed will be 0, but the condition `sender.balance >= maxFeePerGas * gasLimit` checks that the sender has at least `1000000000` wei.\r\n\r\nInstead of the hardcoded value, it might be more sensible to use the base fee of the pending block instead. My proposal is to use `max_priority_fee_per_gas + pending_block.base_fee` as the default value for `max_fee_per_gas`. This way, the transaction in the described scenario would succeed, because `max_fee_per_gas` would be set to 0.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_",
