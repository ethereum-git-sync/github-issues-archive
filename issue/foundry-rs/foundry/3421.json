  "body": "### Component\r\n\r\nForge\r\n\r\n### Describe the feature you would like\r\n\r\nIt's currently impossible to load a non-utf8 encoded file. Would be useful to have another `vm.readFile` cheatcode which would return bytes instead of string.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nTo give a specific example. I work at Aztec and we are working on rewriting all our tests in Foundry. We are currently blocked by not having this feature because our [verifier tests](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-connect/blob/b0a71b01c5f1aa3b4b9a61d417aa4c479e01ef47/blockchain/src/contracts/verifier/fixtures/get_rollup_data.ts#L5) are dependent on loading a binary file. We could work around it by hardcoding the data to a solidity file but that would be a bit \"hacky\".",
