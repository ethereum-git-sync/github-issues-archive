  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nFor certain tests I need to get the block hashes of many different blocks. I can do this using `ffi` to call `cast` from terminal, but this ends up being very slow (I'm guessing because it needs to do a subroutine call each time?). It would be great if some cast commands like `eth_getBlock`, `eth_getProof` could be available from within forge test. Even better, if the forge fork caching worked on these requests.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
