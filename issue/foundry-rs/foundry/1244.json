I added some `assert(false)` in my contracts, which should definitely blow up some tests, but I'm still getting the same.\r\n\r\nSome things I've tried:\r\n- removing `cache/`\r\n- removing `out/`, but there is no `out/` folder even after `forge build`\r\n- `forge test --force`, same thing\r\n- `forge test --run-all`, same thing\r\n- eventually, what resolved my issue was deleting a symlink I had created in src/, pointing to a folder in one of the submodules in lib/. \r\n\r\nThe context for the symlink is that I was trying to find a way to import a dependency that would work for both hardhat and foundry. I was able to deploy using hardhat with the symlink, but that turned out to break my foundry build/tests. I can go back to using the remapping, but that breaks hardhat deploys...\r\n",

Not sure if that installs latest nightly.  Also, maybe my cache was in a weird state from prior version but I don't think so (because I did a --force using latest after installing latest). I'll try to catch the sequence of events that leads to this. In case it's not obvious, the problem is that I asked for a test to be run, but got silent nothing, until I asked again with --force.  If the `-m` search finds nothing, it could be because there are dirty files that didn't get recompiled. Maybe at the least a message should be emitted that no matching test was found?",

Your next forge test/build (without the force) won't rebuild the file that had the error if that file hasn't been touched.\r\n\r\nMaybe there's a philosophical issue here. Personally I expect if a file has errors, the build command should retry the build irrespective of whether it thinks the compilation source changed. Warnings may deserve a --force to rebuild. Better would be the --strict you previously suggested, where *only* the files with warnings would be rebuilt (vs all files).",
