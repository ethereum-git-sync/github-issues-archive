  "body": "### Component\n\nAnvil\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\n## Feature: Distributed Tracing for Anvil\r\n\r\nIn order to make a system observable, it must be instrumented. That is, the code must emit [traces](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/observability-primer/#distributed-traces), [metrics](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/observability-primer/#reliability--metrics), and [logs](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/observability-primer/#logs). The instrumented data must then be sent to an Observability back-end. There are a number of Observability back-ends out there, ranging from self-hosted open-source tools (e.g. [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/) and [Zipkin](https://zipkin.io/)), to commercial SAAS offerings. This feature request asks for Open Telemetry to be integrated into Anvil. \r\n\r\nFor reference, Hyperledger Besu has support for OTEL. \r\n\r\n## Example: OTEL Config w/ docker-compose\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n# otel-collector-config.yml:\r\nreceivers:\r\n  otlp:\r\n    protocols:\r\n      grpc:\r\n      http:\r\n\r\nexporters:\r\n  zipkin:\r\n    endpoint: \"http://zipkin:9411/api/v2/spans\"\r\n\r\nprocessors:\r\n  batch:\r\n\r\nextensions:\r\n  health_check:\r\n  pprof:\r\n  zpages:\r\n\r\nservice:\r\n  extensions: [pprof, zpages, health_check]\r\n  pipelines:\r\n    traces:\r\n      receivers: [otlp]\r\n      exporters: [zipkin]\r\n      processors: [batch]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n# docker-compose.yml\r\nversion: \"3\"\r\nservices:\r\n  otel-collector:\r\n    image: otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.11.0\r\n    command: [\"--config=/etc/otel-collector-config.yml\"]\r\n    volumes:\r\n      - ./otel-collector-config.yml:/etc/otel-collector-config.yml\r\n    ports:\r\n      - \"1888:1888\"   # pprof extension\r\n      - \"8888:8888\"   # Prometheus metrics exposed by the collector\r\n      - \"8889:8889\"   # Prometheus exporter metrics\r\n      - \"13133:13133\" # health_check extension\r\n      - \"55680:55680\" # zpages extension\r\n    depends_on:\r\n      - zipkin\r\n  foundry:\r\n    image: manifoldfinance/foundry\r\n    container_name: foundry\r\n    command:\r\n      - '--config.file=/etc/foundry/foundry.toml'\r\n    ports:\r\n      - 9090:9090\r\n    restart: unless-stopped\r\n    networks:\r\n      - overlay\r\n    deploy:\r\n      endpoint_mode: vip\r\n    volumes:\r\n      - ./foundry:/etc/foundry\r\n      - forge_data:/foundry\r\n    environment:\r\n      ETH_RPC_URL: development\r\n      DAPP_SOLC_VERSION: 0.8.15\r\n      DAPP_TEST_VERBOSITY: 1\r\n  working_dir: /usr/src/app\r\n  volumes:\r\n    - .:/usr/src/app:cached\r\n    - .:/opt/solc:cached\r\n\r\n  #Zipkin\r\n  zipkin:\r\n    image: openzipkin/zipkin\r\n    container_name: zipkin\r\n    ports:\r\n      - 9411:9411\r\n      - ```\n\n### Additional context\n\n\r\npart of https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/2396",
