Turns out I have `libusb` in `/usr/local/Cellar`, which means brew installed `libusb` for x86_64. I resolved the issue with the following commands: \r\n\r\n```bash\r\nrm -rf /usr/local/Cellar/libusb\r\n# install a clean arm64 version of libusb\r\nbrew uninstall libusb\r\nbrew install libusb\r\n# in the foundry root folder\r\ncargo clean\r\ncargo build\r\n./target/debug/forge --version\r\n# it should now output something like forge 0.2.0 (3c3221e 2022-04-18T20:51:02.159301+00:00)\r\n```",
