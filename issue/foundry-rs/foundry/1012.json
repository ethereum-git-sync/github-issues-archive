Flattening removes license information from the imported files.  \r\n\r\nWorst case scenario, this could result in a more permissive license on an imported restrictive license library being used.  \r\nChanging licenses on open source software is a bad outcome.\r\n\r\n## Import context\r\nFlattened files lose import context.  \r\n\r\nIt makes it more complex to quickly identify what is imported code and what is unique to the contract.  Especially for ERC20/ERC721 using common implementations from OpenZeppelin Contracts or solmate.\r\n\r\nTools like https://github.com/dethcrypto/ethereum-code-viewer#readme allow verified contracts to be opened in VS Code\r\n\r\nCompare the rich information in multi-file verification from Remix: https://rinkeby.etherscan.deth.net/address/0x88262f5db936d54f8a6ab2994e049dbc7b0436b9#code with the flattened version from Foundry: https://rinkeby.etherscan.deth.net/address/0x419aacdf7b24929a95f3ed87e8269743f2eeabaf#code\r\n\r\n## Additional\r\nThe two arguments I have come across for flattening is:\r\n* Make auditing easier, compare deployed contracts (I hope open in VS Code resolves this)\r\n* Make copypasta easier (I don't think this is a benefit or something we want to encourage)\r\n\r\n\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
