You cannot also include some kind of string to let the person reading the output what its for. You need to do a separate console log that looks like this\r\n\r\n```\r\nconsole.log(\"--- SOME EXPLANATION ---\");\r\nconsole.logBytes32(theThing);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWould be really great if you could just combine both of these into one call that looks like \r\n`console.log(\"some explanation: %s\", someBytes32String);`\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_",
