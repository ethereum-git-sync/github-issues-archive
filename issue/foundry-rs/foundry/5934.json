With the development of [vypers-rs](https://github.com/crypdoughdoteth/vyper-rs) vyper now has rust compiler bindings (and additional ones can be added as needed but it's current stage should support it. [vypers-rs] can both auto-detect and install a new version of vyper if needed, and keeps it all contained within venvs.\r\n\r\nPlan would be to a feature flag supporting Vyper initially, then as it stabilizes gradually add it to the default\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
