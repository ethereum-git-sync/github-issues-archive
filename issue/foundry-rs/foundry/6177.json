  "body": "## Description:\r\nThe latest script run result file is named `run-latest.json` but other runs has a timestamp attached which makes it easier to identify when the script was run. But to find the timestamp of the latest run we have to manually find it via one of the transaction hashes from the broadcast file. \r\n\r\n## Possible workaround:\r\nIt would be nice to add the timestamp to the latest run as well. \r\nThe resulting file name would be something like `run-latest-<TIMESTAMP>.json`. \r\n\r\nI'm happy to take this on if you think this would be a reasonable change.
