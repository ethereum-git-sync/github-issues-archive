This gasstation has recently (this week) stopped being available. \r\n\r\nWe are ourselves in the middle of switching over to https://gasstation.polygon.technology/v2 for gas-fee estimation for Polygon mainnet. \r\n\r\nWithout having dug deeply in the underlying code for `forge`, I assume that `forge` may need to do something similar.",
