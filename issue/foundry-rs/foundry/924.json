This could be seen as a good first issue, minor polishing task.\r\n\r\nHere is an example install via ssh-git url that fails:\r\n```bash\r\noliver ~> forge install git@github.com:Rari-Capital/solmate.git\r\nInstalling git in \"/home/oliver/ghq/github.com/OliverNChalk/custody-vault/lib/git\", (url: https://github.com/git, tag: Some(\"github.com:Rari-Capital/solmate.git\"))\r\nError:\r\n   0: No such file or directory (os error 2)\r\n\r\nLocation:\r\n   cli/src/cmd/install.rs:157\r\n\r\nBacktrace omitted.\r\nRun with RUST_BACKTRACE=1 environment variable to display it.\r\nRun with RUST_BACKTRACE=full to include source snippets.\r\n```",

No need to setup up ssh-agent or use custom tooling on the client side. This is the biggest benefit of ssh schema: set up once and it just works.\r\n\r\nBut this is really going on a tangent. I'm mostly curious about this: `not everyone is using SSH with git and the modules would fail to pull`.
