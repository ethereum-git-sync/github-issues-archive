When creating an instance of `TxBuilder` on line 200 of `cli/src/cast.rs`, the chain is passed in from the environment variable. This means if you want to use etherscan to infer the function signature and haven't explicitly set the chain, it will fail due to it using the wrong etherscan endpoint.\r\n\r\n`cast send` doesn't even bother to allow the chain to be passed in via env variable, and simply calls the provider to get this information. I think this is probably the better behavior since it reduces the amount of configuration required.\r\n\r\nI'm working on a fix now for this now, but please let me know if there is a better solution, and I'd be happy to adjust.",
