    "body": "> It does work—I've been predicting/verifying create2 address in scripts. I think the issue is that when you predict the address that `msg.sender` is different than the one broadcasting the transaction\n\nThanks, can you please share what you use instead of msg.sender? Logging msg.sender in the scripts does display the correct address afaik.\n\nI did try very carefully to get this to work. So I would really appreciate it if you could share a snippit from your scripts @mds1 ",
