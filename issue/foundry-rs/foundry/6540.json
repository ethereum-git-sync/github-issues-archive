Message: Internal EVM errror` instead of `EvmError: Out of Fund`. \r\n\r\n**1. First script where an account with zero native ETH balance simply tries to deposit native ETH into the WETH contract**\r\n\r\n- Because the account has no native ETH and is attempting to deposit, it throws Out of Fund error as expected. \r\n\r\n```\r\n// Throws EvmError: Out of Fund \r\ncontract SendEthWithoutDeal is Script {\r\n   function run() public {\r\n        vm.startBroadcast(90743482286830539503240959006302832933333810038750515972785732718729991261126);    \r\n        WETH.deposit{ value: 100 ether }(); \r\n        vm.stopBroadcast();\r\n    } \r\n}\r\n```\r\n<img width=\"751\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-12-08 at 12 42 06 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/assets/64379343/b94cb7fb-920c-4c74-a41d-2628054e64af\">\r\n\r\n**2. Second script where I use `vm.deal` before making the WETH deposit** \r\n\r\n```\r\n// throws Application Panic Internal EVM Error  \r\ncontract SendEthWithDeal is Script {\r\n    function run() public {\r\n        vm.startBroadcast(90743482286830539503240959006302832933333810038750515972785732718729991261126);    \r\n        vm.deal(0x7d577a597B2742b498Cb5Cf0C26cDCD726d39E6e, 100 ether); \r\n        WETH.deposit{ value: 100 ether }(); \r\n        vm.stopBroadcast();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n<img width=\"931\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-12-08 at 12 44 06 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/assets/64379343/a3a55869-d316-40e3-9646-c3a310df1400\">\r\n\r\n`vm.deal` can be called before `vm.startBroadcast` and throws the same error message. \r\n\r\n**Note/Question** \r\n- Both \"scripts\" succeed, except the second case throws the panic on top of the success. \r\n- I'm also seeing that `vm.deal` does not create a transaction even inside `vm.startBroadcast`. Does this mean `vm.deal` was never meant to be used together with any broadcasting transactions and hence the error case here. \r\n",
