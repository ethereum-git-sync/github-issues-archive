Brownie makes heavy use of `eth_debugTraceTransaction`\r\n\r\nIt looks like anvil already has a stub for the rpc call that returns `Not implemented`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/b8733d4e2e10dc54928cefb62015a5c26ca5f473/anvil/src/eth/api.rs#L1140-L1147\r\n\r\n@gakonst said in telegram: \"I think we should already should be able to support geth style traces. Maybe we dont expose over rpc?\"\n\n### Additional context\n\nBrownie currently checks for `response[\"error\"][\"code\"] != -32601`, so changing anvil to do that in the mean time would be helpful.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/eth-brownie/brownie/blob/master/brownie/network/web3.py#L119-L131",
