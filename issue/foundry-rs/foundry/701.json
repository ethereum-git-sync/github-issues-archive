  "body": "## Feature: add calver to prefixed nightly versioning scheme\r\n\r\n\r\nUse  the **last commit date** rather than **build date** to avoid ending up with builds for different platforms having different version strings, etc.\r\n\r\ni.e. use some process to generate a version tag with a format like this: `nightly-2022.02.10`\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n```bash    \r\nTZ=UTC git show --quiet --date=\"format-local:%Y.%-m.%-d\" --format=\"nightly-%cd\" >nightly-release.txt\r\n```\r\n#### Output\r\n```bash\r\nnightly-2022.2.8\r\n```\r\n\r\nan alternative format is the one used by Solidity for its nightly releases if you would like commit information as well\r\n\r\n```\r\nsoljson-v0.8.11-nightly.2021.11.18+commit.2aeeef83.js\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Alternative: 3rd Party solution \r\n\r\nAn alternative is. using a 3rd party service, e.g:\r\n\r\n> Releases on GitHub can have assets attached to them. You can link to each of them, however you can't link to the assets of > the latest release. With a Git Releases link, you can skip updating your README or public website with a new download link > whenever a new release has been done. Instead it will always point to the right location.\r\n\r\nAvailable Asset URLs\r\n[gitreleases.dev/gh/gakonst/foundry/latest/foundry_man_nightly.tar.gz](https://gitreleases.dev/gh/gakonst/foundry/latest/foundry_man_nightly.tar.gz)\r\n[gitreleases.dev/gh/gakonst/foundry/latest/foundry_nightly_darwin_amd64.tar.gz](https://gitreleases.dev/gh/gakonst/foundry/latest/foundry_nightly_darwin_amd64.tar.gz)\r\n[gitreleases.dev/gh/gakonst/foundry/latest/foundry_nightly_linux_amd64.tar.gz](https://gitreleases.dev/gh/gakonst/foundry/latest/foundry_nightly_linux_amd64.tar.gz)",
