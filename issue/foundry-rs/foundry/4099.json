  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nCan we introduce batching of transactions made by wallets with different private keys and include them in the same block? So instead of waiting for the previous transaction to be mined, we can order the transactions and broadcast them all at once. As of now, it is waiting for confirmation from transaction made by wallet with private key x to proceed broadcasting the transaction made by private key y (shown in additional context)\n\n### Additional context\n\n```\r\n[⠢] Compiling...\r\nNo files changed, compilation skipped\r\nScript ran successfully.\r\n\r\n==========================\r\n\r\nEstimated total gas used for script: 58010\r\n\r\nEstimated amount required: 0.0005801 ETH\r\n\r\n==========================\r\n\r\n###\r\nFinding wallets for all the necessary addresses...\r\n##\r\nSending transactions [0 - 1].\r\n⠁ [00:00:01] [#################################>--------------------------------] 1/2 txes (1.2s)\r\n⠉ [00:00:07] [##############################################################] 1/1 receipts (0.0s)\r\n#####\r\n✅ Hash: 0x2ed7a4df9bf55806999ac7777463ae20267f98adfcb3af9ca61bcaba543b214b\r\nBlock: 26379340\r\nPaid: 0.00021 ETH (21000 gas * 10 gwei)\r\n\r\n⠉ [00:00:10] [##################################################################] 2/2 txes (0.0s)\r\n⠉ [00:00:07] [##############################################################] 1/1 receipts (0.0s)\r\n#####\r\n✅ Hash: 0xe41081004a74c83e90ebb1917254a41e65ec9ad8f4eeabecf7386b69c8da4317\r\nBlock: 26379344\r\nPaid: 0.00021 ETH (21000 gas * 10 gwei)\r\n\r\n\r\nTransactions saved to: /Users/******/run-latest.json\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n==========================\r\n```",
