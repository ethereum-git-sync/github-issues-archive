Events are part of a contract's ABI so it would be nice to include them in the generated interface. One use case is for testing event emissions in forge tests, another is for modifying the output to serve as the inputs for e.g. an ethers.js human-readable ABI definition\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
