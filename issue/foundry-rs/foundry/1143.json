    "body": "@benesjan What is the use case here/what are you trying to achieve with `tx.gasprice`?\r\n\r\n@gakonst @brockelmore So gas price is 0 because that is what we use to actually *execute* the transaction. The same is true of the block - the basefee is actually 0, but once execution starts the cheatcode handler replaces the block that the EVM sees with one configured by the user (or from the fork) that may have a basefee > 0.\r\n\r\nSo essentially:\r\n\r\n- Block always has 0 gas price, high gas limit from our POV, but from EVM POV these can be non-0\r\n- Transaction always has 0 gas price, since we do not replace tx info the same way as we do for blocks\r\n\r\nI see two paths forward:\r\n\r\n- We remove the gas price thing. I'm not sure how much that would break, but honestly, I can't really see any use case for it, given that we never surface the actual value spent on the call, only the gas consumed\r\n- We handle transactions the same way as blocks - this would only be the case for some parameters\r\n\r\nWdyt?",
