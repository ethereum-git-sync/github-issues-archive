  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nWhile invariant testing, filters can be used to establish a boundary in order to help the engine converge. The `targetSelectors()` filter requires the following struct to be previously declared:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n  struct FuzzSelector {\r\n      address addr;\r\n      bytes4[] selectors;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn order to prevent users from creating that struct across tests and to improve UX, it could be helpful to add that struct on the `Test.sol` file.\r\n\r\nAlso, if specific structures and functions are going to be needed for invariant testing, creating a new (e.g.) `InvariantTest.sol` automatically pushed to `forge-std/src` will help saving resources for those users who only want to perform regular tests allowing invariant testers to independently inherit that contract.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
