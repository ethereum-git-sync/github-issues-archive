I did,\r\n```\r\n$anvil --fork-url https://arbitrum-mainnet.infura.io/v3/$API_KEY\r\n``` \r\nAnd I also ran the follow script command,\r\n```\r\nforge script script/Contract.s.sol:ContractScript \\\r\n  --fork-url http://localhost:8545 \\\r\n  --private-key $ADMIN_PRIVATE \\\r\n  --broadcast\r\n```\r\n`$ADMIN_PRIVATE` is the first key returned from the anvil command output, which is `0xac...80`. However, I ran into\r\n```\r\nScript ran successfully.\r\n\r\n==========================\r\n\r\nEstimated total gas used for script: 3996881\r\n\r\nEstimated amount required: 0.007993762 ETH\r\n\r\n==========================\r\n\r\n###\r\nFinding wallets for all the necessary addresses...\r\n##\r\nSending transactions [0 - 0].\r\n\r\nTransactions saved to: broadcast/Contract.s.sol/42161/run-latest.json\r\n\r\nError:\r\nProviderError(JsonRpcError(JsonRpcError { code: -32003, message: \"Out of gas: required gas exceeds allowance: 0\", data: None }))\r\n```\r\nI verified that running locally `anvil --hardfork latest` and `anvil --fork-url https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/$APT_KEY` worked. I suspect this is due to account not having ETH on Arbitrum. Can someone please help me out? Thank you.",
