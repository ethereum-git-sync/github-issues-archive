  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nI would be nice if `forge inspect <file> storage-layout --pretty` would had an option like to set a width or column specific constraints. The change is probably trivial as https://docs.rs/comfy-table/6.0.0/comfy_table/struct.Column.html which is used to generate the table supports this out of the box, but i'm not sure what would be the best interface to accustom user needs without introducing to much configuration complexity.\r\n\r\nThe first thing i thought off might be to just allow a `--sizes=80,100,120` parameter which can set individual fixed sizes on columns. Wdyt?\r\n\n\n### Additional context\n\nI'm currently using foundry to generate a diff between two proxy implementations.\r\nTo generate a nice human readable diff using `storage-layout --pretty` comes in quite handy. One issue i'm facing though is that due to addition or renaming of variables the table layout might change causing git diff algorithm to assume everything has changed.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-|----------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------+--------+-------|\r\n-| _decimals                        | uint8                                                                                  | 5    | 0      | 1     |\r\n+|-------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+------+--------+-------|\r\n+| _decimals                           | uint8                                                        | 5    | 0      | 1     |\r\n```",

As i understand the comfy_table docs it should be possible to provide min/max/absolute size for each column.\r\n\r\nThe `forge inspect` command supports displaying almost any field in the artifacts generated by Forge. Some of them respond to `--pretty`, but not all of them are put in a table when `--pretty` is set. I can't really recall any others that are put into a table other than `storage_layout` so this flag would really only be for that single field\r\n\r\n>I'm doing the actual diff without the --pretty, but when generating the diff to be embedded inside a md the --pretty option would be nicer.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure I understand, - you diff without `--pretty` but the diff in the issue is with `--pretty`?

    "body": "Hi @onbjerg, any thoughts on this issue? I think there are a few overlapping concerns raised here, but one that we have run into is reliable storage diffs. Without `--pretty` comparing the json output usually results in `astId` mismatches, even though the storage is identical. With `--pretty` we may get some false differences due to formatting. Maybe something formatting agnostic like `--csv` would be simplest for the reliable diff use-case.",
