A common workflow that I have is to fuzz something and if it fails and I need to debug, I will copy the arguments from the trace and use them directly in the test itself, commenting out the arguments to the fuzz test so that it becomes a normal test. Any time that I do this with an address, I need to checksum the address myself so that the solidity will compile.\r\n\r\nAn additional nice to have would be formatting the input arguments that caused the failure in a nice way so that its easier to observe them and copy them out of the trace.",
