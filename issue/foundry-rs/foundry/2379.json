It'd be great to be able to do the same with arbitrary payloads.\r\n\r\nThis could be used to tinker around with all kinds of signed things:\r\n- ERC-712 messages. Currently there's no way to create or verify a `permit` payload.\r\n- Raw transactions. There's no way to verify an arbitrary supposedly signed transaction. There's also no way to manually build a transaction because it can't be signed.\r\n\r\nIt's crucial to be able to provide a raw 256-bit payload (hash) to be signed. Being able to provide a payload which needs to be hashed first would be a nice addition, but not necessary, it'd save a call to `cast keccak`.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_",
