  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nSometimes a call can revert, and being able to see a trace or use the debugger to understand why is useful.  The UX here would be adding `--trace` or `--debug` flags to `cast call`\r\n\r\nRight now you can probably work around this by starting anvil from a fork, using `cast send` to send a tx to anvil, then inspecting the failed tx with `cast run`\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
