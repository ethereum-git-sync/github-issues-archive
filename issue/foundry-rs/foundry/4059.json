  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nWhen an arithmetic operation occurs outside of an unchecked block the system will revert due to an arithmetic error ```[FAIL. Reason: Arithmetic over/underflow]```. This can be due to either a subtraction underflowing zero or an operation overflowing the maximum integer overflowing the maximum int value allocated. I would like the error message to be slightly more informative, telling me if the issue was due to an integer overflowing or if it was due to an integer underflowing. This would make identifying the location of the bug as well as the reason much simpler. It would also be helpful if the error message could include data such as the values that caused the error. For example, \"Integer underflowed, a - b\" and then showing what the inputs to the opcode were similar to how a failed assertion displays the information.\r\n\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
