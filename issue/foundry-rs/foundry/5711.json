On normal development process, `dev` and `main` branches should be locked and accessible through PRs, that may be squashed and merged into, so the \"latest commit\" from which the docs are generated ends up being inexistent.\r\n\r\n- Add a way of specifying a commit hash or a github tag to the \"source code\"\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
