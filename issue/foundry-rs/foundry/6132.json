Today, after running `foundryup`, it started created bad contracts with empty bytecode.\r\n\r\nI went to the nightly builds and kept trying different builds until it worked again. It finally worked at build `5be158b`. I feel like it has been broken in the nightly builds since, but it takes a long time to install each so I could not verify each of them (some of them even failed to install)",
