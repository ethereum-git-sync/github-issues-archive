  "body": "Currently the only way to see where an assertion failed in a fuzz test is by changing the fuzz test to a concrete one and re-running it\r\n\r\nWe should show assertions on failed fuzz tests the same way we do for concrete tests. To do this:\r\n1. Grab the logs (the unused return value) from the output of [`call_raw `](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/blob/3e8c9979e2b8836fccdb16e10be9a21862a9c81a/evm-adapters/src/fuzz.rs#L81)\r\n2. Bubble up those logs in the returned [`FuzzTestResult`](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/blob/3e8c9979e2b8836fccdb16e10be9a21862a9c81a/evm-adapters/src/fuzz.rs#L122) (adding a `logs` field to the `FuzzError` struct seems ideal)\r\n3. Modify [`cli/src/cmd/test.rs`](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/blob/master/cli/src/cmd/test.rs) to print the logs on failure\r\n\r\nI'm going to take a shot at implementing this sometime this week",
