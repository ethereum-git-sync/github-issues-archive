My contract calls the function remove_liquidity_one_coin with all of the proper parameters and approvals in place. For whatever reason, the test fails and I get a revert. \r\n\r\nWhen I test with a stack trace, the stack trace leads to nowhere, and I can see that the emitted transfer event of sending the curve zap pool sending USDC back to my contract goes through successfully.\r\n\r\nAt this point I am just trying to nail down where exactly this error is originating from. I have included a picture of the stack trace at the bottom. The empty () simply leads back to the start of the test, not a particular function call.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66784124/178846518-f358627c-6198-4348-8d0c-d2d353bd4f57.png)\r\n",
