It occasionally does.\r\n\r\nBut 95% of the time or more, I receive an error about gas estimation or an error about mismatched nonces from the provider.\r\n\r\nWhen it is an error about gas estimation, it can be before it sends any transactions. Or, it can deploy the library first, continuing onto the transactions defined in my script, and error about gas estimation when it reaches the transaction that will deploy my contract - the second out of three script defined transactions. \r\n\r\nRight now, I am deploying to Arbitrum Goerli and it is constantly failing although it has occasionally succeeded in the past.\r\n",

So it is important that you have exact steps for reproducing, or we won't be able to prioritize it.\r\n\r\nAppreciate the understanding, it is part of our culture to have repros and would like everyone to respect that :)",
