  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Have you ensured that all of these are up to date?\n\n- [X] Foundry\n- [X] Foundryup\n\n### What version of Foundry are you on?\n\nforge 0.2.0 (2c25b89 2022-11-09T00:07:40.191383165Z)\n\n### What command(s) is the bug in?\n\nforge test\n\n### Operating System\n\nLinux\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nWe have a test suite that runs a lot of fork tests which deal ETH to a fresh address, prank that address and run a situational test from that address. For example:\r\n```js\r\nuint256 fromPrivateKey = 0x1234;\r\naddress from = vm.addr(fromPrivateKey);\r\nvm.createSelectFork(vm.envString(\"FORK_URL\"), blockNum);\r\nvm.startPrank(from);\r\nvm.deal(from, 1 ether);\r\n\r\n// run simple send simulation\r\naddress(recipient).call{value: 0.1 ether }(\"\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nIntermittently (~1/20 test runs) the `deal` call seems to fail to actually deal ETH to the address. This results in an error: `EvmError: OutOfFund` -- this is a native evm error that the account didn't have enough ETH to pay for gas.\r\n\r\nStrangely, if checking the balance first like `assertEq(from.balance, 1 ether)`, the check passes. \r\n\r\nNote that on similar but non-fork tests this intermittent error never happens. Seems to be related to interplay between vm.createSelectFork and vm.deal. Let me know what other info I can provide",
