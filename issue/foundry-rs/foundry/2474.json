(Basically this would be a more versatile version of the `--slow` flag, which would be equivalent to adding `vm.mine()` after every broadcasted tx)\r\n- Ensure that the on-chain-simulation step reflects usage of the `--slow` flag\r\n- Provide a command line option to disable the on-chain simulation step\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_",
