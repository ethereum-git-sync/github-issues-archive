  "body": "### Summary\r\nNoticed some unexpected behavior with remappings and imports when migrating from hardhat. Most npm package dependencies start with the '@' character which are handled perfectly, however this is not the case for all of them. In this case the library is [prb-math](https://github.com/paulrberg/prb-math). A typical solidity import for this library looks like `import \"prb-math/contracts...\"` instead of the usual `import \"@uniswap/v3-periphery..\"` with the '@' character which might be the key to the error.\r\n\r\n### Reproduce the issue\r\n1. `mkdir forge-example`\r\n2. `forge init`\r\n3. `forge build` (This should work)\r\n4. `forge install paulrberg/prb-math`\r\n5.  Add `import \"prb-math/contracts/PRBMathUD60x18.sol\";` to `src/Contract.sol`\r\n6. `touch remappings.txt`\r\n7. Add `prb-math/=lib/prb-math/` to `remappings.txt`\r\n8. `forge build` -- This fails with `Error 0: .../forge-example/lib/prb-math/contracts/contracts/PRBMathUD60x18.sol\": No such file or directory (os error 2)`\r\n\r\n### Current Fix\r\nI was able to fix this by manually changing the import to `import \"@prb-math/contracts/PRBMathUD60x18.sol\";` in `Contract.sol` and the corresponding remapping to `@prb-math/=lib/prb-math/`, but this might be an issue when dealing with multiple imports across different libraries. This led me to believe that foundry might have a hard-coded dependency on the import statements starting with the '@' character.\r\n\r\n### System specs\r\nI'm running a 2017 MBP with macOS 11.6 and an Intel processor\r\n",
