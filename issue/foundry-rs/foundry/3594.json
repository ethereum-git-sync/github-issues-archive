    "body": "@mds1 tbh got mixed feelings about this as it blurs the lines of what the inline config item is exactly. currently, we can define it as a comment that starts with `forgefmt:`\r\nalso, not sure if it's worth applying to any other config items. e.g. if `forgefmt: disable-start` occurs in the middle or end of comment, would we format any preceding content or not\r\ntldr; i'd keep the current behavior as is, because it provides clear understanding of how inline config works",
