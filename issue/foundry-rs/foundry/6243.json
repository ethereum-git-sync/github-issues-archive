  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Have you ensured that all of these are up to date?\n\n- [X] Foundry\n- [X] Foundryup\n\n### What version of Foundry are you on?\n\nforge 0.2.0 (059aa45 2023-11-07T08:13:53.055005635Z)\n\n### What command(s) is the bug in?\n\nforge script\n\n### Operating System\n\nLinux\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nWhen running `forge script` on the new Arbitrum Sepolia Testnet (chain ID: `421614`) the following error is thrown:\r\n\r\n`(code: -32000, message: intrinsic gas too low, data: None)`\r\n\r\nMy EOA has ample ETH balance and I've tried running the script with a higher gas limit (ex: `24000000`), but it still fails.\r\n\r\nThis seems similar to a previous issue for Arbitrum Goerli: https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/3487\r\n\r\nThe temporary fix in that thread was to do the following:\r\n\r\n> Ok I managed to get the script working...\r\n> \r\n> I had to pass --skip-simulation\r\n> \r\n> The estimated gas usage with simulation was 1,859,794\r\n> \r\n> Without simulation, the gas limit was set to ~20M while the gas used was ~14M\r\n> \r\n> So the gas estimation is off. Does forge estimate gas with the local EVM (rEVM?)? Does it call out to the provider?\r\n\r\nPassing `--skip-simulation` worked and the transactions went through, but it seems that the broadcast information is incomplete and does not contain information such as \"contractName\" and \"arguments\". Transactions that should have a type of `CREATE` now have a type of `CALL` instead.\r\n\r\nExample broadcast JSON snippet:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"transactions\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"hash\": \"0x307ee35d60d3b35860c75a7cc06e9263430c5470151bab39d8b2be13db850a9e\",\r\n      \"transactionType\": \"CALL\",\r\n      \"contractName\": null,\r\n      \"contractAddress\": null,\r\n      \"function\": null,\r\n      \"arguments\": null,\r\n    ...\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nvs. what it should look like:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"transactions\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"hash\": \"0x307ee35d60d3b35860c75a7cc06e9263430c5470151bab39d8b2be13db850a9e\",\r\n      \"transactionType\": \"CREATE\",\r\n      \"contractName\": \"ERC20Mintable\",\r\n      \"contractAddress\": \"0xCb10ddAE13dEA1513291589dE9364dF6A645504b\",\r\n      \"function\": null,\r\n      \"arguments\": [\r\n        \"Wrapped BTC\",\r\n        \"WBTC\",\r\n        \"8\",\r\n        \"0xbcbedde8ea16ef6724fa667f4dc63a74d8a42b09\"\r\n      ],\r\n    ...\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is an issue since my scripts rely on this broadcast information to retrieve addresses of recently deployed contracts.\r\n\r\n### Probable Cause\r\n\r\nThe problem in the previous issue was related to the new Arbitrum testnet not being included in these functions:\r\nhttps://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/35b450054e59cb7c5026be433a98fbd5cbfda94c/crates/cli/src/utils/cmd.rs#L170C82-L170C96\r\nhttps://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/35b450054e59cb7c5026be433a98fbd5cbfda94c/crates/cli/src/utils/cmd.rs#L178\r\n\r\nArbitrum Sepolia likely needs to be added there as well.",
