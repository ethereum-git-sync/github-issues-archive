  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nProblem: In a situation with a lot of test files, the dependency paths of test files cannot be entangled. This leads to a situation, where a change at one of the chore contracts (ChoreContract.sol) will lead to a very long compilation time of all test files.\r\n\r\nSolution: Add a command like `--build-only \"test/unit/this-one-file.t.sol\"`. In this case, a change to ChoreContract.sol will a) rebuild all files in src/ that import this contract, but b) no file in the test folder, except `test/unit/this-one-file.t.sol`. This will reduce the build time of tests, and make sure that fast iterations loops can happen at a late project phase (\"Tests need to run fast.\", [Uncle Bob](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/09/03/TestTime.html)).\r\n\r\nAddition: As this will be run with the ´--watch´ option most of the time, maybe the same logic could be applied that checks which tests to re-run. The logic would then be extended to only re-compile this file. \n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
