I've already implemented some of those internals here: (https://github.com/polytope-labs/solidity-merkle-trees/blob/seun/merkle-multi-proof/test/src/helpers.rs#L94-L151).\r\n\r\nAnd i've implemented a test using those internals here: (https://github.com/polytope-labs/solidity-merkle-trees/blob/seun/merkle-multi-proof/test/src/lib.rs).\r\n\r\nThe only issue to make this support complete is that foundry doesn't seem to deploy user libraries when used as a lib, which is needed for the test contract.\r\n\r\nHappy to send a PR to this effect just need some pointers on how to deploy user solidity libs.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
