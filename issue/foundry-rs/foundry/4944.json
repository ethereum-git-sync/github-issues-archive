  "body": "### Component\r\n\r\nForge\r\n\r\n### Describe the feature you would like\r\n\r\nI'm suggesting Foundry to verify contracts on [Sourcify](https://sourcify.dev/) by default on `forge create --verify` or `forge verify-contract`, event without `--verification-provider sourcify` or `--verifier sourcify`.\r\n\r\nTo foster decentralization in Ethereum source-code verification and increase \"full match\" adoption, I am suggesting Foundry verifies the contracts on Sourcify alongside Etherscan unless another verifier is explicitly stated with `--verifier` or `--verification-provider`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nSourcify is an [open-source](https://github.com/ethereum/sourcify) [multi-EVM ](https://docs.sourcify.dev/docs/chains/)chain smart contract verification service. The verified contract repository is accessible to everyone and [pinned on IPFS](https://docs.sourcify.dev/docs/repository/), without Sourcify being the single data owner. Additionally, Sourcify makes use of the [Solidity Contract Metadata](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/metadata.html) and its IPFS hash appended to the bytecode to achieve [\"full match\"](https://docs.sourcify.dev/docs/full-vs-partial-match/)es, that is, a byte-by-byte match of the original deployed source code (See in action on https://playground.sourcify.dev/)\r\n\r\nIt is important to have tooling support because if not done directly on the contract development and deployment pipeline, source code verification gets more difficult, especially because the contract metadata hash is easily affected by smaller changes. \r\n\r\nDisclaimer: I am working on the project Sourcify \r\n",
