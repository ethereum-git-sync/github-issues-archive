Currently it looks as if foundry lists the files alphabetically (see [this recent verification on master](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0x7c47728c1920041431800f47f0cdecf186ee1abb#code))\r\n\r\nfor files 2-n, not sure how they do it but based on my very limited experience hh seemed to do a good job of some kind of reverse relevance sorting (see [older verification w hh](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2ed6c4B5dA6378c7897AC67Ba9e43102Feb694EE#code))\r\n\r\ndebated whether to label this as a bug or feature, but feature ultimately felt more appropriate",
