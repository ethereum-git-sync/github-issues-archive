The remapping in my root directory for solmate is as such:\r\n\r\nsolmate/=lib/solmate/\r\n\r\nHowever, I rely on another submodule, that has it's own remapping of solmate, which is like this:\r\n\r\nsolmate/=lib/solmate/src\r\n\r\nSince the lib I use is mapped to the remapping above, my tests will not run, because forge is trying to apply my remappings to the files inside lib. \r\n\r\nIs there an option to exclude certain paths from the remappping? How can i resolve this?",
