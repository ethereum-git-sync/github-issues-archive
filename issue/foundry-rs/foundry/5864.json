This process can be cumbersome and disrupt the workflow, especially when frequent interaction with Foundry is required during development.\r\n\r\nSo I've develope foundry plugin for IntelliJ IDEA(IntelliJ, Webstrom). Integrating this Foundry plugin into the JetBrains plugin would greatly benefit developers who use IntelliJ IDEA or WebStorm for their projects. \r\n\r\nhttps://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/22751-foundry\r\n\r\n![screenshot](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/assets/10525011/8de5a13d-ef46-4414-9517-03585064652d)\r\n\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
