For instance, you can answer questions such as:\r\n\r\n- Which devs are using `solmate`, and which are using `open-zeppelin`?\r\n- Chronologically, when has each package been used? Do we see a shift over time?\r\n\r\nTo query the codebase to search for such a pattern, we can specify an [AST selector](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/selectors) as it would be accepted by Forge Lint.  \r\n\r\n> AST selector is supported on  [AST Explorer](https://astexplorer.net/) for solidity. \r\n\r\nFor instance, to search for console.log() calls in javascript, the [ESLint selector would be](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/developer-guide/selectors)\r\n\r\n```console\r\n\"CallExpression[callee.object.name=console][callee.property.name=log]\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Other use cases\r\n\r\nThis could be used to help automate refactoring, finding regressions, etc\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
