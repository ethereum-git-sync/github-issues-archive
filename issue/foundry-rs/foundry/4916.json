    "body": "when saying \"set the default to Shanghai\" does this mean 1) the compiler will target shanghai without needing to specify `evm_version` and 2) that `anvil` will also use the shanghai EVM? and i'm also curious is shanghai available for anvil now (as a non-default) and if not how do i know which EVM version anvil is running? \r\n\r\nand one question.. what is the default evm_version now for foundry when compiling? paris? i was thinking it might be nice to have some version flag on forge / anvil cli to see which evm version is set.
