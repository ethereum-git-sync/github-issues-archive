This error will prevent progress to the broadcast step\r\n\r\nIf a transaction has been dropped from the mempool, then `wait_for_receipts` can never succesfully execute, and the dropped transaction can never be re-broadcast.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nInstead of invoking `wait_for_receipts` via `wait_for_pending`,a resume should invoke a new function `resume_check_pending` that does the following:\r\n\r\n- Attempts to retrieve the pending receipt\r\n- If unsuccessful, attempts to retrieve the tx from mempool\r\n- If unsuccessful, deletes the tx hash from pending so that it will be rebroadcast\r\n\r\nThis function should NOT use the `PendingTransaction` struct, as that will be less reliable",
