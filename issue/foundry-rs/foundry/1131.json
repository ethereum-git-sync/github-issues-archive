  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\n`forge test --sweep` would be identical to `forge test`, but instead of running for a single solc version, it runs for either:\r\n1. An auto-detected range of versions that are compatible with all pragmas in your project, or\r\n2. A hard-coded range of versions specified in `foundry.toml`, e.g. `solc-sweep-versions` lets you define either a valid pragma, or an array of explicit versions (either is fine I think, supporting both would be great)\r\n\r\nIf `solc-sweep-versions` is defined in the config that is used, otherwise auto-detection is used.\r\n\r\nThe use case I have in mind here is running this in CI to ensure your pragmas are actually valid, which is especially useful for libraries that try to cover a wide range\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
