  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Have you ensured that all of these are up to date?\n\n- [X] Foundry\n- [ ] Foundryup\n\n### What version of Foundry are you on?\n\nforge 0.2.0 (cce3a44 2022-07-20T00:34:27.703293Z)\n\n### What command(s) is the bug in?\n\nforge fmt\n\n### Operating System\n\nWindows\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nHello there!\r\n\r\nNothing major but I believe the formatting is a bit odd in some cases. Two cases I noticed:\r\n\r\n* Opening brace goes to the next line when the line is long (but not too long!):\r\n\r\n  _Before_:\r\n  ```\r\n          if (something() || somethingElse() || anotherThing() || someOtherThin()) {\r\n              return false;\r\n          }\r\n  ```\r\n  _After_:\r\n  ```\r\n          if (something() || somethingElse() || anotherThing() || someOtherThin())\r\n          {\r\n              return false;\r\n          }\r\n  ```\r\n  Curiously, if the last function in the expression is `someOtherTh()`, which would still make the line length go past 80, the line stays the same, and if it's `someOtherThing()`, it works as expected by moving the expression to the next line.\r\n\r\n* Binary operators seem to always be positioned at the same column when breaking long expressions into multiple lines:\r\n\r\n  This one I'm less sure than the first one about whether it's a bug or just something that's not currenty implemented but will be.\r\n\r\n  _Before_:\r\n  ```\r\n  bool somethingElse = something == 2 || something == 3 || something == 5 || something == 7 || something == 11;\r\n  ```\r\n  _After_:\r\n  ```\r\n  bool somethingElse = something\r\n      == 2\r\n      || something\r\n      == 3\r\n      || something\r\n      == 5\r\n      || something\r\n      == 7\r\n      || something\r\n      == 11;\r\n  ```\r\n\r\nThat's it. By the way, I've been trying out forge and it's been a great experience. Good work!",
