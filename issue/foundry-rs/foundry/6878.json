I am new to foundry but I will make sure to document the reproduction steps clearly as soon as I am able to dedicate the required time to it.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be a bug in frontend UI, when I first start the debugger, and then i click the `down` button to navigate the debugger to the next binary code as you can see in the red rectangle\r\n![image](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/assets/25705974/ef7034bb-db2f-44b7-b100-025b8ab4ff83)\r\nKeep going down the binary code and suddenly it will crash (something ran out of the range).\r\n",
