At least for me when trying non legacy, the estimated 2x was concerning so i used legacy - assume others might experience the same.\r\n",

Might make sense to log though, how the fee is composed (base + tip) is the current log doesn't show this afaik.\r\n\r\nAlso might make sense, to allow users to adjust this surplus (didn't try yet, perhaps i can use gas multiplier 70, to reduce the 100% surplus in case my wallet is short of funds).",
