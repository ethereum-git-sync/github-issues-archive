However, [@0xYYY](https://github.com/0xYYY) was able to help me out by discovering that the code was changed [here](https://github.com/gakonst/ethers-rs/blob/de1020c91e85ecb78e4c6ea12f61f30d28296602/ethers-core/src/abi/human_readable/lexer.rs#L336). The correct way to call abi-encode on our constructor is now, `abi-encode f(...)`.\r\n\r\nWe can either update the docs or fix the code.\r\n",
