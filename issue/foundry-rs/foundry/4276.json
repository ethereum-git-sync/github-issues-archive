  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nThe flags `--match-contract` and `--match-test` are globs, which means that they will match two similar test function names like these:\r\n\r\n- `testFoo`\r\n- `testFooBar`\r\n\r\nHowever, developers often need to focus on one function in particular. It would be helpful to have another flag `--exact` that, when activated, would not match the `testFooBar` function when the user passes `testFoo` to `--match-test`.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we may consider two separate flags `--match-exact-contract` and `--match-exact-test`, which would achieve the same thing with a single flag rather than two.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
