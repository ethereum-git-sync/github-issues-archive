I'm currently attempting to run the script to deploy to Optimism. Simulation run works just fine, but when broadcasting I end up with a `code -32000 [...] insufficient funds for gas * price + value` error.\r\n\r\nI have confirmed that all my wallet and rpc configs are correct (I'm able to broadcast a simple eth transfer on optimism, for example).\r\n\r\nAs you can see in the screenshot below, the deployer balance exceeds the estimated amount required value, but the broadcast is still failing. It appears that the cost estimation is way too low, likely because **it excludes the L1 gas component that is part of an L2 transaction**.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1076\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13247381/236910952-4b13efe0-466a-42e9-8892-c2ed79c0908c.png\">\r\n",

Given that the majority of the gas consumed by a L2 transaction on Optimism (at this stage) is in the L1 gas component, the gas estimation functionality is fairly useless on Optimism. \r\n\r\nI have also noticed that it overestimates the gas price unless you use --legacy (perhaps related to this issue https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/4547).\r\n\r\nOptimism has described [here](https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/build/transaction-fees/#the-l1-data-fee) how the L1 fee could be estimated, by reading from the gas oracle contract, so perhaps that could be a way foundry could address this issue.
