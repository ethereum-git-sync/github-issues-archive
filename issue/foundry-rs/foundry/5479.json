Sometimes development process may require frequent switching between profiles, and it's not very convinient to edit .env every time. Also, passing profile through command-line arg would allow always keeping it in focus and will help to not forget switch profile when needed\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_",
