    "body": "> Here this trace is actually caused by a division by zero in a library that the test is using for... a storage variable in the test class itself. Strangely, the tree does not show the call into the internal function that caused the div 0 error. Rather, it shows it as if it's occurring directly in the test function.\r\n\r\nYeah this makes sense, traces only work with external calls, whereas an internal library function is inlined and does not appear in traces.
