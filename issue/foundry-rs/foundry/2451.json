This is fine right now as this contract is not used anywhere. However, during my first interaction with foundry, right after `--init`, the first thing I wanted to try was adding a test. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I quickly run into syntax errors with quite unhelpful messages:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nContract contract = new Contract()\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs a syntax error because `contract` is a keyword. A simple solution would be to rename `Contract` to `SampleContract`. I would propose doing the same for the script and test file for consistency. \r\n\r\nI can work on this change if there is a consensus that it's worth it.",
