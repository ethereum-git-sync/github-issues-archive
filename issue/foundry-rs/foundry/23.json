  "body": "instead of being compatible only with Sputnik, ideally we should define a `trait EVM` which has the functions we need (e.g. `call`) and we implement it for all EVMs we have. This would allow us to have better benchmarks, feature sets etc. It also means that we could use HEVM for any symbolic tests and fast Rust EVMs for everything else",
