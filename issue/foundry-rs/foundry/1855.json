    "body": "Do you happen to have any updates on this, @mattsse? Sorry to tag you, but I've just bumped into a similar scenario to @joaquinlpereyra.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the more successful Foundry becomes, the more important this feature becomes because Foundry projects become more intertwined (both depth-wise and breadth-wise).\r\n\r\nOur project [sablier-labs/v2-periphery](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-periphery) has many remappings:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-periphery/blob/76c5af55739c0447bff956ea6287be3ae8e8c22a/remappings.txt\r\n\r\nBecause of that and the lack of context-aware remappings in Foundry, V2 Periphery itself cannot be consumed by any third-party Foundry repo (without a patch). I installed `v2-periphery` in my [foundry-template](https://github.com/PaulRBerg/foundry-template), trying to import something from `src/types/Permit2.sol`, and got this error:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nFailed to resolve file: \"/Users/prb/Workspace/templates/foundry-template/lib/v2-periphery/lib/permit2/interfaces/IAllowanceTransfer.sol\": No such file or directory (os error 2).\r\n Check configured remappings..\r\n    --> \"/Users/prb/Workspace/templates/foundry-template/lib/v2-periphery/src/types/Permit2.sol\"\r\n        \"permit2/interfaces/IAllowanceTransfer.sol\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, I ran `forge remappings`, and got this:\r\n\r\n<details><summary>See remappings output</summary>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n```text\r\n@openzeppelin/contracts/=lib/v2-periphery/lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/\r\n@prb/math/=lib/v2-periphery/lib/v2-core/lib/prb-math/src/\r\n@prb/proxy-test/=lib/v2-periphery/lib/prb-proxy/test/\r\n@prb/proxy/=lib/v2-periphery/lib/prb-proxy/src/\r\n@prb/test/=lib/prb-test/src/\r\n@sablier/v2-core-script/=lib/v2-periphery/lib/v2-core/script/\r\n@sablier/v2-core-test/=lib/v2-periphery/lib/v2-core/test/\r\n@sablier/v2-core/=lib/v2-periphery/lib/v2-core/src/\r\n@sablier/v2-periphery/=lib/v2-periphery/src/\r\nds-test/=lib/forge-std/lib/ds-test/src/\r\nerc4626-tests/=lib/v2-periphery/lib/openzeppelin-contracts/lib/erc4626-tests/\r\nforge-gas-snapshot/=lib/v2-periphery/lib/permit2/lib/forge-gas-snapshot/src/\r\nforge-std/=lib/forge-std/src/\r\nopenzeppelin-contracts/=lib/v2-periphery/lib/openzeppelin-contracts/\r\nopenzeppelin/=lib/v2-periphery/lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/\r\npermit2-test/=lib/v2-periphery/lib/permit2/test/\r\npermit2/=lib/v2-periphery/lib/permit2/\r\nprb-math/=lib/v2-periphery/lib/v2-core/lib/prb-math/src/\r\nprb-proxy/=lib/v2-periphery/lib/prb-proxy/\r\nprb-test/=lib/prb-test/src/\r\nsolady/=lib/v2-periphery/lib/solady/\r\nsolarray/=lib/v2-periphery/lib/v2-core/lib/solarray/src/\r\nsolmate/=lib/v2-periphery/lib/permit2/lib/solmate/src/\r\nsrc/=src/\r\nv2-core/=lib/v2-periphery/lib/v2-core/\r\nv2-periphery/=lib/v2-periphery/\r\n```\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n</details> \r\n\r\nNotice the `permit2` remapping, which is the problem here. Foundry does not pick [our own `permit2` remapping](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-periphery/blob/76c5af55739c0447bff956ea6287be3ae8e8c22a/remappings.txt#L9), and as a result, the inferred remapping lacks the `/src` suffix (and I get the error shared above).\r\n\r\nWe can hot-fix this by asking consuming repos to add an explicit re-remapping, like this:\r\n\r\n```text\r\npermit2/=lib/v2-periphery/lib/permit2/src/\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this is a chore - for us and our users - and it's not scalable either (what happens when we have another dependency?).",
