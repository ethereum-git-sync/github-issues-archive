We noticed the memory consumption increases when time goes so we did a small test to confirm it\r\n\r\n```sol\r\ncontract SnapshotTest is Test {\r\n    function testSnapshots() public {\r\n        uint preState;\r\n        for(uint c = 0; c < 1000; c++) {\r\n            for(uint cc = 0; cc < 10000; cc++) {\r\n                preState = vm.snapshot();\r\n                vm.revertTo(preState);\r\n            }\r\n            vm.sleep(2500);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat this code does is create a snapshot and revert directly in a loop then sleep for 2.5 seconds. If you run this you'll see the memory usage increases every 2-3 seconds consistently.\r\n\r\nWhile digging around, we noticed that in your documentation [here](https://book.getfoundry.sh/cheatcodes/snapshots#description) you mentioned that reverting a snapshot deletes the snapshot and all subsequent ones. However, we also noticed that [this PR](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/pull/5487) seems to do the opposite. We suspect that the memory leak is related to this PR.\r\n\r\nOn the short term is there a way to delete/clean the snapshots?\r\n\r\n",
