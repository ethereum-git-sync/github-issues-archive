  "body": "### Component\r\n\r\nCast\r\n\r\n### Describe the feature you would like\r\n\r\nThis [handy utility](https://emn178.github.io/solidity-optimize-name/) generates an optimized function name (i.e. a function selector with leading zero bytes) for a given Solidity function signature. For example, `transfer(address,uint256)` returns the optimized name `transfer_G8l(address,uint256)`, with the selector `0x0000c771`. \r\n\r\nThis would be a nice helper utility to add to `cast`.\r\n\r\nSeems like this might make sense as a flag or subcommand under `cast sig`. Maybe something like:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ cast sig \"transfer(address,uint256)\"\r\n0xa9059cbb\r\n$ cast sig \"transfer(address,uint256)\" --optimize\r\ntransfer_G8l(address,uint256)\r\n0x0000c771\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n(Inspired by a deleted tweet from @transmissions11)",
