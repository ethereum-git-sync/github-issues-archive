This isn't an infinite loop so it shouldn't be an issue at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n```Solidity\r\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _tokenIds.length;) {\r\n            uint256 _tokenId = _tokenIds[i];\r\n            if (_array[i] == 0) continue; // Skip erroneous slashes\r\n            uint256 _votes = balanceOf[_tokenId].votes;\r\n            // Remove\r\n            if (_votes == 1 || _votes < _slash[i]) {\r\n                delete stakes[_tokenId];\r\n            } else {\r\n                balanceOf[_tokenId].votes -= _slash[i];\r\n            }\r\n            console2.log(\"gas\", i, gasleft());\r\n\r\n            unchecked {\r\n                i++;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n```\r\nFor the log: the last log before it reverts is     │   ├─ [0] console::log(gas1, 25671984 [2.567e7]) [staticcall] – indicating that it still has a great deal of gas before running out of gas.\r\n\r\nThe change:\r\n```Solidity\r\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _tokenIds.length; i++) {\r\n< Contract logic here />\r\n}\r\n\r\n```",
