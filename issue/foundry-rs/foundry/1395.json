Integration tests would however carry around config as to the environment they expect to run in. I see two ways to achieve this:\r\n\r\n- Declare config in `solidity`\r\n  - Support setting RPC URL / chain-id (where it then reads rpc-url from environment/config) as a minimum\r\n  - Inherit from `TestHarness` that requires config to be passed in constructor\r\n  - Set desired config using cheatcodes\r\n- Declare config in `toml`/`json`\r\n  - Support setting RPC URL / chain-id (where it then reads rpc-url from environment/config) as a minimum\r\n  - Ideally support passing arguments to setUp / discrete functions within the test contract\r\n  - Pin config to a `contract` or `function` within the contract\r\n  - Could have multiple configs per `contract` or `function`, enabling a form of table testing (though I suspect there might be better UX from pure solidity here)\r\n  - Would enable running new contracts through re-usable tests, as you could potentially pass the contract/bytecode as an argument for testing. E.g. an ERC-20 test harness that gets run against multiple contracts/deployments\r\n\r\n### Next steps\r\n\r\nInterested in getting feedback on:\r\n\r\n- The demand for this sort of functionality\r\n- Whether the potential solutions are appealing\r\n- Alternative approaches\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_",
