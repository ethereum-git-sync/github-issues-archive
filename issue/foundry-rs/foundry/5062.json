I believe it is due to attempting to deploy a contract at an address that has nonzero code.\r\n\r\nThis occurs since 0f98eef9a040468a1d01c57b800565aeba805166.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you do `vm.setNonce(sender,2)` before deploying `Contract`, the script works. But the script does _not_ work if you instead write `vm.setNonce(sender,1)`, unless you precede that with `vm.getNonce(sender)`. This could be an unrelated bug.",
