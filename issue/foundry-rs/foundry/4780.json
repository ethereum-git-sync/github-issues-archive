[Here](https://github.com/onbjerg/forge-coverage-test/pull/1) are my modifications to replicate the bug.\r\n\r\nI cornered case the example a bit (the updates are also in the PR):\r\n\r\nLet's define 2 new contracts:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED\r\npragma solidity >=0.8.15;\r\n\r\ncontract ExtraFileContract1 {\r\n    event ExtraFileEvent(uint256 n);\r\n\r\n    function compute(bool increment) external {\r\n        // Should be treated as a branch\r\n        require(increment);\r\n\r\n        emit ExtraFileEvent(2);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract ExtraFileContract2 {\r\n    // BUG (?): If we would call this event `ExtraFileEvent(uint256 n)`\r\n    // then the compute function below would not be covered.\r\n    // event ExtraFileEvent(uint256 n);\r\n    event ExtraFileEvent();\r\n\r\n    function compute(bool increment) external {\r\n        // Should be treated as a branch\r\n        require(increment);\r\n\r\n        //emit ExtraFileEvent(2);\r\n        emit ExtraFileEvent();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, we have 100% coverage.\r\n\r\nIf we rename the event as `ExtraFileEvent(uint256)` (or uncomment the lines) now we get 50% coverage.\r\n\r\nWhat role are these events playing in code coverage?",
