This is to help ensure that if I make a change in solidity, CI will catch that I need to rebuild the ABI, for example. The downstream effect is that I'll use this ABI to build a typescript SDK (with TypeChain) and use that in my frontend, so I am trying to keep everything in sync/up-to-date.\r\n\r\nI noticed that the build in CI is different from what the build outputs locally. I'm not sure if this is an OS difference or something else at play (I'm using the same foundry/forge version in CI as local), but the JSON fields I see changing are `bytecode.object`, `deployedBytecode.object`, and `ast.absolutePath`.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to create consistency in each of these outputs between runs of `forge build`? (e.g. `absolutePath` becomes relative to the `foundry.toml` instead of absolute. Unsure what to do about `bytecode.object`)\r\n\r\nAlternatively, is there a way to run `forge build` just outputting the e.g. ABI? I can output this to a separate directory and use that to run my \"outdated build files\" check, generate types, etc.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_",
