  "body": "## Description\r\nEncountered multiple errors while initializing a Foundry project and compiling contracts using `forge` (version 0.2.0) on Windows. The issues include submodule cloning errors with backslashes in paths and unresolved imports during compilation.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n1. Run `forge init hello-foundry` to initialize a new Foundry project.\r\n2. Observe errors during submodule cloning (path issue with backslashes).\r\n3. Run `forge test` or `forge build` in the initialized project directory.\r\n4. Notice errors related to unresolved imports (`ds-test/test.sol` not found).\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\nThe `forge init` command should correctly clone submodules without path issues, and the `forge test` or `forge build` commands should resolve imports correctly.\r\n\r\n## Actual Behavior\r\n- During initialization: `error: filename in tree entry contains backslash: '\\'` and `fatal: No url found for submodule path 'lib/forge-std' in .gitmodules`.\r\n- During compilation: Import resolution errors like `Error (6275): Source \"ds-test/test.sol\" not found`.\r\n\r\n## Environment Details\r\n- Operating System: Windows (MINGW64)\r\n- Forge Version: 0.2.0\r\n\r\n## Possible Solution\r\n- The path issue might be related to Windows file path formats. Investigating how paths are handled during submodule cloning could be a start.\r\n- The import resolution issue might be related to how `forge` handles file paths or project structure on Windows.\r\n\r\n## Additional Context\r\n- The issue seems specific to the Windows environment.\r\n- Including command line outputs for reference:\r\n![image](https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-std/assets/142411963/b8a85055-bcfe-4796-8c2a-72ef7c4c6429)\r\n![image](https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-std/assets/142411963/e4aef9a7-dd39-475e-bfa8-cdf235932594)\r\n![image](https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-std/assets/142411963/05200129-e9f5-4dd9-b6e6-32f88a33d22b)\r\n\r\n",
