The goal is to define the input format for the configuration (i.e. whether the configuration will be defined in a separate file like `fmt.toml` or it will become a part of foundry config) and, potentially, expand the options.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the supported configuration values are:\r\n- `line_length` - maximum line length where formatter will try to wrap the line\r\n- `tab_width` - number of spaces per indentation level\r\n- `bracket_spacing` - print spaces between brackets\r\n\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

    "body": "I like the idea of having it inside `foundry.toml` under `fmt`/`format`/`formatter` section to not spread the configuration of the whole toolkit over several files. I like how TOML allows you to have distinct sections not messing up the whole look of config. Also it differs from `rustfmt` which has its own `rustfmt.toml` in the way that it's impossible to have `forge fmt` without other CLIs and commands.\r\n\r\nRegarding the options, I think at least `single_quote: bool` (or `quote_style: single|double`) and `explicit_types: bool` are missing, I feel like they shouldn't be opinionated by us and non-configurable.",

Or do you just have a rule that a header name of `[fmt]` is not a profile but otherwise it looks the same as a profile header? \n\nYou are missing by compiler version, prettier solidity lets you adjust depending on the pragma version.\n\nAdditionally you can sort imports as well, here us an example: \n\n```\nimportOrder: [\"^@forge-std/(.*)$\", \"^ds-test/(.*)$\", \"^@openzeppelin/(.*)$\", \"^~(.*)$\", \"^[./]\"],\n  importOrderSeparation: true,\n  importOrderSortSpecifiers: true,\n```\n\nline-length isn't an option, printWidth is, see the discussion here: https://github.com/prettier-solidity/prettier-plugin-solidity/issues/474#issuecomment-823670541\n\nThis option is misleading as its not a count of characters per line (which makes sense as it would break code if it strictly enforced that). \n\nAlso probably the most requested feature is `// prettier-ignore`\n\nIf you can add maybe something like \n`/*! forge-fmt-disable */`\n`/*! forge-fmt-enable */` \n\nWould be 💯🚀🍻\n\n",

However, I could likely be convinced that approach is valuable, since it'd mean the config settings basically each map to a `forge <cmd>`. Main downside is then you need to specify multiple profiles to run `forge test` which is a little clunky",

The types don't affect bytecode at all so it feels like a formatting/style choice only. (I'm not sure if this is also true for import order). Checked the PR (https://github.com/prettier-solidity/prettier-plugin-solidity/pull/730) and couldn't find any discussion around the decision/controversy, though I did see it affects the AST but from a user-standpoint they won't notice that which makes it feel like just a style preference",
