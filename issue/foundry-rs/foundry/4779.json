  "body": "### Component\r\n\r\nForge\r\n\r\n### Describe the feature you would like\r\n\r\nI use the `changePrank` added in https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-std/pull/319 a lot, and one of the issues I have with it is that I always need to ensure that it's called after a `vm.startPrank`. Otherwise, Foundry throws this error:\r\n\r\n> You have an active prank already.\r\n\r\nUsers would never see this error if there was a cheat that combined `startPrank` and `changePrank` like this:\r\n\r\n- Is prank started?\r\n    - If not, run `vm.startPrank`\r\n    - If yes, replicate the logic in [`changePrank`](https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-std/blob/f06ad8/src/StdCheats.sol#L545-L548) (i.e. `vm.stopPrank` and `vm.startPrank` again)\r\n\r\nPossible names for this new cheat include `startChangePrank` or `startAndChangePrank`. Alternatively, the `startPrank` cheat could itself be modified to work like this, which would make `changePrank` redundant.\r\n\r\nSide note: I opened this issue here rather than `forge-std` due to the ongoing plan to implement all cheats natively in Foundry (https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/3782).",
