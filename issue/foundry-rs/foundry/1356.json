Have to have a nonabstract/library contract utilize the library to get the size. Not sure if there is an easy fix as the compiler doesnt actually output the true bytecode it seems.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31553173/163858341-a2492f2d-bc1f-4031-a082-ab28eaad002f.png)\r\n",
