  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nFor protocol integration testing, sometimes it's required to create a dedicated repo to import multiple submodules that include core contracts for testing. This means that the desired coverage targets are now in the `lib` directory, which currently is not supported by forge coverage. It would be great to be able to include these contracts into the coverage scope, with some ability to toggle include/exclude.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting thing to consider would be if we can include only the *compiled* dependency contracts into the scope of the coverage. Often there are many dependency contracts that aren't intended to be covered as part of the integration testing, but it would be useful to analyze the contracts that are specifically imported for the tests.\r\n\r\nThoughts?\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
