  "body": "### Component\n\nAnvil\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nThe Engine API is currently in RETH but not supported in anvil. Adding the engine API to anvil would be generally useful. For example, it would allow Anvil to work seamlessly within a multichain OP-chain devnet running on top of anvil. Without the engine api this must be hacked around.\n\n### Additional context\n\nSome links about OP node and engine api:\r\n- https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/blob/main/src/engine/README.md\r\n",
