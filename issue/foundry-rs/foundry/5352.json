  "body": "### Component\n\nAnvil\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nSupport for console2/console.log logging in Anvil is somewhat limited and works differently than in a hardhat node, in that the logs are apparently collected in LogCollector but not available for output \"inline\" with other output sent to the terminal while Anvil executes contract code. This make it challenging to debug timing issues between Anvil and connected programs by observing what parts of which contracts have executed via instrumenting those contracts with `console.log()` calls in Solidity.\r\n\r\nI've already implemented the necessary changes in sketch form. I'm just now picking up Rust, and am quite unfamiliar with the internals of Anvil/Foundry/Revm. The implementation I came up with may therefore be quite bad, but please have a look. I took this approach, vs collecting all of the logs on a per `spawn()` or `TransactionExecutor` / `next()` (I'm speaking loosely) basis so that the output from Anvil is happening in \"real time\"\r\n\r\nAmong other things there may be a better name than `inline-logs` for this option. Anyway, by supplying `--inline-logs` Anvil sets up a callback in the revm `Inspector` via `with_inline_logs()`, which I did that way to avoid breaking encapsulation relative to the availability of the `decode_console_log()` function. Again, there may be better ways, please educate me/suggest and I can re-implement.\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm trying to figure out why `decode_console_log()` is failing to decode the logs passed to it.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/aathan/foundry/tree/inline_logs\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
