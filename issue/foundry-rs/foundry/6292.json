  "body": "### Component\r\n\r\nevm\r\n\r\n### Describe the feature you would like\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI'd like to suggest an enhancement for evm sim, focusing on the eth_getStorageAt call functionality. Currently, the approach of individually sending requests for each storage slot can be quite inefficient, especially when dealing with numerous slots for a single address.\r\n\r\nA potential improvement could be the implementation of batch or parallel request processing. By allowing multiple eth_getStorageAt requests to be sent in a single call or concurrently, the efficiency and processing time could be significantly improved. This feature would be particularly impactful in simulation environments, offering a substantial boost in performance and a noticeable difference in overall efficiency.\r\n\r\nThis enhancement could dramatically speed up simulations\r\n\r\n",
