  "body": "### Component\r\n\r\nForge\r\n\r\n### Describe the feature you would like\r\n\r\nCurrently, you can specify the `--skip` option when running `forge build` to ignore certain files specifically. There's also special handlings for `scripts` and `tests` which excludes `.t.sol` and `.s.sol` files respecitively. It would be great if we could also exclude glob patterns. \r\n\r\nMy use-case specifically is to run `forge build` while ignoring the entire `tests` directory when generating code based on `forge build` artifacts. Specifically, I'm using the build artifacts to then run `cast interface` on them to produce interface representations for different solc versions so I can write my integration tests in Solidity >0.8.10). This creates a \"chicken and egg\" problem where I can't generate those interfaces if my test files currently don't compile but in order for them to compile I'd need to generate the interfaces first.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nWe've solved this for now with a little workaround:\r\n\r\n```Makefile\r\n...\r\n\r\n$(ARTIFACTS_DIR): Makefile $(shell find $(CONTRACTS_DIR) -type f -name \"*.sol\")\r\n> mkdir -p $(@D)\r\n> # Remove this once the `forge build` command supports glob patterns in `--skip` option.\r\n> export FOUNDRY_TEST=this-directory-does-not-exist\r\n> forge build --extra-output-files abi\r\n> touch $@ \r\n\r\n...\r\n```",
