It either works, gives me the block hash error, or fails with a max fee error. Nothing is very consistent so it is hard to reproduce. Breakpoints or adding / adjusting logging always changes the outcome which makes me believe there is just some race conditions happening. Also, this seems to only be an issue with forked networks",
