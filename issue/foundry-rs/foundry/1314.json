There is an issue with both compiling `group` (fixed by adding openss in #1313). But, that just uncovers another issue with compiling `foundry-cli` within Docker.\r\n```sh\r\n#13 808.6    Compiling foundry-cli v0.2.0 (/opt/foundry/cli)\r\n#13 809.7 error: failed to run custom build command for `foundry-cli v0.2.0 (/opt/foundry/cli)`\r\n#13 809.7 \r\n#13 809.7 Caused by:\r\n#13 809.7   process didn't exit successfully: `/opt/foundry/target/release/build/foundry-cli-f3551be4cc3b0164/build-script-build` (signal: 11, SIGSEGV: invalid memory reference)\r\n#13 809.7 warning: build failed, waiting for other jobs to finish...\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample job [here](https://github.com/dmfxyz/foundry/runs/6032143566?check_suite_focus=true).\r\n\r\nI will pick this up in a few days unless another contributor wishes to look earlier :) . For now, I am proposing disabling the nightly docker build in #1313.",
