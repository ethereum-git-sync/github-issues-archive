Unfortunately, currently, it's _not_ possible to interact with the Truffle Dashboard due to an underlying problem with MetaMask:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/issues/11824\r\n- https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/issues/18076\r\n- https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/3890\r\n\r\n_TL;DR:_ MetaMask supports the tx type `0x2` but not `0x02` which in turn makes it incompatible with the `ethers-rs` library.\r\n\r\nI have created this issue to track the status of the ongoing issue(s) and once resolved it should be properly tested and validated, and eventually, I propose to add a small section to the docs. I feel like this is an important part to highlight the advantages of non-`.env`-file-based development.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nSee my tweet [here](https://twitter.com/pcaversaccio/status/1664930332175478784) about why `.env` files are bad practice.",
