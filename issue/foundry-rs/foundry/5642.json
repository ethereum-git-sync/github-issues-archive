  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nAllow for dynamic library linking within Solidity by adding a `libraries` field to the contract creation syntax. This would enable linking libraries to contracts during deployment, akin to how it's done in Hardhat. The proposed syntax would be:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nstring[] memory myContractLibraries = ['src/libraries/MyLibrary.sol:MyLibrary: 0x1230000000000000000000000000000000000abc'];\r\nMyContract myContract = new MyContract{libraries: myContractLibraries}();\r\n```\n\n### Additional context\n\nI initially asked [a question on the ethereum stackexchange](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/q/153411/86303)\r\n\r\nThe proposed syntax adheres to existing practices within Foundry, requiring a list of strings in the format `<libraryPath>:<libraryName>:<libraryAddress>`.\r\n\r\nThis solution aims to bring Foundry's capabilities in line with other popular development environments while maintaining its unique all-Solidity approach.",
