So same scripts have been working to deploy onto public testnets.\r\n\r\nOur code isn't public - but the `Script` contract that we use is deploying a contract that helps manage the deployment - but that is only done inside the script and NOT broadcast.\r\n\r\nPseudo code:\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract MarketFactory is Test {\r\n  function deployMarketWithBroadcast(\r\n    address deployer,\r\n    // some other parameters\r\n    Vm vm // same thing happens if we don't pass this through.\r\n  ) public returns (uint32 marketIndex) {\r\n    console2.log(\"Deploying market with\", deployer);\r\n    vm.startPrank(deployer);\r\n    console2.log(\"these addreses should be the same\", deployer, msg.sender);\r\n    vm.stopPrank();\r\n    vm.startBroadcast(deployer);\r\n    console2.log(\"these addreses should be the same\", deployer, msg.sender);\r\n    // Do the deployment\r\n    vm.stopBroadcast();\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract DeployScript is Test {\r\n  MarketFactory factory;\r\n  constructor () {\r\n    factory = new MarketFactory();\r\n  }\r\n  function run() public {\r\n    factory.deployMarketWithBroadcast(msg.sender, vm)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n``` \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6032276/196662290-aa7b98fe-32c8-4a01-b62c-3099dd439485.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6032276/196662230-4d8ecfed-3661-455a-82b3-b6efbe0d8d25.png)\r\n\r\nIn the above images `0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266` is the msg.sender (or the account we are doing the deployment with) and `0x5b73C5498c1E3b4dbA84de0F1833c4a029d90519` is the `factory` contract address.\r\nNote, we don't actually want to deploy the Factory on chain, it is just a contract with some utility functions and helpers.\r\n",
