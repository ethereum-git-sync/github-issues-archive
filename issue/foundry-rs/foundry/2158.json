  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nThe order of the [secp256k1](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Secp256k1) curve is a little bit smaller than `2^256`, which means that not all `uint256` values can be used as private keys. The order has this value:\r\n\r\n```\r\n0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFEBAAEDCE6AF48A03BBFD25E8CD0364141\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently, when we pass a value greater than this to the `vm.addr` cheatcode, we got the following error:\r\n\r\n> signature error\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to display a clearer, more specific error, to let users that what happened is that the private key is greater than what is permitted by secp256k1.\n\n### Additional context\n\nIt is quite easy for a user to end up passing a value greater than the curve order:\r\n\r\n1. Fuzz the private key as an `uint256` argument in a test function\r\n2. Use the `vm.addr` cheatcode to generate an address from the fuzzed private key\r\n",
