  "body": "Right now if you run `forge test` and have `ETH_RPC_URL` set globally, forge will pick that up and run tests against that RPC URL, even though my test command did not specify to fork.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/gakonst/foundry/blob/11d87038f972b890ed450846c8755a35e39d8182/cli/src/utils.rs#L46-L50\r\n\r\nEnsuring `ETH_RPC_URL` is always defined on your machine is useful for `seth` and `cast`, but that should not affect `forge test` unless explicitly specified. Suggested fix is to run tests locally by default when `forge test` is ran, and only fork if `--rpc-url` is provided in the test command",
