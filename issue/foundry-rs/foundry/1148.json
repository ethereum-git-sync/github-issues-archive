For users coming from hardhat, the fact that you don't see the extra 21k gas overhead makes it even worse.\r\n\r\nI think it would be very helpful if the \"Deployment Size\" cell would expand 5 cells instead of 1,  to differentiate it from the other headers. Unfortunately this won't be possible because comfy_table [doesn't support colspan](https://github.com/Nukesor/comfy-table/issues/6)\r\n\r\nI think this table does a better job (supports colspan!) so might be worth considering: https://github.com/RyanBluth/term-table-rs\r\n\r\nA less desired alternative would be to split the table in two separate ones. \r\n- Deployment cost / size \r\n- Gas consumption\r\n\r\nMaybe there's a better way, so if someone makes a decision, I'm happy to jump in and try to implement it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nI think the hardhat-gas-reporter table does a really good job of displaying the same info.\r\n\r\n![59982003-c30a4380-95c0-11e9-9d93-e3af979df227](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1247834/160984139-44a5d8cb-f279-4171-bc0f-95d6462ffb53.png)\r\n ",
