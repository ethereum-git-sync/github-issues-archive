  "body": "### Component\r\n\r\nForge\r\n\r\n### Describe the feature you would like\r\n\r\n`forge install openzeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts@3.1.0` falls back to latest version despite the presence of v3.1.0 in the list of tags, which can additionally be confusing if you thought you were installing 3.1.0.  The above command will work if the exact full tag is added.  There are no other tags with 3.1.0 in their strings so exact match fails but a grep would return the correct result.\r\n\r\nSuggested change: search all tags for version requested. If no tag is found, error and display what versions are available. If one tag is found, install it.  If multiple tags contain the version (ie, 3.1 and 3.1.1 when searching with 3.1) then prompt for a selection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\nHere's an example of when a package version is not found using pip\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-02-06 at 10 40 48 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8229664/152696252-b32181bc-7688-4ffd-b2b4-fbdfa590a262.png)\r\n",
