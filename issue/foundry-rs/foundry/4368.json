    "body": "Regarding the second issue (some fields like `maxPriorityFeePerGas` and `maxFeePerGas` set even when it does not make sense) I have also a prepared commit. However, I would like to discuss one field - `gasPrice`.\r\n\r\nAccording to [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559), `gasPrice` should not be set in EIP-1559 txs. It even does not make sense because it was replaced by `maxPriorityFeePerGas` and `maxFeePerGas` in EIP-1559. The current implementation sets it anyway:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/ecddbdb5081d9bce725d91a62d7ebc96f2701616/anvil/src/eth/backend/mem/mod.rs#L2024-L2037\r\n\r\nBut Hardhat also sets the `gasPrice` field for EIP-1559 txs. This is the only thing where Hardhat deviates from the [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559) specification.\r\n\r\nDo we want to stick up strictly with the specification (i.e. remove the `gasPrice` field for EIP-1559 txs) or follow Hardhat and leave the value of `gasPrice` as it is currently implemented?",
