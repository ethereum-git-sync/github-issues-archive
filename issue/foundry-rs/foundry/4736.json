Each of these use `forge build` in their build step and we recently tried to turn on parallel builds (via `pnpm`), but it failed with\r\n\r\n```\r\nText file busy (os error 26)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe logs weren't specific about where this was coming from, but I later saw a log line that mentioned `solc-0.8.13`:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/508855/231887985-ea665bbf-1865-48f0-b7f6-4ef6ccd5b5a2.png)\r\n\r\nUnclear if this is a foundry issue or solc issue, but it originates from `forge build`, so I'm starting here.\r\n\r\nUltimately would like to be able to run `forge build` for multiple foundry projects in parallel. Is this an issue with some sort of global cache? Or strictly just a ulimit thing?",
