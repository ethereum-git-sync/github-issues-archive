Run `forge test --fork-url <url> --fork-block-number <fork_block_number>`\r\n2. `block.number` will return the current fork block, `block.timestamp` will return the corresponding timestamp, and all state read from the RPC's state at that block\r\n3. Call `vm.roll(fork_block_number + x)`, where `fork_block_number + x` is a block that has already been mined on the specified RPC\r\n4. `block.number` returns the new block number, but `block.timestamp` and all state read from the RPC's state still give values for `fork_block_number`, and not `fork_block_number + x`\r\n\r\nA sample use case here is testing a Uniswap TWAP oracle: scaffolding everything locally is a hassle, and it would be much easier to test prices/behavior against historical mainnet data. However, it seems this is not current possible with forge\r\n\r\nWhen rolling to a block number that has not yet been mined on the provided RPC, `block.timestamp` can be either the same as the most recent blocks timestamp, or extrapolated by assuming a 12 second block time. Similarly, RPC queries for state should use the most recent block at the time of the `roll`",
