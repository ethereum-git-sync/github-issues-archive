The cli outputs that it's sending the transaction but nothing actually pops up on my ledger. Changing back to version forge 0.2.0 (60ec002 2023-12-04T13:54:02.349674000Z) does not cause this issue and the transactions shows up on my ledger. `cast send --ledger` also works great on the latest build.",
