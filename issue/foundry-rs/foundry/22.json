  "body": "We already support non-Solidity tests as shown here, but gotta make the API better: https://github.com/gakonst/dapptools-rs/blob/master/dapp/src/multi_runner.rs#L191-L227. \r\n\r\nThe nicest way to write Solidity tests, would be to write an ethers-rs middleware that instead of doing RPC requests (https://github.com/gakonst/ethers-rs/blob/master/ethers-providers/src/provider.rs#L124), itâ€™d do direct EVM calls. I think this is doable and tbh is ~equivalent to Solidity tests. All dapp test really does is continuously call all sol functions starting with test* by directly calling the EVM, so really just an abstraction",

    "body": "This is REALLY good stuff. \r\n\r\nI think the proper way to re-use Akula / Evmodin here would be the following:\r\n1. Refactor Akula into smaller crates, ideally allowing us to run the stuff under your repo's `src/akula` directory w/o Nightly without copy-pasting any code.\r\n2. Abstract Akula's [`IntraBlockState`'s functions](https://github.com/akula-bft/akula/blob/2d835a05624968b41086e30fc9370c81cf947834/src/state/intra_block_state.rs#L99) to look like evmodin's `Host` trait, allowing us to wrap backends over each other to add new functionality, like middleware.\r\n3. Make a `ForkedIntraBlockState` which is basically an implementation of your Forked Backend, which implements the same kind of logic as the one [here](https://github.com/gakonst/dapptools-rs/blob/master/evm-adapters/src/sputnik/forked_backend.rs). A challenge here would be on how we can reuse as much forking/caching code as possible across evmodin/sputnik.\r\n\r\nI think that 1 & 2 could happen inside the upstream Akula repo, with 3 happening inside this repo.",
