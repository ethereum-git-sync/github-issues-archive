This *only* happens when the test contains refunds which can *only* happen with `SSTORE`.\r\n\r\nWe need a sure-fire way to validate which number is correct and adjust the other one accordingly. An idea is to implement unit tests for the executor that test against the test cases in [EIP-3529](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3529) as these cases have clearly defined gas costs. Note that the costs in the table assumes that all slots are hot, but our executor always starts with slots cold.\r\n\r\nWe have to assume that the number reported by REVM is truth, so the fault most likely lies in the tracer inspector.",
