    "body": "If you run a single test and run number 34 of that test fails, the test does fail immediately and no other \"normal\" fuzz runs are ran. I say \"normal\" because at that point shrinking occurs, where the test is run more times to find the smallest fuzz input value(s) that still trigger the failure. Perhaps the feature request here is to turn off shrinking to see failures faster? You could probably argue the shrinked values would make debugging faster so it's worth the wait, so I'm curious if a feature to turn off shrinking is useful",
