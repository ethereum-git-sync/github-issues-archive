Say we're expecting address A to  revert with `0x1234`\r\n- If address A was the first contract in the call stack to revert with `0x1234`, that's a success\r\n- If address B was the first contract in the call stack to revert with `0x1234`, then it bubbled up to A which therefore reverted with that same error, that's a failure because A did not originate with the revert\r\n- If address B was the first contract in the call stack to revert with `0x1234`, then it bubbled up to A which caught the error and re-threw it, that would be a success because A originated the error, and could have originated any revert data there (or could have continued execution)\r\n\r\n@Evalir @xeno097 do you agree with that behavior? I'm not sure how feasible that third bullet is though. So it might be better to just consider all 3 of those bullets a success, i.e. we're expecting that A throws that error anywhere in the call stack, and does not have to be the originator",
