  "body": "### Component\n\nAnvil\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nAnvil is an extremely useful tool for simulating a sequence of unsigned transactions and determining if any will revert. The `eth_sendUnsignedTransaction` appears to be without analogy in any other client/tool and is awesome! However, being able to simulate *state diffs* is important to many workflows as well.\r\n\r\nGeth has several [built in tracers](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/developers/evm-tracing/built-in-tracers), including one that is exceedingly useful called the [`prestateTracer`](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/developers/evm-tracing/built-in-tracers#prestate-tracer). \r\n\r\nIt would be great if Anvil could incorporate a similar tracer to provide state diffs for simulated, unsigned transactions.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
