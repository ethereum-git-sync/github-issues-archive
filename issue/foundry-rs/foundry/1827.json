    "body": "The fact that I'm searching through a lot of blocks is actually how I surfaced this bug: I'm performing a getLogs query with a filter for a specific address value for topic1. When filtering for that specific topic1 value the result set is only ~100 logs. Without it there are many thousands.\r\n\r\nI get my ~100 log result set when I use a regular alchemy url, but it fails as soon as I swap out that url for the one for a spawned forked anvil node.\r\n\r\nThe error message is a little confusing there: it's not saying that I used (0, 7476821) as a filter parameter, but rather that it expects that I could use that more restrictive range if I wanted to get a more manageable result set.\r\n\r\nI haven't checked what happens using http transport -- I'll throw together a minimal test case and reply back.",
