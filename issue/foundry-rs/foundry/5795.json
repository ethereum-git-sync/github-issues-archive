It could not be called twice for one block. For invariant test, I added a handler with function:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvm.roll(block.number+1);\r\ntestFunction();\r\n```\r\nAnd it reverts! Furthermore, it's impossible to get stacktrace when it happened.\r\n\r\nThen, I add a storage variable to handler contract `blockNum` and change the code into:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvm.roll(++blockNum);\r\ntestFunction();\r\n```\r\nThis code doesn't revert.\r\n\r\nSo, it seems there is race condition or incorrect mutex for block.number which allow to change it during the parrallel execution",
