It could not be called twice for one block. For invariant test, I added a handler with function:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvm.roll(block.number+1);\r\ntestFunction();\r\n```\r\nAnd it reverts! Furthermore, it's impossible to get stacktrace when it happened.\r\n\r\nThen, I add a storage variable to handler contract `blockNum` and change the code into:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvm.roll(++blockNum);\r\ntestFunction();\r\n```\r\nThis code doesn't revert.\r\n\r\nSo, it seems there is race condition or incorrect mutex for block.number which allow to change it during the parrallel execution",

At the moment, state changes are not persisted between tests, which means changes to `block.timestamp` or `block.number` won't persist. You have already figured out the workaround for now which is to persist the state and warp/roll to it. See this [comment](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/4994#issuecomment-1618329347) for a more complete solution.",
