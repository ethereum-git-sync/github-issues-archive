This data was to be stored in `bytes` chunks on-chain. Past a certain number of entries to seed, Forge fails with an `EvmError: OutOfGas` error, even when `vm.pauseGasMetering()` is enabled before any gas is used in the script.\r\n\r\nYou can tweak the variables in [NFT.sol](https://github.com/joejordan/foundry-OutOfGas-error/blob/eefc31ad59abcdad219b50fd040e43ca3dd5135e/src/NFT.sol#L10) to see the script work successfully. If run as-is the script should fail with an OutOfGas error.  More details are included in the [repo comments](https://github.com/joejordan/foundry-OutOfGas-error/blob/eefc31ad59abcdad219b50fd040e43ca3dd5135e/script/NFT.s.sol#L12).",
