The use case here is to confirm deploy parameters in a script in a table or similar before executing the script.\r\n\r\nThe `vm.toString()` cheatcodes along with `string.concat()` make it simple to put the string together. It should support things like `\\n`, or some other common syntax used for aligning lines such as rust's [`format!`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.format.html) macro. \r\n\r\nThe benefit to making this a cheatcode instead of putting it in forge-std is to avoid requiring `ffi` for it.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

    "body": "Cool, yea I like that idea. So I imagine the UX being something like:\r\n- A new flag to enable/disable the \"confirm continue\" terminal prompt\r\n- If enabled, show the decoded txs, perhaps in a view that looks similar to the tx traces? (I'm mostly indifferent as to the actual format here)\r\n    - For normal txs we can decode like usual.\r\n    - For `create` we'd want to decode contract name and constructor args.\r\n    - For `create2` txs, we'll need to show one level deeper (since top-level calldata is a tx to the create2 deployer, which then makes the create2 call).\r\n\r\nDoes that line up with what you're thinking?",
