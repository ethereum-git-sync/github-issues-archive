However, I get multiple errors like the following if I run `forge test` (see here a CI run example: https://github.com/pcaversaccio/snekmate/actions/runs/5132149269/jobs/9233075709#step:11:44)\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n2023-05-31T11:14:59.396656Z ERROR forge::multi_runner: error=Unrecoverable error: Err(Eyre(\r\nbackend: failed while inspecting: Transaction(CreateInitcodeSizeLimit)))\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm fully aware of the init code size limit introduced by `shanghai` but I'm not sure about this error and its impact. It seems that the tests are running successfully but instead of lasting now (around 25-30mins; see e.g. https://github.com/pcaversaccio/snekmate/actions/runs/5126407871/jobs/9220852266#step:11:1), they are completed within 7-10 mins (see e.g. https://github.com/pcaversaccio/snekmate/actions/runs/5132149269/jobs/9233075709#step:11:1)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/assets/25297591/ae51d80e-851f-412d-b6d1-fe1ab5b404a1)\r\n![image](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/assets/25297591/12085e54-b49e-43c2-85ff-8a789246b2e5)\r\n\r\nI can't explain the performance boost tbh. This smells like something is wrong (except ofc if Foundry, ethers-rs or any other major dependency was significantly refactored).  ",
