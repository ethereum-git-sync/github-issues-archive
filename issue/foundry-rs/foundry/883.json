The doc says the following about this command: \"prints the automatically inferred remappings for this repository\". Maybe we should either update the documentation, or change the command behaviour? IMO it would be useful if this command actually printed the final result (after reading all config files, env vars) with the effective configuration.\r\n(man forge says I'm on version 0.2.0. `forge --version` yields command not found. Maybe i'm on a too old version? \r\n\r\nEdit: Hm.. it looks like I was \"stuck\" in some old forge version, that wasn't even picking up the foundry.toml.\r\n\r\nNow on 0.2.0 ef881b75  , but still it seems foundry.toml is not being used \r\n\nEdit 2: please ignore all the above. On another machine with clean installation it works as expected. ",

    "body": "Maybe some context helps at least where my confusion came from: when I was initially confused about why remappings was not picking the overrides, I was in a version of forge where config subcommand didn't exist. Today when I see both commands there (config and remappings), and read the docs, I can infer that since \"config\" considers the overrides (that is, the \"effective\" values used), I would guess guess that remappings doesn't. My suggestion would be the following:\r\nEither:\r\n1- remove remappings subcommand altogether - user can see them anyways with output of config command;\r\n2- do something along the lines of what @onbjerg suggested about with optional flags;\r\n2- clarify exactly what remappings is useful for or how it interacts with the \"local repository\"  - what affects its output?\r\n3- Leave both commands but update documentation with something along the lines of:\r\nremappings - prints the effective remappings\r\nconfig - Print all effective configuration values.\r\nRelatedly, I didn't find in the forge docs a documentation similar to what we have in dapp-tools on the order of precedence related to config variables, environment vars, etc. I just tried changing the value of remappings in the foundry.toml config file, yet I didn't see the change reflected in `forge remappings` - maybe I'm missing something here, but clarifying the whole topic in general in the docs would be beneficial imo.
