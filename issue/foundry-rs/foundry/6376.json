Consider reporting it at https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry\r\n\r\nBacktrace omitted. Run with RUST_BACKTRACE=1 environment variable to display it.\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected behaviour: throw error with invalid `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` set, but not panic.\r\n\r\n ~~PS: Will fix it myself in a new PR.~~ - it seems like everything is handled through the same function, so adding an exact test case that would not fail for just this error is not really a good fix.",
