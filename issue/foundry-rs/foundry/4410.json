  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nDuring our deployment and release process, we would like to have more transparency about contents of deployed contracts.\r\nCurrently, there is no straightforward way to verify that source code of the deployed contract matches with the locally compiled one.\r\n\r\nIdeally, we would like to have an ability to quickly verify the deployed contract bytecode and its metadata hash against bytecode of a locally compiled contract. This would be a nice addition to the existing `forge verify-contract` CLI.\r\n\r\nFor example, such CLI could behave in the following way:\r\n```\r\n$ forge verify-bytecode --rpc-url <RPC> <ADDRESS> <CONTRACT> --constructor-args <ARGS>\r\nCompiler run successful!\r\nCompiler version: solc v0.8.18\r\nOptimizer settings: 200 runs\r\n\r\nFull match!\r\nLocal bytecode hash: 0x<hash>\r\nDeployed bytecode hash: 0x<hash>\r\nLocal metadata hash: 0x<hash>\r\nDeployed metadata hash: 0x<hash>\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
