  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\n`vm.readLine` always reads in as a string, and therefore converting to other types like bytes32 requires dropping into assembly and removing the ascii encoding. This can be greatly simplified by a set of `parse*` cheatcodes that take a string and return the specified type. The full set of functions would be:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction parseBool(string calldata) external returns (bool);\r\nfunction parseUint(string calldata) external returns (uint256);\r\nfunction parseInt(string calldata) external returns (int256);\r\nfunction parseAddress(string calldata) external returns (address);\r\nfunction parseBytes32(string calldata) external returns (bytes32);\r\nfunction parseBytes(string calldata) external returns (bytes memory);\r\n```\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\nA side effect of this is that we have the option of removing the `envBool`, `envUint`, etc. overloads and just havng a single `env` cheatcode that always return a string, and then use these methods to convert from string to the appropriate type. This would be a breaking change. Additionally, we probably still want to keep the env overloads that return arrays since they involve parsing a delimiter.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
