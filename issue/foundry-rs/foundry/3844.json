Fuzzing is often a long process, and I'd like some insight into what it is doing while it is running. Especially since nothing else is displayed while fuzzing, not even the current number of runs.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

In the first instance I was able to quickly stop fuzzing, fix my typo and re-run the fuzzer to get the results I was expecting, and the merits of the second point need no explanation! ",
