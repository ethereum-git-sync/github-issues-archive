  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nTesting tools often give the ability to exit upon the first test failure. It would great if `forge test --fail-fast` could be added to accomplish this. This not only provides fast feedback loops for developers but also makes tools that programmatically call forge test like CIs more efficient.\n\n### Additional context\n\nhttps://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/how-to/failures.html#stopping-after-the-first-or-n-failures",
