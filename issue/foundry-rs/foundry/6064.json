  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Have you ensured that all of these are up to date?\n\n- [X] Foundry\n- [X] Foundryup\n\n### What version of Foundry are you on?\n\nforge 0.2.0 (577dae3 2023-09-01T00:41:50.439385000Z)\n\n### What command(s) is the bug in?\n\nforge coverage\n\n### Operating System\n\nNone\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nSo currently we see discrepancies between 2 of our branches when we are about to export the `forge coverage` reports. On one branch (`main`) it shows somewhat correct numbers, but on the feature branch (`contestable-zkrollup`) it says 0% for most of the contracts.\r\n\r\nThe forge versions are the same, the dependencies (in `package.json`) looks different but locally i tried to have the same (as `main` - which is the working one) and gave no resolution of the problem.\r\n\r\nLet me just get you up to speed how you could re-create the issue quick.\r\n\r\nHere is our repo:\r\n`git@github.com:taikoxyz/taiko-mono.git`\r\n\r\nIn order to replicate it, please create 2 local repositories (so that you can beyond-compare 3 files which are suspicious). One with branch `main` and one with branch `contestable-zkrollup`\r\n\r\n1. Clone main: `git clone git@github.com:taikoxyz/taiko-mono.git`\r\n2. Clone feature: `git clone --branch contestable-zkrollup git@github.com:taikoxyz/taiko-mono.git`\r\n3. Enter into the repos' packages/protocol library: `cd taiko-mono/packages/protocol` (on both)\r\n4. Install deps. `pnpm install`\r\n5. `forge coverage --report summary`\r\n\r\nYou will see different results.\r\n\r\nNow, what seemed to be suspicious (beside the versions and dependencies which we ruled out not be the case) to see the test files itself.\r\n\r\nSo i picked 3 files (`TestBase.sol`, `TaikoL1TestBase.sol`, `TaikoL1.t.sol`) in beyond compare and tried to figure out, why `TaikoL1` tests are on main branch are covered, and on feature branch not.\r\n\r\nObviously there are changes in these 3 files, but not on interface level. We import some additional contracts, or remove other imports, changed the logic inside a function but the function signatures and APIs / inheritance is the same.\r\n\r\nCould you please help us figure out what could be the issue, since it is a prio thing for use to see (and prove) coverage ?",
