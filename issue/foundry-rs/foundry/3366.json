  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nIt would be nice to have a flag on `forge build` that skips building the tests. As our test suite grows, it results in the build being more slow. This would be useful for when the artifacts are desired, we use them as part of a build process to build bindings in go. We don't need to build the tests for this case.\r\n\r\nThere are a few ways to do this - skipping files that have `.t.sol` in the filename, or looking for the `IS_TEST` function in the contract ABI.\r\n\r\nPotentially could apply the same thing for scripts\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
