This causes forge to produce an error that looks like `fuzz: failed to inspect: Database(GetStorage(contract, slot), Odd number of digits)`. `hexutil.Big` is a reasonable thing to be returned by a web3 gateway, so `forge script` should treat `0x0` as zero.\r\n\r\nIt is very inconvenient to fall back to `cast` for deployments because scripting doesn't work due to this bug. MITM proxying the Web3 gateway and returning `0x` is my workaround for now.",
