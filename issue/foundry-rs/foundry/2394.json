    "body": "As I've been doing a lot more exploration into low-level EVM, I have been playing around a lot with the byte form of data and sometimes my assembly code will require right and left shifting. Given that cast has such an extensive set of utilities, it seems like bit shifting would fit right in. \r\n\r\nIn terms of UX, something like `(Dec or Hex) [>>, <<] (Dec or Hex) --output [dec, hex]` would be great.\r\nSo `42 << 250 --output hex` should yield `0xa800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`\r\nAnd `0xa800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 >> 250 --output hex` would yield `0x2a`.\r\n\r\nSupport for `uint256` would be great since I haven't found any online tools that support numbers that large. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, while I haven't had the need for this myself, to make the tool holistic, it might be great to include support for signed integers as well. So perhaps another option `--(un)signed`.",
