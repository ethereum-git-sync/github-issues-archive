    "body": "Hello! Just following up on this thread as I was looking for an option to enable multi-line function parameters instead of all parameters put together in the same line.\r\n\r\nIs there a specific setting/flag I can enable in `foundry.toml`'s `[fmt]` section for achieving this?\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\nI found `multiline_func_header` but it doesn't produce the desired effect. The fmt still clubs all the function parameters in the same line if it can.\r\n<img width=\"718\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33789105/206928071-d80c3ebb-163b-4c6e-9003-ebdbf2453701.png\">\r\n ",
