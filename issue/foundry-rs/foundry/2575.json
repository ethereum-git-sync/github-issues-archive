I am trying to mint (51 tokens) more than max supply (50 tokens) here and expect to get a revert. This test code is not correct (the expect revert should be immediately before the mint). However, it serves the purpose of showing that when something is expected to revert, and it does not, then it should be flagged as a failing test.

    "body": "Ahhh, whew. I really thought this was a bug for a second: the reason your test doesn't fail is because `testFail` *inverts* the result of the test. So, `vm.expectRevert` failing *actually makes the test pass*. I do not recommend using `testFail`: in general it's somewhat of an anti-pattern left over from DappTools. In some cases it is ok to use but generally you should prefer explicit assertions instead, e.g. instead of `testFail` and `assert(a == b)` to test that `a != b`, just write `assert(a != b)` :)",
