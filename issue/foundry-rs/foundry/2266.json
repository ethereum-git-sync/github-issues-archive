  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nWhen using some libraries, the `--flatten` output will be gigantic as [flatten](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/forge/forge-flatten.html#description) will inline all imports. It would be neat if flatten would detect & remove unused imports.\r\n\r\nWhen using re-export index files like here https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-address-book/blob/main/src/AaveAddressBook.sol that makes it essentially impossible to use in foundry as the generated code will be unusable long.\n\n### Additional context\n\nIn addition to what i mentioned above i guess it might make sense to even eliminate unused code in the actually imported files. Not sure sure about this though.",
