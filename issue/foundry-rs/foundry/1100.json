In my case it shows two unexpected behaviors:\r\n\r\n1) The function call is not decoded, along with the input being not decoded.\r\n2) The wrong contract is shown in `<contractName>::<function>`.\r\n\r\n`regTest.t.sol` tests for both contracts not being the same (although highly similar, note the additional `s` in `decodeThiss` and the `uintArr[1]` difference).\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102544091/160454031-368a3d26-87ff-4470-a369-64994326c082.png)\r\n\r\nrunning `forge clean` does not solve this issue.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore peculiar, when you:\r\n1) delete the 'regTest2.sol' file and \r\n2) remove the references in the `regTest.t.sol` to that file\r\n\r\n> regTest.t.sol\r\n\r\n```\r\npragma solidity >0.8.10;\r\n\r\nimport \"../../lib/ds-test/src/test.sol\";\r\n\r\nimport \"../regTest.sol\";\r\n//import \"../regTest2.sol\";\r\n\r\ncontract RegressionTest is DSTest {\r\n  \r\n  function testDecodes(uint256 fuzzUint, address fuzzAddr) public {\r\n    RegressionOriginal contractOrig = new RegressionOriginal();\r\n\r\n    contractOrig.decodeThiss(fuzzUint, fuzzAddr);\r\n    fail();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  // function testContractsAreNotEqual() public {\r\n  //   assertTrue(keccak256(type(NotRegressionTheOriginal).creationCode) != keccak256(type(RegressionOriginal).creationCode));\r\n  // }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe decoding of the function & function input works. The correct contractname is also referenced in the call trace.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102544091/160455704-6eebe48d-0b26-4d65-83da-50112da8c5da.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter adding back the original `regTest2.sol` file (and running `forge clean` as desired), the unwanted behavior returns. This is even without having the contract in `regTest2.sol` referenced in the test file:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102544091/160455039-2f4d3ae4-1966-4f8d-8ed0-0d4731010328.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon downgrading to v0.1.0 using `cargo install --git https://github.com/gakonst/foundry --rev 22323e21c3e00d9eccc5914589c23f2a0115413b --bins --locked` , the unexpected behavior does not show. I.e., all function calls are decoded correctly and the contract names are referred to as expected.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I assume it might be something cache related, I hope to be able to reproduce it on another machine \"from scratch\", but haven't had the chance to yet.\r\n",

    "body": ">Should work with proxies - are the bytecodes of all your contracts very similar? I think the threshold is 10%\r\n\r\nWe have a series of contracts that do inherit the same abstract contract, but only about 5 of them inherit that same contract (from around ~30 which don't get decoded). The other contracts are very different, asides from an occasional shared openzeppelin's Ownable for example.\r\nIn our tests, we do create many instances of the same contracts. For example, a series of ERC20's that are based on the same contract, a series of ERC721's, series of ERC1155's, series oracles, ...\r\n\r\n> Also, do traces for your main project decode properly with 0.1.0?\r\n\r\nYes! All traces for all calls, including contract names, function names and input decodes work perfectly on 0.1.0.",
