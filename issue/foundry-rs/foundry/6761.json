I created a minimal example to reproduce the issue which I have provided below. It simulates a simple transfer, which I also executed on chain (see [here](https://goerli.etherscan.io/tx/0x623674fe5575d86df79d4d33c7341ed5f033829a4ba54f861dcfa704317d79f7)). You can see that there is a difference of 2300 gas.\r\n\r\n[gas-usage-test.zip](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/files/13905227/gas-usage-test.zip)\r\n",
