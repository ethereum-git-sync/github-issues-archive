Address: 0xdcc0ed94411272c1eb99067f34dfb0aefc511709\r\n```\r\nthen I try to deploy my smart contract using script by typing\r\n```\r\nforge script script/DeploySimpleStorage.s.sol --rpc-url $GANACHE_RPC_URL --broadcast --account gan-wall\r\n```\r\nI got an error\r\n```\r\nError:\r\n\r\nYou seem to be using Foundry's default sender. Be sure to set your own --sender.\r\nNo associated wallet for addresses: {0x1804c8ab1f12e6bbf3894d4083f33e07309d1f38}. Unlocked wallets: [0xdcc0ed94411272c1eb99067f34dfb0aefc511709]\r\n```\r\nI add --sender, and it works\r\n```\r\nforge script script/DeploySimpleStorage.s.sol --rpc-url $GANACHE_RPC_URL --broadcast --account gan-wall --sender 0xdCC0eD94411272c1eB99067F34dFb0AEfc511709\r\n```\r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n> I think specifying --account should automatically select the corresponding address as the sender because technically --account is the replacement for --private-key, and when you use --private-key you don't have to explicitly specify --sender as it automatically defaults to it, same should be the case with --account.\r\n-- from @usmanfarooq91\r\n\n\n### Additional context\n\n- original discussion: https://github.com/Cyfrin/foundry-full-course-f23/discussions/945#discussion-5688288\r\n- @PatrickAlphaC will be happy to sponsor this work.\r\n- forge version: forge 0.2.0 (8c1a569 2023-09-19T00:25:23.149586075Z)\r\n- cast version: cast 0.2.0 (8c1a569 2023-09-19T00:25:23.141846282Z)",
