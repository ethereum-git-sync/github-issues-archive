I cloned their [repo which can be found here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-09-maia).\r\n\r\nFirst things first, I used `forge install` which returned the following logs (I'm replacing my name with <user>):\r\n\r\n```\r\nUpdating dependencies in \"/Users/<user>/Developer/2023-09-maia/lib\"\r\n(base)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI assumed all is well and went on to use `forge build` which provided the following output:\r\n\r\n```\r\n❯ forge build\r\nThe application panicked (crashed).\r\nMessage:  failed to extract foundry config:\r\nfoundry config error: Unknown evm version: paris for setting `evm_version`\r\n\r\nLocation: config/src/lib.rs:449\r\n\r\nThis is a bug. Consider reporting it at https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry\r\n\r\nBacktrace omitted. Run with RUST_BACKTRACE=1 environment variable to display it.\r\nRun with RUST_BACKTRACE=full to include source snippets.\r\n[1]    98536 abort      forge build\r\n(base)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe same error now also happens for `forge install`.\r\n\r\nI looked at the root `foundry.toml` file and there is no mention of using the paris version, but I still modified it to explicitly try london as such:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[profile.default]\r\nsrc = 'src'\r\nout = 'out'\r\nlibs = ['lib']\r\nsolc = \"0.8.19\"\r\nevm_version = \"london\"\r\nvia_ir = true\r\ngas_price = 10000\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe error still happens just the same. So I CMD+SHIFT+F ed my way to look for any \"paris\" mention throughout the whole code base.\r\n\r\nIt appears Solady which is a dependancy of this project uses paris for their `evm_version`.\r\n\r\nPlease not that I'm not a Foundry/forge expert nor a solc versioning expert. I simply figured it might be useful to you to report this because the error message told me so.\r\n\r\nAlso, I haven't really tried diving to deep yet. I figured I should report early and update this issue later if I figure out the fix for this. \r\n\r\nThanks.",
