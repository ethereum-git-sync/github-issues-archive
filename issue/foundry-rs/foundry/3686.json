  "body": "### Component\r\n\r\nForge\r\n\r\n### Have you ensured that all of these are up to date?\r\n\r\n- [X] Foundry\r\n- [X] Foundryup\r\n\r\n### What version of Foundry are you on?\r\n\r\nforge 0.2.0 (e320eb3 2022-11-10T09:21:49.2140657Z)\r\n\r\n### What command(s) is the bug in?\r\n\r\nforge test\r\n\r\n### Operating System\r\n\r\nWindows\r\n\r\n### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nI was playing around with a Foundry integration into a Hardhat project and I encountered a weird bug. To reproduce the bug simply clone my repo here: https://github.com/pcaversaccio/hardhat-project-template-ts. The `forge-std` library is currently pulled directly and not as submodule - this will change in the future but it doesn't matter for the bug.\r\n\r\nIf you run `forge test` on this repository using Ubuntu & `foundryup` the test will simply pass (you see all the GH Actions are successful). However, if you use Windows & installing from the source you will get the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nRunning 1 test for contracts/test/Greeter.t.sol:ContractTest\r\n[FAIL. Reason: Invalid data] setUp() (gas: 0)\r\nTest result: FAILED. 0 passed; 1 failed; finished in 1.09ms\r\n\r\nFailing tests:\r\nEncountered 1 failing test in contracts/test/Greeter.t.sol:ContractTest\r\n[FAIL. Reason: Invalid data] setUp() (gas: 0)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe foundry version I'm currently running from Windows is `forge 0.2.0 (e320eb3 2022-11-10T09:21:49.2140657Z)`. I did some digging and if you would simply import `DSTest` instead of `Test` it would work for Windows. After digging more into the problem I figured out that `StdCheats` from `forge-std` is causing the error - if you remove the inheritance in `Test.sol` on `StdCheats` it will run successfully. Can someone support on this weird bug?\r\n\r\nA further bug in the context of the above one is coming from the Hardhat Etherscan plugin somehow. Run `yarn test:forge` and you will get the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[FAIL. Reason: Invalid data] setUp() (gas: 0)\r\n2022-11-15T09:15:21.049633Z ERROR etherscan: Failed to deserialize response: data did not match any variant of untagged enum ResponseData res=\"{\\\"message\\\":\\\"OK\\\",\\\"result\\\":[{\\\"Address\\\":\\\"0xb4c79dab8f259c7aee6e5b2aa729821864227e84\\\"}],\\\"status\\\":\\\"1\\\"}\"\r\n2022-11-15T09:15:21.050264Z ERROR etherscan: Failed to deserialize response: data did not match any variant of untagged enum ResponseData res=\"{\\\"message\\\":\\\"OK\\\",\\\"result\\\":[{\\\"Address\\\":\\\"0x7109709ecfa91a80626ff3989d68f67f5b1dd12d\\\"}],\\\"status\\\":\\\"1\\\"}\"\r\nTest result: FAILED. 0 passed; 1 failed; finished in 1.16ms\r\n```",
