With the hardhat node, you can actually enable forking even if the hardhat node had never been forking before, by passing the following params to `hardhat_reset`:\r\n```json\r\n{ \"forking\": {\"jsonRpcUrl\": \"<fork_url>\" }\r\n```\r\nThis will start forking from the latest block on `fork_url` even if the hardhat node was started as purely a local dev node.\r\n\r\nTrying the same procedure against anvil yields a `Forking not enabled` error. I've tracked it down to this line: https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/d5c51a5007805486ee5a456d35865e0ee440c8a7/crates/anvil/src/eth/backend/mem/mod.rs#L415\r\n\r\nI'd like to bring anvil to feature parity with the hardhat RPC here and allow forking to be set for the first time via RPC. If maintainers agree, happy to open a PR.",

    "body": "I've started on this and seem to be in `tokio::sync::RwLock` hell. Feel like I'm going about it the wrong way at this point. \r\n\r\nI've moved most of the code from here:\r\nhttps://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/5cfed63071ef1bb06f90190d2f678f546bfc971c/crates/anvil/src/config.rs#L807-L807\r\n\r\nto a separate function and have added a `node_config` member to the `backend::mem::Backend` struct. This then allows the `backend` to \"call up\" to the `node_config` to get the `db` and `fork` structs back which it needs to setup forking for the first time. Since doing that, I've had to change `env` and `fork` inside of `backend::mem::Backend` to be wrapped in `tokio::sync::RwLock` and add a lot of subsequent awaits... Feels wrong and still not compiling because then I encounter a lot of `future is not Send` errors due to `env` and `fork` previously not needing async calls.\r\n\r\nMaybe instead of \"calling up\" from the `backend` I should allow the `EthApi` to replace the `backend` entirely? \r\n\r\nWould appreciate some pointers as I feel like I'm going against the grain here.
