  "body": "### Component\n\nAnvil\n\n### Have you ensured that all of these are up to date?\n\n- [X] Foundry\n- [X] Foundryup\n\n### What version of Foundry are you on?\n\nforge 0.2.0 (d5c51a5 2023-09-10T00:26:11.552502000Z)\n\n### What command(s) is the bug in?\n\nanvil\n\n### Operating System\n\nmacOS (Apple Silicon)\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nIt seems like `anvil_reset` is almost at feature parity with `hardhat_reset`, but it's missing one thing. With the hardhat node, you can actually enable forking even if the hardhat node had never been forking before, by passing the following params to `hardhat_reset`:\r\n```json\r\n{ \"forking\": {\"jsonRpcUrl\": \"<fork_url>\" }\r\n```\r\nThis will start forking from the latest block on `fork_url` even if the hardhat node was started as purely a local dev node.\r\n\r\nTrying the same procedure against anvil yields a `Forking not enabled` error. I've tracked it down to this line: https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/d5c51a5007805486ee5a456d35865e0ee440c8a7/crates/anvil/src/eth/backend/mem/mod.rs#L415\r\n\r\nI'd like to bring anvil to feature parity with the hardhat RPC here and allow forking to be set for the first time via RPC. If maintainers agree, happy to open a PR.",
