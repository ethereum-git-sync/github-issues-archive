  "body": "### Component\r\n\r\nForge, Anvil\r\n\r\n### Describe the feature you would like\r\n\r\nWhen broadcasting transactions with the recently introduced Solidity scripts, a `broadcasts` folder with the following structure gets created:\r\n\r\n```tree\r\n|-- broadcasts\r\n  `-- SCRIPT_NAME\r\n    `-- CHAIN_ID\r\n      `-- run-TIMESTAMP.json\r\n      `-- run-latest.json\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's up to each user to decide what chains to git ignore (should testnet deployments be kept in version control?), but I think that it would be a sensible default to git ignore the deployments made to Anvil.\r\n\r\nTo do that, we could add the following globs to the `.gitignore` file that gets generated when running `forge init`:\r\n\r\n```ignore\r\n!/broadcast\r\n/broadcast/*\r\n/broadcast/*/31337/\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe second glob is needed to also ignore the `SCRIPT_NAME` folder (otherwise it would get committed as an empty folder).",
