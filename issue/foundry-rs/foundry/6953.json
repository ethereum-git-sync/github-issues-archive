For example it regularly happens with Polygon and Polygonscan.com that those cannot get the smart contract verified using only 10 retries, because Polygonscan is having internal issues of catching up.\r\n\r\nSuggested fix is \r\n- To increase max retries to 999\r\n- Set default retries to 20\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_",
