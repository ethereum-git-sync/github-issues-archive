I have seen 3 issues with user accounts that are bots. Head off the spam now, as this will invariably be a target as foundry is crypto-related so it's even at a higher risk than normal popular repos.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nSolution: [docs.github.com/en/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/limiting-interactions-in-your-repository](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/limiting-interactions-in-your-repository)\r\n\r\nor alt. create a github action similar to [github.com/marketplace/actions/faceless-issues](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/faceless-issues) but without the comment disclosing about the avatar check and an additional check to see how many repos, commits or whatever other heuristic is relevant",
