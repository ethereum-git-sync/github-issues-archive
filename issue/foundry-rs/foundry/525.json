  "body": "First of all: Thanks everyone involved for creating `foundry`.\r\n\r\nThis might not be the correct repository but I thought that I'd post it regardless in case others stumble upon the same issue.\r\n\r\nWhen I clone, compile and run `foundry` on an M1 Mac I get the following error message when running `foundry build` in the example scaffold that is generated via `foundry init`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[1] philipp@MacBook-Pro-14> forge build\r\ncompiling...\r\nError: \r\n   0: \"/Users/philipp/.svm/0.8.11/solc-0.8.11\": Bad CPU type in executable (os error 86)\r\n\r\nLocation:\r\n   cli/src/cmd/mod.rs:49\r\n```\r\n\r\nOverall it looks like svm doesn't support Apple Silicon binaries as of yet. I found the following issue in the `svm-rs` repo that might be related to the problem: https://github.com/roynalnaruto/svm-rs/issues/12",

Still getting the same error (I also removed `~/.svm` before running it) 🤔\r\n\r\n**Edit 2:** The interesting part is that `svm-rs` seems to be lacking support for darwin-arm as per [this `enum`](https://github.com/roynalnaruto/svm-rs/blob/5518296f756458f878958a76b985b6fe423acad4/src/platform.rs#L5-L10)",

It definitely comes with a steep learning curve and a lot of times you have to fiddle around with the system yourself but I just love how everything is in `/nix` and installing new packages doesn't \"pollute\" the system (except for the dotfiles the packages create themselves in `~`).\r\n\r\nI looked through `foundryup` which is a great script to install Foundry but ideally I'd love to have Nix manage this for me (I want to build my own little package for this but haven't found the time to do that yet).\r\n\r\nThe other beautiful thing about the binaries is that they're \"portable\" so you can just move them around on your filesystem.",
