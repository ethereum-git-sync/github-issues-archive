    "body": "@DaniPopes \r\n\r\nOh it was a feature of revm. Thanks for letting me know.\r\n\r\nIn my case, if `uint256(blockhash(x - 1)) % 2 == uint256(blockhash(x - 2)) % 2`, a process is executed, but now it's completely failed.\r\nOf course, I know that `blockhash` is a weak source of randomness, and such codes are rare in real, but imo we should make it as close to real behavior.\r\n\r\nIt's not too much of a problem for the even-odd case, but I think it's bad that the blockhash, even though it's a 256-bit value, can be represented by a much smaller number of bits from a security point of view.\r\nFor example, if a contract has a bug that the upper bits of the blockhash value are missing in inline-assembly or something, the bug would not be detected in tests.\r\n\r\nSo i think `keccak256(block.number)` is enough.",
