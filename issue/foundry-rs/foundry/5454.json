Here is a simple example PoC to demonstrate it: \r\n```solidity\r\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED\r\npragma solidity ^0.8.21;\r\n\r\nimport \"forge-std/Test.sol\";\r\n\r\nlibrary MyLib {\r\n  error MyError();\r\n\r\n  function myMethodWithPublicCall(MyContract mc) internal returns (uint256 a) {\r\n    a = mc.myFunc(12);\r\n    revert MyError();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  function myMethodWithoutPublicCall() internal returns (uint256 a) {\r\n    a = 12;\r\n    revert MyError();\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract MyContract {\r\n  function myFunc(uint256 a) external returns (uint256 _a) {\r\n    _a = a;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract TestPoc is Test {\r\n  MyContract private _mc;\r\n\r\n  function setUp() public {\r\n    _mc = new MyContract();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  function testRevert_myMethodWithPublicCall_MyError() public {\r\n    vm.expectRevert(MyLib.MyError.selector);\r\n    MyLib.myMethodWithPublicCall(_mc);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  function testRevert_myMethodWithoutPublicCall_MyError() public {\r\n    vm.expectRevert(MyLib.MyError.selector);\r\n    MyLib.myMethodWithoutPublicCall();\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning `forge test --mc TestPoc` outputs the following:\r\n```\r\nRunning 2 tests for test/TestPoc.t.sol:TestPoc\r\n[FAIL. Reason: Call did not revert as expected] testRevert_myMethodWithPublicCall_MyError() (gas: 8390)\r\nTraces:\r\n  [8390] TestPoc::testRevert_myMethodWithPublicCall_MyError() \r\n    ├─ [0] VM::expectRevert(MyError()) \r\n    │   └─ ← ()\r\n    ├─ [235] MyContract::myFunc(12) \r\n    │   └─ ← 12\r\n    └─ ← \"Call did not revert as expected\"\r\n\r\n[PASS] testRevert_myMethodWithoutPublicCall_MyError() (gas: 3164)\r\nTest result: FAILED. 1 passed; 1 failed; 0 skipped; finished in 2.83ms\r\nRan 1 test suites: 1 tests passed, 1 failed, 0 skipped (2 total tests)\r\n\r\nFailing tests:\r\nEncountered 1 failing test in test/TestPoc.t.sol:TestPoc\r\n[FAIL. Reason: Call did not revert as expected] testRevert_myMethodWithPublicCall_MyError() (gas: 8390)\r\n\r\nEncountered a total of 1 failing tests, 1 tests succeeded\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe test passes for the version that does not perform a public call **before** the error is raised. On the contrary if a public call is performed before (and this calls does not revert with the expected error), then the test fails.\r\n\r\nWhat I would have imagined is `expectRevert` to behave the same way as `expectEmit`. `expectEmit` does not care if the very next event emitted it the one you are expecting. It only cares about two things:\r\n1. The expected event is emitted **at some point** within the transaction\r\n2. If several events are expected, you can omit some of them, but the ordering **must** match.\r\n\r\nWould be really helpful to be able to use `expectRevert` so that if the expected error is raised at some point within the transaction, the test passes.\r\n\r\nFor now I'm using `testFail` but not a fan of it. I am aware I could maybe wrap all my libraries in contracts and exposes their internal methods but as I sad my entire application is 90% made of libs so that's quite painfull.",

    "body": "> I am aware I could maybe wrap all my libraries in contracts and exposes their internal methods but as I sad my entire application is 90% made of libs so that's quite painfull.\r\n\r\nI know it's tedious to wrap like this, but unfortunately that is the recommended approach for now. Maybe we should have a codegen feature that can automatically generate these wrapper contracts? Let me know what you think, cc @gakonst @Evalir \r\n\r\n[This comment](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/5367#issuecomment-1635887313) provides references where you can read more about why we need to remove `expectRevert` support for jumps, I'd recommend giving that and the linked discussions a read.\r\n\r\nThe summary is: we can't reliably hook into jumps, and \"supporting\" expectReverts on jump was a bug that is now widely used, which is problematic because it has the following footgun:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nfunction testRevert_myMethodWithoutPublicCall_MyError() public {\r\n  // Jump to library method.\r\n  // This part works as expected and if the revert is seen the test passes.\r\n  vm.expectRevert(MyLib.MyError.selector);\r\n  MyLib.myMethodWithoutPublicCall();\r\n\r\n  // Jump to library method again.\r\n  // BUT execution never reaches here: it stops after the last expect revert was successful!\r\n  vm.expectRevert(MyLib.MyError.selector);\r\n  MyLib.myMethodWithoutPublicCall();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason you observe what you reported here is because in `testRevert_myMethodWithPublicCall_MyError` here's what happens:\r\n1. `vm.expectRevert(MyLib.MyError.selector)`: We tell forge we expect a revert\r\n2. `MyLib.myMethodWithPublicCall(_mc)`: Since `myMethodWithPublicCall` is an internal method, it's a JUMP and not a CALL\r\n    1. Maybe some non-reverting internal logic is here, maybe not, doesn't matter much \r\n    1. `a = mc.myFunc(12)`: We make an external call and forge now expects the revert here! When this call succeeds, the scope of \"where to expect a revert\" is over and we never saw one, so the test fails. If the prior step (internal library logic) did revert, that's where we'd be relying on the accidental/footgun jumps support of `expectRevert`\r\n\r\nGiven the assumption that we can't expectReverts for jumps, we'd appreciate any feedback on how to simplify the test process. Manually wrapping large libraries is tedious, so maybe a codegen feature/convention is the best approach to facilitate this? Let me know what you think :)",
