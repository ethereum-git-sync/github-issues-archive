  "body": "### Component\n\nForge, Cast\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nI am currently facing a dilemma when deploying a DApp, which usually requires deploying multiple contracts. Part of the construct args in these contracts are usually another contract that has just been deployed, and there are usually some settings that need to be interacted with the blockchain after the contract is deployed. \r\nWhen using Hardhat, you can write a deployment script in js/ts to take care of it, but when using Foundry, I have to keep `forge create`, then copying the address, then `forge create` again, and finally writing some long commands use `cast`. This is not a very good workflow. \r\nHave I done something wrong or is this how everyone does it? \r\nDoes Foundry have plans to support programmable contract deployment?\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
