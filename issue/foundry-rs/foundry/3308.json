    "body": "+1 on this, great idea\r\n\r\nShould `ignore` take a file path, or should there be three ignore fields analogous to the various match flags in `forge test`? Perhaps the keys are:\r\n- `ignore_path`\r\n- `ignore_contract` (also accepts libraries)\r\n- `ignore_function` (also accepts modifiers)\r\n\r\nPath is self explanatory, contract/function could be an array of the form `MyContract` or `functionSig(address)` OR `path/to/file.sol:Contract` OR `path/to/file.sol:Function` OR `path/to/file.sol:Contract:Function` \r\n\r\nIMO the main use case is copying in a dependency, and wanting to leave the formatting unchanged to simplify diffs against the original source, so I can see these suggestions being overkill with a single `ignore_path` key being all we need.\r\n\r\nOpen to either, but figured it was worth discussing :) ",
