  "body": "### Component\r\n\r\nForge\r\n\r\n### Describe the feature you would like\r\n\r\n- Currently implementing jsonParse and forge-std helper functions. Although we don't **have** to use the same field names in Solidity and in the JSON (they are serially decoded as a tuple -- we only care about the correct type), I think it would be unintuitive to the programmer if a field called `type` in the Json appeared as `transactionType` in the Solidity struct\r\n- `.transactions[].type` is a special word in Solidity \r\n- `.transactions[].tx.function` is a special word in Solidity\r\n- `.receipts[].returns` is a special word in Solidity\r\n- `transactions[].tx` is a special word in Solidity\r\n- `.transactions[].tx` have some optional fields that are not serialized in case of `None`. That makes the struct parsing very hard, as I have to create different structs for the different combinations and the user needs to expect that (otherwise the tuple serialization will be wrong).  It would be better if we serialized them with a `null` value, so the object is consistent with every run.\r\n\r\njsonParse: https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/pull/2293\r\nforge-std branch: https://github.com/odyslam/forge-std/tree/feat/parse-json\r\noriginally discussed in https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/2153 by @mds1 \r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_",
