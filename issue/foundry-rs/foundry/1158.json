Running `foundryup` should also update `foundryup` so users can get `foundryup` fixes and features without needing to check that for updates separately\r\n2. `foundryup` should be rewritten in rust so we don't need to maintain a separate bash script\r\n\r\n(If separate issues are preferred, let me know and I can just close this and make two new ones)\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

    "body": "This is a pretty breaking change since we need everyone to migrate to the new foundryup. We would need to think about how we make sure people do that. Since this is the case, we should probably also consider moving away from using GitHub releases for everything (and using our hacky workaround for release channels) into something a bit more sane like a manifest format and storing the artifacts on something like S3.\r\n\r\nFWIW I don't think this is something anyone can just pick up because of this, since it requires larger coordination of multiple pieces of the release pipeline.\r\n\r\nI have some thoughts on the interface for the foundryup CLI, it's capabilities and also design of the manifest format etc.\r\n\r\nWe should probably still upload artifacts to stable releases on GitHub though",
