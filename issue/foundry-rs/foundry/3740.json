To do this we use forge to generate a set of random inputs which represent a \"simple\" join, build the equivalent inputs for the \"full\" join and check to make sure that they both result in the same output.\r\n\r\n## Bug\r\n\r\nWe have the test file [`WeightedMath.t.sol`](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/forge-bound-assume-fail/pkg/pool-weighted/test/foundry/WeightedMath.t.sol) which contains two tests `testJoinSwap` and `testExitSwap`.\r\n\r\nBoth functions immediately call into the `prepareValues ` helper function to get a random valid set of weights for the pool to use. `prepareValues` contains the only `vm.assume` call in the entire contract.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/2181edffb71efda789221aca6a50c1b0d251b9da/pkg/pool-weighted/test/foundry/WeightedMath.t.sol#L46\r\n\r\n`prepareValues` only receives values from the fuzzer as inputs so we would assume that if one of the tests fails from too many invalid inputs then the other one should as well. However if we run the test suite we'll consistently see `testJoinSwaps` pass and `testExitSwaps` fail. \r\n\r\n```\r\n$ forge test -m \"test(Join|Exit)Swap\"\r\n[⠆] Compiling...\r\nNo files changed, compilation skipped\r\n\r\nRunning 2 tests for test/foundry/WeightedMath.t.sol:WeightedMathTest\r\n[FAIL.
