Was working previously, and now without changes to the contract or other parts of the PR, getting following error in CI. The contract being deployed takes in an array of structs, and our script passes in array of tuple like so \"[(struct element1, fields separated by commas)]\".\r\n\r\n```\r\nlocal_network_test    | The application panicked (crashed).\r\nlocal_network_test    | Message:  Could not parse types: TypeParser(Error(\"invalid type string: tuple\"))\r\nlocal_network_test    | Location: crates/forge/bin/cmd/create.rs:332\r\nlocal_network_test    | \r\nlocal_network_test    | This is a bug.
