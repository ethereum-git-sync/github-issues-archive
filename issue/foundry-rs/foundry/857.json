  "body": "The utils crate is currently a huge file filled with utility functions that do not necessarily have anything to do with each other. We should consider refactoring it and:\r\n\r\n- Moving some functions to other crates if it makes sense (for example, maybe linking should live in `forge` in some capacity)\r\n- Moving some functions to modules (for example, the decoding-related functions could live in a submodule called `decode`)",
