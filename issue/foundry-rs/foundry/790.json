  "body": "### Component\n\nCast\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nI have an idea for a small improvement to the `cast wallet new` command. Currently, the command emits an address and private key with trailing periods. These trailing periods can accidentally be copied and pasted into Metamask or `.env` files because they get included when double clicking on the address or private key.\r\n\r\n### Screenshot\r\n\r\n<img width=\"589\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-02-22 at 4 34 25 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3699047/155223637-6dcc07ef-5d0f-424b-ab37-c319e0be24cf.png\">\r\n \r\nProposal: remove the trailing periods\n\n### Additional context\n\nThis idea was inspired by https://github.com/withtally/rollcall/tree/main/scripts/eth-denver-workshop\r\n\r\n> Replace `<public key>` and `<private key>` with the output of the cast wallet new command above. Be sure to remove the trailing period.",
