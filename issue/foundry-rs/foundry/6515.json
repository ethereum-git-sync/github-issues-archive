I can't get this to work under any configuration.\r\n\r\n`forge verify-contract` falsely reports successful verification, while the verified code would not appear on etherscan. Only explicitly passed `--compiler-version` param specifying the compiler version makes the command actually verify contract.\r\n\r\n**All of the details, exact steps and exact configuration can be found in the PoC repo linked below\r\nhttps://github.com/barrutko/verification-issue-poc**",
