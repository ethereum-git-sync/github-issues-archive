Then, when trying to interact with that newly deployed contract using the address that was passed as an argument, I get the following error **Reason: Setup failed: Contract 0xCe71065D4017F316EC606Fe4422e11eB2c47c246 does not exist**. If I interact with that newly deployed contract using some other account (not the one that was passed to constructor), everything works as expected.\r\n\r\nSee code snippet:\r\n```\r\nfortressSwap = new FortressSwap(address(owner));\r\nconsole.log(\"fortressSwap address: \", address(fortressSwap));\r\nvm.prank(owner);\r\nfortressSwap.updateOwner(alice); \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe _fortressSwap address_ is **0xCe71065D4017F316EC606Fe4422e11eB2c47c246**.",
