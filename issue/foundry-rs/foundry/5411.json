That's one of the missing pieces in my [snekmate](https://github.com/pcaversaccio/snekmate) repo. I reckon that the same (or similar) solution for this feature could also be carried over to Huff or Fe contracts later.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nMy version of the `VyperDeployer` can be found [here](https://github.com/pcaversaccio/snekmate/blob/main/lib/utils/VyperDeployer.sol).",
