  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nA set of cheatcodes, similar to `record/accesses` and `recordLogs/getRecordedLogs` but for logging and returning the preimages used by the `keccak256` opcode.\r\n\r\nUse case: related to https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/6704, this is required to perform the spec validations for ERC-4337, which only allows reading/writing slots that are associated with a specific address in some circumstances. `record/access` is sufficient in cases in which this address is used directly as a slot value, but not in cases in which it is hashed together with another value, such as when using a mapping. It is also not sufficient to try to brute force mappings with low indexes, because this will not work for nested mappings.\r\n\r\n### Suggestion\r\n- `function recordPreImages() external;` - which starts recording all keccak preimages sliced out from memory\r\n- `function getRecordedPreImages() external returns (bytes[] memory);` - which returns all recorded preimages\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

However, one way this could work for my use case relatively easily is to change `stopMappingRecording` or add a new function that returns an array of all recorded mappings (similar to `stopAndReturnStateDiff`).
