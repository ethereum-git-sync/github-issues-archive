This makes them non-conformant with POSIX definition of lines of text. It also conflicts with many tools like text editors, which automatically insert the newline at the end of each file. Various code displaying tools like `gitk` also treat lack of the newline as an anomaly which needs to be explicitly highlighted, which generates noise.",
