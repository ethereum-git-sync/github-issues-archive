(mainly around how to filter out the test contracts, I think the rest should be easy to figure out)\r\n\r\nHere's my proposed implementation:\r\n- Refactor output of `forge build --sizes` to display a table similar to gas report so it's easier to read\r\n- Changes to the table:\r\n    - No test contracts shown\r\n    - Add a column that shows the delta between current size and max size\r\n    - Color red if over limit, yellow if over 18kb, green otherwise (18 kB feels arbitrary, open to changing the thresholds, but over 75% seems like a good range for yellow)\r\n- Modify `forge build --sizes` to always error if there's a contract over the size limit, similar to how `forge test` always errors if a test fails\r\n- \"some separate command to find the minimum optimizer runs that can fit your contracts into the limit\" — this feels like it can be pulled into a separate issue, and probably out of scope for my current implementation plan 😅",
