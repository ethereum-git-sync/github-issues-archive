  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nI would like to use foundry for simulation of transactions that I create in my golang backend. Currently, I use ganache for that, so I start ganache from my go code, deploy my contracts, set everything up and run the tx that I want to simulate, all through RPC.\r\n\r\nIt would be much easier to use forge for this and also, with ganache you are kind of blindfolded, while with foundry you get a nice trace and log output.\r\nThis would need the ability to parameterize a forge test run and one way would be to able to pass \"name=hexvalue\" on the forge command line that can then be accessed through a cheatcode.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
