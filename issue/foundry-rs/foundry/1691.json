  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nIn certain circumstances, it would be very helpful if Forge tests could read pre-configured variables (either from `foundry.toml` or sourced from the bash environment) for conditional/context-specific logic, without the need to use the potentially unsafe `vm.ffi` cheatcode.\r\n\n\n### Additional context\n\nThe Seaport test suite [uses `vm.ffi`](https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/seaport/blob/463bf8add301c7b3a326093122303dcc9658f0d0/test/foundry/utils/BaseConsiderationTest.sol#L40) with what is essentially a no-op to conditionally compile+deploy a set of contracts normally in order to surface stack traces and source code in the debugger when a specific Foundry profile is active.\r\n\r\nWe have included a warning about the dangers of using `ffi`, but it would be even better if we did not have to use it at all.",
