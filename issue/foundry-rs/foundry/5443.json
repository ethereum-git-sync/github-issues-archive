  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nIt would be great if it was possible to have a CLI flag that enabled writing a file to disk after `forge script` execution that includes the altered state as a JSON file compatible with go-ethereum's genesis serialization.  This doesn't necessarily need to be a full state diff with the pre and post state, just the post state is useful. Then developers will have a way to see the exact side effects of their script as all of the modified state will be in this JSON file.\r\n\n\n### Additional context\n\nThis is particularly useful to Optimism so that our foundry based deployment scripts can have test coverage in our in memory end to end test suite by running the deployment using `forge` and outputting a JSON file that is then consumed by the e2e tests to initialize the L1 genesis state.",
