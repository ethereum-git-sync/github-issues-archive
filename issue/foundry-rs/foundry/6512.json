If the default\r\n bundle file isn't adequate, you can specify an alternate file\r\n using the --cacert option.\r\nIf this HTTPS server uses a certificate signed by a CA represented in\r\n the bundle, the certificate verification probably failed due to a\r\n problem with the certificate (it might be expired, or the name might\r\n not match the domain name in the URL).\r\nIf you'd like to turn off curl's verification of the certificate, use\r\n the -k (or --insecure) option.\r\nHTTPS-proxy has similar options --proxy-cacert and --proxy-insecure.\r\n```\r\nvery new to coding in general any help would be much appreciated. Not sure how to approach this or any other ways to download or just use one of the proxy commands and trust it? \r\n</div>",
