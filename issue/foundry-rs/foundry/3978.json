Assuming a user wants to compile/deploy with via-ir, and given that `forge coverage` requires no optimizer/via-ir and effectively ignores the config file when invoked, there are two scenarios:\r\n1. `forge coverage` is able to compile normally, so you get coverage results with no via-ir, then deploy with via-ir\r\n2. `forge coverage` is not able to compile normally, so it exits with an error and you are unable to run coverage\r\n\r\nWhat am I missing here / what is the bug?",

    "body": "> It is odd that you say that the regular optimizer is not supported, because I have managed to successfully obtain a coverage report even with the optimizer enabled.\r\n\r\nHmm I think we might be misunderstanding each other a bit here. @mattsse can correct me if I'm wrong but my understanding of forge coverage is it behaves as follows: when you run `forge coverage` it ignores all solidity build settings you have configured and compiles with default solc settings, i.e. no optimizer and no via-ir. \r\n\r\nIn your case, it just meant your contracts are able to be compiled both with and without the optimizer.\r\n\r\n> I mean failing early - not even trying to compile if Forge sees that `--via-ir` is enabled. Just stop the execution and show an error there.\r\n\r\nSay I want to deploy with via-ir because it results in cheaper functions for users. Let's also say my contract still compiles normally, even if via-ir is not used. In this case, why would I want `forge coverage` to fail early? Getting coverage information is still useful, even though it was compiled differently than the production version will be",
