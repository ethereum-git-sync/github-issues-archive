    "body": "the proxy ones somewhat unreliable, as they use heuristics to detect proxies, and the heuristics differ across etherscan deployments 😬  e.g. kovan etherscan detects fewer proxy types than mainnet etherscan, and proxy detection heuristics have to be added by engineers (or just patched up via manual CSR review)\r\n\r\nHowever, there's an etherscan support page that lets you tell the etherscan CSRs that it's a proxy. You can find it by submitting a failed proxy verification attempt so I don't have the link on hand 😓. Would be a good idea to link users to that page from the output of `forge verify-proxy-check` (or whatever the command ends up being) when it fails",

    "body": "> btw guys, when I try to implement this and deploy minimal proxy on arbiscan it get auto-verified (in testnet and mainnet). So I think this feature is unnecessary coz the proxy contract is automatically verified.\r\n\r\nthis happens for well-known proxies, but even slight variations cause automatic detection to fail. A large set of proxies will not be automatically verified but can be verified by API request",
