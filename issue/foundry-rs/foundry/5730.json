It's called a lot by fuzz and invariant tests (`foundry_evm::executor::Executor::ensure_success` -> `revm::db::in_memory_db::CacheDB::insert_contract`). CC @Evalir @rakita\r\n- Rust bump from 1.71 to 1.72, as I've seen some regressions on the Rust issue tracker\r\n\r\nI've tested locally and overall performance is better for normal tests but ~30% slower for running with the `ci` profile like in your example.",
