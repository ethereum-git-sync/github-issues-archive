  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nIt'd be great to be able to call a state changing (i.e. non-view) method on a contract to get it's return value without affecting contract state.\r\n\r\nBasically it'd be doing the same thing as the [`eth_call` method ](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#eth_call). \r\n\r\nNote that this is different from just calling the method outside a `broadcast`-block since afaik those calls would still affect the simulated state during the scripts runtime.\r\n\r\nThe syntax could look something like this:\r\n```\r\nvm.startStaticCall();\r\nuint returnValue = contract.stateChangingMethod();\r\nvm.stopStaticCall();\r\n```\n\n### Additional context\n\nExamples of this functionality in existing libraries:\r\n- [ethers.js](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#eth_call)\r\n- [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.6/web3-eth-contract.html#methods-mymethod-call)",
