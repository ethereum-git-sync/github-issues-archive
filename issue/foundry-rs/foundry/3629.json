There was an infinite loop in one of the smart contract that I'm testing and it gets stuck at `Compiler run successful (with warnings)` when `forge test` is ran.\r\n\r\nTo replicate the issue, create a test or contract under test that doesn't terminate, ie:\r\n```\r\n...\r\n    function testLoop() public {\r\n        while (true) {\r\n            // Do nothing\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning `forge test` will have the terminal stuck at `Compiler run successful (with warnings)` until manually terminated. This may be a problem when testing in CI where the program will consume extra compute hours. \r\n\r\nSuggestion is to allow for test to have a gas limit that can be adjusted by the user or a global timeout for the test. This ensure that the program always terminates and also testers can be more aware of the gas consumed.",
