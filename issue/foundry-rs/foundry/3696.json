Right now it's frustrating because I have do a lot of manual work to remove & reinstall a submodule because `forge remove` isn't working as expected for me either. I could continue with the current way I'm doing things, but I figured I might as well throw up a post as I haven't seen a Github issue about this but there are a couple instances of this in the Telegram chat.\r\n\r\n# Problem\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ forge update lib/celo-foundry\r\nError:\r\nSubmodule 'lib/celo-foundry' (https://github.com/spiralsprotocol/celo-foundry) registered for path 'lib/celo-foundry'\r\nCloning into '/Users/dzq/spirals/protocol/lib/celo-foundry'...\r\nfatal: Needed a single revision\r\nUnable to find current origin/master revision in submodule path 'lib/celo-foundry'\r\n```\r\n\r\nMost recommendations I could find online tell me to then just remove the submodule and reinstall it.
