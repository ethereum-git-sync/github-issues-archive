  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nInstalling dependencies through `forge` currently requires more manual steps than, e.g., through `npm` on hardhat. This is because `remappings.txt` is not automatically updated when a new library is included.\r\n\r\nThis proposal suggests including an option on `forge install` that would automatically update `remappings.txt`\n\n### Additional context\n\nIt is possible to install and automatically search for `.sol` files, and based on that add the corresponding remapping. Another idea is to have a directory of commonly used libraries and default remappings for that (e.g. `@openzeppelin/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts/`), but it requires more maintenance and is not very scalable.",
