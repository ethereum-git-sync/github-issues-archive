Assuming the output should match dapptools, then:\r\n\r\ndapptools:\r\n```\r\n  -- log_named_decimal_int(\"decimal int\", -1.0e18, 18)\r\n  decimal int: -1.000000000000000000\r\n```\r\n\r\nforge:\r\n```\r\n  -- log_named_decimal_int(\"decimal int\", -1.0e18, 18)\r\n  decimal int: -1000000000000000000000000000000000000\r\n```\r\n\r\nI guess the # of trailing zeros for dapptools is arbitrary. @gakonst do you want to match dapptools exactly? I don't see any reason to have 18 trailing zeros.\r\n\r\nHappy to take care of this",
