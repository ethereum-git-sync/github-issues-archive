  "body": "## Problem\r\n\r\nRight now the shipped binaries make assumptions about where dynamically-linked libraries live. This is a problem for NixOS and other Linux distros that use less usual FHS layouts (there are dozens of us!).\r\n\r\n1. The binaries that ship in the release are not statically linked, so there's several shared libraries that aren't loaded successfully (I suspect this can be `patchelf`'d in a pinch)\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ldd forge\r\n\tlinux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffe0b58f000)\r\n\tlibssl.so.1.1 => not found\r\n\tlibcrypto.so.1.1 => not found\r\n[...]\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. `forge build` downloads a `solc` binary which suffers from the same problem.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ forge build\r\ncompiling...\r\nError:\r\n   0: \"/home/shazow/.svm/0.8.2/solc-0.8.2\": No such file or directory (os error 2)\r\n[...]\r\n$ ldd /home/shazow/.svm/0.8.2/solc-0.8.2\r\n\tlinux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffec07b9000)\r\n\tlibdl.so.2 => /nix/store/s9qbqh7gzacs7h68b2jfmn9l6q4jwfjz-glibc-2.33-59/lib/libdl.so.2 (0x00007fe833da6000)\r\n\tlibm.so.6 => /nix/store/s9qbqh7gzacs7h68b2jfmn9l6q4jwfjz-glibc-2.33-59/lib/libm.so.6 (0x00007fe833c65000)\r\n\tlibc.so.6 => /nix/store/s9qbqh7gzacs7h68b2jfmn9l6q4jwfjz-glibc-2.33-59/lib/libc.so.6 (0x00007fe833aa0000)\r\n\t/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 => /nix/store/s9qbqh7gzacs7h68b2jfmn9l6q4jwfjz-glibc-2.33-59/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007fe834965000)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI tried using `forge build --no-auto-detect` but looks like it's refusing to use my local version.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ which solc\r\n/nix/store/5q9xn2s9pjav5fsh7qg8nj94gnj3jqdg-solc-0.8.2/bin/solc\r\n$ forge build --no-auto-detect\r\ncompiling...\r\nError:\r\n   0: \"/home/shazow/.svm/0.8.2/solc-0.8.2\": No such file or directory (os error 2)\r\n[...]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Solutions\r\n\r\n1. The low hanging fruit would be to build the shipped binaries as more statically linked than they are now. I do this for some other projects I maintain (mainly Go), it helps reduce all kinds of problems (can make it runnable on Alpine and other minimalist distros!) in exchange for larger binaries.\r\n\r\n2. The more sustainable solution is to rely less on out-of-band binary fetching, and more on distro-friendly pre-packaging.\r\n\r\nI understand that the current state of the project is in flux and perhaps the main demographic is people who copypasta curl-bash into their terminals (per the README), but realistically it does not need to be a big change to make this more distro packaging friendly. Even if we're not ready to start tagging releases, small things like changing the default Cargo dependencies to load specific versions rather than git main would go a long way (e.g. ethers-rs). Happy to send some PRs to this effect if it sounds desirable. :)",

    "body": "I'd love nix support. :)\r\n\r\nIf you could include a `flake.nix` derivation, so that any distro that supports the `nix` package manager (basically everything) will be able to automagically build foundry from source in one command. This would also make it trivial to add to the [nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs) package set as a full derivation (which would also give binary caches for free).\r\n\r\nI started some work on this here, but still needs more work: https://github.com/shazow/foundry/pull/1\r\n\r\nSomewhat related to https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/issues/315 but I wanted to clarify that you can have this declaration in a generic way that does not require any further maintenance (unless your build process changes substantially), and you don't need to use it to manage your releases or anything like that.\r\n\r\n[Edit] The other option is to make a derivation that just downloads the latest binary releases, has all the correct inputs, and tries to patchelf the broken ldd's. It's not preferred but there are lots of binary-only packages that do this.\r\n\r\n[Edit2] Worth noting that the solc problem will still be a thing, though.

By nature, non-statically-linked binaries don't work. We have decent tooling for patching the dynamically linked paths, and one idea would be to allow for a hook to run on install but that modifies the hash so hash-based version detection goes out the window.\r\n\r\nIn a full Nix-ified version of this, you would specify the derivation and companion versions you want available, and nix would make sure it's available for you. If foundry has provisions for enabling this scenario (ie. allow for multiple versions of solc to be available for selection but without necessarily relying on a binary fetcher), then I think the rest can be done in the nix packaging out of band. \r\n\r\nWould it be possible for it to be an ENV var rather than a flag with every command?\r\n\r\n[Edit] Also would be even nicer if the solc version selection still works if present (perhaps via sub-path? or ENV var?) but it doesn't rely on hashes and fetching.",
