Can they somehow not be mutually exclusive?\r\n\r\nSuch is basically disabling formatting by custom config in the monorepos...\r\n\r\nI believe that mine user error could be an error not just for me as a user, since some of the DApps want to enable rapid development by having a monorepo and yet use the newest toolings such as Foundry.\r\n\r\nHowever, my particular case is next:\r\n```\r\n.\r\n├── README.md\r\n├── apps\r\n├── contracts\r\n├── node_modules\r\n├── package.json\r\n├── packages\r\n├── pnpm-lock.yaml\r\n├── pnpm-workspace.yaml\r\n├── remappings.txt\r\n└── turbo.json\r\n```\r\n\r\n> I leave `remappings.txt` so Solidity LSP running in VSCode doesn't go crazy. \r\n\r\n`foundry.toml` is hidden in the `contracts` folder. I tried first as you propose, to simply have `forge fmt` in the `lint-staged` script to format staged files, but the formatting rules I state in the config are not being respected.\r\n\r\nOnly when I do `forge fmt --root contracts` or format the files from the `contracts` folder one by one fixes the issue.\r\n\r\nI would love to see those arguments to work together.\r\n\r\n------\r\nThanks for diving into `lint-staged` library which probably does not come from your area of development.",
