This has 2 consequences.\r\n\r\n1) In a test run where a few iterations succeed, and a subsequent one fails, the traces seem to show a random trace of a successful fuzzed iteration. As such, it's hard to pinpoint the exact problem through the traces. The error message shows the arguments on which it fails, yet the test with that argument is not shown in the traces.\r\n2) In a test run where the first iteration of a fuzzed test fails, no traces are shown. This makes me believe that on a failed test, no traces are kept (and thus, no traces can be shown).\r\n\r\nThe expected behavior would be to have the trace of the failed iteration shown.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce, I have a small repro here: [https://github.com/j-vp/foundry-2848](https://github.com/j-vp/foundry-2848). This is a slightly modified version of the `forge init` project.\r\n\r\nUpon launching a few `forge test -vvv`'s, you'll notice that sometimes it doesn't show a trace and sometimes it does. When it doesn't show a trace, it will have `args=[0]` and `runs: 0`.\r\nWhen it does show a trace, it will be a trace of a successful run and `runs` will be `>0`.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the screenshot below, note the trace of a passed iteration, and the `runs: 0` when no trace is shown.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104004836/185644259-e256f355-e9e4-4c5d-8b94-3ca385a99f9a.png)\r\n",
