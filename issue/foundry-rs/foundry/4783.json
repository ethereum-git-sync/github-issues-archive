I am facing a initcode limit issue when deploying a contract now and I have no idea how to handle it, because locally it goes right in a fork (anvil should have a flag for setting a maximum initcode size too). Meanwhile, do you know how can I know the creation code size so I can reduce it or split transactions?\r\n\r\nThanks!",
