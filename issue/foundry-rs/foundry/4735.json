This time is when using `stdstore` to `find` the storage slot of a struct variable. \r\n```js\r\nuint256 slot = stdstore\r\n            .target(address(contract))\r\n            .sig('MyStruct()')\r\n            .depth(0)\r\n            .find();\r\n```\r\n\r\nLike with the bug mentioned in the beginning, if I add the prefix `RUST_LOG=forge=trace,foundry_evm=trace,ethers=trace` to my original command `forget test -m $FUNC -vvv`, I can see all the RPC requests being done. \r\n\r\nAnd also, like in that bug, adding a specific sender with `targetSender(address)`  or the fuzz runs don't solve the issue.",
