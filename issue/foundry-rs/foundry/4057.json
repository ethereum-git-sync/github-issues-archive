The issue is when we want to have multiples keys on the same `foundry.toml` like here â†“\r\n<img width=\"1273\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23560242/211301776-371f301b-80f1-4165-9828-fcfcecda1ba0.png\">\r\n\r\nThis will not work... Actually, only the `etherscan_api_key` seems to be chosen even when using the `-c BSC` to change the chain.\r\n cmd used : \r\n```bash\r\ncast interface 0xc0e8D30D2ead2C324b3f1A8386992Ba1Be534CbF  -c bsc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nThe intented behavior should be to use the key associated to `bsc` or any others network to go faster.",
