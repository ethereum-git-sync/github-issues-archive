On [this comment](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/693#issuecomment-1122014755) the developer created its own shell script to handle deployment and upgrades.\r\n\r\nCheck [this tutorial](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/uups-proxies-tutorial-solidity-javascript/7786) about how deployments/upgrades are handled in hardhat.\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nDeploying an upgradable contract can be done in the following way:\r\n\r\n```\r\nforge create [--kind <UPGRADE_PATTERN_TYPE>] [--upgrade] <CONTRACT>\r\n```\r\n\r\n`kind` should be [one of](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/api-hardhat-upgrades#common-options):\r\n- uups\r\n- transparent\r\n- beacon\r\n\r\n`upgrade` should be used only when upgrading the contract. It shouldn't be used when deploying it for the first time.\n\n### Additional context\n\n- [OpenZeppelin Hardhat plugin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-upgrades/tree/master/packages/plugin-hardhat)",
