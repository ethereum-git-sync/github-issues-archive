  "body": "### Component\r\n\r\nForge\r\n\r\n### Describe the feature you would like\r\n\r\nForge writes out Solidity artifacts in a flat structure. Is it possible to allow for maintaining the directory structure (or at least the top level directories like `src` `lib` and `test`) inside the artifacts `out`?\r\n\r\nI am using TypeChain to generate TS types for contracts and when I point it at the `out` directory, I get a lot of typed files for Solidity that I'll never end up using (mostly test stuff). I am able to exclude files with `.t.sol` extensions but it doesn't help for transitive dependencies like `Test.sol` and `Vm.sol` and `console.sol` from `forge-std`.\r\n\r\nMy typechain command looks something like:\r\n```bash\r\ntypechain --target ethers-v5 \"out/**/!(*.t|test).sol/!(*.abi).json\" --out-dir types\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'd rather not have to maintain a list of every contract/solidity file to generate types for and update that as I add more to the list. A slightly more nested directory structure in `out` would help with this and could use a glob like:\r\n```bash\r\ntypechain --target ethers-v5 \"out/src/**/!(*.abi).json\" --out-dir types\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso open to other ideas!\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nHere's an example repo using forge: https://github.com/holic/web3-scaffold\r\n\r\nAnd a recent PR that moves from `ds-test` to `forge-std`: https://github.com/holic/web3-scaffold/pull/20\r\n\r\nI've opted to generate types (and compile down to JS) + check them into the repo for ease of use when importing them into/using them from the app package. I have a CI script that ensures the built files are up to date with the source files. (This was all previously done at deploy time but added too much time to the deploy step, which happens more often than editing Solidity).",
