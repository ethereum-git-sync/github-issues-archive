MakerDAO is actively expanding to other chains. Currently we do integration testing with hardhat because you can connect to multiple forks at once. It would be nice if we have some cheatcode to switch between chains.\r\n\r\nFor example you could configure:\r\n\r\nmainnet: https://ethereumendpoint\r\noptimism: https://optimismendpoint\r\n\r\nWe could then toggle between the networks:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvm.switchContext(\"mainnet\");\r\n// do something on mainnet\r\nvm.switchContext(\"optimism\")\r\n// do something on optimism\r\n```\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
