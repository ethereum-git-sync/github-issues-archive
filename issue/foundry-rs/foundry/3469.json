The value is currently only \"u8\" that means we loose the link between solidity and rust and have to manually define our own enums.\r\nBeing to directly refer to the solidity enum in our rust bindings would greatly simplify the life of the developer there.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_",
