OpenZeppelin does this, for instance:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/f8e3c375d19bd12f54222109dd0801c0e0b60dd2/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol#L60\r\n- https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/f8e3c375d19bd12f54222109dd0801c0e0b60dd2/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol#L178\r\n- https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/f8e3c375d19bd12f54222109dd0801c0e0b60dd2/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol#L232\r\n\r\nI imagine that the algorithm would go something like this in Forge:\r\n\r\n- `{Contract}`: link to the contract page, e.g. `/src/Contract.sol/contract.Contract.md`\r\n- `{function}` (or `{event}`}: relative link in the same document with `#`, e.g. `#-function`\r\n- `{Contract-function}`: link to the contract page and the function section by adding a `#` in the URL, e.g. `/src/Contract.sol/contract.Contract.md#function`",
