Only align items with the same function used, and when there are no line breaks in between them.\r\n2. Left-justify all lines to the character length of the longest item from the previous parameter.\r\n3. Align all params with each other.\r\n4. Break into multiline syntax with a line break above if the alignment causes a line to become too long.\r\n\r\nFor structs, it would just be rule 2 for all the params in the struct.\r\n\r\nHere's some examples of some diffs of me doing this manually:\r\n![Screenshot 2023-05-29 at 4 23 49 PM](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/assets/44272939/05529725-9df9-4e22-b76b-f9592db02133)\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2023-05-29 at 4 25 31 PM](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/assets/44272939/0a14ea2f-bb97-4841-aa51-6f7f49c2064a)\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2023-05-29 at 4 26 51 PM](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/assets/44272939/ade0b5de-b332-4f77-a24f-426ebd47277d)\r\n\r\nMulti-param alignment demonstrated below\r\n```solidity\r\nvm.serializeUint(keyLongerLength, 'baseRateConversion', strategy.baseRateConversion());\r\nvm.serializeUint(key,             'borrowSpread',       strategy.borrowSpread());\r\nvm.serializeUint(key,             'supplySpread',       strategy.supplySpread());\r\nvm.serializeUint(key,             'maxRate',            strategy.maxRate());\r\n```\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
