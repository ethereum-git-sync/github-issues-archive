The use case is clear, it can make it easier and help save time for a lot of common on-chain operations.\r\n\r\nThe challenge is to make it a plugin-like system, such that users can easily add new commands.\n\n### Additional context\n\nHave started looking into this, specifically at the method described [here](https://twitter.com/ceccon_me/status/1480246020063780864). I will try to learn more about clap, and see if this approach makes sense.\r\n\r\nSuggestions for alternative methods are welcome!",
