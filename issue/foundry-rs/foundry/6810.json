  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\n`anvil` has the ability to dump state via CLI flag and RPC endpoint. It would be nice to be able to dump state similarly using a cheatcode in a foundry script. This would be the inverse to a recently added cheatcode, `vm.loadAllocs(string)`. The cheatcode that dumps state could be useful for generating JSON files to be read via `loadAllocs`. The JSON files could also be read into other tools such as initializing a geth based custom network.\r\n\r\nAt Optimism, we would use this cheatcode to generate the L2 genesis files. Right now we have a lot of custom code written in Go that could all be eliminated if we could build the L2 genesis using `forge`. It would also greatly simplify the tooling as the exact same code that sets up the L2 state for unit tests would easily be able to generate the L2 genesis files.\r\n\r\nIdeally the script contract is omitted from the dump, but we could handle post processing outside of foundry if necessary.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
