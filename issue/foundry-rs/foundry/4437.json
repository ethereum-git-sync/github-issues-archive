  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nHey. I just ran into a problem that wasted more time that I'm willing to admit.\r\n\r\nFoundry has a feature where tests named `testFailSomething` are expected to fail. It's easy to forget about it.\r\n\r\nSo I found myself in a situation where test is failing for some unknown reason and all I get is this message:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[FAIL. Reason: Assertion failed.]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be good if this particular failure had a more user-friendly message, pointing to the reason behind the failure. It's easy to come up with a test name like `testFailsWhenCalledContractFailed` and not know about the `testFailXXX` feature.\r\n\r\nMessage like `FAIL. Reason: test was expected to revert, but it did not.` or something similar.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

    "body": "@gakonst We should probably just remove `testFail` at this point, things like this have happened a few times and I don't think  we need support for it anymore. Similar to https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/3153#issuecomment-1445486191, we should look for tests named `testFail*` and print an issue/warning to inform users not to use this test name/format.\r\n\r\n@rafales In the meantime I'd suggest following the naming conventions in https://book.getfoundry.sh/tutorials/best-practices, which are `test_RevertIf_Condition` ",
