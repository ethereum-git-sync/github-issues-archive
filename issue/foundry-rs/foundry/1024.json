    "body": "This is not present in the REVM port either because we decided that \r\n\r\n1) it clutters the traces and \r\n2) `console.log` has borked function signatures that we need to patch. If we want to include it in the traces we need to patch function selectors every time there is a call to the `console.log` address which may degrade performance.\r\n\r\nI'm curious why you think it would be useful to have it in traces - can you elaborate a bit on your use case?",

Then, I add a console.log in my code to output further debugging information that I need to pinpoint the problem and run the test again.\r\nAt that point, I find myself scrolling between the traces and Logs section and try to map when which log output happened in the chronological order of the trace output. \r\nIt just would be handy and easier to read to have the output inline in the trace section. Right now, it's actually more readable to emit my own events with debug information instead of using console.log.",
