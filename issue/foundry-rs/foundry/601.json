  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nTo be backwards compatible with dapptools we need to be able to override the chain ID, even when forking. If you run a test in fork mode using DappTools the chain ID will always still be 99, whereas we fetch the chain ID from the RPC.\r\n\r\nWe should allow for both scenarios, so:\r\n\r\n- No `--chain-id`: fetch chain ID from RPC\r\n- `--chain-id`: override chain ID from RPC\n\n### Additional context\n\nCurrently mds1/drai is failing in our integration test suite because the domain separator is expected to be calculated using chain ID 99, even though the tests are run in fork mode.",
