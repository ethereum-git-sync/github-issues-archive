    "body": "Following up here. This seems to occur when I add more functions (or any code). If I delete some code, I can deploy without an error (and I'm pretty sure it does not have anything to do with \"linking\", unless I misunderstand that word). Could this then simply be when the max code size is reached? Did the error messages get messed up?\r\n\r\nEdit: Perhaps ignore what I just wrote there (noticed that I was on an older version that didn't display the message). Just want to mention that this is still very much a real issue and currently is entirely hindering me from deploying in a specific repository. Got a friend to reproduce and he is able to run the scripts without any issues. For me the problem persists, even after re-installing foundry, cleaning, changing the config...",
