    "body": "We use Foundry at my work, and I wanted to write a Homebrew formula for it for a few reasons:\r\n- `curl | bash`-ing a script off the internet is not very safe, and we all know how much of a target people who work in crypto are.\r\n- Putting this in homebrew will encourage people to upgrade foundry regularly, as they upgrade everything else they have in Homebrew.\r\n- People who are installing foundry for the first time and people who are upgrading will be on the same version, whereas right now they'll get differently nightly versions if they. This adds another small friction point when trying to debug issues together.\r\n\r\nHowever, I was forced to put it in a Homebrew tap instead of Homebrew Core because Foundry is not properly versioned.\r\n\r\nIf it would be helpful, I'm happy to help you guys set up some release documentation (and possibly tooling if needed) around this.",
