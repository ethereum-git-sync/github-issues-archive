Below I will discuss the issue in the context of the Optimism monorepo, but I've also created a minimal repro example [here](https://github.com/maurelian/solidity-sandbox/blob/main/src/test/12_yul.sol#L10-L16). \r\n\r\n**Issue:**\r\n\r\nWhen I run `forge coverage` in [this dir](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock) of our repo, it fails with `yul if statement had no body`.\r\n\r\nI searched through all of the assembly block in solidity code within that directory, and could only find [one instance](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/79f31007470b582ab79718e5e021687e42f92865/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/libraries/rlp/Lib_RLPReader.sol#L158) of a yul `if` statement, which does look like it has a body. \r\n\r\nWhat's odd is that I was unable to get past the issue by rewriting it as a `switch`/`case` statement (which did work OK in the minimal repro I linked above). So perhaps the issue is in a dependency (I will go check now).\r\n\r\n\r\n",
