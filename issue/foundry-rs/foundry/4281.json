I know it might be a bit ugly in terms of not be so well-defined when multiple tests are being run and potentially multiple calls to `vm.startChisel` are being made, but I think this would make a great additional feature for debugging. It could also only be activated if a single test match is found.\r\n\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
