  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nOpen to other prefix name ideas, but basically right now there's no way to distinguish broadcasted logs from dry runs when looking at JSON files in the `broadcast` file. It's useful to still generate them for local inspection / facilitating writing scripts/tests that read them in.\r\n\r\nI also think we should update the default `.gitignore` on `forge init` to include `broadcast/dry-run-*.json` \r\n\r\nAnother solution to this problem is a flag to enable/disable saving them, but that's more tedious / easy to mess up and overwrite your `run-latest.json` file\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
