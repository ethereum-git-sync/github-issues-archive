  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nDuring development in large code bases, it it often useful to use the `--match-test` flag to zero in on specific tests. However, making one small change in `src` often leads to Forge recompiling all test files:\r\n\r\n```text\r\n[â ’] Compiling 139 files with 0.8.19\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis operation takes time (minutes) even with the optimizer disabled (and via IR disabled, too).\r\n\r\nIt would be helpful if Forge could exclude all test files not matched via `--match-test` (or `--match-contract`, or `--match-path`) from the compilation step.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
