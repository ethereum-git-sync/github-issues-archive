  "body": "### Component\n\nAnvil\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nWe setup an anvil localnode for integration tests, deploy contracts, register some txs, and then save this state. The problem is that the events have meaningful information that needs to be queried from offchain code. However, anvil only has a --dump-state feature, and when starting anvil with `anvil --load-state saved_state.json`, all receipts are lost, and the chain is restarted at block 0.\r\n\r\nWould be useful to have a flag `--dump-receipts` that would also dump the receipts in a file, and could restart the chain with those events. Is that possible? \n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
