So, you _must_ define the API key as an env var or as a flag to the `create` command in order to pass the preflight check and deploy the contract.\r\n\r\nNow, you also can't pass in a dummy API keys. The env var and command flag taking precedence over `foundry.toml`'s etherscan values. (And so does the `etherscan_api_key` value in a profile.)\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, the values do get read, but `get_etherscan_config_with_chain()` in `config/src/lib.rs` defaults to using an env var if available.\r\n\r\nThis approach seems a little counter intuitive since Etherscan now has a fragmented API Key setup across lots of chains, and it's easy to pull env vars into the `foundry.toml` file.\r\n\r\nI will follow-up with a PR suggesting a change that worked for the example above.",
