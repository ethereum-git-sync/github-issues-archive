  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nLet's say right now my invariant test is setup with two contracts:\r\n- Contract A has 1 function selector, `fn0`.\r\n- Contract B has 20 function selectors, `fn1` through `fn20`.\r\n\r\nAs I understand it, right now the process is:\r\n1. First Contract A or Contract B will be chosen randomly\r\n2. Then we look at the available selectors for each and randomly choose one.\r\n\r\nThis means `fn0` will be chosen ~50% of the time, and `fn1` through `fn20` are each only chosen 50 / 20 = 2.5% of the time. Ideally, each of the 21 functions would be chosen 100 / 21 = ~4.76% of the time\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
