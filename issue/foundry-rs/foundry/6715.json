  "body": "The objective is to deduplicate the internal anvil types in `anvil-core`, used for storage and internal representation of state and phase out ethers. This involves:\r\n- Removing the duplicated types in `anvil-core` which are now included in https://github.com/alloy-rs/alloy/pull/83\r\n- Using the new alloy signers\r\n- Migrating any custom needed anvil internal types (e.g `ImpersonatedTransaction`) to alloy.\r\n- Migrating anvil's txpool/execution logic to use alloy.\r\n\r\nMilestones on (`anvil-core`):\r\n- [ ] `ethers_compat.rs` phased out\r\n- [ ] `block.rs` phased out as duplicate\r\n- [ ] `state.rs` phased out as duplicate\r\n- [ ] `receipt.rs` phased out as duplicate by using the new receipt type in Alloy Consensus\r\n- [ ] `subscription.rs` types migrated to use alloy-rpc types, consensus or core types wherever needed\r\n- [ ] `trie.rs` migrated (migration needed for `eth_getProof` endpoint)\r\n- [ ] `utils.rs` migrated to using alloy rlp encoding instead of parity rlp.\r\n- [ ] `anvil`'s `executor.rs` migrated to use alloy types.\r\n- [ ] all `ToAlloy/ToEthers` conversions removed\r\n- [ ] `fastrlp` dropped\r\n\r\nThe result of this is that we will end up removing all the remaining `ToAlloy`/`ToEthers` conversions in anvil, as we won't longer have the separation between alloy-based rpc types and ethers-based internal types, but rather both will come from `alloy-rs/alloy`, and use the alloy primitive types. This allows us to drop ethers completely from anvil.",
