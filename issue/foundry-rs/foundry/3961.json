This leads to some issues (eg. https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/pull/3960) where the same cheatcode test passes on `forge test` but it would fail on `forge script`, and we don't know.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if `TestConfig` could be configurable to additionally run some tests as scripts. Ideally we'd enable it for every cheatcode test.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_",
