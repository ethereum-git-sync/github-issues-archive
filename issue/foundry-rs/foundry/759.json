In essence just adding support for compiling and testing .yul Files.\r\n\r\nUsing a Solidity File containing an interface whose ABI can be specified to be used for a Yul file\n\n### Additional context\n\nThe Solc compiler has a language option which can be changed to \"Yul\" to compile the yul files themselves, as far as ABI I've only done it with the Yul+ js package, but if you parse the match case statement in most Yul files and it may make more sense to target Yul+ support first (because sig\"\" statements can be used to identify Solidity compatible functions) or maybe require a Solidity interface that pairs with each Yul file, whose ABI will be cast on top of said Yul file (akin to YulContract.sol.yul)\r\n\r\nHappy to help and talk on Yul support, but my toolchain only works on truffle and want to help bring Yul to foundry, and felt cramming in Yul via FFI would be sloppy vs a direct Yul compilation, especially as if Yul is compile able by foundry, then I can easily add Yul+ support on top.",
