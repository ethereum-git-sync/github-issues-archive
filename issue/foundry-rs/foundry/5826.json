However, the tests running in parallel causes trouble for that specific process.\r\n\r\nI'd like to be able to identify which test is being run (either the test function name, test file name, or some arbitrary test runner ID) so that I can pass it into `vm.ffi` process as an extra argument to separate executions of that process.\r\n\r\nI could work around this by writing to some temporary file, but I'd like to do avoid fs writes and leaving around tmp files.\r\n\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
