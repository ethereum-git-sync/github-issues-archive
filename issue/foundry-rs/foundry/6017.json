  "body": "### Component\r\n\r\nAnvil\r\n\r\n### Describe the feature you would like\r\n\r\n**Description**\r\n\r\nI've been utilizing Anvil `0.2.0` (5be158b 2023-10-02T00:23:45.472182000Z) as a local Ethereum node for a Uniswap V3 backtester project. The backtester replays all transactions for a specific Uniswap V3 Pool. However, I've noticed a consistent and steady increase in memory usage over time as more transactions are replayed, even with the `--prune-history` flag enabled. Below is the exact command I'm using to start the anvil node:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nanvil --prune-history --timestamp 1619820000 --order fifo --code-size-limit 4294967296 -m \"test test test test test test test test test test test junk\" --gas-limit 100000000000 --gas-price 0 --base-fee 0\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Observations**\r\n\r\n1. The memory consumption increases steadily with the replaying of transactions.\r\n2. When replaying transactions for backtesting, I first set the block's timestamp using `evm_setNextBlockTimestamp` and then utilize `evm_mine` to mine the block.\r\n3. After around 10 minutes of running, the Docker stats indicate that Anvil has consumed around 9.247GiB of memory:\r\n\r\n```\r\nde526102010a   web3-backtester-anvil-1-1        98.78%    9.247GiB / 62.01GiB   14.91%    12.3MB / 15.6MB   4.77MB / 0B       11\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. I'm only deploying contracts at the very start and the rest(and vast majority) of the runtime is spent replaying transactions for the backtest.\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\nStable memory consumption or a slower, more controlled growth in memory usage over time when replaying transactions.\r\n\r\n**Possible Solutions**\r\n\r\nWhile I'm not certain about the root cause, I'd appreciate if the team could investigate:\r\n\r\n1. Whether transaction replays might be causing memory leaks or if there are specific internal data structures growing unbounded.\r\n2. If the `--prune-history` flag could be further optimized or if there's a possibility of introducing additional pruning or memory management features.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n**Environment Details**\r\n\r\n- Anvil Version: `0.2.0`\r\n- Host: EC2 instance (8 vCPU, 64 GB RAM)\r\n- Docker container",
