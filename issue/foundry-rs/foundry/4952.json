Here's how long my invariant tests take to run normally:\r\n\r\nhttps://app.warp.dev/block/FObNIsh7boJJYzRFqLwS1Y\r\n\r\nAnd here's what happens when I run `forge coverage` (the command does not finish running even after 10 minutes):\r\n\r\nhttps://app.warp.dev/block/iM1hbmlzW9hPCwbmnUgce2\r\n\r\nMy hunch is that `forge coverage` recompiles the contracts on every invariant run, and this is what causes the slow execution. However, I can't know for sure because there's no progress reported for invariants (ref https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/3277).\r\n\r\nI can put together a dedicated repo for reproducing the bug, but doing so should be pretty easy to do in any Foundry project with invariants.\r\n\r\n**Update**: my most recent CI run (which used the same settings as I did locally in the permalink above) just finished, and it took 37 minutes to run the coverage command over a set of invariant tests that take ~28 seconds to run directly.",
