This is common in formatters, e.g. from the prettier [docs](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html#print-width):\r\n\r\n> Prettier’s printWidth ... is not the hard upper allowed line length limit. It is a way to say to Prettier roughly how long you’d like lines to be. Prettier will make both shorter and longer lines, but generally strive to meet the specified printWidth.\r\n",
