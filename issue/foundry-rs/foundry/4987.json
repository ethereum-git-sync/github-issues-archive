However, I propose a change in this behavior for consistency and clearer distinction between the two. \r\n\r\nIn the same way as `cast abi-encode` excludes the selector in its output, while `cast calldata` includes it, I suggest `cast --abi-decode --input` should also not expect the selector in its input. This contrasts with `cast --calldata-decode` that would continue to expect the selector. I believe this change would provide a more intuitive and consistent user experience across these commands.
