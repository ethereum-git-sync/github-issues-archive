Especially if the fuzz takes make RPC calls, for example. \r\n\r\nRight now we always pass in `true` for the value of `include_fuzz_tests`, so this should be simple to expose with a flag / config item:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/309cfe7cc6d558484310ab01c33548d760cba925/cli/src/cmd/forge/test.rs#L324\r\nhttps://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/309cfe7cc6d558484310ab01c33548d760cba925/cli/src/cmd/forge/test.rs#L460\r\n\r\nWorkarounds:\r\n- Test naming conventions like `function test_*` and `function testFuzz_*` so you can use the match flags\r\n- Set the number of fuzz runs to 1 (or even 0, if that works, I haven't tested it)\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
