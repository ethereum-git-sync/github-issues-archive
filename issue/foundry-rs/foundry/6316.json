We try to use it as test blockchain for the testing of our application. \r\n\r\nEven several eth_call's of balanceOf can cause anvil to freeze and answer to this command for more than 1 minute.\r\n\r\nWhen sending several transactions and calls, for example:\r\n1) call to check allowance\r\n2) approve\r\n3) execute\r\n\r\nexecution or estimate_gas can also freeze for longer than 1 minute.\r\n\r\nThere is no errors in logs. It just works slow as you can see on timings\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/assets/48215060/b900d724-5fbe-4be2-8b66-9b07ddb9447b)\r\n\r\nThe server has 50% of memory free and CPU (2 core) is loaded slighty ",
