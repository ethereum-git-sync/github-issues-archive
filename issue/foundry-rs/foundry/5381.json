While it is possible to send a transaction by impersonating an account, it is not possible to impersonate a signature, as the underlying cryptography is preserved as normal on the fork node. \r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\n\r\nImplement an `anvil_recoverSignature` method, where a `signature` and `address` pair can be assigned. Thereafter any `ecreccover` matching the given `signature` will return the given `address`. \r\n\r\nThis feature can be used to effectively bypass on chain validations in fork mode where private keys are not available. \n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
