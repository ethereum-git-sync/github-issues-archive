  "body": "### Component\n\nAnvil\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nThe requirement is pretty straight-forward: would be nice to have support for Reth's built-in tracers (namely `callTracer` & `prestateTracer`) in Anvil. This would help us build an intuitive UI inside [Rivet](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/rivet) for tracing & state changes on transactions (and calls).\r\n\r\nIt was [noted in a previous issue](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/4110#issuecomment-1575919746) that there may be consolidation efforts to bring native tracers over from Reth and into Anvil, and an option (for the meantime) was also raised to just copy-paste the Reth native tracer implementation into Anvil for the time being. I am happy to give the copy-paste part a shot if the consolidation efforts are not to happen anytime soon, but if it is, I am happy to wait!\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
