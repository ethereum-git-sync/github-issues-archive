It's possible to verify contracts locally via sourcify, but not possible to use these verified contracts for forge script debugging (e.g. getting access to the hash->selector mapping in tracebacks).\r\n\r\nIdeally an arg could be added to `forge script` like `--verifier-selector-db-url`\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
