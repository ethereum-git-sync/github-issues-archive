Testing and building the project locally works. Also deploying the contract to mumbai works.\r\n\r\nThis project runs in an nx monorepo where /node_modules is at the root and <path to project root> is /apps/<project name>/ in which `forge init` was done. Using remappings the /node_modules folder is found. This works as verified by being able to build and test the project.\r\n\r\nDeploy command:\r\n```\r\nforge create --json --use solc:0.8.13 --root <path to project root> --rpc-url https://polygon-mumbai.g.alchemy.com/v2/<key> --private-key <key> --optimizer-runs 200 <path to project root>/src/<contractName>.sol:<contractName>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom this I get a response and I can see the deployed contract at the given address on mumbai.polygonscan.com.\r\n\r\nVerify command:\r\n```\r\nforge verify-contract --root <path to project root> --chain-id 80001 --num-of-optimizations 200 --compiler-version v0.8.13+commit.abaa5c0e  <contract address> src/<contractName>.sol:<contractName> <etherscan/polygonscan api key>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom which I get an `OK` response.\r\n\r\nThen doing a verify-check with:\r\n```\r\nforge verify-check --chain-id 80001 <GUID> <etherscan/polygonscan api key>\r\n```\r\n\r\nGiving as a response:\r\n```\r\nWaiting for verification result...\r\nContract verification failed:\r\nResponse: `NOTOK`\r\nDetails: `Fail - Unable to verify`\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've seen other issues with the same problem but the responses on those issues didn't help me.",

    "body": "Hey, I am also having the exact same problem as described by @enzeve above. Either the contract has already been verified (proxy address) or the status is OK and submitted but the contract never is verified or updated on the blockchain explorer side.. \r\n\r\nI actually find working with proxies and foundry extremely tough and very frustrating but maybe it is because I haven't found the right tutorial. Does anyone have a way to verify the implementation contract for a UUPS proxy?",
