During this time it does not respond to most requests and just hangs. The amount of RAM consumption does not increase, the process does not crash. After this delay, the anvil produces a bunch of blocks at a time and starts responding to some requests. After 2-3 such delays, the node starts responding steadily, and nothing crashes\r\n\r\nIn the attached logs the bug starts at 2023-10-13T09:31:54.519257387Z\r\n[anvil.log](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/files/12892358/anvil.log)\r\n",
