  "body": "### Component\n\nAnvil\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nIn my use case, I sometimes need to call `eth_getCode` in the context of older blocks. These blocks are usually up to 10 blocks away from the latest block. To avoid filling the up disk space and to save our SSDs, it would be nice to keep state data for a few latest blocks in memory. Currently, when using `--prune-history` I get error messages like\r\n```\r\n{'code': -32602, 'message': 'BlockOutOfRangeError: block height is 6 but requested was 2'}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`--transaction-block-keeper` does not seem to have any effect in this case.\r\n\r\nIdeally, the amount of block states to keep in memory should be configurable by the end user.\r\n\r\nI am running Anvil with:\r\n```\r\nanvil --prune-history --transaction-block-keeper 10 --base-fee 0 --steps-tracing --silent --port 39787\r\n```\r\n\r\n`anvil --version`: `anvil 0.1.0 (cd7850b 2023-02-02T00:07:54.508115898Z)`\r\n\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
