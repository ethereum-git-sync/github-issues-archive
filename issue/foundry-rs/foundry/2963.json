In that case the call reverts with `[FAIL. Reason: EvmError: RejectCallerWithCode]` due to EIP-3607, similar to https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/pull/2090\r\n\r\nIMO the ideal solution here is to bypass 3607 since the `msg.sender` can have code, and this is referring to the fact that `tx.origin` cannot have code which isn't too relevant for invariant tests.",
