    "body": "`cast --abi-decode` does not decode calldata by default. To decode calldata, you need to include the `--input` flag. Also, the signature provided should be a full function signature, which I think is the specific problem that causes the \"Message:  could not convert (uint112,uint112,uint32) to function\" message. I also don't believe that calldata blob is valid. It would need to include 3*32 = 96 bytes but only seems to include 28.",
