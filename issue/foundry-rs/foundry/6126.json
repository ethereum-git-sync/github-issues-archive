  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nSeveral Layer 2s, including Optimism, allocate many proxies etc. in the genesis file. For example, take [Base Mainnet's 8.76MB genesis file](https://github.com/base-org/node/blob/main/goerli/genesis-l2.json).\r\n\r\nWhile it is possible to deploy all of these contracts manually in a test file's setUp function, it is slow, cumbersome, and rather easy to accidentally break parity. A solution to make this process easier for authors of test suites that would like to locally allocate the same accounts that are in the L2 genesis file is to add a simple cheatcode which loads a JSON file with account allocations inside of it into the in-memory revm journal.\r\n\r\nThis cheatcode can re-use the type defined in `ethers-rs` for the `GenesisAccount` when deserializing the allocs JSON, and the basic structure of the file would be `HashMap<Address, GenesisAccount>`.\r\n\r\n**Desired Usage**\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract MyTest is Test {\r\n    function setUp() public {\r\n        vm.loadAllocs(\"./path/to/allocs.json\");\r\n\r\n        // After the cheatcode is invoked, the accounts will have been committed to the revm journal and accessible\r\n        // within the environment.\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\n\n### Additional context\n\nn/a",
