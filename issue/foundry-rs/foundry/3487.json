This script executes successfully on Goerli and Arbitrum Rinkeby, but it fails on Arbitrum Goerli with `(code: -32000, message: intrinsic gas too low, data: None)`\r\n\r\nI have tried Alchemy RPC + public RPC (https://goerli-rollup.arbitrum.io/rpc/)\r\n\r\nVery weird that Arbitrum Rinkeby works, but Arbitrum Goerli does not. They both run Arbitrum Nitro ... perhaps Goerli is running a newer version since Rinkeby is deprecated...?\r\n\r\nAlso, I tried increasing the gas price and gas limit by many multiples, but that didn't change anything. And I have more than enough ArbGoerli ETH in my EOA.\r\n\r\nThe transaction requests are identical between rinkeby and goerli, aside from the nonce, but I also tried using a fresh account with nonce = 0 on goerli and that also didn't change anything:\r\n```\r\n      \"transaction\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"0x00\",\r\n        \"from\": \"0x...\",\r\n        \"gas\": \"0x1c60d2\",\r\n        \"value\": \"0x0\",\r\n        \"data\": \"0x...\",\r\n        \"nonce\": \"0x0\"\r\n      },\r\n```\r\n\r\nFull output:\r\n```\r\n==========================\r\n\r\nEstimated total gas used for script: 1859794\r\n\r\nEstimated amount required: 0.0001859794 ETH\r\n\r\n==========================\r\n\r\n###\r\nFinding wallets for all the necessary addresses...\r\n##\r\nSending transactions [0 - 0].\r\n\r\nTransactions saved to: broadcast/DeployFactory.s.sol/421613/run-latest.json\r\n\r\nError:\r\n(code: -32000, message: intrinsic gas too low, data: None)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nScript:\r\n```\r\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED\r\npragma solidity ^0.8.17;\r\n\r\nimport \"forge-std/Script.sol\";\r\nimport \"../src/Factory.sol\";\r\n\r\ncontract DeployFactory is Script {\r\n    function run() external {\r\n        uint256 deployerPrivateKey = vm.envUint(\"PRIVATE_KEY\");\r\n\r\n        vm.startBroadcast(deployerPrivateKey);\r\n        new Factory();\r\n        vm.stopBroadcast();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```",

Does forge estimate gas with the local EVM (rEVM?)? Does it call out to the provider?\r\n\r\nthis fixed the same issue i was having with arbitrum mainnet",
