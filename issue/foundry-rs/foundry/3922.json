  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nIt would be sweet if there was an option for `forge verify-contract` to take a broadcast file as input and automatically try to verify any contracts created from it. It could automatically parse constructor args and creation addresses etc. \r\n\r\nThis is useful in case we forget to pass the `--verify` flag to `forge script`, or verification fails the first time for some reason. Major time save to avoid looking up the constructor args and creation addresses after-the-fact especially for complex scripts. \r\n\r\nSuggested API:\r\n```\r\nforge verify-contract --from-broadcast /path/to/broadcast.json\r\n```\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
