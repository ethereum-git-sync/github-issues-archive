From what I can tell, 31337 would simplify things for a larger subset of foundry users than 99 or 1337.\r\n- I don't know of many projects that use forge which also use ganache or `geth --dev`, i.e. I'm not sure what compatibility benefits we get from chain ID 1337.\r\n- Using 99 is only useful for backwards compatibility with dapptools, but dapptools is no longer under active development so I don't think this should be weighed to heavily.\r\n",
