In order to replicate the normal installation behaviour, you can run the following GH CI action on any test repo:\r\n\r\n```yml\r\nname: ðŸ›  Test Native Windows Foundry Build\r\n\r\non: [workflow_dispatch]\r\n\r\njobs:\r\n  build:\r\n    name: Foundry\r\n    runs-on: windows-latest\r\n\r\n    steps:\r\n      - name: Checkout\r\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\r\n\r\n      - name: Set up Rust\r\n        uses: actions-rs/toolchain@v1\r\n        with:\r\n          toolchain: stable\r\n\r\n      - name: Build Foundry from source\r\n        run: cargo install --git https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry --profile local --force foundry-cli anvil chisel\r\n```\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/assets/25297591/501b56c5-7ba9-4d9a-9f53-a066d3b357a9)\r\n\r\nFor `foundry-cli`, `anvil`, and `chisel` together you usually have +90mins build time, which is honestly not acceptable. WSL works of course as an alternative, but I would like to still discuss potential remediations here.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nMy current local installation time:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/assets/25297591/de787972-1c15-40b8-86d1-258ecdc6fa2e)\r\n",
