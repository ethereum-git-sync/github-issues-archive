  "body": "We should keep 3 days worth of nightlies. Each nightly will have a new tag (like `nightly-${commitish}`) in addition to the `nightly` tag.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately we can't download off of the `nightly` tag unless it is the main tag used for the release, but we can't have it be the main tag either, since that would just override the previous nightly release.\r\n\r\nSo we need to:\r\n\r\n1. Find the commit that the  `nightly` tag is pointing to\r\n2. Lookup the release using `nightly-` concatenated with the short SHA of that commit\r\n\r\nAfter the nightly release, we should then delete all pre-releases except the three newest ones.\r\n\r\nThis would affect both `forgeup` and `foundry-toolchain`",
