  "body": "### Component\n\nOther (please describe)\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nThe current `rust-toolchain` files pins `rustc` to a stable version (1.62).\r\n\r\nReason for this is probably that we want to use features that have been introduced with that very version. For this, using a so called minimal supported Rust version (MSRV) is more appropriate. This is also nicely supported by the [rust-version field](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-rust-version-field) of the `cargo` manifest [package] section.\r\n\r\nA `rust-toolchian` file messes around with the local environment  by installing the pinned version. Currently this means that I have `1.62` installed twice :disappointed: and sure enough some tools get tripped  by that more or less.\r\n\r\nIMO, a `rust-toolchain` file only makes sense if a very specific *nightly* version of `rustc` is needed. For version limiting stable `rustc`, using a MSRV is more appropriate and less intrusive.\n\n### Additional context\n\nRepository quality-of-life issue",
