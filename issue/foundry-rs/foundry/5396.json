I am one of the core contributors of [`cartesi/rollups`](https://github.com/cartesi/rollups). Our [test workflow](https://github.com/cartesi/rollups/actions/runs/5554303929) started failing since earlier today (10 a.m. BRT), because `forge test` is crashing. I managed to replicate the error locally, and this is the error message. The back trace is not very helpful, so I omitted it.\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe application panicked (crashed).\r\nMessage:  No target contract named ../node_modules/@cartesi/util/contracts/CartesiMathV2.sol:CartesiMathV2\r\nLocation: utils/src/lib.rs:269\r\n```\r\n\r\nI easily managed to pinpoint the line that raised the error: [here](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/master/utils/src/lib.rs#L269).\r\nAlso, it seems that this section of code was last updated by this PR: [here](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/pull/5364).\r\n\r\nYou can replicate the error yourself by following these steps:\r\n\r\n1. Start the latest Ubuntu machine\r\n2. Install `jq`, `yarn` and `docker`\r\n3. Clone `https://github.com/cartesi/rollups.git`\r\n4. Initialize the submodules (`git submodule update --init --recursive`)\r\n5. Go to `onchain/rollups`\r\n6. Run `yarn` (installs contract dependencies)\r\n7. Run `./test/foundry/dapp/helper/update-proofs.sh --setup`\r\n8. Run `forge test`",

    "body": "Hey, @Evalir and @mattsse, I am a core contributor at [kwenta](https://github.com/Kwenta/token) - a defi protocol.\r\n\r\nThis issue has been closed, but I am still facing the same issue when running `forge test`:\r\n```\r\nThe application panicked (crashed).\r\nMessage:  No artifact for contract contracts/libraries/SafeDecimalMath.sol:SafeDecimalMath\r\nLocation: /Users/runner/work/foundry/foundry/utils/src/lib.rs:288\r\n```\r\n\r\nSame thing - the tests used to run, until our CI broke a few weeks ago. Then today I started getting the same error locally as in the CI. It's not based on any of our code changes, I have tried checking out old versions of code before the issue cropped up and I still get the error, so this is definitely a foundry issue.\r\n\r\nI have run `foundryup`.\r\n\r\nYou can replicate the issue by cloning the [kwenta token repo](https://github.com/Kwenta/token) locally and running `npm run f-test`.\r\n\r\nThe `SafeDecimalMath.sol` artifacts folder is being created in`/out` with `SafeDecimalMath.0.8.19.json` and `SafeDecimalMath.0.8.20.json` inside.\r\n\r\nIf I rollback to an older version of foundry using this commit: `ed8b709c8fed1aaec4e7de4e3c95553ef09de034` then it works again.\r\n\r\nHowever rolling back to this commit: `b5a089670140d3e72fbe7cd3348fc9185bcad9a3` - it still fails. So the responsible change is somewhere between those commits.\r\n\r\nAny ideas what the problem is?",
