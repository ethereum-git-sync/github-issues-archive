However, I was able to narrow down to the EXACT lines.  This is the line causing the issue.\r\nhttps://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/64cbdd183e0aae99eb1be507196b6b5d640b3801/cli/src/cmd/forge/verify/etherscan.rs#L191\r\n\r\nSpecifically, there's a problem with how you try to get the verifier_url when exec'ing via a node process.\r\n\r\nIf I change the line to read:\r\n```\r\n-        let url = verifier_url.or_else(|| etherscan_config.as_ref().map(|c| c.api_url.as_str()));\r\n+        //let url = verifier_url.or_else(|| etherscan_config.as_ref().map(|c| c.api_url.as_str()));\r\n+        let url = verifier_url;\r\n```\r\nAll is well.  I haven't dug further as to what's happening here, but it appears that an invalid etherscan url is being used in the or_else line.\r\n",
