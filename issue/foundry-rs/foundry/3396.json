  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nThere's two levels of sorting here:\r\n\r\nFirst, the filepath level. Personally I like to sort imports as forge-std > dependencies > test > script > src, then alphabetically by path within each of those categories. This is similar to the sort order suggested in python's [style guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#imports). I'm not sure of conventions in rust or elsewhere, but don't feel too strongly on the exact order here. Maybe we default to sorting imports like rustfmt and let users toggle that off?\r\n\r\nThen with named imports. For example, `import {foo, bar} from \"src/Contract.sol\"` should become `import {bar, foo} from \"src/Contract.sol\"`.\r\n\r\nProbably can have a single `sort-imports` config item that covers both sort options.\r\n\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
