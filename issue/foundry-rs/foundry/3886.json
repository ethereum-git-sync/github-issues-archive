  "body": "### Component\n\nAnvil\n\n### Have you ensured that all of these are up to date?\n\n- [X] Foundry\n- [X] Foundryup\n\n### What version of Foundry are you on?\n\n_No response_\n\n### What command(s) is the bug in?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Operating System\n\nmacOS (Apple Silicon)\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nWhen using `anvil_impersonateAccount` on a contract address, I would expect that calls (from user or between contracts) to this contract would work as usual. But turns out that when impersonating a contract address, its code is unreachable. \r\nExample (using fork from Ethereum mainnet :\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst ethers = require(\"ethers\");\r\nconst PAUSE_ABI = [\r\n  {\r\n    constant: true,\r\n    inputs: [],\r\n    name: \"delay\",\r\n    outputs: [{ internalType: \"uint256\", name: \"\", type: \"uint256\" }],\r\n    payable: false,\r\n    stateMutability: \"view\",\r\n    type: \"function\",\r\n  }\r\n];\r\n\r\nasync function main() {\r\n  const pauseAddress = \"0xbE286431454714F511008713973d3B053A2d38f3\";\r\n  const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(\"http://127.0.0.1:8545\");\r\n  const pauseContract = new ethers.Contract(pauseAddress, PAUSE_ABI, provider);\r\n\r\n  await provider.send(\"anvil_impersonateAccount\", [pauseAddress]);\r\n\r\n  console.log(`delay: ${await pauseContract.delay()}`);\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\nmain().catch((e) => console.log(e));\r\n```\r\nReturns :\r\n```\r\nError: call revert exception [ See: https://links.ethers.org/v5-errors-CALL_EXCEPTION ] (method=\"delay()\", data=\"0x\", errorArgs=null, errorName=null, errorSignature=null, reason=null, code=CALL_EXCEPTION, version=abi/5.7.0)\r\n  reason: null,\r\n  code: 'CALL_EXCEPTION',\r\n  method: 'delay()',\r\n  data: '0x',\r\n  errorArgs: null,\r\n  errorName: null,\r\n  errorSignature: null,\r\n  address: '0xbE286431454714F511008713973d3B053A2d38f3',\r\n  args: [],\r\n  transaction: {\r\n    data: '0x6a42b8f8',\r\n    to: '0xbE286431454714F511008713973d3B053A2d38f3'\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nVerified on HardHat and the code snippet works on Hardhat. \r\n\r\nI found https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/1943, but not sure why we have to overwrite the contract code (seems like hardhat doesn't do this)\r\nHaving the option to impersonate a specific contract is necessary for bypassing authorization (e.g admin contract) but there are some circumstances that we still want the contract to be usable.
