For now transaction only reverts without any message. It is hard to find such a bug without informative message.\r\nThe same issue for a transactions where user is trying to attach more ETH that he have on his balance.\n\n### Additional context\n\n<img width=\"1792\" alt=\"Screenshot 2022-07-26 at 16 37 09\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26391964/181020537-c94646d7-1c38-4319-b29d-98da36016261.png\">\r\n\r\nIn this case Carol have 0 ETH on her balance.",
