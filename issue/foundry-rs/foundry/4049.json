The natural solution is to use `deployCode`, however, this contract also requires certain libraries. The following leads to an error:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\naddress factory = deployCode(\r\n  “Factory.sol”,\r\n  abi.encode(arg1)\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Error**:\r\n```\r\n[FAIL. Reason: Setup failed: No bytecode for contract. Is it abstract or unlinked?]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's a known limitation that `deployCode` doesn't support library linking which prevents the Factory contract from being deployed.\r\n\r\nWhat is the best alternative for deploying a contract that needs a unique version number and depends on libraries?\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
