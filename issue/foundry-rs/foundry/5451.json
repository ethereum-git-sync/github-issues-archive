This started happening after I flattened the main contract.\r\n\r\nI used `forge flatten --output src/Example.flattened.sol src/Example.sol`.\r\n\r\nThe flattened contract was included in the coverage report, but I have since deleted that and the original contract is still not appearing. The main contract has plenty of functions in it with tests that are passing, but is not showing in the coverage report.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere are my files:\r\n<img width=\"323\" alt=\"files\" src=\"https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/assets/120574160/60df281f-ed5b-48be-b046-da16fa85fd79\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere are tests passing for Example.sol:\r\n<img width=\"747\" alt=\"passing-tests\" src=\"https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/assets/120574160/8545bd78-1625-440a-b653-e81d65b25a19\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is the coverage with no Example.sol:\r\n<img width=\"901\" alt=\"no-example-contract\" src=\"https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/assets/120574160/680867ed-95a9-4a4a-adc1-a74e53b01a0c\">\r\n",
