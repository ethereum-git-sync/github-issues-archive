Attempting to mint tokens to this address simply results in an \"ERC1155/721: transfer to non ERC1155/721Receiver implementer\" error. If possible, I would like to request that this default address has these functions implemented to allow for easier testing. Thanks!\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
