  "body": "### Component\n\nAnvil\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\n### Feature Request\r\n\r\nHello, I would like to have `anvil` crate published to crates.io as a crate (not just the binary) and that we can be able to use it from normal rust projects.\r\n\r\n### Context and use cases\r\n\r\nIt would be super useful to have a fully running local EVM node from our Rust projects and be able to interact with them using ethers-rs for example, and here is specifically what are our use case:\r\n\r\nAs a developer, I would like to be able to spawn a local EVM node, deploy some contracts on it (using ethers-rs), run a few tests on it, then at the end tear down everything. \r\n\r\nTalking more specific, we are building General Purpose Oracles, in Rust using ethers-rs, and we built a general `EventWatcher` module that watches for contract events and then calls `handle_event` to a set of preconfigured event handlers. We want to test this and make sure it works under different scenarios.\r\n\r\n**What we did consider before?** we did fallback to use and write all of our tests in Typescript with ganache and ethers.js and run our oracle as a child process with JSON logging, man, it is a crazy process to just test a few things. What we hope for is that, with everything being in Rust using `anvil` it will be super simple as we can use Rust's built-in test framework to do all these things in much simpler way so that we test each part in more isolated way.  \n\n### Additional context\n\nHere is a link to our Oracle code of the [`EventWatcher`](https://github.com/webb-tools/relayer/blob/cb25b3ed5428795158a8e76173bd877f0122d3d8/src/events_watcher/mod.rs#L95-L259) that I was talking about above.",
