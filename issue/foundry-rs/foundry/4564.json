Next time it hits, it will serve that result from the cache and not hit the RPC endpoint again, as the state can not change, so the outcome should be the same. it seems right now anvil will hit the node every single time.\r\n\r\nJust trying to avoid hitting the RPC endpoint so much on things which repeat; the question is, do you see this as the consumer's job to build caching around it for their cases like this, or do you see anvil job to be more clever with its caching?\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_",

    "body": "We simulate transactions using eth_call, and we have to repeat these again and again across different services but sharing the Anvil running node. We use a fork of Anvil to try to use as much cache as possible, but on reflection, it still hit the alchemy nodes more than we wanted, so now I am like, is there even a need to use the Anvil fork to do this aka not much benefit. I'm happy to add caching on our side, but a cache key like that is pretty cool to have to not constantly hit the provider on those cases.",
