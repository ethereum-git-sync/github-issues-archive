See the example below.\r\n\r\nThe contracts are\r\n\r\n```\r\ncontract A {\r\n    address public bAddress;\r\n\r\n    constructor() {\r\n        bAddress = address(new B()); \r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract B {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nScript to deploy\r\n```\r\n// ... imports ...\r\n\r\ncontract DeployContractsAB {\r\n    function run() {\r\n        vm.broadcast();\r\n        A a = new A();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently, only contract `A` would get verified. The feature request is to also verify contract `B` in this scenario.\r\n\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
