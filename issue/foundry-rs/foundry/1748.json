Reason: Revert] mint() (gas: 55015)\r\nTraces:\r\n[0] ContractTest::testMint()\r\n  ├─ [55015] contract::mint{value: 50000000000000000}(1)\r\n   │   └─ ← ()\r\n└─ ← ()\r\n```\r\n\r\nI forgot to `vm.deal()` which reverted the mint due to not having enough ether. Im aware of `hoax()` in forge-std (and I shouldve dealed anyway) but the \"issue\" is that the revert string is quite unhelpful. My initial assumption was that something was wrong with my function or test, not that I forgot to `vm.deal()`. \r\n\r\n@gakonst asked what the ideal error string would be - something like \"Not enough ether\" or the likes. ERC20s error out with `arithmetic underflow/overflow` which could work in this instance as well.\r\n\r\nThanks :)",
