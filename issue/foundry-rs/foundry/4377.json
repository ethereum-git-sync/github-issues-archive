Normally, we would get the `JoinHandle` from spawning a `tokio` task and call `handle.abort()` on it. However, `anvil::spawn` returns a custom `NodeHandle` which doesn't seem to ever expose the underlying `JoinHandle`.\r\n\r\nIs there some other way to shutdown the task? If not, it would be helpful to have access to the `JoinHandle` of the task.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
