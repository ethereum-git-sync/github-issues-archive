    "body": "sounds good @gakonst, Ill start working on it.\r\n\r\nAs per my understanding the main goal here is to add a parameter like `create2_deployer` which lets a user use a custom create2 factory instead of the default 0x4e59b44847b379578588920ca78fbf26c0b4956c. This is useful for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n- Enables usage of alternative improved create2 custom contracts as described above in the thread.\r\n- There is no way to deploy the create2 0x4e59b44847b379578588920ca78fbf26c0b4956c on chains not supporting pre EIP-155 transactions. (The transaction mentioned here can not be replayed https://github.com/Arachnid/deterministic-deployment-proxy#latest-outputs). Eg. CANTO (http://chainlist.org/chain/7700)\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes this make sense? @mds1 @joshieDo \r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "> The way we verify contracts or create the transaction depends on the factory we use. So just letting anyone use their own factory implementation is not that straightforward imo. So... if we can agree to a certain interface, it should be fine.\r\n\r\nI think the core issue is not just about a custom factory, but agreeing on a specific interface for a new factory.\r\n\r\nSure, having a parameter for a custom factory is nice, but for the reasons given above, it has to share the same interface as the default factory.",

    "body": "> So should we change this schema to accommodate something like `permit2 = new Permit2{salt: SALT, deployerCreate2: CREATE2_ADDRESS}();`\r\n\r\nThis is not valid solidity and there is currently no plans to preprocess solidity to support custom syntax, so this option isn't currently doable.\r\n\r\n> OR instead add a forge-std helper method such as `deployCreate2(string contractName, bytes32 salt, bytes memory constructorData, bytes memory initData, address deployer)`\r\n\r\nThis solution is ok, would pair nicely with the create2 helpers recently added in https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-std/pull/276. There may be alternative function sigs we'd want, would need to think about it. But the custom create2 deployer would need to have the same signature as the default create2 deployer so it's not clear how much value this adds since you can do this on your own anyway.\r\n\r\nAnother option is to add a new config option to the `foundry.toml` with some name options defined in https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/2638#issuecomment-1206855029, but again the custom create2 deployer would need to have the same signature as the default create2 deployer\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\nThere's been a lot of discussion in this issue so I think it's worth backing up a sec to discuss _why_ we want this feature, which we discussed briefly starting [here](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/2638#issuecomment-1206880912), and using that answer to determine which solution to go with.\r\n\r\nIMO the best (but not necessarily simplest) solution is to write a new, more flexible create2 factory that has the features we need and deploy it across all chains. You can then add cheatcodes to instruct forge what specifically to do with the create2 deployer, for example a `vm.BatchInitializeCall` cheat might take the next create2 deploy and subsequent tx and batch them into the same transaction to the deployer. Or a `vm.safeCreate2` cheat might instruct forge to instead use the `safeCreate2` method, etc. AFAIK none of other solutions allow native support for this, and the ability to batch contract deployment + initialization is definitely important\r\n\r\n",
