  "body": "### Component\r\n\r\nForge\r\n\r\n### Describe the feature you would like\r\n\r\nCurrently only `nightly` is available as a build. There are specific nightly builds such as https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/releases/tag/nightly-a1f41be934a850251b03c40cbc25e9953ffe0d10 , but that will get removed in a few days. This presents a constant source of frustration for our team that run forge in CI. We get weekly and sometimes daily breakages in our CI process because we can't pin the version of forge, and a bug or incompatibility was introduced overnight.\r\n\r\nReasoning:\r\n\r\n- We want to have the control of when we upgrade our version of forge.\r\n- Hyrum's Law: https://www.hyrumslaw.com/ . Even though some new features are definite improvements to forge that we are grateful to get, they may be incompatible with how we have been using forge. We just want the choice of when to upgrade to fix those incompatibilities.\r\n- Some examples that have tripped us up:\r\n  - https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/commit/8a5ae36c35a12d5fa9f6f46f0eec016b28ef336a introduced `is_fixed_gas_limit` into the anvil state, which we dump/load in unittests, so older snapshots are not the same as newer ones.\r\n  - https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/commit/5c2db0babf02e1f1016b1471de3b21593cb06b56#r98769848 had a typo in logging output which caused some of our scripts to break.\r\n  - There were many others\r\n\r\nPossible solution:\r\n\r\n- Just some build, any build, that infrequently gets snapshotted and _stays available_ for at least several weeks or months. It doesn't have to have a version number, or changelog. Just something stable (in the sense that it won't get removed, and won't change from under us).\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_",
