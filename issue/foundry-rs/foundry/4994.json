  "body": "### Component\r\n\r\nForge\r\n\r\n### Describe the feature you would like\r\n\r\nBecause most smart contract systems expect time to pass, it is a common need to simulate the passage of time (with `vm.warp`) when running invariant test campaigns with Foundry.\r\n\r\nBut this is difficult to do today because [state is not preserved during invariants runs](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/3005). Just look at [Maple Finance's solution](https://github.com/maple-labs/maple-core-v2/blob/00f01ae7175885f8d49ac201a1c72465e320b2f6/tests/invariants/BaseInvariants.t.sol#L34-L37) - they have to apply the `useCurrentTimestamp` modifier to all invariant tests, as well as all functions in the handler contracts.\r\n\r\nNow, regardless of the state-preserving limitation and if and when it will be lifted, I posit that it would be helpful to offer native support for time warps in invariants.\r\n\r\nHere's what I have in mind :\r\n\r\n```toml\r\n[profile.default.invariant]\r\n  time_jump_min = 50\r\n  time_jump_max = 1000\r\n```\r\n\r\nNevermind the names - we can think about what would fit best later. What matters is the idea - to introduce two new config options which would be used for bounding a time jump that gets applied after every invariant test run, i.e. have Foundry do something like this:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nmodifier jump() {\r\n    uint256 timeWarp = block.timestamp;\r\n    timeWarp = _bound(timeWarp, 50 seconds, 1000 seconds);\r\n    timestampStore.increaseCurrentTimestamp(timeWarp);\r\n    vm.warp(timestampStore.currentTimestamp());\r\n    _;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis way, an invariant test campaign would more accurately simulate the real world, where time passes between function calls.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nRelated discussions:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-std/issues/376\r\n- https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/3005#issuecomment-1556141136\r\n- https://t.me/foundry_support/34043\r\n- https://t.me/foundry_support/35144",

    "body": "I like the idea here. I'd suggest also adding a `time_jump_frequency` config value which is `[0,100]` which specifies the probability that you add a time jump before (and/or after?) the next function call to have a little more control. Since testing txs in the same block is also useful, and it'd be nice to have both scenarios with a single config.\r\n\r\nLike @simplyoptimistic I think we should couple this with block number increases to keep those in sync to make sure things are realistic and minimize footguns.\r\n\r\nPartly related to https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/749#issuecomment-1445181592 where we discuss the idea of codegen'ing handler contracts that have properties like this defined",
