It would be helpful to display aggregated test results.\n\n### Additional context\n\nConsider there are 4 test suites with 10 tests in each suite. The last line of the output after displaying the test results could be something like:\r\n\r\n`Test suites: 4. Total passed: 33. Total failed: 7`\r\n\r\nOr it can be more detailed like:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n- VaultTest ~ 10 tests\r\n   - Passed: 6\r\n   - Failed: 4\r\n\r\n- VaultFactoryTest ~ 4 tests \r\n    - Passed: 4\r\n    - Failed: 0\r\n...\r\nTest suites: 2.
