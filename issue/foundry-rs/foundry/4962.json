    "body": "Hi @bzpassersby , thanks for reporting this! I've managed to reproduce the error. \r\n\r\nThe root cause of the issue is that the ChainStack RPC service doesn't provide [archive nodes](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/archive-nodes/) for their free tier, but forking from older blocks is only supported with archive nodes. If you need to fork from a specific block, you could try try to upgrade your ChainStack plan or use a different provider such as Alchemy, Ankr or Infura that provide archive nodes for free for development.\r\n\r\nI'm working on a PR to improve error reporting when a user tries to fork from an older block with a non-archive node.",
