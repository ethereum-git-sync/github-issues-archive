For example, I want to deploy contract Foo at address(0x01), so that i can write IFoo interface in the test file. And I can write IFoo targetContract = IFoo(addres(0x01)); So the test contract might not need compiled again.",

But the key is that the code of the contract is frequently changed, and i don't want the test file frequently compiled since as per the documentation, the test file has the dependencies of those codes.",
