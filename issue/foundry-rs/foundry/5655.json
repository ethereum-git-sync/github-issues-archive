Because of the way negative assertions have been implemented, it is not possible to combine them with other assertions around whether a function has been called or not, as you will receive this error:\r\n\r\n`[FAIL. Reason: Counted expected calls can only bet set once.]` < also notice the typo\r\n\r\nWhereas it would be possible to check in a test that different functions are being called by doing something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvm.expectCall(where, data);\r\nf.X();\r\n\r\nvm.expectCall(where, data);\r\nf.Y();\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere, `where` and `data` can be the same in both cases, and `X()` and `Y()` can be the same in both cases. It fails even if you do the following:\r\n\r\n`vm.expectCall(where, data)`\r\n`vm.expectCall(where, data, count=0)` \r\n\r\nwith the same error as above. ",
