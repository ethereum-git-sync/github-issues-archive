  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nRecently, we've merged https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/pull/201 with basic formatter functionality which includes:\r\n- Parsing source code (respecting project structure) with [solang](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/solang/)\r\n- Traversing the Parse Tree and reconstructing the code on-the-go\r\n- Reconstructing some basic nodes such as pragma directives, import directives and enum definitions\r\n\r\nThe caveat is that we've disabled `forge fmt` CLI command for now because it doesn't preserve every piece of original code: comments are missing. Solang recently added support for parsing regular comments: https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/solang/pull/656. All we need to do now is to support it in our formatter.\r\n\r\nThe hard part about it is that regular comments, in contrast to NatSpec ones, can appear everywhere, so we need to keep that in mind.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

    "body": "comments are not part of the AST right? this makes it significantly harder to traverse the tree and simply to node -> text.\r\n\r\nSo I guess we need to find a way to inject them somehow. \r\nthis is a bit tricky because we need to check at every node if there's a comment.\r\n\r\n~~one idea I have is, to write an additional CommentVisitor that wraps the actual visitor and before delegating to the wrapped visitor, checks if there's comment before the node.~~\r\n\r\nperhaps we can solve this with a macro that we add in every visit function, that checks if the next comment's location is before the location of current node, if so visit_comment?\r\n\r\n",
