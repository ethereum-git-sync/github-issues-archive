Since it is a monorepo, we use github refs with commit hashes in the `package.json` to manage the solidity dependencies. We install all of the dependencies first and then when running build, it says that it detects missing dependencies and then fails. I believe that the failure may be due to `git` not being installed on the machine in CI, but the dependencies were installed via `yarn` so I feel like it shouldn't try to install them.\r\n\r\nIs there any way that we could make this a configurable feature?",
