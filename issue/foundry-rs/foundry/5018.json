Furthermore it would be helpful to configue the run for some functions to only be called towards the end of the run or be called with more probability toward the end of a run. For example when running invariants against a protocol that has loan cycles where certain functions in the system are only to be called after certain other actions have taken place, it would be helpful to control the order of call sequence to a certain degree. Otherwise the amount of reverts are extremely high . Does anything like this exist or has there been a discussion around it? I could not find anything in the docs\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_",
