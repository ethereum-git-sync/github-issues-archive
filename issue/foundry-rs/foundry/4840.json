The function is supposed to respond an address but when invoked using foundry script i am receiving 0x0 address. Can we investigate and fix this issue to ensure that the foundry script is able to pass along the response from the function call for contract deployed on Polygon-edge ?\r\n\r\nLet me know if you need any further information or assistance in resolving this issue. I will be sharing a repo with all files required to reproduce this bug shortly.\r\n\r\nThe bug is reproducible through https://github.com/SantaHub/Polygon-Edge-Testing/tree/main\r\n",
