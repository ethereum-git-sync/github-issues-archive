  "body": "Running the same `dapp build` will create different json files that are structurally the same, but are serialized in a different order. The order is reversed at random intervals.\r\n\r\nFor example, one invocation may create a `json` file that defines ContractA and then ContractB, while the next invocation may create a `json` file that defines ContractB and then ContractA. \r\n\r\nWhile the json are interchangeable, they are not identical and they can't be compared as strings. \r\n\r\nThis was discovered when setting up tests for brew, which tested the output of `dapp build`.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2021-09-22 at 3 01 15 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13405632/134340919-00c32f1b-3b1d-4458-bcd5-884534ff0bc0.png)\r\n.
