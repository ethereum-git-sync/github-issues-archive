This is actually ok and works out in our favor, because we only use global rejects with `vm.assume`. Relevant docs on proptest's local vs global rejects are [here](https://altsysrq.github.io/proptest-book/proptest/tutorial/filtering.html).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when hitting the reject limit, tests fail with `Too many global rejects` bubbled up from proptest. I have been unable to trigger the [`ASSUME: Too many rejects`](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/blob/33f1df0ec7e17799342ee78e5e1ffb07e9ea086d/evm/src/fuzz/mod.rs#L89) failure reason, so not sure if that codepath is still used.\r\n\r\nPotential paths forward:\r\n1. Remove local rejects from the config file/docs and rename the global rejects param to just `max_fuzz_rejects`, or\r\n2. Keep both parameters, and just update the docs to mention that local rejects are currently unused but may be in the future.\r\n\r\nOnly option 1 actually results in source code changes, whereas 2 is just a documentation change.",
