I believe this change has to do with https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/pull/4920 — from what I can see here, it's not super clear but it looks like you might have an ordering issue from what I see in the traces?\r\n\r\nIt's worth mentioning that the behavior now is that events are expected to be emitted _in the next call_. So if you're matching multiple events across multiple calls, you need to \"declare\" the events to be matched before the call were they're going to be emitted.\r\n\r\nIf you think this is actually a bug, could you maybe provide a more minimal repro? I'm 100% happy to look into this, just can' determine it from looking at these traces.",

    "body": "This might be a genuine bug - I'm in the same boat as @lyoungblood.\r\n\r\nI'm as confident a person can be that there's no additional non-static call (`methodList` is static) between `expectEmit` and the call whereby the event is expected to be emitted. This can also be seen in the console logs:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nemit InstallPlugin(owner: Alice: [0xBf0b5A4099F0bf6c8bC4252eBeC548Bae95602Ea], proxy: PRBProxy: [0xd462e9352b6793b5CB1aFeB8632880462C6bec3f], plugin: PluginDummy: [0x5615dEB798BB3E4dFa0139dFa1b3D433Cc23b72f])\r\n    ├─ [52180] Registry::installPlugin(PluginDummy: [0x5615dEB798BB3E4dFa0139dFa1b3D433Cc23b72f])\r\n    │   ├─ [871] PluginDummy::methodList()\r\n    │   │   └─ ← [0xc2985578, 0xfebb0f7e]\r\n    │   ├─ emit InstallPlugin(owner: Alice: [0xBf0b5A4099F0bf6c8bC4252eBeC548Bae95602Ea], proxy: PRBProxy: [0xd462e9352b6793b5CB1aFeB8632880462C6bec3f], plugin: PluginDummy: [0x5615dEB798BB3E4dFa0139dFa1b3D433Cc23b72f])\r\n    │   └─ ← ()\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, all event arguments match. You can see the full logs [here](https://app.warp.dev/block/JW9EAMBTZrM9Y1v5lQufzX).\r\n\r\nI think I know what's going on. The bug started to occur only after adding two more `indexed` parameters in the event; with only one `indexed` parameter, the test was passing (even now, with the latest Foundry version). And, with two params, the bug still occurs.\r\n\r\n@lyoungblood seems also to have had multiple `indexed` params.",
