Initialize sample project with `forge init`\r\n2. Manually remove the `lib/forge-std` file with `rm lib/forge-std`\r\n3. Remove the library from the git staging area by running `git add lib/forge-std` (this will break `forge update` in addition to `install` and `remove` which stop working after step 2)\r\n\r\n# Observed behaviour\r\n\r\nThere seems no way to reinstall the manually deleted library again using `forge` commands since: \r\n\r\n1. `forge install foundry-rs/forge-std` fails wtih `A git directory for 'lib/forge-std' is found locally`\r\n2. `forge remove lib/forge-std` fails with `No such dependency`\r\n3. `forge update lib/forge-std` fails with `pathspec 'lib/forge-std' did not match any file(s) known to git`\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only way to resolve this situation seems to be to add the module again using git submodule by running:\r\n`git submodule add --force --name lib/forge-std https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-std lib/forge-std`\r\n\r\nAfter that the above mentioned forge commands work again as expected.\r\n\r\n# Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nI'd expect to be able to resolve this situation with `forge` commands only. Specifically I'd expect to `forge remove lib/forge-std` to still remove the submodule / file from the git index even if the directory / file in the `lib` folder was removed. Alternatively I'd expect `forge install` to provide a `--force` option to force install the library again.\r\n\r\n# Example repo:\r\nThe following repo is an example in the above described broken state:\r\nhttps://github.com/ckoopmann/forge-issue-manual-dependency-removal",

Using `forge remove` in the first place to remove the module does indeed work fine.\r\n\r\nThe point of this issue is, that if the user does the mistake of calling `rm` on a dependency,  the project is left in a \"broken\" state that is not recoverable using forge / foundry commands (including `forge remove`).",
