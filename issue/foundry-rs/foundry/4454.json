  "body": "### Component\n\nCast\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nI'm using `cast send` extensively in some scripts. Sometimes they fail with `replacement transaction underpriced`. I suggest having a flag that allows bumping the gas price automatically so that the script can replace the stuck transaction.\r\n\r\n- Option A: `--bump-fee`. If the transaction encounters the above error, we try resending it with iteratively increasing gas price (e.g. +10%) until we succeed.\r\n- Option B: `--bump-fee <MAX_GAS_PRICE>`. Same as above but provide an upper limit.\r\n\r\nI can take a go at implementing this if you think this would be a useful feature.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
