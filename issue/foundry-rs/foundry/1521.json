You cannot make these functions external, so they will never have a 4byte signature.\r\n\r\nThe others make sense to me.\r\n\r\nThere is another issue: Some Cast commands (`cast call` for example), we cannot use structs. `AbiParser` supports it, but it really just expands them into tuples. We should probably allow people to pass tuples (even though it is technically invalid?) to support people calling functions with structs (and functions that return structs)\r\n\r\nRef https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/670\r\n\r\n>It's really more of a problem there than it is a foundry bug.\r\n\r\nProbably but I think having a tracking issue here also makes sense :man_shrugging: ",
