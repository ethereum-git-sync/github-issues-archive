    "body": "Was experiencing same thing but managed to resolve it in a non-deterministic way unfortunately.\r\nOne of the three things fixed it for me:\r\n\r\n1. Cleared git tree by committing all my changes\r\n2. manually added the submodule to my .gitignore with ignore=dirty:\r\n```\r\n[submodule \"lib/openzeppelin-contracts\"]\r\n\tpath = lib/openzeppelin-contracts\r\n\turl = https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts\r\n\tbranch = v4.8.1\r\n\tignore = dirty\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. and added some incorrect fuzz to the end of the installation command to force it to break for a different error, then running the standard `forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts` again and it worked.\r\n\r\nCuriously i now have a second entry in my .gitignore with funky backslashes:\r\n```\r\n[submodule \"lib/forge-std\"]\r\n\tpath = lib/forge-std\r\n\turl = https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-std\r\n\tbranch = v1.4.0\r\n    ignore = dirty\r\n[submodule \"lib/openzeppelin-contracts\"]\r\n\tpath = lib/openzeppelin-contracts\r\n\turl = https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts\r\n\tbranch = v4.8.1\r\n\tignore = dirty\r\n[submodule \"lib\\\\openzeppelin-contracts\"]\r\n\tbranch = v4.8.1\r\n```\r\n\r\nHope this helps with investigation - will try to reproduce on a fresh build tomorrow but posting this incase anyone stuck",
