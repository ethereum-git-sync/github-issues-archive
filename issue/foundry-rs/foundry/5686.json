Is this possible to expose via CLI option?\r\n\r\nIn the short term, we can work around this by having a root `foundry.toml` that is aligned with the same `[fmt]` config as the rest of them, but a little trickier to maintain context-specific ignore lists that way.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_",
