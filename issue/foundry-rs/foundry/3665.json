  "body": "### Component\n\nAnvil\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nAnvil will persist state to disk after hitting a certain limit. It would be nice if anvil was able to read this data / persist it between restarts. That way I could run, e.g. a game on anvil, then spin it down when it was no longer being played, and spin it up again when it was.\n\n### Additional context\n\nI think what this would involve is:\r\n\r\n- Ability to specify a data directory, where data is persisted (internal state, etc.)\r\n- Reading from the data directory if path is specified (and bootstrapping state from it on startup)",
