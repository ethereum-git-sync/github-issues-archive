It makes perfect sense to optimize away the stack storage of a constant, but it breaks test EVMs with changeable timestamps.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this is solveable in Foundry, it may be a Solidity issue. OTOH it's overall a good optimization, it breaks only with Foundry's test framework architecture, why should every DeFi user in the world pay gas for that?",
