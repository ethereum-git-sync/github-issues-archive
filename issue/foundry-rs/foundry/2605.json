  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nMy team has been using foundry and forge bindings in production for a few months, they're great but have a few rough edges, here is some feedback to make binding generation even better, in order of importance (for us at least):\r\n\r\n- Provide a way to filter out tests, scripts and library related bindings. Today `forge bind` generates bindings for all contracts, and some of them (like bindings to `forge-std` contacts) are useless and add time to the build. In our repo, we delete 30 files and usually leave 2/3 (our actual contracts)\r\n\r\n- Re-compile contracts by default. I personally shoot myself in the foot a few times by not recompiling before publishing our bindings, its easy to forget as all other forge commands re-compile before running.  \r\n\r\n- Use a fixed ethers-rs version instead of the latest one from github\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

We do publish the bindings to our internal cargo registry and use them in other repos (which I understand might be unusual), and I don't have a compelling argument for people building single repo apps, so its probably better to leave it as is",
