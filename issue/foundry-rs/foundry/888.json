This ends up creating gigantic snapshot diffs. \r\n\r\n# Potential Solution\r\n\r\nWe should by default not print the fuzz test values to the snapshot file (what we do now) and maybe add a flag which lets you get today's behavior\r\n\r\n(This was requested by @transmissions1, pls weigh in if any other ideas for solving this)\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
