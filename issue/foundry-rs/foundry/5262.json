    "body": "Really sorry to see this. Based on recent prs it would make sense #5246 caused the time increase. \r\n\r\nSome thoughts on what may be the cause specifically:\r\n- Each value in `state` has comparisons to `U256::zero()` and `U256::max()`\r\n    - match on value does effectively the same thing yeah?\r\n- ~3x Vec pushes in `collect_push_bytes` -> leading to 1-2+ Vec reallocs in the fn\r\n    - an iterator over the original `bytes` output would do a similar job without the reallocs\r\n- ~3x HashSet insertions into `state`\r\n    - Not sure how to get increase performance on this\r\n- The fuzz corpus could be providing values that get deeper into the fns, executing more opcodes\r\n\r\n\r\nOTOH, causing a doubling in time seems really unexpected based on these changes. There could be side effects I'm not aware of. Spitballing here - `proptest` generation time could be linear on `state` size?\r\n\r\nIn any case, @mds1 had good instinct with fearing fuzz merges without extensive benching on daedaluzz/etc. It makes sense to revert the pr and I can work on testing it more rigorously with metrics of time/findings/etc. ðŸ«¡",
