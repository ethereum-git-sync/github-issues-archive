    "body": "Really sorry to see this. Based on recent prs it would make sense #5246 caused the time increase. \r\n\r\nSome thoughts on what may be the cause specifically:\r\n- Each value in `state` has comparisons to `U256::zero()` and `U256::max()`\r\n    - match on value does effectively the same thing yeah?\r\n- ~3x Vec pushes in `collect_push_bytes` -> leading to 1-2+ Vec reallocs in the fn\r\n    - an iterator over the original `bytes` output would do a similar job without the reallocs\r\n- ~3x HashSet insertions into `state`\r\n    - Not sure how to get increase performance on this\r\n- The fuzz corpus could be providing values that get deeper into the fns, executing more opcodes\r\n\r\n\r\nOTOH, causing a doubling in time seems really unexpected based on these changes. There could be side effects I'm not aware of. Spitballing here - `proptest` generation time could be linear on `state` size?\r\n\r\nIn any case, @mds1 had good instinct with fearing fuzz merges without extensive benching on daedaluzz/etc. It makes sense to revert the pr and I can work on testing it more rigorously with metrics of time/findings/etc. 🫡",

    "body": "Thanks @DaniPopes — actually pretty surprised fuzzing with only one run adds so much overhead—the intention was to cut fuzzing time by skipping the whole test altogether if it's marked as skipped. Let's patch the fuzzer ASAP then so this doesn't keep happening and CI comes back to normal again 🙏 ",
