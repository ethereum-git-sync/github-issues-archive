  "body": "### Component\n\nChisel\n\n### Have you ensured that all of these are up to date?\n\n- [ ] Foundry\n- [X] Foundryup\n\n### What version of Foundry are you on?\n\nforge 0.2.0 (d369d24 2023-07-02T00:05:10.773939000Z)\n\n### What command(s) is the bug in?\n\nchisel\n\n### Operating System\n\nmacOS (Apple Silicon)\n\n### Describe the bug\n\n---\r\n**Title:** Mapping Element Deletion Issue in Chisel\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Description:**\r\n### Bug Summary\r\nWhen attempting to delete a mapping element in the `token2token` mapping, the expected behavior is to have the deleted element return `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`. However, the current behavior after deletion is returning `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000002`, which doesnâ€™t reflect the expected outcome.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n1. Assign a value to `token2token[address(1)]` (e.g., `token2token[address(1)] = address(2)`)\r\n2. Verify the value of `token2token[address(1)]` to confirm it's `address(2)`\r\n3. Attempt to delete the element using `delete token2token[address(1)]`\r\n4. Check the value of `token2token[address(1)]` post-deletion\r\n\r\n### Code Snippet\r\n```solidity\r\nmapping (address => address) public token2token;\r\n\r\n// Assigning a value to token2token[address(1)]\r\ntoken2token[address(1)] = address(2);\r\n\r\n// Verifying the value before deletion\r\n// Expected: address(2)\r\n// Actual: address(2)\r\naddress valueBeforeDeletion = token2token[address(1)];\r\n\r\n// Attempting to delete the element\r\ndelete token2token[address(1)];\r\n\r\n// Checking the value after deletion\r\n// Expected: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\r\n// Actual: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000002\r\naddress valueAfterDeletion = token2token[address(1)];\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected Outcome\r\nAfter deletion (`delete token2token[address(1)]`), the value of `token2token[address(1)]` should return `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`.\r\n\r\n### Actual Outcome\r\nInstead of returning `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000` after deletion, the value of `token2token[address(1)]` is `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000002`.",
