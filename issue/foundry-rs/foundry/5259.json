  "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI am currently fuzzing Uniswap v2 as part of a comparison between foundry and echidna.\r\n\r\nI am having some trouble reproducing what I can do with echidna here. \r\n\r\nMore specifically, when echidna is run with `testMode: assertion`, it will fail if an assertion does not equal `true`, but it will continue fuzzing if a `require` does not equal `true` (similar to the behavior of `vm.assume` on foundry). \r\n\r\nHowever, foundry invariant tests will treat both `assert` and `revert` as a failure. \r\n\r\nThis is not ideal when I am trying to catch failed asserts on my `targetContract` but I do not care about failed `require`s on any other contracts. This is the case if I'm doing handler-based testing. For example, my target contract **MUST NOT** have any failed `assert`s, but any other deployed contracts may have failed `require`s.\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to have a `fail_on_assert` configuration variable in order to mimic echidna's behavior.",
