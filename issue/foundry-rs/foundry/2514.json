It cannot take env which is set by cheatcode `setEnv`.\r\n\r\nUse case is that: Read Alchemy API key through `vm.setEnv` and resolve in config for multiple fork.\r\n\r\n```toml\r\n[rpc_endpoints]\r\noptimism = \"https://optimism.alchemyapi.io/v2/${ALCHEMY_KEY}\"\r\ngoerli = \"https://eth-goerli.g.alchemy.com/v2/${ALCHEMY_KEY}\"\r\n```\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
