  "body": "I am writing an NFT project test codes. And in the test, I want to mock owner of a specific NFT (given NFT ID). In the contract code, ownership information is stored in a private mapping - _packedOwnerships. \r\n![packed](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/assets/59200993/fec1e988-ce04-49df-826c-14d3b9a0d0be)\r\nI already found storage slot of _packedOwnerships.\r\n![memory](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/assets/59200993/996bccd4-fc91-4c12-8242-415a44689a10)\r\nBut since it is a mapping, I cannot write value to the storage slot directly, right?\r\n\r\nFor example, if I want to mock NFT number 1145's owner to be address(0x123), how can I achieve it?",
