  "body": "### Component\n\nCast\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nThis is actually how `cast --to-hex`, for example, used to work. The base input should be implicit for these alias commands:\r\n- `cast --to-hex <val>` should be equivalent to `cast --to-base <val> 16`\r\n- `cast --to-dec <val>` should be equivalent to `cast --to-base <val> 10`\r\nand so on.\r\n\r\nOtherwise it's confusing and lets users write `cast --to-hex <val> 10`, which doesn't do what you'd expect.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
