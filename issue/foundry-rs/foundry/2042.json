  "body": "### Component\n\nForge, Cast\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nBoth `cast` and `forge` print a bunch of stuff when an error occurs:\r\n\r\n```\r\nError:\r\n   0: Invalid selector: expected 8 characters (excluding 0x prefix), got 66 characters (including 0x prefix).\r\n\r\nLocation:\r\n   /home/oliver/Projects/github/foundry-rs/foundry/utils/src/selectors.rs:114\r\n\r\nBacktrace omitted. Run with RUST_BACKTRACE=1 environment variable to display it.\r\nRun with RUST_BACKTRACE=full to include source snippets.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is OK for debugging/development but ideally we would have a more minimal error reporter by default, i.e. one that just displays the error message(s) (see below) to the user. For panics we should print more information and explain to the user that it is a bug (ideally, we'd never encounter a panic).\n\n### Additional context\n\nWe use `color_eyre` as an error handler in both `cast` and `forge`. Skimming through the docs it's pretty configurable, but not to the point that we could hide most of this information(?)\r\n\r\nWe should retain the ability to ask users to run with some environment variable set (or a flag) to get more information for debugging purposes.\r\n\r\nAlso worth noting is that it is possible to add context to errors and that errors might be nested, which we should still display to the user. I think this is used in Cast specifically.",
