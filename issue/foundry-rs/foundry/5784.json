  "body": "### Component\r\n\r\nForge\r\n\r\n### Describe the feature you would like\r\n\r\nSupport [Microsoft's Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP)](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol//), so that folks can use the debuggers built into VSCode / Neovim / Emacs / Helix / etc.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nI mentioned this in a comment somewhere, but it could be good to track it as its own issue.\r\n\r\nI could take a look when the debugger is in a more stable state. It probably involves exposing library bindings so that a headless executable could be built (but who knows, maybe communicating with a subprocess via stdin could be viable). Ideally it could serve over TCP (`vscode.DebugAdapterServer`) or stdio (`vscode.DebugAdapterExecutable`).\r\n\r\nHere's an explanation of how it works: https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol//overview.html\r\nA tutorial implementation: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-mock-debug\r\nA real implementation: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-debugadapter-node/blob/main/adapter/src/runDebugAdapter.ts\r\n\r\nNot many DAP are implemented in Rust. But:\r\n* [`debug_types`](https://github.com/hirosystems/debug_types) could probably be used to check the DAP implementation.\r\n* [`dap` crate](https://lib.rs/crates/dap) goes a bit further and actually implements some of the boilerplate like parsing/sending Content-Length, serializing from/to BufReader/BufWriter, etc.\r\n* [Here](https://github.com/pileghoff/retread/blob/main/Cargo.toml)'s a project using the above crate. It's a pretty simple setup, they just use a 3-state machine: https://github.com/pileghoff/retread/blob/main/src/app_state.rs",
