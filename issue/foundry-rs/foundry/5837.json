However for a long time forge-std has had [`skip`](https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-std/blob/705263c95892a906d7af65f0f73ce8a4a0c80b80/src/StdCheats.sol#L646-L649) which skips forward in time.\r\n\r\nThe latter has been around longer, and `skipTest` is more explicit, so I'd suggest renaming the `vm.skip` cheat to `vm.skipTest`\r\n\r\nIf people agree with this change, let's introduce `vm.skipTest` now and remove `vm.skip` as part of the v1 release\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
