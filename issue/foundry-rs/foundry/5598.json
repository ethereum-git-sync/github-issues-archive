I've created a [minimal repro repo here](https://github.com/jaycenhorton/forge-panick-repro). The following is the relevant test contract for convenience: \r\n\r\n```solidity\r\npragma solidity ^0.8.4;\r\n\r\nimport \"forge-std/Test.sol\";\r\n\r\ncontract Contract is Test {\r\n  function setUp() external {\r\n    vm.startPrank(address(1));\r\n    // vm.stopPrank(); // uncomment this to fix\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  function test() external {\r\n    // vm.stopPrank(); // OR uncomment this to fix\r\n    payable(address(2)).transfer(1);\r\n    // vm.stopPrank(); // uncommenting this will NOT fix\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo repro, run `forge test --sender=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001`. \r\n\r\nHere's the output\r\n\r\n```\r\nforge test --sender=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001                                    \r\n[⠒] Compiling...\r\n[⠘] Compiling 1 files with 0.8.17\r\n[⠊] Solc 0.8.17 finished in 605.37ms\r\nCompiler run successful!\r\nThe application panicked (crashed).\r\nMessage:  called `Option::unwrap()` on a `None` value\r\nLocation: /home/runner/.cargo/git/checkouts/revm-bf744d8ffabcbad9/bc4d203/crates/revm/src/evm_impl.rs:267\r\n\r\nThis is a bug.
