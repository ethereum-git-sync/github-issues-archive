    "body": "I'll add comments to this issue for features that I've noticed are missing as I attempt to replace `seth` with `cast` during my normal usage:\r\n\r\n- [x] `cast call` does not support the `--block <block>` flag for querying historical data — done in https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/pull/638\r\n- [x] as noted in the readme, `cast run-tx` is not supported—I used the `--trace` and `--debug` modes often - added in #1358 \r\n- [x] `cast client` — added in https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/pull/635\r\n- [x] `cast sig` — added in https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/pull/645\r\n- [x] `cast index` not supported — any ideas for better syntax than [`seth index`](https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools/blob/249c8cca1a4806b8bc47882ca7214ab380d29082/src/seth/libexec/seth/seth-index#L3)? — added in https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/pull/676\r\n- [x] `cast call <addr> <0xCalldata>` is not supported. Probably just need a `.starts_with('0x')` block [here](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/blob/8c0fac7cd5db9bf4574c153d40b7f6c5f5a4c317/cast/src/lib.rs#L237-L248)? —done in https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/pull/742\r\n- [x] `cast abi-encode` with ints not supported, e.g. `cast abi-encode \"x(int256)\" \"-123\"` errors with \"Found argument '-1' which wasn't expected, or isn't valid in this context\" fixed in https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/pull/584\r\n- [ ] Support for signed integers is lacking. https://github.com/gakonst/ethers-rs/issues/842 should be completed first to make this simpler\r\n    - [ ] unsupported in `cast --to-fix` because in `cast/src/lib.rs` the `to_fix` method only takes a U256. Ideal solution is to add support to ethers-rs `format_units` and pass through to that method\r\n    - [ ] unsupported in `cast --from-wei` because in `cast/src/lib.rs` the `from_wei`  method (1) takes an U256 and (2) passes through to ethers-rs `format_units` which does not support integers \r\n    - [ ] unsupported in `cast --to-wei` because in `cast/src/lib.rs` the `to_wei`  method (1) takes an U256 and (2) passes through to ethers-rs `parse_units` which does not support integers \r\n    - [ ] unsupported in `cast calldata` because in `utils/src/lib.rs` the `encode_args` method calls `parse_tokens` which errors with `Failed to parse tokens`, though I have not looked into why\r\n",

    "body": "There is another command that could be useful - `seth rpc` which doesn't seem to completely work when passing args, but it does work when the RPC accepts no arguments. This would be useful to call RPCs that don't already have `cast` commands.

So strings would need to be explicit, like `'\"3\"'` would be a string  and `\"3\"` or `3` would be a number. The response json could return the jsonrpc `result` field and it could be easily composed with `jq`",
