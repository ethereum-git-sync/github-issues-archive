  "body": "### Component\r\n\r\nForge\r\n\r\n### Describe the feature you would like\r\n\r\n# Problem\r\nCurrently in order to execute a forge script and broadcast its transactions, it first has to pass the on-chain simulation step. If any transaction in this simulation fails the script will not be executed.\r\nHowever the on-chain simulation is limited  since certain aspects of the execution (such as the blockhash for example) cannot be predicted before the transaction is included on-chain.\r\nThis leads to a situation where certain scrips that would succeed on-chain cannot be broadcast.\r\n\r\n# Example\r\nOne example is the [CoinFlip](https://github.com/ckoopmann/Foundrynaut/blob/ff833767d8a81a8602c96b21fa810bfde50a7d82/src/problems/03_CoinFlip/Problem.sol#L20) challenge from the Ethernaut project, which reverts if the blockhash did not change. Since we are currently returning the same hash for any future block in the on-chain simulation step this will always fail in the simulation.\r\n\r\nWhile there would be workarounds for this particular example (such as using a random hash for future blocks), there will probably always be transactions that defy simulation.\r\n\r\n# Solution\r\n\r\nAllow the user to disable on-chain simulation when broadcasting a script using an additional command line argument `--skip-simulation`.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_",
