  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Have you ensured that all of these are up to date?\n\n- [X] Foundry\n- [X] Foundryup\n\n### What version of Foundry are you on?\n\nforge 0.2.0 (490b588 2023-10-19T00:17:56.537546457Z)\n\n### What command(s) is the bug in?\n\nforge build\n\n### Operating System\n\nLinux\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nI observed that source maps exhibit some ambiguity in relation to their source unit IDs during incremental builds. Specifically, upon building a project and adding a new contract within a new file, followed by another build, the new file incorrectly receives a source unit ID of `0` already utilized. Consequently, multiple source units now share an identical ID, creating confusion about which file certain source unit entries within the source maps correspond.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Initialize a new contract file under `src/First.sol` with the ensuing content:\r\n    ```solidity\r\n    // SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED\r\n    pragma solidity ^0.8.21;\r\n\r\n    contract First {\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n2. Execute the command `forge build`.\r\n\r\n3. Subsequently, create an additional contract within `src/Second.sol` including the following:\r\n    ```solidity\r\n    // SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED\r\n    pragma solidity ^0.8.21;\r\n\r\n    contract Second {\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n4. Run the command `forge build` once again.\r\n\r\n5. Proceed by examining the generated output artifacts, specifically `out/First.sol/First.json` and `out/Second.sol/Second.json`, noting that the content is abbreviated for brevity. The contents are as follows:\r\n\r\n    ```json\r\n    // First.json\r\n    {\r\n      \"bytecode\": {\r\n        \"sourceMap\": \"65:18:0:-:0;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"deployedBytecode\": {\r\n        \"sourceMap\": \"65:18:0:-:0;;;;;\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"id\": 0\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // Second.json\r\n    {\r\n      \"bytecode\": {\r\n        \"sourceMap\": \"65:19:0:-:0;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;\",\r\n      },\r\n      \"deployedBytecode\": {\r\n        \"sourceMap\": \"65:19:0:-:0;;;;;\",\r\n      },\r\n      \"id\": 0\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n## Current Behavior\r\n\r\nThe artifacts generated post-build, namely `First.json` and `Second.json`, both possess an `id` attribute at the top level with a value of `0`. This `id` ostensibly represents the source unit ID. However, the source maps within each artifact refer to this identical ID, leading to an ambiguity as to the actual source unit to which the source maps are referring.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nEach unique source unit or file should be assigned a distinct source unit ID to prevent overlaps, thereby eliminating any ambiguity in the source maps. This clear distinction is vital for ensuring the source maps accurately reflect their corresponding source units, especially in incremental build environments.\r\n",
