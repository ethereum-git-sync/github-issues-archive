For example setting the root to have read only permissions and the `./cache` folder to have write only permissions will fail if the read only permission for root are set first.\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\n// foundry.toml\r\n...\r\nfs_permissions = [{ access = \"read\", path = \"./\"}, { access = \"write\", path = \"./cache\"}]\r\n```\r\n\r\n``` javascript\r\n// Test.t.sol\r\n...\r\nfunction test_read_write() public {\r\n    vm.readFile(\"foundry.toml\");\r\n    vm.writeFile(\"./cache/cachedFile.txt\", \"cached data\");\r\n}\r\n\r\n// [FAIL. Reason: the path cache/cachedFile.json is not allowed to be accessed for write operations]\r\n```\r\n\r\nReversing the order of the `fs_permissions` will not fail, implying that the ordering is important. I did not notice anything mentioning this in the docs, so I assume it's unintended .\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\n// foundry.toml\r\n...\r\nfs_permissions = [{ access = \"write\", path = \"./cache\"}, { access = \"read\", path = \"./\"}]\r\n```",
