  "body": "### Component\n\nForge, Other (please describe)\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nAs a smart contract developer who builds in Solidity but requires a compiler that is not solc - its difficult for me to use foundry. It would be greatly beneficial for Foundry to implement alternate compiler configurations for developers using custom ZK compilers for L2s.\r\n\r\nAn Ideal outcome of this would be having a switch in the config such that you could point the compiler to a local compiler command as opposed to defaulting to solc. This may have downstream affects for loading ABIs and bytecode for testing. An example compiler that would utilize this request would be the zkSync compiler - currently the only option is using hardhat and npm (https://www.npmjs.com/package/@matterlabs/hardhat-zksync-solc).\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
