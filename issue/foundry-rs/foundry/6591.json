This doesn't break broadcasts using `forge script`, but it breaks off-chain tooling that uses forge script to estimate the gas without broadcasting the transactions.\r\n\r\nA minimal reproducible example is here: [https://github.com/sam-goldman/ArbSepoliaGasEstimation](https://github.com/sam-goldman/ArbSepoliaGasEstimation)\r\n",
