But deleting the file `ForkTest.t.sol` causes the tests to be fine, so the problem is there (in the fork tests).\n\nCan the output be made more helpful on panic? Maybe to say which test it's panicking on?\n\nAttached is a zip directory this is happening in: \n\n[foundry.zip](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/files/9237649/foundry.zip)\n\n",
