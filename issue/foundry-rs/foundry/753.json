Then we'd be able to just print & decode them in the CLI.\r\n\r\nOne idea on how this can work, to be maximally flexible:\r\n1. instantiate the CallTracing inspector\r\n1. make a function call (as contracts are being deployed, store their address -> Abi in a mapping in the runner)\r\n1. the inspector's `traces` field should contain only RAW traces, like the current `CallTraceArena` impl\r\n1. check if all touched addresses in the traces are in the mapping from step 2\r\n1. if not, do a fuzzy bytecode match against all deployed contracts to figure out their ABI/Address (this is required for contracts deployed in setUp() @brockelmore can provide more context here once we get to this)\r\n1. if not, do a join_all etherscan::get_abi on all unidentified ones\r\n1. decode the Raw traces using these abis",
