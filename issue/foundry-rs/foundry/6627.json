    "body": "Hi @gunboatsss,\r\n\r\nI was able to reproduce the error but I think it is not actually a bug.\r\n\r\nIn your minimal reproduction test the requested blockheight for forking of `18634930` on OP mainnet was [524 days ago](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/block/18634930) (at time of writing) whereas the `OpsProxyFactory` was deployed only [344 days ago](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0x1d2dbb34f92564b18a48bebdb6666bbbe43b22d876e4ddf9074b94565581123e) (at time of writing). Therefore the `OpsProxyFactory` contract is not yet deployed at the blockheight and throws.\r\n\r\nI think you were attempting to use the Ethereum blockheight to query OP Mainnet, which produces its own [blocks](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/blocks).\r\n\r\nHope this helps.\r\n\r\n@gakonst feels free to double check - I think this ticket can be closed.",
