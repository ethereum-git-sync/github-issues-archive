When passing it in as an env variable via `FOUNDRY_FUZZ_SEED`, it works fine. \r\n\r\nbehavior:\r\nin foundry.toml, I've set\r\n```\r\n[fuzz]\r\nruns = 100\r\nseed = 0x4444\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen running `forge snapshot`, it works fine and uses 100 runs. Then I set the seed in the environment with\r\n\r\n`FOUNDRY_FUZZ_SEED=0x4444 forge snapshot` and it results in a different snapshot file. I would expect this to be the same seed as set in foundry.toml.\r\n\r\nThis causes a problem in CI where locally run snapshots do not match CI-run snapshots unless environment variable seed is set.\r\n\r\nReference PR from uniswap/v4-core where we had to set fuzz seed in env https://github.com/Uniswap/v4-core/pull/331",
