  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nIn #603, the chain ID was set to default to 1 if not specified (this may have already been the default behavior, though the rest still applies). Defaulting to mainnet's chain ID is not great for a few reason:\r\n- `permit`s and other signatures generated during tests are valid and can be replayed on mainnet\r\n- When RPC support is added, frontend devs will change the network in metamask to the local forge node. Adding this network requires will require specifying a chain ID of 1, meaning any development transaction is now a valid mainnet transaction\r\n\r\nWe should default to 99 (like dapptools), 31337 (like hardhat), or really any arbitrary number [not in use](https://chainlist.org/)\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
