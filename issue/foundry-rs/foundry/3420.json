Another workaround is `log_named_uint(\"name\", bool ? uint256(1) : uint256(0))` or ``log_named_string(\"name\", bool ? \"true\" : \"false\")``\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we have added additional `log_*` helpers to foundry, and I'd support adding a `log_bool` and `log_named_bool`. @justforfunya if you're interested in PR'ing this, check out these where we added other log methods \r\n- https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/pull/1916\r\n- Then in forge-std add them here https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-std/blob/cb69e9c07fbd002819c8c6c8db3caeab76b90d6b/src/Test.sol#L21-L26",
