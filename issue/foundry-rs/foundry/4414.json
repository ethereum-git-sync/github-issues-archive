  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\n### Feature request\r\nIt would be great if there was a way to globally define files, that are default excluded from all foundry commands (we're only interested in ignoring on `forge test`, but probably should apply to all).\r\n\r\nI imagine a system similar to popular `.*ignore` systems, where you can specify a glob of paths & files to ignore by the system. Alternatively this could be an array field on the `foundry.toml`\r\n\r\n### Context\r\nWe maintain a repository which essentially tests most of the proposals on aave governance on mainnet but as well on l2s.\r\nCurrently there are around 160 proposals on mainnet and there's a growing number on l2s as well.\r\nWhat these tests do in a nutshell is: `fork a certain block -> simulate the execution -> check configuration changes`\r\nThese tests are relevant as long as the proposals are not executed as another proposal execution could have side effects on the pending proposal.\r\n\r\nOnce the proposal is getting executed though, it's test is getting irrelevant.\r\nFor historic reasons we'd like to keep the tests, but no longer run them.\r\nAt the same time it would be great if ppl could run `forge test` to test all currently relevant tests, without having to manually maintain a `--match-contract` list or similar.\r\n\r\n### Other options\r\n- we could move the irrelevant tests to a folder not used by foundry\r\n- we could comment out the tests\r\n\r\nThe drawbacks with these options is that they:\r\n- revise history (the code is no longer the same as used to test the proposal before passing)\r\n- even if you wanted to you can no longer run these tests without modifying them\r\n\n\n### Additional context\n\nhttps://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/discussions/4373",
