More info here: https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/pull/2164#discussion_r910478797\r\n\r\nInstead of `assume` you can also use uint248 as the input type for the private key: this obviously shrinks the range of private keys you'll get since `type(uint248).max < curve order`, but it should be good enough for most use cases. Though that'll still revert on zero, so using `bound` is another option",

For \"narrow\" conditions, you might get a lot of rejects and bound of course would have zero rejects so would result in a faster test suite. \"Broad\" and \"tight\" are grey, there's no hard rule here and definitely some personal preference involved.",
