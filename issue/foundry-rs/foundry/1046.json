    "body": "> I'm really unsure what you're asking for here given the amount of (seemingly) unrelated information that has been dumped. Do you want `forge install` to resolve npm packages?\n\nI want to find the subset of compiler versions and openzeppelin versions that cover the maximal amount of user base. Eg what versions cover 80% of users for install OpenZeppelin and which are the corresponding solidity compiler versions needed to cover those versions. Knowing that it can be included in a container image so that it reduces time for getting started etc. i should have been more explicit yes",

Thanks for the comments has helped reasoning about this better (ie what assortment of included compilers yields the greatest coverage to eliminate fetching them at invocation) \r\n\r\nthe answer is the latest for every version except the latest semver which is latest and half of latest",
