  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nTo test functions, they are called as a sub-call of a larger test transaction. This means that gas information does not include the gas costs of the calldata needed to actually call the function in question as the entrypoint of a transaction.\r\n\r\nWhile on mainnet calldata is pretty cheap and so this isnt a huge issue, on L2s calldata is a huge proportion of the total gas of a function. It would be great if there was a way to get estimated gas costs for a function _including_ the calldata costs on various chains.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
