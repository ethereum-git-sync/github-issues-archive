Reason: Undefined.] ` which is very **misleading**, given that nothing is undefined. IMO it **should say something to the effect of \"bad assertion\"** or \"var not equal to asserted value\".\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm new to Foundry so maybe there's a reason for this, but I think **it'd be super useful to have the error logging point to a line in the file**. Knowing what test the error happened in is useful, but the test could be big and I'd like to know what line it actually failed on.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nRunning 1 test for test/PickleCoin.t.sol:PickleCoinTester\r\n[FAIL. Reason: Undefined.] testBalanceOf() (gas: 14813)\r\nTest result: FAILED. 0 passed; 1 failed; finished in 3.10ms\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor slightly more context, this below obvi passes:\r\n```solidity\r\nfunction testBalanceOf() public {\r\n    uint balance = 1;\r\n    assertEq(balance, 1);\r\n}\r\n```",
