This is mainly for testing purposes and prevents me from having to call the impersonate for every address I want to make a transaction with, it saves quit a bit of compute and storage by not having to do this for every transaction.\r\n\r\nI'd be happy to provide a PR for this, I already made this locally to test. Happy to start contributing.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
