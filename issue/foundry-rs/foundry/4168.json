  "body": "### Component\n\nCast\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nIt would be very convenient to have some `cast` methods for fetching the implementation/admin storage slots built directly into `cast`. These storage slots are deterministic between proxies implementing [EIP-1967](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-19670) and it is know that the 32 byte storage slot should be abi decoded as an `address`. It is possible to write a bash alias that wraps `cast storage` and trims the 12 most significant bytes from the result, but I figure this would be useful enough to have directly in `cast`.\r\n\r\nA few possible implementations:\r\n\r\nA top level `1967` command with 3 subcommands\r\n```bash\r\n$ cast 1967 admin\r\n$ cast 1967 implementation\r\n$ cast 1967 beacon\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother option is to do the same thing but instead replace `1967` with `proxy`.\r\n\r\nOr its possible to add 3 new top level commands\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ cast proxy-admin\r\n$ cast proxy-implementation\r\n$ cast proxy-beacon\r\n```\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
