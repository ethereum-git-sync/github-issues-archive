I only want it to pass if it fails on the expected e.g. `require` or with a particular message.\r\n\r\nThis is as `testFail...` test cases could in the future pass as I broke something else and so they're not making sure a formerly tested function fails upon a certain `require`.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
