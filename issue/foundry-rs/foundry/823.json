I just forked your repo and deleted the submodule for now. but idk if you want to fix this it's a total nitpick that'd make my life a little easier\n\n### Additional context\n\nminimal example: make a cargo project. put the dependency line above in a cargo.toml. import something from forge into a main.rs. \r\n\r\nwitness:\r\n```\r\n    Updating git repository `https://github.com/gakonst/foundry`\r\nerror: failed to get `foundry` as a dependency of package `hedgebot v0.1.0 (/Users/laudiacay/hedgebot)`\r\n\r\nCaused by:\r\n  failed to load source for dependency `foundry`\r\n\r\nCaused by:\r\n  Unable to update https://github.com/gakonst/foundry?tag=nightly-d08a59ec16e07329c70f9a5ccf5dbb92baf367f3\r\n\r\nCaused by:\r\n  failed to update submodule `lib/ds-test`\r\n\r\nCaused by:\r\n  no URL configured for submodule 'lib/ds-test'; class=Submodule (17)\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n  :////",
