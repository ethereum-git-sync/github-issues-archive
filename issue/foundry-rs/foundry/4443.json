    "body": "Tried to have a look at an actual fix myself but i don't really understand where to fix this due to lacking rust fu. I guess one could filter duplicates here: https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/master/cli/src/cmd/forge/script/cmd.rs#L127 , but seems wrong as probably should not land here in first place.\r\n\r\nI tried manually deploying the external libraries and using compiler linking, but seems manually deploying libraries doesn't work either as i'm getting `TypeError: Invalid use of a library name.`\r\nDo you have an idea on how one could work around this in the meantime?",
