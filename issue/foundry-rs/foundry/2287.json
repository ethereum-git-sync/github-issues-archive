    "body": "Ok, I think there's two (maybe related?) gas report issues here:\r\n1. Gas reports seem to be printed in order based on when tests finish. But tests are run in parallel and therefore this is not deterministic. I'd propose printing the table sorted alphabetically by path.\r\n2. It seems sometimes not all contracts are shown? Here are three gists from myself, @apbendi, and @garyghayrat. We checked out [this commit](https://github.com/ScopeLift/umbra-protocol/pull/351/commits/ee44b0fcfc351b0b0bd673c68e65bd4e977dce05) of our repo, `cd contracts-periphery; forge install; make snapshot-gas`. This just dumps the output of the `forge test --gas-report` to a file.\r\n    - https://gist.github.com/mds1/07636301420e1019c85953b2c5c18625\r\n    - https://gist.github.com/apbendi/e44f122e3fe28c89fc2015f5e430cbd5\r\n    - https://gist.github.com/garyghayrat/b403a10b4e896cf33a5cc178c3297889\r\n\r\nWe got (un)lucky in the sense that all orders are correct in these gists, but we did observe differing orders between runs. In these gists you'll notice:\r\n- Differing contract sizes in the gas reports (no one changed anything from that commit)\r\n- Differing gas numbers\r\n- Gary's gist is missing a lot of gas report tables, he noticed the same behavior no both linux and macOS and we're all using the same foundry version (Ben and I are both on macOS)",
