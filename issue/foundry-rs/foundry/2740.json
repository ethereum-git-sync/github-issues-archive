No way to stop that.\r\n\r\nI mean something like:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nvm.ExpectRevert(RevertReasons.OUT_OF_GAS);\r\n(bool success, ) = target.call{ gas: 1 }(...);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere you pass a defined amount of gas to a subcall and it reverts there but there is still gas left in the higher level call to continue. This is probably a more fringe usecase so not super important",
