In order to test signatures using EIP-2098 `vm.sign` should return the `vs` key (for when v != 27).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nYou can see how a EIP-2098 compact signature is created in ethers here: https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/blob/master/packages/bytes/src.ts/index.ts#L380-L381\r\n\r\nOn the flip side you can see how Solady recovers an EIP-2098 signature here: https://github.com/Vectorized/solady/blob/main/src/utils/ECDSA.sol#L93-L97\r\n\r\nI was able to implement this manually in my test by doing this:\r\n```solidity\r\n(uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) = vm.sign(privateKey, digest);\r\nif (v != 27) {\r\n  // then left-most bit of s has to be flipped to 1.\r\n  s = s | bytes32(uint256(1) << 255);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut ideally the `vs` would be returned by `vm.sign`.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
