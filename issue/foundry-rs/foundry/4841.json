  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nTokens in Solidity having varying decimals (18 for many ERC20, 8 for wBTC, etc.). This makes it difficult to recognize exactly how much of something is being printed when shown in \"%d\" or \"%e\" format. I'd like to have \"%ne\" supported to see these numbers as decimal.\r\n\r\nE.g.\r\nSomeone's supply of wBTC on chain: 420000000\r\nFormatted using \"%8e\": 4.2\n\n### Additional context\n\nThere was [an idea](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/4464#issuecomment-1455114406) to add this as part of #4464, but was not picked up. I'm reiterating the request here.",
