I can't find any instances of `e4e1c0` or `15000000` in either the revm or anvil source, so I'm wondering if this value is coming in from Avalanche? In any case, if the gas limit is disabled, it shouldn't matter, right? This upper bound on the block gas_limit happens when setting via `--gas-limit 20000000` too.",
