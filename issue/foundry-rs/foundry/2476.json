It seems to be using `sh` so try adding\r\n\r\n`SHELL [\"/bin/sh\", \"-c\"]` after your FROM line. \r\n\r\nAnd then manually add your env after sourcing the shell file\r\n`RUN source ~/.profile`\r\n`ENV PATH=\"~/.foundry/bin:${PATH}\"`\r\n\r\nI am guessing based on the file you attached and the error message you posted.
