    "body": "You'd add a test in `testdata/cheats` similar to the ones already there - there is already a file for `getRecordedLogs` so you'd just extend/change that. There isn't really a nice alternative to `RawLog` in ethers, so you'd need to create a wrapper type like\r\n\r\n```rs\r\nstruct Log {\r\n  emitter: Address,\r\n  inner: RawLog,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nor something like that. You could also use a map of `address -> vec<RawLog>` but that would erase the order in which logs were emitted which we probably want to keep",
