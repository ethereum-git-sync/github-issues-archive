I'm forking during tests using the cheatcodes instead of the command-line parameter.\r\n2. I have a dedicated ForkManagement file that handles all the forking.\r\n3. My TestSetup (main test file which all others inherit from) inherits from ForkManagement.\r\n4. I'm using both `constructor` and `setUp` functions (maybe I shouldn't - cause that's where the bug comes from!)\r\n5. The forking is happening in the ForkManagement constructor\r\n6. It is still the same in the TestSetup constructor, but it suddenly becomes different in TestSetup.setUp (it becomes 31337 default one)\r\n7. If I move the forking from ForkManagement constructor into ForkManagement.setUp - then all is fine\r\n\r\nHere are example code snippets to reproduce:\r\n\r\n**ForkManagement.sol**\r\n```\r\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\r\npragma solidity ^0.8.13;\r\n\r\nimport 'forge-std/Script.sol';\r\n\r\ncontract ForkManagement is Script {\r\n    constructor() {\r\n        vm.createSelectFork(\"polygon\", 45504400);\r\n        console.log('Chain ID in ForkManagement: %s', block.chainid);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function setUp() public virtual {\r\n    //     vm.createSelectFork(\"polygon\", 45504400);\r\n    //     console.log('Chain ID in ForkManagement.setUp: %s', block.chainid);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**TestSetup.sol**\r\n```\r\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED\r\npragma solidity ^0.8.13;\r\n\r\nimport \"forge-std/Test.sol\";\r\nimport \"./ForkManagement.sol\";\r\n\r\ncontract TestSetup is Test, ForkManagement {\r\n    constructor() {\r\n        console.log(\"ChainId in TestSetup constructor: %s\", block.chainid);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function setUp() public virtual override {\r\n        super.setUp();\r\n        console.log(\"ChainId in TestSetup.setUp: %s\", block.chainid);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function testTest() public {\r\n        console.log(\"ChainId in TestSetup.testTest: %s\", block.chainid);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou also need to have this in your **foundry.toml**:\r\n```\r\n[rpc_endpoints]\r\npolygon = \"${POLYGON_RPC_URL}\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd this in your **.env**:\r\n```\r\nexport POLYGON_RPC_URL=\"https://........... your rpc url here\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput of the `forge t`:\r\n```\r\nLogs:\r\n  Chain ID in ForkManagement: 137\r\n  ChainId in TestSetup constructor: 137\r\n  ChainId in TestSetup.setUp: 31337\r\n  ChainId in TestSetup.testTest: 31337\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected output:\r\n```\r\nLogs:\r\n  Chain ID in ForkManagement: 137\r\n  ChainId in TestSetup constructor: 137\r\n  ChainId in TestSetup.setUp: 137\r\n  ChainId in TestSetup.testTest: 137\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput if I move the forking to ForkManagement setUp:\r\n```\r\nLogs:\r\n  ChainId in TestSetup constructor: 31337\r\n  Chain ID in ForkManagement.setUp: 137\r\n  ChainId in TestSetup.setUp: 137\r\n  ChainId in TestSetup.testTest: 137\r\n```",
