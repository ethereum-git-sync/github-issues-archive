I have an overloaded function called getHp that accepts either one or three parameters. I see that the gas results are combined into one function.\r\n\r\nHeres an example gas report with getHp as an overloaded function:\r\n<img width=\"575\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10659278/158915311-426e1835-40b9-4e5e-b23a-3ec8b747abba.png\">\r\n\r\nand heres me splitting getHp into two separate functions (getHp and getHp1), this is more how I would expect forge to show the gas cost for an overloaded function:\r\n<img width=\"584\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10659278/158915763-0e1ece6c-9106-45d0-9a4f-4203d680cbdf.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n",
