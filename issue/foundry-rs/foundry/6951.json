I noticed that when I send a transaction like this:\r\n```\r\nconst signer = new Wallet(privateKey, provider);\r\nawait signer.sendTransaction({\r\n    to: token,\r\n    value: parseEther('1'),\r\n  });\r\n```\r\nIt triggers a mine and the transaction is taken into consideration (as in the user's balance is affected).\r\n\r\nHowever if you sign the transaction and send it through the provider's [broadcastTransaction](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/api/providers/#Provider-broadcastTransaction) like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    const res = await provider\r\n      .broadcastTransaction(\r\n        SIGNED_TRANSACTION_HASH\r\n      )\r\n      .catch((err) => {\r\n        console.log('err', err);\r\n      });\r\n    console.log('res', res);\r\n```\r\nAnvil doesn't mine any block. I tried to even force mine a block after that broadcast via `evm_mine` and even tried `anvil_mine` to mine 20 blocks, but the signed transaction was not included (user's balance unaffected).\r\n\r\nI saw the same issue with ganache\r\non Hardhat, the transaction is mined though\r\n\r\nprovider is:\r\n\r\n`new WebSocketProvider(new WebSocket('ws://127.0.0.1:8545'))`",
