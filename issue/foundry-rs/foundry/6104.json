Namely:\r\n- `Numeric` type to parse different types of numbers (percentages, decimals, hex strings): These should either be deduped into a single Numeric type we can use everywhere and either upstream to alloy or centralize in `common`.\r\n- `format_units`: This utility should eventually be upstreamed to Alloy primitives due to its usefulness.",
