  "body": "# Requested Feature\r\nFor sufficiently large repos, solc compilation can be the slowest part of testing. In those cases we should multithread compilation as much as possible. Here is a rough sketch of a potential way to achieve this?\r\n\r\n## Suggested solution\r\n\r\n1. Determine a threshold for multithreading compilation (# of sol files in repo?) that offsets any overhead\r\n2. Spin up 1 thread per file, determining dependency graph\r\n3. Hash trees/dep graph, and remove duplicate trees\r\n4. Compile the needed contracts using the existing threads, in parallel\r\n\r\nThere could be issues here that I am unaware of but documenting the thoughts I had anyway",

Repos got bigger? Via-ir? Forge-std?\r\n> \r\n> (Closing)\r\n\r\nFwiw, i do think for some repos it may be worthwhile dependent on the number of roots in the project. Where a root is a contract in which no other contract inherits or imports it (diagram below shows how we could split a project into two roots based on dependency graph). I generally believe this is tractable but the number of projects that need this may be few and far between? i.e. if I import my complex contract A, and use the contract as an interface elsewhere i still have to compile the contract in its entirety (but if the project uses interface contracts its probably worth splitting up). This is a different version of parallelization than trying to do any crazy linking. It is much more straightforward. I think it would only have a benefit where via-ir is on (also all of this should in theory be done at the compiler level, not in foundry...)\r\n\r\n```mermaid\r\ngraph TD;\r\n    subgraph root_2 \r\n         A-->B;\r\n         A-->C;\r\n         C-->G;\r\n         B-->H;\r\n    end\r\n    subgraph root_1\r\n        D-->E;\r\n        D-->F;\r\n    end\r\n```\r\n",

    "body": "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI'm revisiting the idea of parallel compilation in Foundry. After a discussion in one of the Solidity team's weekly meetings, it was indicated that they don't currently plan to implement parallel compilation in `solc`. However, they suggested an alternative approach of running `solc` for different files in parallel, rather than for the whole repo. With the shift towards `via-ir` potentially becoming the default mode for Solidity compilation, I believe exploring parallel compilation approaches could become even more crucial for optimizing build times, especially for larger projects.\r\n\r\nSince this issue was previously closed, has there been any new developments or considerations about integrating parallel compilation in Foundry? This could involve strategies like the one suggested by the Solidity team or other methods to effectively parallelize the build process. I recognize the complexity of this feature but am interested in whether there's room for further discussion or contributions.\r\n\r\nThanks for your work on Foundry!",
