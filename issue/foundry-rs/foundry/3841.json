  "body": "### Component\r\n\r\nForge\r\n\r\n### Describe the feature you would like\r\n\r\nThe `test` property in the Foundry config is currently a simple path to a directory. My request is turn it into a glob pattern to enable selective exclusion of certain paths (e.g. fork tests), though there may be multiple use cases depending upon each user's situation.\r\n\r\nTake the following directory structure:\r\n\r\n```tree\r\ntest\r\n├── e2e\r\n├── integration\r\n└── unit\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is not currently possible to make Forge run the tests only in the `integration` and `unit` directories, but this is useful in a non-CI environment. It is only possible to run the tests in *either* the `integration` and the `unit`. The following configuration doesn't work:\r\n\r\n```toml\r\ntest = \"test/{integration,unit}\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdding support for glob patterns should be easy, because there wouldn't be any breaking change. A simple directory path is still a glob pattern.",
