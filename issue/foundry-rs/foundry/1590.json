Thus, the following is a valid string:\r\n\r\n    0x1\r\n\r\nAnd this is not:\r\n\r\n    0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001\r\n\r\nThis leads to the following frustrating error:\r\n\r\n    $ cast storage 0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2 0x1\r\n    \r\n    Error:\r\n      0: (code: -32602, message: Errors encountered in param 1: Invalid value \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001\" supplied to : QUANTITY, data: None)\r\n\r\nThe [spec](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1474#quantity) appears to reject leading zeros, so it looks like Hardhat is implementing the spec correctly and `cast` is left-padding the quantity incorrectly.\r\n\r\n[This comment](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/385#issuecomment-1008013886) implies that it's the other way round, so I'm not sure what the correct outcome here is.\r\n\r\nI'm [cross-posting this at the Hardhat repository](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/issues/2698) too, in case it makes more sense for them to deviate from the spec.",
