  "body": "In #310 a cheat code will be added for testing that a single event is emitted. To keep the first iteration simple it'll work as described in that issue and only test for one instance of the specified event.\r\n\r\nIt would be useful to add a second definition of `expectEmit` with one additional argument which specifies the number of expected logs emitted. This is useful for cases where:\r\n1. you have identical logs emitted within the same transaction, e.g. batch token transfers, and\r\n2. you just want to check a log was emitted `n` times but don't need to test the actual values emitted",
