There could be some obscure edge case in your contracts with those addresses, and we don't want to miss that by excluding them.\r\n2. Precompile addresses are valid inputs an attacker can send to your contract, so they should not be excluded from testing.\r\n3. A forge-std helper can wrap `vm.assume` to ensure the address passed from the fuzzer isn't a precompile, without affecting the core fuzzer, so this doesn't really need to be integrated natively anyway.",
