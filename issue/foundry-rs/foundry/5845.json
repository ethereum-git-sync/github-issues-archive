    "body": "> Ohhhhh I see... @trevorgjohnson can you try running forge with `RUST_LOG=forge,forge::evm,etherscan`? This might be etherscan identifiers blocking a test thread\r\n\r\nDefinitely! This is what prints to the console after the tests are ran:\r\n![image](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/assets/27569194/b83eb9f9-5ab9-4b31-80ca-b52d96b6df20)\r\n\r\nThat `pushing decoder` extends down a lot further, but it seems it's just looping through each of the tests.\n\nEDIT: the \"pushing decoder\" was an old `println` I was using for tracing the issue. Apologies for the confusion",
