Failed to resolve file: \"(...)/lib/forge-std/lib/ds-test/src/MyDsTest.sol\": No such file or directory (os error 2).\r\n        Check configured remappings.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is manageable with 1 level of dependency but will cause surprises with nested dependencies.\r\n\r\n## Suggestion\r\n\r\nOnly apply the remapping when compiling files of the imported dependency (I don't know how forge invokes `solc`, maybe that's not an option). Optionally also rewrite deep imports (like `import dependency/remapped_dir/Contract.sol` from the root level.",
