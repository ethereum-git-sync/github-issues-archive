The snapshot interface can be simplified while also executing more runs for snapshot data by:\r\n- Removing the `--include-fuzz` flag.\r\n- Modifying `forge snapshot` to always use the same rng seed. The value used doesn't really matter here, maybe we just use 0 or 1.\r\n\r\nPotentially related gas snapshot issues:\r\n- #137 \r\n- #1795 \r\n- #2056 \n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
