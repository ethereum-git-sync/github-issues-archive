I have created an example repository - https://github.com/michprev/anvil-tx-dropped-issue.\r\n\r\nSee `tests/test_counter.py` for the test source code and `log.txt` for the full JSON-RPC communication log.\r\n\r\nThe steps to reproduce the issue are:\r\n- install Woke `pip install woke` (Python >= 3.7 < 3.11 needed)\r\n- clone the repository, cd into it\r\n- run `woke test tests/test_counter.py`\r\n\r\nWill be happy to provide more information if needed.",
