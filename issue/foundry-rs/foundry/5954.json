Then I compare it with the number itself. It seems that the inserted number is decreased by 1. I wonder why it is so. To make sure I did not store the value in the wrong slot. I tried one more time using\r\n         vm.store(\r\n            address(addrContract),\r\n            bytes32(uint256(0)),\r\n            bytes32(uint256(MAX + 1))\r\n        );\r\n, and the test passed. So it proves that the inserted value is indeed decreased by 1.",
