  "body": "### Component\r\n\r\nForge\r\n\r\n### Describe the feature you would like\r\n\r\nThe idea is to introduce a new config option called `filter` (or `sift`) that accepts a list of whitelisted contracts:\r\n\r\n```toml\r\n[profile.artifacts]\r\nfilter = [\r\n  \"Foo\",\r\n  \"Bar\",\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen it sees this config, Forge generates artifacts only for the members listed under `filter`, regardless of whatever other members may be present in the repository. Note that by \"members\" in this context, I mean any of the following:\r\n\r\n- contract\r\n- interface\r\n- abstract\r\n- library\r\n\r\nThe primary use case is shipping a Node.js package that should include only the production contracts' artifacts - though there may be more use cases than just that. Anything related to artifact generation may benefit from such a feature.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nIn our project, we wrote a [Bash script](https://gist.github.com/PaulRBerg/6cdca9662bb51474b2580fddf4c03c0c) because we couldn't find a way to filter contracts with Foundry itself.",
