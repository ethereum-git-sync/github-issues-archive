  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nThis is probably not at all trivial, but: it would be very helpful to include informative stack traces in test output and code source in the debugger when using `vm.getCode`, and that code comes from a Forge output folder. \n\n### Additional context\n\nOur test suite relies on deploying pre-compiled contracts: one set using 0.8.13 and via_ir=true, and another using 0.8.7 and via_ir=false. Neither configuration is really appropriate for the test suite â€“ IR compilation is slow, and 0.8.13 has more convenience methods.\r\nWe were able to partially work around this by [conditionally deploying some contracts normally](https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/seaport/blob/463bf8add301c7b3a326093122303dcc9658f0d0/test/foundry/utils/BaseConsiderationTest.sol#L40) in the Seaport test suite, but this is not always possible, especially if a set of contracts requires a different compiler version or cannot be compiled with the test suite configuration.",

Sounds like there's no way to get source mapping for those besides compiling without IR.\r\nShould probably close this ðŸ˜…\r\n\r\nEdit: It looks like the test contracts do still have to import the precompiled contracts (even if not deploying them), otherwise the debugger shows \"Unknown contract at 0x...\" instead of sourcemap",
