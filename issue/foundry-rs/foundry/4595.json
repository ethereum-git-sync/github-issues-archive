    "body": "The OUSD contract's `balanceOf` method dynamically computes the balance to return (like a rebase token), whereas the `deal` cheat only supports tokens that return `balanceOf` by reading a value directly form a storage slot, because `deal` works by changing the value in the `balanceOf` storage slot. As a result this token is not currently supported by forge-std, similar to https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-std/issues/140\r\n\r\nAs a workaround you can find an OUSD whale from [etherscan](https://etherscan.io/token/0x2A8e1E676Ec238d8A992307B495b45B3fEAa5e86#balances), prank as that user, and transfer tokens to any address you need\r\n\r\n(For future reference, `deal` for tokens is a forge-std cheat, not a native forge cheat, so this issue should be in the forge-std repo) ",
