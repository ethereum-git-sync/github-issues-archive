Additionally, it does not appear that `SizeAuction.sol` imports a file that looks to contain a library named `ChainlinkTWAP`. Is it defined in `SizeAuction.sol`?\r\n\r\nYou also specify libraries for some of the tests - this is not needed, unless you are running fork tests. In that case, there seems to be additional tests which make use of libraries that do not appear in `libraries`.\r\n\r\nWhat contract are you trying to deploy?",
