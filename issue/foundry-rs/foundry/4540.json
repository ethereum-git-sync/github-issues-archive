It took me a few moments (the author of my NatSpec comments) to figure out what was happening; a third-party reader of the docs website wouldn't have a clue that one section is for general audience, and the other is for devs.\r\n\r\n> Wonder if there's any alternative solutions that keep the visual separation but doesn't break formatting like this\r\n\r\nAt a minimum, `forge doc` should handle the case when the content of the `@dev` tag is split into multiple lines. Adding asterisks doesn't work in this case.\r\n\r\nBut users should ideally be able to tweak this on and off either via an option in `foundry.toml`, or by a more robust templating functionality à la [solidity-docgen](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/solidity-docgen) (which can generate different Markdown based on a template provided by the user).\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, I am in favor of `forge doc` making as few opinionated choices as possible, because a simpler Markdown is easier to customize later on.",
