  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nI am not a fan of npmjs or git submodules. Because of this, a few weeks ago, I decided to write a dependency manager specifically for Solidity, called [Soldeer](https://github.com/mario-eth/soldeer)\r\n\r\nI've been involved in web2 for a long time before transitioning to web3 a few years ago. Over the years, I've come to appreciate a robust dependency manager and build tool that can simplify your work. From the start of my web3 journey I felt there was a lack of a good dependency manager for Solidity.\r\n\r\nInitially, this wasn't a major concern since smart contracts were relatively small. But that has changed over the years.\r\n\r\nCurrently, there are many projects developing smart contracts, producing various libraries and more. Keeping up with them is challenging, and most of these projects rely on npm or GitHub for releases.\r\n\r\nAs I began developing Soldeer, I realized that the release and management of versions felt a bit like the \"wild west.\"\r\n\r\n### Description of Soldeer\r\n- Soldeer is written in Rust and is published on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/soldeer).\r\n- It's entirely open-source.\r\n- It archives the dependencies in a specialized repository because there wasn't a consistent way to fetch dependencies from a project's GitHub. Some repositories feature releases, others use branches, and some rely on specific commits.\r\n- There's also an option to install dependencies manually by providing your link to the zipped dependency.\r\n- Soldeer uses TOML for configuration management.\r\n- If a flag is marked as true, it will automatically add the dependency to the remappings.\r\n- I've designed it to be as lightweight as possible. It still needs enhancements, but I initially built it for my use during my spare time.\r\n\r\n### Plans for the future\r\n- Backend + Frontend for dependency storage.\r\n- A release pipeline, enabling projects to deploy their dependencies.\r\n- Integration of tools like Slither and more within the release pipeline to assist developers.\r\n\r\n### How do you use Soldeer now\r\nYou just install it via cargo `cargo install soldeer` and then use it as simple as `soldeer install [dependency~version]` (more can be seen in the [readme](https://github.com/mario-eth/soldeer/blob/main/README.md))\r\n\r\n### Why i'm opening this issue\r\nI'd love for Soldeer to be integrated into Foundry. I envision users being able to run commands like `forge install [dependency~version]`. Alternatively, if we decide to retain submodules, perhaps a command like `forge soldeer [ARGS]`.\r\n\r\nI must admit I do not know the foundry's internal structure as of now, so integrating it myself can take some time, would love to hear your thoughts. \r\n\r\n\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
