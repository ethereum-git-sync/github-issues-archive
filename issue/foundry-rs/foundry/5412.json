  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Have you ensured that all of these are up to date?\n\n- [X] Foundry\n- [x] Foundryup\n\n### What version of Foundry are you on?\n\nforge 0.2.0\n\n### What command(s) is the bug in?\n\nforge test\n\n### Operating System\n\nLinux\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nHi!\r\nJust figured that overflowing the total supply of an ERC20 won't revert if done with the `deal` cheatcode. Instead it will cause total supply to became 0, while some wallets may still have balances > 0.\r\n\r\nHere is a minimal reproduction:\r\n```solidity\r\nfunction testFuzz_dealWontRevert(uint256 amount1, uint256 amount2) public {\r\n    deal(address(myToken), address(1234), amount1);\r\n    deal(address(myToken), address(1234), amount2);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis fuzz test contains a lot of possible scenarios where `deal` call would make the total supply exceeds `type(uint256).max`. However, this test passes successfully.\r\n\r\nI just spent 1 hour trying to figure this out, it was totally breaking the behavior of my contract :sweat_smile: \r\n\r\nIf this can be easily solved by bounding `amount2` (see below), it'd be awesome to have clean error report to makes tests debugging easier.\r\n```solidity\r\nfunction testFuzz_dealWontRevert(uint256 amount1, uint256 amount2) public {\r\n    deal(address(myToken), address(1234), amount1);\r\n    amount2 = bound(amount2, 0, type(uint256).max - myToken.totalSupply());\r\n    deal(address(myToken), address(1234), amount2);\r\n}\r\n```",
