  "body": "### Component\r\n\r\nForge\r\n\r\n### Describe the feature you would like\r\n\r\nAdd `vm.promptAddress(string prompt)`, `vm.promptUint(string prompt)`, etc. cheatcodes which would prompt user for some input. This could be used as an alternative of script function args.\r\n\r\nReasons why I think this could be useful:\r\n1. When working on a new external project it would be handy if user could just run the script and follow the instructions after it rather than checking certain function parameters and signatures in random .sol script files to enter them in cli. Also, prompt string would allow to specify more details on what needs to be provided\r\n2. This would allow more straightforward UI because scripts relying on some arguments will not require explicit specification of them in `--sig` argument\r\n\r\nExpected behavior:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract Deploy is Script {\r\n    function deployFoo() public {\r\n        address bar = vm.promptAddress(\"Enter bar address: \");\r\n        new Foo(bar);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_",
