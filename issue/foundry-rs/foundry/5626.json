My reasoning is that if I simply create an empty `.git` folder and run the command, then it exits successfully. \r\n\r\nI looked over the `git blame` for the surrounding lines. It seems like there is a lot of back and forth, but if you're looking to wipe the git history of the template then you need to do so from the project root directory, not the directory from which the init command was called.",
