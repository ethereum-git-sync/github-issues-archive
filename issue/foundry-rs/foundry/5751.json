The new code adds a print statement that sometimes prints \"- skipping the remapping\". This line gets added to the start of the json output, causing json parsers to fail. The expected behavior of any command using `--json` would be a valid json output. The invalid output causes any script piping the expected json output to fail. One example that is affected by this failure is Nomic foundations hardhat-foundry plugin which fails with the following code ([hardhat-foundry/src/foundry.ts](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/blob/b84baf2d9f5d3ea897c06e0ecd5e7084780d8b6c/packages/hardhat-foundry/src/foundry.ts#L31)).\r\n\r\nThe specific line of code causing the issue is [foundry/crates/config/src/providers/remappings.rs](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/c97661960054e400e9ed5af096db734349084f83/crates/config/src/providers/remappings.rs#L166).",
