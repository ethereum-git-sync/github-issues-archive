  "body": "### Component\n\nFoundryup\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nFoundryup provides easy and repeatable installations of nightly, branched/versioned, and forked Foundry repositories.  Currently, it is only possible to install `forge` and `cast` from remote repositories/tarballs.\r\n\r\nFor both Foundry contributors and users, it would be convenient to enable `foundryup` to install from local repositories. This would simplify the testing of local changes across multiple projects and generally align local development with the install method used for remote codebases and official releases. \r\n\r\nIn short, I propose a simple capability for local installations to be added to Foundryup. If there is agreement, I can clean-up my personal implementation and open it in a PR for review and modification.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Additional context\n\nDiscussed briefly in Telegram with @gakonst ",

Originally I had symlinked to a new $AUTHOR folder in $FOUNDRY_DIR then installed from there. It worked but it made the control flow in the remote repo block over complicated. I think this can be done in a very short `if` block that's executed if a `--local-repo` value is passed. Will put up a draft PR tonight PT. ",
