  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nNot entirely sure the best way to approach such a feature, but it would be great to utilize Forge Scripts to generate proposals for Openzeppelin Defender: https://docs.openzeppelin.com/defender/admin.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that some changes to contracts need to be administered by a multi-sig (e.g. Gnosis Safe). I could see a workflow like this:\r\n\r\n- Create an upgrade/update script for forge, and run it to produce a proposal on Openzeppelin Defender\r\n- Check is on Defender, and approve with multisig\r\n\r\nThere is a hardhat defender plugin that can probably be mimicked. The idea is to simulate the script and gather the broadcasted transactions. Then convert those transactions into a format that Defender understands for proposals and send it over.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
