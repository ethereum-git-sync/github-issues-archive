It might be useful sometimes to track the execution of long-running script.\r\n\r\nAll `console.log`s are collected as events and printed only after the execution is completed. This is a behavior inherited from hardhat, however with cheatcodes it is now possible to perform operations in the middle of simulation.\r\n\r\nI am proposing a very simple interface `vm.log(string line)` which will just log `line` into stdout.\r\n\r\nIf this is a desired feature, I would be happy to implement it\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_",
