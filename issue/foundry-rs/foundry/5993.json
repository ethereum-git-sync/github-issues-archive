I find this a bit confusing. I see the `chain` option is under etherscan, so it probably is only used w.r.t. to etherscan API configuration.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately `forge create --help` lists `--chain` under \"Ethereum options\". My recommendation is to either:\r\n1) in the create subcommand, respect `chain` if it is set explicitly\r\n2) clearly state in the help docs that `chain` is only used for etherscan API configuration",
