  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nSometimes it's useful to set tests to be skipped, such as:\r\n- When a test is transiently broken\r\n- If the current environment does not support running a particular test\r\n- Some tests are particularly slow, and would be convenient to only run them when an env variable is set. (Hypothetically, haven't run into these myself yet ðŸ˜…)\r\n\r\nMore specific example: I have some end-to-end integration tests that rely on forking a live RPC, but sometimes the test suite is run in offline environments which results in the forking process failing due to lacking an RPC to work with. I'd prefer to catch that scenario, a message like \"Skipping fooTest: ETH_RPC_URL not set\".\r\n\r\n(Bonus points if this is also callable inside setUp())\r\n\r\nWould love a `skip(string message)` function which marks the current test as neither passed nor failed, bails, and prints the message when skipping it.\n\n### Additional context\n\nNot sure if this should be part of forge-std, or needs to be part of a vm cheatcode? I suspect some changes would need to be made in forge also?\r\n\r\nAPI Examples:\r\n- Rust has the `#[ignore]` attribute (not sure what the best practice is for skipping at runtime with a message)\r\n- Mocha in JavaScript has `this.skip(...)` and a bunch of other helpers: https://mochajs.org/#inclusive-tests\r\n- Go has t.Skip(...): https://pkg.go.dev/testing#hdr-Skipping",
