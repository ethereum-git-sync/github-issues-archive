  "body": "### Component\r\n\r\nForge\r\n\r\n### Describe the feature you would like\r\n\r\nI'd like to be able to easily send flashbots bundles within forge scripts for use-cases involving transactions that cannot hit public mempools for security reasons (e.g. MEV-able transactions, whitehat rescues, etc). \r\n\r\nDoing this natively from a forge script obviates the need for me to use Hardhat for use-cases like this, or for me to write custom TypeScript/Rust code for each instance. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nI have a draft/WIP PR for this here: https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/pull/4948",
