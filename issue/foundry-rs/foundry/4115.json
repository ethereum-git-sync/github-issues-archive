Resolve relative image imports in home properly\r\n\r\nWhen testing forge doc w/ Art Gobblers the home page shows up like this:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26209401/213080814-7e32c981-e7d0-4de3-87b3-bcbe918e4699.png)\r\n\r\nThe broken images seem to be due to the fact that the Art Gobblers readme uses relative imports like `![Gobbler Lifecycle](assets/state-machines/gobbler-lifecycle.png)` for images which work on Github but not with forge doc. Would be nice if they were as 1:1 compatible as possible.\r\n\r\n2. More eager link resolving\r\n\r\ni.e: Links in the author section do not get shown as hyperlinks:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26209401/213080990-f8216380-8af4-4d65-8576-8414d438adc8.png)\r\n\r\n3. Table of contents sidebar for each file/contract\r\n\r\nWould make it a lot easier to navigate large contracts' docs if there was a table of contents on sidebar that had a collapsable header for functions, events, errors, etc and you could open them to skip to specific functions/events/errors/etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nforge doc is awesome! Was asked to give feedback and these are the main things that came to mind.",

I was gonna create a new issue with a couple things I noticed, but figured I'd leave them here since this issue is already scoped broadly\r\n\r\n1. **+1 on table of contents sidebar**\r\n\r\n2. **User-defined `SUMMARY.md`**. Just like a user can provide their own settings for the book by specifying a path for  `book.toml`, it would be great to be able to define book layout by specifying a path for a custom [`SUMMARY.md`](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/format/summary.html) file. \r\n\r\n3. **Support for `extra-watch-dirs`**. This would be useful for allowing projects to include more detailed docs and guides outside of the project readme and NatSpec.",

    "body": "Agree with everything here. Only comment is on @slgraham third item: Perhaps instead of `extra-watch-dirs`, we just put those additional docs in the same `docs` folder that gets created by `forge doc`. Might need to move all the autogenerated stuff into a subfolder like `docs/docgen` so it's easy to commit the custom `SUMMARY.md` and other custom files while not comitting the generated docs. And the `SUMMARY.md` file would specify what to do with your custom files",
