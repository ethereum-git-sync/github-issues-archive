  "body": "### Component\n\nAnvil\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nHey team, wanted to ask if it was possible to add eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas to the Anvil Node? My team is using the Golang Geth generated bindings to interact with the chain, but we are adding integration tests using an ephemeral chain. We tried hardhat node but they don't implement this method as it's Geth Specific. \r\nWhen we tried to deploy a contract using the geth bindings pointing to a hardhat node, it fails for this reason. \r\n\r\nWould be great if the anvil team could take an edge here, even if it's hardcoded to any value for testing\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
