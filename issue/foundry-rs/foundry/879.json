Right now, I'm separating my src files from my tests in the directory structure src/ and tests/, run `forge build` to compile src, run the code-gen, and then `forge test --contracts tests`.  The behavior I was expecting that if I set `test='tests'` option in the foundry.toml that it would do `forge test --contracts tests` behind the scenes when I do forge test\n\n### Additional context\n\n[repo for more context](https://github.com/stevennevins/example-fixtures)",
