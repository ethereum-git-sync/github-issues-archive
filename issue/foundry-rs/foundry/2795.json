Since most of the frameworks don't output the metadata by default, the file after compilation goes missing. When developers make a small change, the newly generated metadata file will be different, making a perfect verification impossible. That the file goes missing, and the lack of knowledge of the metadata have been the main obstacles to the ecosystem-wide adoption of perfect verification. \r\n\r\nBy outputting it by default, users can be saved from an additional step and can use this output in the artifacts later even if they don't use the `verify-contract --verifier sourcify` feature.\r\n\r\nOther frameworks such as Truffle and recently Hardhat already output the metadata by default\r\nhttps://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/pull/1863\r\n\r\ncc: @rkrasiuk \n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
