It would be helpful to have general access to the underlying format function.\r\n\r\nThis may be overkill, or may be an issue for `forge-std`, but I am guessing it would run faster to directly call the underlying format than to reimplement `%s`-substitution in Solidity.\r\n\r\nThen instead of\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nvm.writeLine(string.concat('\"',vm.toString(addr),'\": ',vm.toString(t.balanceOf(addr))));\r\n```\r\n\r\nyou can write\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nvm.writeLine('\"%s\": %s', addr, t.balanceOf(addr));\r\n```\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

    "body": "We only support the format-related arguments because Hardhat's `console.log` has it, beyond that I think using Solidity and the `vm.toString` cheatcodes are enough - changing e.g. `writeLine` to your example is a lot more complex since we'd essentially have to revisit all cheatcodes that accept strings and add a new signature that supports formats with a long list of arguments. Closing this as out of scope for that reason, but we can revisit if it turns out there is a lot of demand for it :)",
