    "body": "Going to close this as a duplicate of https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/3390 which tracks this idea + other trace improvements. Note that you can use the `vm.record` and `vm.accesses` cheats as a partial workaround for nowâ€”you lose some ordering info since it returns two separate arrays instead of a single array of both reads+writes, and it doesn't give you values. A good feature request would be to improve `accesses` to return more data if you wanted to open that issue, e.g. return a single array of structs like:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nstruct StorageAccess {\r\n  bool isWrite; // true for SSTORE, false for SLOAD\r\n  bytes32 slot;\r\n  bytes32 previousValue;\r\n  bytes32 newValue; // for SLOAD, this would match previousValue\r\n}\r\n```",
