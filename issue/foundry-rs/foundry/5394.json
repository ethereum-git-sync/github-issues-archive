For example, [using the seed 0](https://github.com/aviggiano/fuzzer-evaluation/blob/main/results/final.csv#L35) for this test case finished in 25960 seconds with status code 0.\r\n\r\nGiven the large value set for max runs ($2^{32}-1$, approximately 4 billion), it makes me believe that the max runs value is not being appropriately respected, or is being overridden at some point, but I have looked through the codebase and I could not find any explicit limitations.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if I am doing something wrong, or how I can help investigate this further.\r\n",
