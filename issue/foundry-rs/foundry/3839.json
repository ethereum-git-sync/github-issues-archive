We fixed it by switching to `mainnet`\r\n\r\n2. **forge verify-contract**: this command seems to not properly handle `[etherscan]` settings from toml.\r\nWhen adding a appropriate key in `.env` and defining `optimism={key=\"${ETHERSCAN_API_KEY_OPTIMISM}\",chainId=10}` verification will fail with \"invalid key\" - when manually passing the same key as parameter to  `forge verify-contract 0x0 --chain-id optimism Contract key` it works.\r\n\r\n3. **optimism/arbitrum**: not sure if only happening here and not sure if related to `--legacy` flag or not, but here i multiple times got\r\n```\r\nONCHAIN EXECUTION COMPLETE & SUCCESSFUL.\r\nThe application panicked (crashed).\r\nMessage:  division by zero\r\n\r\n// and\r\n\r\nError: \r\nEOA nonce changed unexpectedly while sending transactions.\r\n```",
