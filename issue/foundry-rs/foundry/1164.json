For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport {\r\n    IllegalArgument,\r\n    IllegalState,\r\n    Unauthorized,\r\n    UnsupportedOperation\r\n} from \"../../base/Errors.sol\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs expected to be:\r\n\r\n```\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis issue subsequently caused a silent error when verifying the contract because the flattened code would not compile on Etherscan.",
