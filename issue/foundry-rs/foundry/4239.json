I am now trying to do the same for `chisel` but the paths seems to be ignored so the default installation of `solc` is executed each time. I tried with different paths all being ignored and verified that they work with `forge --use`.\r\n\r\nMy `chisel` version is:\r\nchisel 0.1.1 (31f945c 2023-01-30T00:05:13.423748Z)",
