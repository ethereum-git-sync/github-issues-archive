However, (I think) it's currently impossible to impersonate accounts from `forge script`. For example, for deploying a contract you may need approval from some existing admin contract. Currently `vm.broadcast(adminContractAddress)` fails because the contract is not unlocked.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_",
