  "body": "### Component\r\n\r\nForge\r\n\r\n### Have you ensured that all of these are up to date?\r\n\r\n- [X] Foundry\r\n- [X] Foundryup\r\n\r\n### What version of Foundry are you on?\r\n\r\nforge 0.2.0\r\n\r\n### What command(s) is the bug in?\r\n\r\nforge init hello_foundry\r\n\r\n### Operating System\r\n\r\nLinux\r\n\r\n### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nThere seems to be a circular dependency issue with `forge init hello_foundry` in an existing and empty git repo.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\nMost of my crypto work is anon, so I don't globally set my git credentials. I set them up per repo using scripts.\r\n\r\nThis is the reason why I'm running the above command in an empty folder that has already been initialised as a repo (an setup with correct user config). \r\n\r\n# Steps to replicate\r\n\r\n> must make sure that git credentials are not set globally by running `git config --list | grep 'user.'`\r\n\r\n1. Create a new folder \r\n\r\n2. Initialise that new folder as a git repo\r\n\r\n3. Run `forge init hello_foundry` \r\n\r\n# Behaviour\r\n\r\nRunning the command ends in this error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nInstalling forge-std in \"/home/USER/foundry/hello_foundry/lib/forge-std\" (url: Some(\"https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-std\"), tag: None)\r\nError: \r\nThis command requires clean working and staging areas, including no untracked files. Modify .gitignore and/or add/commit first, or add the --no-commit option.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nQuite a strange error as you can see: why would we get an unclean working area within an empty git repo?\r\n\r\nAfter doing an ls in the repo it becomes clear what is happening.\r\n\r\n```\r\nhello_foundry\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe folder for the project has been created and a downstream command has a clean repo requirement that is not satified.\r\n\r\nBut I'm also betting that the folder is required for upcoming steps, hence why I titled this - circular dependency.\r\n\r\n# Workarounds\r\n\r\nTrying to commit the newly created folder and then rerunning the `init` command does not work, resulting in: \r\n\r\n```\r\nerror: `forge init` cannot be run on a non-empty directory.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning `forge init hello_foundry --force` also does not work, resulting in: \r\n\r\n```\r\nInstalling forge-std in \"/home/USER/foundry/hello_foundry/lib/forge-std\" (url: Some(\"https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-std\"), tag: None)\r\nError: \r\nfatal: pathspec '.gitmodules' did not match any files\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Outcome\r\n\r\nWas not able to install the `hello-world` example because of the above issues\r\n\r\n",
