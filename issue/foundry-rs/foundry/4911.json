What i need is to first `Struct Encoding` ComplicatedStruct first, according to the [doc](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/cast/cast-sig)\r\n\r\n<img width=\"842\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/assets/16397293/0a1308b3-0608-4867-ae71-d2facac4d4c8\">\r\n\r\nwould be appretiate if we can support  'Struct Encoding' by default, for example we can do the following direct to get selector back.\r\n```\r\ncast sig '\r\n  struct NestedStruct {\r\n      string name;\r\n      uint8 age;\r\n   }\r\n   struct ComplicatedStruct {\r\n       NestedStructA a;\r\n   }\r\n\r\n    function f(\r\n        ComplicatedStruct memory data,\r\n        uint256 tokenId\r\n    );\r\n'\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
