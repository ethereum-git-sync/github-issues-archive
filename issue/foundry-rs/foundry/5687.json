  "body": "### Component\r\n\r\nForge\r\n\r\n### Describe the feature you would like\r\n\r\nSince git history is removed during initialization from a template, this functionality can't be implemented outside of foundry. Add an option to clone from or checkout a specific branch of a repository before replacing the git history during initialization.\r\n\r\nThis could be an additional arg which is optionally passed along when the --template argument is used, or a string which is appended to the repository name after some seperator. Github links have the following appended when linking to the root of the respective branch `https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery/tree/controlled-pool`\r\n\r\neg.\r\n`forge init --template Uniswap/v3-periphery -b controlled-pool`\r\nor\r\n`forge init --template Uniswap/v3-periphery#controlled-pool`\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nWhen a branch is provided, the command used can be updated to provide the branch name `git clone -b <branch> <remote_repo>`.\r\n\r\nBranch option needs to be added to this struct, or extracted from the `template` string in the next code snippet.\r\nhttps://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/45b100f002b744e537a2e73739a37b9bbda6c26f/crates/forge/bin/cmd/init.rs#L13-L37\r\n\r\nForwarded in the `clone` function call\r\nhttps://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/45b100f002b744e537a2e73739a37b9bbda6c26f/crates/forge/bin/cmd/init.rs#L54-L72\r\n\r\nAnd branch argument needs to be added to this command line call\r\nhttps://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/b536f518fb2b161c24d591f95e336194ec809c25/crates/cli/src/utils/mod.rs#L327-L341",
