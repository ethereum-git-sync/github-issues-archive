I'm posting screenshots from before and after the new release dropped. Prior to the new release, we never had issues with our code coverage action, but since the release, every coverage job has run for 6 hours and failed due to a timeout. \r\n\r\nHere's a screenshot showing our recent job statuses:\r\n<img width=\"1355\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2023-08-11 at 10 29 46 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/assets/34827329/08eb6ebc-8123-405f-a165-d72ba2fe0b7e\">\r\n\r\nI looked at the release history, and the latest release coincides with this. \r\n<img width=\"1290\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2023-08-11 at 10 18 39 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/assets/34827329/cd094f06-4a39-4e4c-b625-95163118eef2\">\r\n\r\nI downgraded to version `forge 0.2.0 (1044042 2023-08-10T13:04:25.942019017Z)`, and sure enough, the coverage job succeeds: \r\n\r\n<img width=\"1727\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2023-08-11 at 10 38 38 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/assets/34827329/6203de2f-396f-4244-88c0-b858daaf527c\">\r\n\r\nDowngrading is an easy fix for us in the meantime, but let me know if there's any other information that would be helpful when investigating this.
