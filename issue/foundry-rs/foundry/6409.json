I settled on using `forge-fmt`, since it emits a formatted string.\r\n\r\n### Problem\r\n\r\nI'm building the parse tree myself, and not by parsing but by translating a custom tree structure into a parse tree. This means that I don't have a source string (`src`) to pass to `Comments::new(comments, src)`.\r\n\r\n### Request\r\n\r\nMake `CommentWithMetadata` part of the public API  (and probably the whole `comments` module as well). This solves the issue because I can call `CommentWithMetadata::new()`, which doesn't have the source string requirement.\r\n\r\nI'm expecting this to be a trivial change, so I'm happy to do it myself.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_",
