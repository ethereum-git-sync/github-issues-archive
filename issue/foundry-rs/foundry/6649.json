  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nThis is a completely random idea, but would it be possible to make the project compilation multi-threaded? As of now there's 1 instance of `solc` running in 1 process, apparently compiling the project contract by contract. Would it be possible to compile each contract using a separate instance of `solc` in a separate process? This could be especially useful when using the new via-IR pipeline of Solidity, because it's rather slow, it takes many minutes to compile a larger project.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
