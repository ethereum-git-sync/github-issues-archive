    "body": "ah interesting issue here: i think the real issue is the address of the *test* contract, not the sender. See [here](https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools/tree/master/src/hevm#environment-variables). I tried on @exp-table's repo setting the sender variable to the above, and it still failed. \r\n\r\nThe hard part is that we support *multiple* test contracts. Which is the right thing to do for parallelizing tests, but means that we can't easily support without some compromises. One option is to not pre-deploy, and just deploy per test, and in `run_test` do a `set_code` into the specified address, which is what i imagine hevm does under the hood ",
