It seems they have no restrictions on the paths they can read from / write to, meaning someone can trick you into executing a malicious test suite that overwrites important system files.\r\n\r\nBy default, we should limit those cheatcodes to only working within the foundry project directory. Additionally, we should either:\r\n- add a config option to extend the allowed system paths, or\r\n- treat it similarly to ffi with a special `--io` flag that allows writing to/from anywhere on the system\r\n\r\ncc @shekhirin\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
