    "body": "@JasoonS I see. I looked at your reproduction repo now, missed that before, sorry. I was just assuming that you are refering to the `pnpm store` behavior and how it resolves packages via symlinks from `node_modules/.pnpm` in the workspace root. This you can solve with `public-hoist-pattern` which causes the packages to be hoisted to `node_modules/@openzeppelin/contracts/...` etc. instead of `node_modules/.pnpm/@openzeppelin+contracts@{version}/...`\r\n\r\nIt doesn't solve the problem you are facing though. To get around it, I'd suggest to put to `foundry.toml` in the root and configure it accordingly. I've opened a PR against your repro repo. I personally prefer to have to foundry.toml in the root so that you can conveniently use `forge` from there too just like you are used to with `pnpm run`, `pnpm turbo run` etc. but I can see how that might be personal preference.\r\n\r\nMaybe someone else has a better idea for how this might work. There are some monorepos out there using foundry already e.g. https://github.com/nomad-xyz/monorepo (yarn, granted, but still). That one also uses packages to split up the contracts for instance.",
