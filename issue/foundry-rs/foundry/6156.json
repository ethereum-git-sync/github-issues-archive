When running `forge coverage` alone, I get a \"stack too deep\" error; when running `forge coverage --ir-minimum`, it works, but it tells me I don't have coverage on an area of my tests that I clearly have coverage for (specifically, 3 lines of assembly code for loading data into memory). I know I have coverage for these 3 lines because if you remove some of the contract files and one of the test files, the normal `forge coverage` command works and tells me I have 100% coverage (but again tells me I don't have 100% coverage if I run `forge coverage --ir-minimum`). Any ideas on what to do here to get coverage to show 100%? Thanks! @mattsse @Evalir @spockP ",

But I don't have time to dig deeper into it. \r\nSuperficially,   `inline assembly blocks` are missing in the `SourceMap`. \r\nBut I am not sure:  \r\n\r\n- Is this a bug in ethers-rs ? \r\n- Or, is this a bug in solidity compiler (missing assembly blocks when using YUL with minimum optimization)?  <== last time, I thought it was more likely to be this one  \r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/5c137e8ac9165a070e36ff0eeb0382c2a2cf6637/crates/evm/coverage/src/anchors.rs#L11-L47\r\n\r\n",
