When running `forge coverage` alone, I get a \"stack too deep\" error; when running `forge coverage --ir-minimum`, it works, but it tells me I don't have coverage on an area of my tests that I clearly have coverage for (specifically, 3 lines of assembly code for loading data into memory). I know I have coverage for these 3 lines because if you remove some of the contract files and one of the test files, the normal `forge coverage` command works and tells me I have 100% coverage (but again tells me I don't have 100% coverage if I run `forge coverage --ir-minimum`). Any ideas on what to do here to get coverage to show 100%? Thanks! @mattsse @Evalir @spockP ",

It's not a silverbullet, and fixing this properly this will require a revisit to coverage. I'll close this as it's a duplicate of several other coverage issues which we're consolidating",
