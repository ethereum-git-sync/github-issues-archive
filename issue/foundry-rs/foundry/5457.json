After writing certain functions I ran forge coverage, it was showing the contract in the coverage reports. And after that I added another function like below:\r\n```solidity\r\nfunction testing() public {\r\n        \r\n}\r\n```\r\nAnd after adding this function which actually does nothing, so at this point when I ran forge coverage, the contract was gone from the coverage reports. So, if we write any empty function in the contract, foundry doesn't consider that contract in the coverage reports.",
