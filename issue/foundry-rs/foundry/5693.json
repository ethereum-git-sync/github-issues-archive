    "body": "Right I see @dcbuild3r:\r\n\r\n the call to `Hashing.hashCrossDomainMessageV1(...)` is special because it's a library call, and this library only has internal functions, therefore technically it's a `JUMP`, not a `CALL`. This means that `expectRevert` won't work since it expects reverts to happen in `CALL`s.\r\n\r\nOne thing you can do to fix this is to wrap the call to the library in an intermediate contract e.g `HashingMock` and make this call `external`, so it properly triggers a `CALL` opcodeâ€”lmk if that works!",
