But there's no corresponding `excludeSelectors` for `targetSelectors`. \r\n\r\nIt's probably a safer practice to start by excluding selectors from invariant test handler contracts to avoid forgetting a function or two for large handlers, so it would be useful to have support for `excludeSelectors`.",
