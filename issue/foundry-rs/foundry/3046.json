  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nI was using `forge script` for the first time, and was using the `--interactives`  option to input private keys from `anvil`. However, I was confused because it didn't appear pasting the keys from the anvil terminal session was working. I was then more confused when my keystrokes weren't appearing. \r\n\r\nFinally, I realized that `forge` was doing the usual unix thing 'don't show keystrokes for sensitive inputs.' It would be helpful to have text reminding the user that their inputs won't appear. \r\n\r\n```\r\njon@Ganyu:~/ethernaut/fallback$ forge script script/Fallback.s.sol:FallbackScript --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545 --broadcast --interactives 2\r\n[â †] Compiling...\r\nNo files changed, compilation skipped\r\nScript ran successfully.\r\n\r\n==========================\r\n\r\nEstimated total gas used for script: 464940\r\n\r\nEstimated amount required: 0.0023247 ETH\r\n\r\n==========================\r\n\r\n###\r\nFinding wallets for all the necessary addresses...\r\nKEYSTROKES/TEXT WILL NOT APPEAR\r\nInsert private key:\r\n\r\nInsert private key:\r\n\r\n##\r\nSending transactions [0 - 3].\r\n```\r\nAlternatively, change the inputs to `*` so that the user knows input was accepted.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
