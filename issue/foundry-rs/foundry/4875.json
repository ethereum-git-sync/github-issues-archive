    "body": "Considering that the `prank` cheat code allows impersonating the 0 address I think that the function signature should be something like this: \r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nfunction readPrank() external returns (bool, address, address)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first `bool` would indicate if a prank is active, the first `address` would be the new `msg.sender`, and the last one the new `tx.origin` used to set the prank. The boolean helps in removing the ambiguity of a prank being active in an edge case like calling `vm.prank(address(0), address(0))`.",
