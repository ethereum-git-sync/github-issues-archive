This includes about 100 contract deployments (including testnet mock contractsðŸ˜…) , the rest are function calls.\r\n\r\nFoundry runs through the simulations correctly:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104004836/171627953-4ea41071-5282-420a-88ed-712ede2265b1.png)\r\n\r\nand seemingly generates the transactions correctly:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104004836/171628265-f0427e29-4966-4ac7-a536-04ac25a0d7aa.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon starting broadcast, it logs that it sends 2-4 transactions, then errors with a list of transaction hashes that haven't been broadcasted.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104004836/171626430-5daf90c0-1d36-438e-9b4c-93ecf248a7b5.png)\r\n\r\nThe error message suggests to launch the same command with `--resume`.\r\nAfter doing so, a similar thing happens: 2-4 transactions are logged, then it errors.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104004836/171626753-9d85fdc1-abbc-4700-98bb-054169fcc71d.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nStrangely, more transactions **are** broadcasted (between 30 and ~200 per run, can't find the logic behind it). For example, see the deploy history of https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/txs?a=0x362e058e129e4b7c4c8b161d3c121661de1c9d07 . The above screenshots caused all transactions in blocks 10782135 to 10782157 (which are about 75 txes).\r\n\r\nAfter another new `--broadcast` command, I notice that some of the transactions which are \"sent but not logged\" fail. I assume that after the simulations, broadcasted txes aren't supposed to fail? This was a single `forge script --broadcast` command, which logged 4 transactions sent, but actually broadcasted ~200 transactions (without any `--resume`). These are the transactions between blocks 10782260 and 10782279 at https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/txs?a=0x362e058e129e4b7c4c8b161d3c121661de1c9d07 .\r\n\r\nRunning the `--broadcast` with `--slow` does seem to not cause it to timeout/..., although it isn't practical in our case to wait 400 blocks. I haven't ran it to completion yet, as it takes a bit too long to wait for it.\r\n\r\nNot sure if related, but Infura shows a lot of 'invalid' rpc calls:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104004836/171628647-2f38e65e-6e7c-46e1-b33a-5de9bf325bcb.png)\r\n\r\nOnly foundry scripting uses this endpoint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

At the time of the simulation, it works, however, at the broadcasted time the slippage makes it fail.  This can be exacerbated with a large set of transactions, where the transactions in the end of the queue might take longer to confirm. ",
