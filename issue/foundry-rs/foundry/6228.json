    "body": "@evalir This probably happens because the EVM version for fork in which script is running defaults to the EVM version contracts were compiled with. This is also valid for tests using forking environments. \r\n\r\nRight now it is impossible to do fork-testing of contract compiled with `paris` which is interacting with contracts compiled with `shanghai`, however, this should be possible\r\n\r\nMinimal repro for this looks like this:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\npragma solidity 0.8.20;\r\n\r\nimport {Test} from \"forge-std/Test.sol\";\r\n\r\ninterface ICreate2Deployer {\r\n    function computeAddress(bytes32 salt, bytes32 codeHash) external view returns (address);\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract TestEVMVersion is Test {\r\n    function test() public {\r\n        vm.createSelectFork(\"mainnet\");\r\n\r\n        ICreate2Deployer(0x35Da41c476fA5c6De066f20556069096A1F39364).computeAddress(bytes32(0), bytes32(0));\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning `forge test -vvv --evm-version paris` will fail with `EvmError: NotActivated` while `forge test -vvv --evm-version shanghai` will run successfully\r\n\r\nThis will get worse over the time as more contracts will be deployed with PUSH0, and projects still compiling with `paris` will get unexpected reverts duing fork testing.\r\n\r\nThis can be solved by automatically enabling shanghai for chains from [SHANGHAI_ENABLED_CHAINS](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/64b0e8fcf6db9f9482e34aacafc180ee2801c6b5/crates/forge/bin/cmd/script/mod.rs#L72) when running tests/scripts in forks, but it does not seem to be a best fix as this list would have to be updated every time some other chain enables shanghai support\r\n",

    "body": "Thanks for the clarification. So:\r\n- The existing `evm_version` should only affect solc configuration, not forge's execution environment.\r\n- When forge has an RPC URL (either during tests after selecting a fork, or during a script simulation), forge should use the correct execution environment of that fork.\r\n    - This should be a function of block number too, i.e. it accounts for when upgrades occurred.\r\n    - Consequence here is forge needs a mapping from chain ID to a list of forks and the block numbers at which they occurred. (For mainnet this is [here](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs#ethereum-protocol-releases))\r\n- If there is no RPC, the execution environment defaults to the `evm_version` selected.\r\n\r\nI think that should solve this issue, and avoid the need for an extra flag. How does that sound?",

    "body": "Yes, this sounds reasonable.\r\n\r\n> This should be a function of block number too, i.e. it accounts for when upgrades occurred.\r\n\r\nManaging such mapping seems like something out of foundry's scope and it will be hard to include all existing chains into it. \r\n\r\nIt might make sense to also add a `vm.createFork(string rpcUrl, EvmVersion evmVersion)` (`EvmVersion` is a enum), so that users deploying and testing contracts on chains supporting `shanghai` will be able to run tests successfuly, despite foundry not including this chain in the mapping for some reason",
