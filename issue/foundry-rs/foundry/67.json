    "body": "Could we not enable arbitrary signing via a simple local REST/JSON-RPC service? e.g. something like:\r\n\r\n```txt\r\n/sign-eth\r\n-> raw_unsigned_tx\r\n<- raw_signed_tx\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would for allow users to forward the `raw_unsigned_tx` to their favorite key management tool and then return the signed tx for validation & submission. My personal use case is forwarding the `raw_unsigned_tx` to fireblocks for signing, so we would need to allow for slow response times from the signer-service (we could go for a callback/polling approach instead of a single long-lasting REST call).",

    "body": "I think you're right, wallets will probably steer away from `eth_sign` due to the risk that a user signing a message will actually sign a valid ethereum tx. In this case the interface would look like:\r\n\r\n```txt\r\n/eth_signTransaction\r\n-> (legacy | eip-1559 | eip-2930)\r\n<- encoded_transaction\r\n\r\n/eth_accounts\r\n<- address[]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should allow users to fairly simply host a local proxy to forward the requests for signing to their various signing mechanisms. It would also return the accounts the signing mechanism has access to, this can be used by forge's wallet management logic.",

    "body": "> Would it do any harm to change the AwsSigner to own its KmsClient property?\r\n\r\nNo, it's fine. It's actually been on my to-clean list for a while. Initially wrote it this way to save resources when using several AWS keys in the same bin, but later dug in and figured out that `KmsClient` holds a `rusoto_core::Client` which wraps an `Arc` containing the actual request dispatch system. It won't add significant overhead to change to an owned `KmsClient`, as it's always cheap to clone",
