  "body": "I think we need a better construct for release channels. For nightly the setup in this PR works fine, but for stable it does not: the primary tag of the release is not a `stable-$SHA` tag, it's a `vx.y.z` tag. I looked at GitHub's API and there is no way for us to get all tags pointing to a specific commit unless we literally just iterate over all tags in the repository (worst case).\r\n\r\nAn alternative would be to have some file that just describes the latest release in each channel like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnightly: nightly-$SHA\r\nstable: v1.0.2\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that it is not a JSON file or something similar: it is easy to parse in both Node.js (for the action) and Bash (for `foundryup`). The question is where to host this file.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @onbjerg in https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/issues/492#issuecomment-1015227335_",
