I'd like to be able to specify a range of allowed solc versions and have `forge build` use the \"highest possible\" (within the pragma range) of the allowed solc versions for a given file.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nI'm currently debugging an issue where `auto_detect_solc` behaves somewhat non-deterministically and chooses different solc versions between CI and local runs. Locally, it uses `0.8.17` and in CI it uses `0.8.20` for some files.\r\n\r\nEDIT: I opened that as a seperate bug report: https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/5050",
