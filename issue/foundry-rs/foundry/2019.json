Then you will have these in your `remappings.txt` file\r\n\r\n```\r\nds-test/=lib/forge-std/lib/ds-test/src/\r\nerc4626-tests/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts/lib/erc4626-tests/\r\nforge-std/=lib/forge-std/src/\r\nopenzeppelin-contracts/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts/\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdd this `@openzeppelin/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts/` below.
