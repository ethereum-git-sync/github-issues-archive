Otherwise you get the following nondescript error:\r\n```\r\n  [0] 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000::fallback() \r\n    └─ ← ()\r\n```\r\n\r\nIdeally forge would automatically exclude contracts from its randomized sender generation. Barring that, users should be told to exclude the following built-in contracts, since they may be unaware of them:\r\n- 0x7109709ECfa91a80626fF3989D68f67F5b1DD12D (vm)\r\n- 0x4e59b44847b379578588920cA78FbF26c0B4956C (create2 factory, not documented in foundrybook afaict)\r\n\r\nArguably this is a feature request, but as far as I'm concerned it's unexpected/unexplained behavior so I'm submitting as a bug.",
