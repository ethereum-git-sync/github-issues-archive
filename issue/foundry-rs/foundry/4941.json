The workaround for this is simple, just use `127.0.0.1:8545` for all constants. But I worry new developers may not be able to figure this out. Maybe it's also not as modern / future-proof. FWIW [geth listens on both IPv4 and IPv6](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/19174).\r\n\r\n(I actually regret filing this as a bug, should be a feature request)\r\n\r\nAn amusing workaround for GitHub Actions specifically is\r\n```\r\n      - name: Remove IPv6 localhost\r\n        run: sudo sed -i 's/localhost ip6/ip6/' /etc/hosts\r\n```\r\n(it's funny because if you `cat /etc/hosts` you see a bunch of BTC mining websites)\r\n^if you do this then `localhost:8545` in Node.js on GitHub Actions works fine.",
