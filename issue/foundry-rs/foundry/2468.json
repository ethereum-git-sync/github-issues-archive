    "body": "@onbjerg I was looking into taking this as a good first contribution, but after taking a look it seems like the proposed solution is already implemented? I'm at `master 01b16238ff87dc7ca8ee3f5f13e389888c2a2ee4`. \r\n\r\nLooking into `cmd/forge/verify/etherscan.rs` we can see that the message `- Verification is still pending...` is already inside a loop:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        retry\r\n            .run_async(|| {\r\n                async {\r\n                    let resp = etherscan\r\n                        .check_contract_verification_status(args.id.clone())\r\n                        .await\r\n                        .wrap_err(\"Failed to request verification status\")?;\r\n\r\n                   ...\r\n\r\n                    if resp.result == \"Pending in queue\" {\r\n                        return Err(eyre!(\"Verification is still pending...\",));\r\n                    }\r\n\r\n                  ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe loop is controlled by the `args.watch` and `args.retry` parameters, which I think is reasonable.
