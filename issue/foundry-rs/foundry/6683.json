However, Foundry consistently fails to shrink down to that one.\r\n\r\nI restarted the run 10 times and took note of how many txs it was able to shrink to:\r\n\r\n1. 6\r\n2. 12\r\n3. 3\r\n4. 10\r\n5. 15\r\n6. 12\r\n7. 13\r\n8. 10\r\n9. 12\r\n10. 1\r\n\r\n\r\nI also tried doubling the `shrink_run_limit` parameter up to `524288`, but it made no difference, neither in the \"performance\" of the shrinking algorithm nor in the time to shrink. This is unexpected. I'd like to crank the \"shrinking\" limit up to infinity and be able to get to \"the\" smallest possible.",
