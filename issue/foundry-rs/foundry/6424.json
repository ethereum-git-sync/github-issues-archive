  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\n`forge verify-contract` does not attempt to re-verify an already-verified contract as this is an expensive operation. However there are some cases in which this behavior is desired e.g. to re-verify a partially-verified contract with source code that matches the metadata hash. I suggest adding a flag `--ignore-already-verified` to the verifier command-line arguments to skip the contract already verified check.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
