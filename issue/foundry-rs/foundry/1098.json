    "body": "Ok, the cause seems to be that the `staticcall` in `console.log` is where the prank occurs, i.e. it doesn't get ignored like calls to the cheatcode address do. The fact that calls seem to came from the zero address is unrelatedâ€”that's an artifact of the params passed by the fuzzer which I didn't realize when saving off the calldata.\r\n\r\nThe fix then is to treat [`HARDHAT_CONSOLE_ADDRESS `](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/blob/33f1df0ec7e17799342ee78e5e1ffb07e9ea086d/evm/src/executor/abi.rs#L48-L54) the same as [`CHEATCODE_ADDRESS `](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/blob/33f1df0ec7e17799342ee78e5e1ffb07e9ea086d/evm/src/executor/abi.rs#L5-L11) and ignore it for the context of cheatcodes\r\n\r\n",
