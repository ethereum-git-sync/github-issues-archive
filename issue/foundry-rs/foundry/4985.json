This is fast, which only took me ~1 second in the demo repo.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/assets/131971450/db4ce56c-7c7c-4b38-912e-e8cb319df449)\r\n\r\nBut using the other approach, which is to use the creationCode of two contracts, and then create a contract using `create` opcode in assembly, is extremely slow, took me ~26 seconds to complete. \r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/assets/131971450/55bee600-7c14-49ac-b4fd-12fcba2da10c)\r\n\r\nSo, I'm confused now, why is it so slow to create a contract?\r\n",
