I'm Lucas, a core contributor to the Drips project (https://www.drips.network/). I help recipients of donations through their learning and onboarding process.\r\n\r\n[OpenZeppelin](https://www.openzeppelin.com/) has been using https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry. It's one of their most critical dependencies! You are already getting funded by two projects (OpenZ and us, Drips).\r\n\r\nOpenZeppelin core contributors appreciate your work and want to ensure you are all well-funded to keep doing it. For that reason, they have decided to donate some funds to your project throughÂ [Drips](https://www.drips.network/).\r\n\r\nWho can I talk to about it?\r\n\r\ncc: @gakonst \r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nN/a",
