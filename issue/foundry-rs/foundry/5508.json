User runs foundryup -C 3b1129b5bc43ba22a9bcf4e4323c5a9df0023140\r\n2. Foundryup git checkout foundry repo at specified commit\r\n3. Foundryup then tries to cargo install foundry\r\n4. rustc linker fails because of a nightly bug\r\n5. User reconfigures rust environment to use stable\r\n6. Users runs foundryup -C 3b1129b5bc43ba22a9bcf4e4323c5a9df0023140\r\n7. Foundryup git checkout fails because there are local changes in the foundryup repo directory\r\n\r\nI am able to fix this by manually reverting the changes introduced by step 2; `cd $HOME/.foundry/foundry-rs/foundry && git reset --hard`. It'll be nicer if foundryup were to do this automatically when installing a specific commit.",
