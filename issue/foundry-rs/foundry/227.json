    "body": "Looking at how to extend the interface to handle the proposed changes. Some thoughts:\r\n\r\nRust regexes don't have negative lookaheads, so there's no (easy?) way to use part of a name as an inverse match, which means inverse filters have to be explicit.\r\n\r\nAlso, filtering both contract names and test fn names with the same pattern seems problematic, so `--match` should likely be split into a set of new flags.\r\n\r\nFrom the Rust eco, `cargo test` has `--bin`, `--test` flags, etc. They don't really match up to what's being done here (no patterns, no inverse), but I guess it can be argued that a set of flags is Rusty.\r\n\r\nMochaJS, which is arguably the most used framework in the most used language, uses sth like `--filter` along with `--inverse`, e.g., `--filter foo --inverse` to exclude `foo` tests. Personally I don't like it.\r\n\r\nProbably the way to go is:\r\n\r\n`--match-test`\r\n`--match-contract`\r\n\r\nCould then alias and deprecate `--match` to `--match-test` so there are no breaking changes. \r\n\r\nBut filters need to be explicitly negated, so probably:\r\n\r\n`--match-test`\r\n`--no-match-test`\r\n`--match-contract`\r\n`--no-match-contract`\r\n\r\nOr\r\n\r\n`--include-test`\r\n`--exclude-test`\r\n`--include-contract`\r\n`--exclude-contract`\r\n\r\nThe impl would effectively AND these together so using `--include-contract Foo --exclude-contract FooBaz --include-test bar` would run the `bar` fns for `Foo` but not `FooBaz`. \r\n\r\nThe only alternative I can think of to keep a single `--match` flag would be to have some sort of custom annotated regex as input, but I can't imagine a scenario where that wouldn't be awful. \r\n\r\nI'm a little *cough* rusty after an extended break so I might be overlooking sth obvious here. Feedback / input is appreciated.",
