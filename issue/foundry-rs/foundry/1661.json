If I accidentally call them in the order: `node` `enable` `deploy` the entire anvil node breaks and does not accept more requests. Actually, the deploy script does not even work.\r\n\r\nOf course, I should not be able to call `enable` on the contract before it is deployed, but still it should not break the node entirely.\r\n\r\nIt seems that something in anvil gets hung up on the reverting TX `enable`. In the logs I don't even see a reverting TX, I just see\r\n```\r\neth_sendRawTransaction\r\n```\r\nBut of course no output that the tx was successful or unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nTrying to deploy then afterwards, nothing shows up in the anvil logs. They just stop but the `anvil` process is still running and `forge create` just hangs.",

    "body": "I could reproduce this after connecting with metamask\r\n\r\nrun ./node.sh and immediately open MM\r\n\r\nthen the first output (above anvil logs) is\r\n\r\n```console\r\nError:\r\n   0: error sending request for url (http://localhost:8545/): error trying to connect: tcp connect error: Connection refused (os error 61)\r\n   1: error trying to connect: tcp connect error: Connection refused (os error 61)\r\n   2: tcp connect error: Connection refused (os error 61)\r\n   3: Connection refused (os error 61)\r\n\r\nLocation:\r\n   /Users/runner/work/foundry/foundry/cast/src/lib.rs:424\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich is a cast error, turning anvil logging on (RUST_LOG=backend,rpc) shows that cast fires while the fork state is still being initialized\r\n\r\nso what could happen here is that the 5 secs is too short and MM perhaps interferes with the boot process as well.\r\n\r\nbumping the sleep timeout seems to resolve the issue.\r\n\r\nor perhaps better, reading from stdout and waiting for Listening.\r\n\r\nbut this makes me think that we need to prioritize getting the server up and running, even before everything is ready so we're able to receive requests instantly\r\n",
