    "body": "Why should it not be used? The difficulty opcode `0x44` is still in use after EIP4399 and MUST return `mixHash`. The EIP just argues for a repurposing + rename of the opcode, not a deprecation. The deprecation only relates to the field in the block header as far as I have understood. Also you can see from the goerli transaction that it clearly still works there.\r\nI'm sorry, my issue was probably a bit misleading because I wrote that the correct `difficulty` needs to be fetched form the node provider - this should of course be `mixHash`.",
