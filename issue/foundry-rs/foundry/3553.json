Not super familiar with rust so I can't pinpoint exactly what's going on but this is what I've found.\r\n\r\nI had a friend using commit `1d9a34e` deploy and verify a multipart contract and it resulted in a good example. Same commit on my machine resulted in a bad example for the same contract.\r\n\r\nLooking at the build info (JSON standard input), it looks like the sources are ordered opposite. The build info was retrieved using `forge build --build-info`.\r\n\r\nIt feels crazy but is there machine dependent ordering of the source list in the JSON standard input? Block explorers take the list supplied as is and that determines the order of the files shown.\r\n\r\nI'll keep looking into this but hopefully this sparks some inspiration and hopefully we can close out this issue. Perhaps @rkrasiuk this helps 🤞 ",
