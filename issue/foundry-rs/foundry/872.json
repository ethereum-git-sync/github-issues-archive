There's the excellent `foundry-toolchain` GH action, which makes it a breeze. Unfortunately because it depends on the binaries from releases in this repo, it needs to be reconfigured every 3 days to migrate to the new nightly before the previous one is purged. Alternatively it can always fetch the newest nightly, but that's not acceptable for the CI, it MUST work consistently and it MUST NEVER break because of a 3rd party release. `foundry-toolchain` already supports setting specific nightly releases.\r\n\r\nAn alternative would be to host a pinned binary myself, but that requires forking `foundry-toolchain` and ideally also `foundryup` to use it, which less than ideal.",

OTOH it hurts adoption, e.g. I'd love to start battering Foundry daily in our project but I can't because that would require destabilizing the CI. Maybe it's not visible from the inside but Foundry is in a really good shape, it's no longer an experiment, it has become a truly viable toolchain good enough to depend on in everyday work. Maybe it's time to acknowledge its readiness and let people start fully utilizing it?",
