You should be able to reproduce the two by simply running `forge test`\r\n\r\nFirst Bug (Main Branch):\r\nFails setup with reason contract does not exist. \r\nBug: \r\n1. Block was rolled back earlier in the setup file Line 53\r\n2. Token contract deployed in line 55\r\n3.  lLine 85, the fork is rolled forwards 1 Block and attempts to access a function in token contract \r\nError: Contract not found. But surely it should be cause it was deployed in an earlier block so should still be visible.\r\n\r\nSecond Bug (fail1 branch):\r\nFails with application panic mentioned previously. `Option::unwrap() on a none value`\r\nBug: \r\n1. Block was rolled back earlier in the setup file Line 53\r\n2. This occurs when placing vm.rollFork() inside a test function Line 93 \r\nPanic error occurs\r\n\r\nLet me know if you can reproduce these",
