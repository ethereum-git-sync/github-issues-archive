Since they are not defined within an interface or contract but they are within a solidity file, there should be a singular markdown file exported for each solidity file which includes all of its free functions, constants and custom errors.\r\n\r\nFree constants are already exported to a dedicated \"constants\" file with the solidity file name, so this should just be extended to include all free functions and variables.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
