I fork a specific block, set the block time to be a certain interval\r\n1. Launch opensea.io and sign in with one of my wallets that has an NFT\r\n1. List the item and in the process, calling setApprovalForAll on the NFT\r\n1. Notice that the transaction never goes through and anvil just freezes up (No blocks are getting produced anymore every 5s, it just seems to completely freeze and hang)\r\n\r\n",

Here is a Link from OpenSea(buy an NFT): https://etherscan.io/tx/0x4b23df29d89e5ddae74aff791fc38f2227feb952420c212f5987590f4db3c2b1\r\nThe tx is committed at block: [14983339](https://etherscan.io/block/14983339)\r\n\r\nYou can fork the mainnet just before this block(like: 14983338), and copy the call-data from the tx, then \r\nconstructs a new tx with the copied calldata.  Then, you'll see the result.\r\n\r\nHope this'll help you.\r\n",

And I update to use fork mode (under same domain), which chain id is `5` now. And I forgot to update the chain id setting on MetaMask's custom network. When it sends request to anvil with expecting chain id `33137`, anvil can't fetch some data and causes `Failed to get account ...` then crash.\r\n\r\nNot sure how detail things work, but it looks like this.",
