Consider reporting it at https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry\r\n\r\nBacktrace omitted. Run with RUST_BACKTRACE=1 environment variable to display it.\r\nRun with RUST_BACKTRACE=full to include source snippets.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis can be reproduced using the Docker container: `docker run --rm -it ghcr.io/foundry-rs/foundry:nightly 'FOUNDRY_FUZZ_RUNS=-1 forge test'`\r\n\r\nThe error is straightforward (using `-1` in `fuzz_runs` is not supported), but I find it strange to report this as a panic instead of only displaying the first line and exiting with an error. By looking at the code, it seems that `Config::from_provider(figment)` should be replaced by `Config::try_from(figment)` in https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/f020b250d788255d49871a0c7a5e39d60fa55236/cli/src/cmd/utils.rs#L246-L249\r\n\r\nBy the way, I choose to report this issue because the error message said \"This is a bug. Consider reporting it at https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry\". Feel free to close it as \"won't fix\" if this behavior looks right to you.",
