  "body": "### Component\n\nOther (please describe)\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nI found an issue when writing to a file using `vm.writeFile()` where the script breaks if the file is being written into a directory that does not yet exist. `vm.writeFile()` is only able to write to existing directories, and I have not seen functionality to create a directory directly from a script. This would be helpful, for example, if I want to write some of the output from `script/Deploy.s.sol` into my own `script/output/{chainName}/Deploy.json` file after broadcasting instead of needing to work with the whole `Broadcast.json`.\r\n\r\nSince I'm working with the script on multiple chains, I don't always have the {chainName} directory created, and this feature would be much appreciated.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

    "body": "Is the feature request here to have `vm.writeFile` automatically create the directory if it doesn't exist, or to add a `vm.mkdir` cheat to create directories? Both seem reasonable to me, though just updating `writeLine` seems sufficient and would be my preferenceâ€”it keeps the cheat interface smaller/simpler and accomplishes the same goal",
