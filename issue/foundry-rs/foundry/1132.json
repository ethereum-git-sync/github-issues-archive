This scales better for large projects and is a little more explicit about where tests are\r\n- [ ] Minimize `foundry.toml` by only including things users are more likely to change. For example, most users don't need to worry about remappings so those can be removed (I think they may have been already?). Most people don't change the folder structure so that can probably be removed too. Include a `default` and `ci` profile that specify e.g. 100 and 10,000 runs respectively\r\n- [ ] Include a strong default github workflow with multiple jobs\r\n    1. [ ] Runs `FOUNDRY_PROFILE=ci forge test`\r\n    2. [ ] Sweeps over pragmas with the default profile. Dependent on https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/issues/1131\r\n    3. [x] Verifies all non-test contracts are below the size limit. Dependent on https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/issues/1133\r\n- [x] The default pragma is `0.8.10`. This should be bumped and loosened to `^0.8.13`\r\n\r\nI can see an argument against (3) since not everyone uses github. But it's very rare I come across gitlab or bitbucket repos, and it's easy to remove the workflow, so I think this tradeoff is worth it\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_",
