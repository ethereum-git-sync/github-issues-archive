It seems your issue lies on how `foundryup` is getting added to your system, which might be due to your terminal config, zsh related. You also seem to have multiple `forge`/`anvil`/cast`/`chisel` PATHs exported, see the warning messages you have.\r\n\r\nI'm closing this because this is actually user config error—let's take this to the telegram chat so we can help you further.
