But the `.env` file may not be in the cwd! It may be located in the root directory of the current git repository.\r\n\r\n## Example:\r\n```\r\n.\r\n|- .env\r\n|- .git\r\n|- dir\r\n   |- script.js # invokes forge script\r\n```\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n./dir$ script.js # .env is one level above\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere, looking one level above would load the current repo's `.env` file.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
