  "body": "### Component\n\nFoundryup\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nFor anyone who's used the GitHub CLI, the `gh pr checkout <prNumber>` is _extremely_ helpful. It lets you seamlessly check out a branch from any PR, even when the branch on that PR is from a fork. I'd love a similar feature for foundryup so you can do something like `foundryup -pr 1048`.\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/issues/1045, @onbjerg mentioned that this should ignore the repo flag, though ideally I think we can allow this as optional, similar to how [`gh pr checkout`](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_pr_checkout) behaves\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
