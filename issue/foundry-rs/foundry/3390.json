  "body": "### Component\r\n\r\nForge, Cast\r\n\r\n### Describe the feature you would like\r\n\r\n`forge test`, `forge script`, and `cast run` all produce traces. Depending on your use case, there are various display modes that may be the most helpful:\r\n\r\n1. Hiding addresses if you have a label vs. showing label + addr vs. always showing addr (ref https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/3381)\r\n2. Truncated address like `0x123...def` vs full addresses (this has come up in an issue before, can't find it now though)\r\n3. Overall tx state diffs vs. no state diffs (ref https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/2846)\r\n4. Call-level state diffs within the trace (arguably would get cluttered, but still is useful)\r\n5. Showing only logs instead of a full trace\r\n6. Showing vs. hiding function parameter names\r\n7. Showing vs. hiding decoded SSTOREs and SLOADs in a call, similar to https://tx.eth.samczsun.com/#txhash=0x3443cd8f0c722fa9d83e12033f29eb590b177804ae625f2072625dfb79b329c2\r\n8. Hide/modify certain calls in the traces, for example file/json reading/writing large files can quickly clutter logs. Perhaps a flag that takes an array of VM function names/signatures and replaces them with some other value\r\n\r\nI think we should support these various options in two ways:\r\n- A new `[trace]` section in the config file (more useful for forge)\r\n- CLI flags (more useful for cast)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_",
