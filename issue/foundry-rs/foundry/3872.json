But verification with `forge script` fails silently.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n1. Run a blacksmith and an anvil server\r\n2. `forge init test_verify_fail && cd test_verify_fail`\r\n3. Modify `CounterScript` to deploy the `Counter` contract\r\n4. `forge script CounterScript --verify --unlocked --sender 0xf39fd6e51aad88f6f4ce6ab8827279cfffb92266 --rpc-url http://localhost:8545 --verifier-url http://localhost:3000/api/verify --etherscan-api-key blacksmith --broadcast`\r\n5. The tx is broadcast but no verification occurs.\r\n\r\nNote that the following does verify correctly: `forge create src/Counter.sol:Counter --verify --unlocked --from 0xf39fd6e51aad88f6f4ce6ab8827279cfffb92266 --rpc-url http://localhost:8545 --verifier-url http://localhost:3000/api/verify --etherscan-api-key blacksmith`",

    "body": "To provide some additional context here–[blacksmith](https://github.com/blacksmith-eth/blacksmith) relies on the `--verifier-url` flag of `forge create` in order to provide a custom route (e.g. `http://localhost:3000/api/verify`) that accepts the contract source code, compiles it, and stores the ABI (which is used to render contract inputs in the application).\r\n\r\nAt a cursory glance of the `forge script` code, it seems that `clap` accepts all of the `VerifierArgs` defined in `cli/src/cmd/forge/verify/mod.rs`, but the `verifier_url` doesn't seem to be used by `forge script` like it is when verifying with `forge create`.\r\n\r\nI suspect that this isn't just an issue with Blacksmith, but that `forge script` doesn't fully support custom verifier urls.\r\n\r\nAlso, I believe the label here should be updated to `Cmd-forge-script`, and `Cmd-forge-create` should be removed.",
