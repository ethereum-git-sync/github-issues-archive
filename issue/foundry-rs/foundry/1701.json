  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nRight now without `--overwrite` passed `forge bind` generates and checks the bindings for consistency, i.e. if they require to be updated. In a monorepo structure like http://github.com/gakonst/foundry-rust-template you are usually using the `bindings` crate in your app, and ethers version should be consistent between the two for being able to use the `bindings` crate in the `app`. Currently, `bindings` are generated with `default-features = false` and git master branch. If the user is using different version of ethers or ones with additional features like `ws`, `ipc`, `rustls`, etc. the `ethers_providers` versions mismatch and you are not able to use the `bindings` crate in the app anymore.\r\n\r\nAbility to skip `Cargo.toml` from consistency checks would allow users to manage the ethers version themselves and as suitable to them while also not giving up on consistency checks.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
