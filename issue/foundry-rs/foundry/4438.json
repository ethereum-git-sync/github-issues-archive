  "body": "### Component\r\n\r\nForge\r\n\r\n### Describe the feature you would like\r\n\r\nThis issue tracks invariant-testing specific improvements. General fuzzer improvements are in #4433. \r\n\r\nItems are roughly ordered by my opinion of priority, both at the header-level and the bullet-level. I say \"roughly ordered\" because some items are much bigger scope than others so having a strict ordering doesn't make much sense.\r\n\r\n## High Priority\r\n\r\nThese would all give a big improvement to invariant testing UX and performance, and should not be too hard to implement\r\n\r\n### UX/Features\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/3005\r\n- https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/4718\r\n- https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/2985\r\n- https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/2986 \r\n- https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/4352\r\n\r\n### Bugs\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/2962\r\n- https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/4178\r\n- https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/4287\r\n- https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/4163\r\n- https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/4381\r\n- https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/4245\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/4162 — The terms we use are misleading so this worth clarifying / maybe renaming things a bit \r\n\r\n## Medium Priority\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/4951\r\n- https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/585\r\n- https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/4190 \r\n- https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/1578 — More thought is needed around how to detect reentrancy issues, so this one is likely more work than all of the above, but it could be very useful. Related is https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/4245\r\n\r\n## Low Priority\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/4834\r\n- https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/4300 — Listed as low because you can replicate this by calling functions at the end of each test\r\n- https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/3452 — Needs more thought, but could be powerful\r\n- https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/3607 — An `invariantCallSummary` test and similar approaches are decent workarounds, though this still would be valuable\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_",
