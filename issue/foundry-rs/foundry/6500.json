However, the Logs (when using `console.log()`) only show the addresses of e.g. tokens. It would be great if addresses in Logs would also be replaced by labels like it is done in stack traces. \n\n### Additional context\n\n<img width=\"1235\" alt=\"logExample\" src=\"https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/assets/85028981/c03f4c55-d34c-46e0-96d1-1269f8d2060c\">\r\n",
