  "body": "### Component\r\n\r\nForge\r\n\r\n### Describe the feature you would like\r\n\r\nAggregating a list of new cheatcodes and improvements to existing cheatcodes that have been requested in other issues:\r\n\r\n- [ ] 1. `vm.not` cheat code. When called immediately before (or after?) `expectEmit` or `expectCall` it modifies that cheat code so the event/call is expected not to be present. Alternatively, `expectNoEmit` or `expectNoCall` would work. https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/issues/509\r\n- [ ] 2. Allow `expectEmit` to be declared _after_ the call emitting the event, instead of the current workflow which requires it to be declared before. If we have to choose only allowing it to be declared before or after, my preference would be after, because it allows you to read updated state from the call and use those values as the event args, as explained  in https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/issues/512#issuecomment-1016577046\r\n- [ ] 3. Update `mockCall`, `expectCall`, and `expectRevert` (and `expectEmit`?) to work for JUMPs (currently they only work for calls). This has been discussed in #432 and #864\r\n- [ ] 4. When an `expectEmit` matcher fails, specify which topics or data did not match: https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/issues/592\r\n- [x] 5. Some `expectEmit` issues described in https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/issues/760\r\n- [ ] 6. Still needs more discussion to determine if cheatcodes is the optimal approach, but I think cheatcodes for setting fuzzer params on a per-contract or per-test basis would be very useful: https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/issues/744\r\n- [x] 7. Nonce cheatcodes: https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/issues/554\r\n- [x] 8. `captureLogs` and `getLogs` cheatcodes (similar to `records` and `accesses`) to support https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/issues/543\r\n- [x] 9. `vm.roll` should update how RPC queries behave when forking: https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/issues/939\r\n- [ ] 10. `expectEmit` error message: https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/issues/908\r\n- [x] 11. `expectRevert` with no bytes to assert that any revert should happen: https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/issues/885\r\n- [ ] 12. Needs discussion/decision, but requiring `expectEmit`/`expectCall` to only check the next call, and not all subsequent calls: https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/1745\r\n- [ ] 13. Some `expect*` edge cases / bugs? https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/3723#issuecomment-1323696016\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_",
