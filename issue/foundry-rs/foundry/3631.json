This would probably need to be a config flag as opposed to a cheatcode just based on the fuzzer architecture.\r\n\r\nHere's a list of addresses that would need to be ignored:\r\n\r\n- The test contract's address\r\n- Precompile addresses ([ref](https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-std/blob/master/src/StdCheats.sol#L286-L316))\r\n- VM Address: `0x7109709ECfa91a80626fF3989D68f67F5b1DD12D` ([ref](https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools/blob/master/src/hevm/README.md#cheat-codes))\r\n- Console address: `0x000000000000000000636F6e736F6c652e6c6f67` ([ref](https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-std/blob/5bafa16b4a6aa67c503d96294be846a22a6f6efb/src/console2.sol#L10))\r\n- Create2Deployer `0x4e59b44847b379578588920cA78FbF26c0B4956C` ([ref](https://github.com/pcaversaccio/create2deployer))\n\n### Additional context\n\nhttps://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/3625",
