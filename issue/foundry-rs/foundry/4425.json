I tried deleting the folder hello_foundry and starting over. However, now I am stuck on forge install and the bug is \"The target directory is a part of or on its own an already initialized git repository\". Does anyone have any ideas on how I can completely wipe what I did before and restart the tutorial or just how to fix this issue? Thanks",
