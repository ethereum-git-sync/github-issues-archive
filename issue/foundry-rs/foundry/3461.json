I haven't seen a single formatter treating the line length as a guideline, the maximum line length is always respected. The similar issue https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/3033 was treated as a bug and fixed in https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/pull/3082. You can see a number of references to that issue, because people expect the formatter to keep the line length and doing otherwise can break other tools.\r\n\r\nI can't demand a fix, but please, at least reopen the issue, because it's an actual bug and only if it's flagged as such it has a chance of ever being fixed.",
