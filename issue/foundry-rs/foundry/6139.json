Very weird behaviour.\r\n\r\nSee the debugging info I added there:\r\n\r\n```md\r\nIf I replace hex\"01\" with abi.encode(hex\"01\") it will run successfully (if I use abi.encodePacked instead it will revert; the function deployCreate uses bytes as input for the argument, which is the init code). So two questions @Evalir: why is this throwing only if I use the ci profile and why is there an issue with the hex/abi.encodePacked instruction?\r\n```",
