  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nIt would be convenient to have an option to specify `--guess-constructor-args` flag on `forge verify-contract` command which will try to find constructor arguments for contract without need to explicitly provide them when running the command.\r\n\r\nIt can be done in 3 steps:\r\n1. Fetch contract deployment transaction with Etherscan API: https://docs.etherscan.io/api-endpoints/contracts#get-contract-creator-and-creation-tx-hash\r\n2. Fetch contract creation code from transaction\r\n3. Use contract ABI to calculate length of abi-encoded constructor arguments and take a suffix of creation code with this length.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting part is fetching the creation code (step 2). For contracts deployed by EOAs it is pretty simple (we can just take `tx.data` field). But for contracts deployed with CREATE/CREATE2 it would require tracing of transaction execution which takes time and requires endpoint with archive data which is not available to everyone.\r\n\r\nIt might also make sense to add a CLI command `forge get-constructor-args <CONTRACT> <CREATION_CODE>` which will basically perform a step 3 above. This might be useful because users may have init code from broadcast artifacts or Etherscan UI\r\n\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
