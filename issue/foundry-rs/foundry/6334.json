  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nIt would be convenient to have an option to specify `--guess-constructor-args` flag on `forge verify-contract` command which will try to find constructor arguments for contract without need to explicitly provide them when running the command.\r\n\r\nIt can be done in 3 steps:\r\n1. Fetch contract deployment transaction with Etherscan API: https://docs.etherscan.io/api-endpoints/contracts#get-contract-creator-and-creation-tx-hash\r\n2. Fetch contract creation code from transaction\r\n3. Use contract ABI to calculate length of abi-encoded constructor arguments and take a suffix of creation code with this length.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting part is fetching the creation code (step 2). For contracts deployed by EOAs it is pretty simple (we can just take `tx.data` field). But for contracts deployed with CREATE/CREATE2 it would require tracing of transaction execution which takes time and requires endpoint with archive data which is not available to everyone.\r\n\r\nIt might also make sense to add a CLI command `forge get-constructor-args <CONTRACT> <CREATION_CODE>` which will basically perform a step 3 above. This might be useful because users may have init code from broadcast artifacts or Etherscan UI\r\n\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

It seems that it is not possible to get rpc endpoint from configuration by chain_id without iterating over each of endpoints and comparing eth_chainId response.\r\n\r\nI can see 2 ways to solve this:\r\n1. Force users to specify `--rpc-url` when `--guess-constructor-args` is used.\r\n2. Add logic to query [Etherscan geth proxy](https://docs.etherscan.io/api-endpoints/geth-parity-proxy#eth_gettransactionbyhash) using the same endpoint and API key\r\n\r\nOption 1 messes up UX a little bit. But it might be a good thing because it will be clear that there is some additional RPC stuff going on under the hood.\r\n\r\nOption 2 is better for UX but hard to implement in a clean way because Etherscan Geth proxy doesn't work as a standard RPC-endpoint, you have to specify method as a query parameter, so we can't just reuse the same logic as for usual RPC-endpoints. Also, Etherscan doesn't support archive eth_getStorageAt queries, so verification of contracts created by contracts won't work.\r\n\r\nDo you see any other options and what do you think about those?",
