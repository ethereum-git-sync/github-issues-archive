  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nThis item is perhaps a minor defect, or a small improvement that may save someone else some confusion. \r\n\r\nI had a contract with imports like:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nimport \"@openzeppelin/contracts@3.4.0/...\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nI ran\r\n```bash\r\nforge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts@3.4.0 \r\n```\r\n\r\nThis ran and (seemingly) worked. The contract wouldn't build due to version contracts.\r\n\r\nAfter some confusion, I read the `/lib/openzeppelin-contracts/package.json` which showed the version as `4.5.0` which is the current **master** version.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"openzeppelin-solidity\",\r\n  \"description\": \"Secure Smart Contract library for Solidity\",\r\n  \"version\": \"4.5.0\",\r\n   ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nI went to github and found the tag which was [**v**3.4.0.](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/releases/tag/v3.4.0) (note the \"v\" that was absent in the original install tag version)\r\n\r\nI tried an intentionally errant tag (note the \"_asdf_\" at the end) and again got the master `4.5.0` version. \r\n ```bash\r\nforge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts@v3.4.0asdf \r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter successfully removing the errant version the correct @tag installed successfully. The version matched in the package.json, and all contracts built:\r\n\r\n ```bash\r\nforge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts@v3.4.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nIMO either fail to install or warn that the requested tag was not installed but a fallback version.\r\n\r\n***\r\n#### `forge remove` left gitmodule issues that required post-hoc cleanup and manual handling\r\n\r\nAfter running `forge remove OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts`, there was an error when trying to `install` again (I didn't record this exact error). The error message essentially said there was already a module `OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts`.\r\n\r\nI _basically_ followed this top answer suggested [here on SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1260748/how-do-i-remove-a-submodule). I repeated this a few times while trying/removing, etc. \r\n\r\nThe remove process could also clean up the git modules (maybe?!). That seems a bit kludgy I realise, but I'm not sure what else to recommend.\r\n\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
