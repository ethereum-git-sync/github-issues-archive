For ex: `src/admin, src/analysis, src/some_project, src/blockchain_proj`, also `touch .gitmodules` so there's one at the top level \r\n<img width=\"397\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5566843/209503595-14d3544f-92e6-4e23-b374-406a90eca28d.png\">\r\n\r\n- `blockchain_proj` needs to write `.sol`, so will use foundry. Go make the backend there w/ `cd src/blockchain_proj && foundry init backend_contract_proj1`\r\n\r\n- `cd backend_contract_proj1`, Run `forge install openzeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts --no-commit`\r\n\r\nThis will add new code into my top-level `.gitmodules`, instead of creating a `src/blockchain_proj/backend_contract_proj1/.gitmodules`, which is diff from how npm, pip/poetry, etc all do it. They will detect the top-level \"for the project\" (i.e. where foundry.tml lives @ `src/blockchain_proj/backend_contract_proj1/foundry.toml`) and modify any .git files there, instead of always going all the way up to the top of the root.\r\n\r\nWhat's the best way to get `forge install` to stop doing this? I tried creating a `src/blockchain_proj/backend_contract_proj1/.gitmodules` but everytime I install it still installs into my top-level `.gitmodules` and I have to copy paste it over",
