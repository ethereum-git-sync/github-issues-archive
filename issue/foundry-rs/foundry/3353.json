  "body": "I recently updated to the most recent forge version, and am observing the below.\r\n\r\n### Component\r\n\r\nForge\r\n\r\n### Have you ensured that all of these are up to date?\r\n\r\n- [X] Foundry\r\n- [X] Foundryup\r\n\r\n### What version of Foundry are you on?\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### What command(s) is the bug in?\r\n\r\nforge 0.2.0\r\n\r\n### Operating System\r\n\r\nmacOS (Intel)\r\n\r\n### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nI used to run forge script and it would run very fast, within 3-4 seconds (max). However, now running the same exact contracts take a lot longer when running with same configuration.\r\n\r\nIt gets hung on\r\n```\r\nTraces:\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut will eventually finish.\r\n\r\nWhy does this take so much longer now compared to older versions. I haven't updated my version in about 6 months until today. After updating today, it takes several minutes (```real\t3m22.765s```) to run the same exact scripts.\r\n\r\nTest command:\r\n```\r\nforge script --tc <contractname> --sig \"testfunc()\" --fork-url <RPC> --ffi ./script/<contract>.s.sol --chain-id 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nCould this have to do with solidity versions? or the amount of dependencies?\r\n\r\nIf I make a blank script file, it runs fast, but why would my dependencies all of a sudden start making scripts take longer to run compared to older forge versions?\r\n\r\nCould it be something in the configuration?\r\n",
