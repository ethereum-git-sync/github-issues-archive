This can be accomplish by `forge build` outputting used parameters in the stdout when `forge build --verify` is run.\r\n\r\nNow forge prints\r\n\r\n```\r\nStart verifying contract `...` deployed on polygon\r\n```\r\n\r\nMore context needs to be added:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nStart verifying contract `...` deployed on polygon\r\nCompiler version: Solidity xxx...\r\nOptimisations: 200\r\nConstructor args: 0x000000....\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Additional context\n\nAdd pic here where I am pulling out my hair with EtherScan.gif",
