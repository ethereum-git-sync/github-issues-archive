Sadly this mechanism sabotages any chance of giving it the right URL.\r\n\r\nAnd I can't simply say in root's README.md that docs are available in \"docs/src/README.md\" because it will be copied over.\r\n\r\nThis is super unexpected behavior, my first instinct was to provide some basic info in `README.md` and then fill out all information in `docs/src/README.md`, which then got overwritten to my surprise. Thanks to using local history I was able to recover everything, but that was a close call.",
