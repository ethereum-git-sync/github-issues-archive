  "body": "A common hardhat workflow of mine is to have a deploy script, which can be quite complex. Sometimes I am working on a project that requires deploying several contracts, with the deployed address of one being an input to another. Other times, it is not just deploying, but making calls to these contracts after deploying them, to seed a certain state for some client testing I might be doing. \r\n\r\nCurrently Foundry has no way to support this workflow, aside from maybe a bash script using `cli/create`.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am not sure how interested Foundry is in trying to solve this problem.
