  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Have you ensured that all of these are up to date?\n\n- [X] Foundry\n- [X] Foundryup\n\n### What version of Foundry are you on?\n\nforge 0.2.0 (8f246e0 2023-04-28T00:03:59.802167368Z)\n\n### What command(s) is the bug in?\n\nforge test\n\n### Operating System\n\nLinux\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nDue to https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/pull/4833 we tried to update lib/forge-std from 4a79aca83f8075f8b1b4fe9153945fef08375630 to b971f66b8416e3b09f240f6ee7230ad3bdb13c19 in order to set the number of expected calls.\r\n\r\nHowever, that breaks our usage of readStringArray . We try to read the methodIdentifiers from the ABI output in the \"out\" files. We have previously been able to use code similar to the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// SPDX-License-Identifier:\tAGPL-3.0\r\npragma solidity ^0.8.17;\r\n\r\nimport {stdJson} from \"forge-std/StdJson.sol\";\r\nimport {Test, console2} from \"forge-std/Test.sol\";\r\n\r\ncontract JsonTest is Test {\r\n  function test_readStringArray() public view {\r\n    string memory json = \"{ \\\"abi\\\": [ ], \\\"methodIdentifiers\\\": { \\\"function1()\\\": \\\"abcdabcd\\\", \\\"function2()\\\": \\\"def0def0\\\" } } \";\r\n    string[] memory methodIdentifiers = stdJson.readStringArray(json, \".methodIdentifiers[*]~\");\r\n    bytes[] memory selectors = new bytes[](methodIdentifiers.length);\r\n    for (uint i = 0; i < methodIdentifiers.length; i++) {\r\n      selectors[i] = vm.parseBytes(methodIdentifiers[i]);\r\n    }\r\n    console2.log(vm.toString(selectors[0]));\r\n    console2.log(vm.toString(selectors[1]));\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich outputs the following on the old version of the lib\r\n```\r\n[PASS] test_readStringArray() (gas: 15952)\r\nLogs:\r\n  0xabcdabcd\r\n  0xdef0def0\r\n```\r\n  \r\nBut with the updated lib/forge-std we get:\r\n```\r\n [FAIL. Reason: EvmError: Revert] test_readStringArray() (gas: 4281)\r\nTraces:\r\n  [4281] JsonTest::test_readStringArray() \r\n    ├─ [0] VM::parseJsonStringArray({ \"abi\": [ ], \"methodIdentifiers\": { \"function1()\": \"abcdabcd\", \"function2()\": \"def0def0\" } } , .methodIdentifiers[*]~) \r\n    │   └─ ← 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000086162636461626364000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\r\n    └─ ← \"EvmError: Revert\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote, the `~` at the end of `.methodIdentifiers[*]~` should actually make it output the keys and not the values, but that is a separate and not important issue for us. Without it it still does not work.\r\n\r\nLooking at https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/8f246e07c89129b6effa89f0d71c4ac67758a155/testdata/cheats/Json.t.sol it seems reading all the keys or values of objects is not in the test suite, so could it be broken or are we using it wrong?",
