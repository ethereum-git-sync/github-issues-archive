  "body": "### Component\r\n\r\nForge\r\n\r\n### Describe the feature you would like\r\n\r\nWhen generating contract bindings via `forge bind`, it would be excellent if the structs/enums created can implement `serde::{Serialize, Deserialize}` so that users may ultimately be able to output data collected from such calls/events/errors into other formats such as CSV or databases. \r\n\r\nNote that I also linked an issue in [`ethers-rs` here](https://github.com/gakonst/ethers-rs/issues/2599). However, I think this is not necessary as I have a quick addition to Forge that solves the problem and can be made more configurable.\r\n\r\nSee here:\r\nhttps://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/ae89c92ee32b38d525429fe9c216a0919bc7bed1/crates/forge/bin/cmd/bind.rs#L122-L145\r\n\r\nIf we replace the `.map` on line 134 as such:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n.map(|x| {\r\n                Abigen::from_file(x)?\r\n                    .add_derive(\"serde::Serialize\")?\r\n                    .add_derive(\"serde::Deserialize\")\r\n            })\r\n```\r\nthen we find the additional traits are derived on the relevant structs/enums.\r\n\r\nI am happy to implement these changes in a PR. Please see the additional context for more configurability.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nThe feature could also include a flag in a few ways, if we want more configuration. E.g.,\r\n- `forge bind --with-serde` adds the addition to the map as shown, and otherwise leaves it as is.\r\n- `forge bind --with-derive \"serde::Serialize\" --with-derive \"serde::Deserialize\"` adds each derive one by one. Could also allow for multiple strings as:\r\n- `forge bind --with-derives [\"serde::Serialize\", \"serde::Deserialize\"]`",
