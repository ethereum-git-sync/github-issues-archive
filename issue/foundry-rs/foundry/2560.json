    "body": "After more investigating it seems that it is not the complicate/simplify step, the random tree generator simply generates invalid trees. I'm not sure if this is related to endianess or something (`I256` is LE, Eth is BE) and it's lost in translation? The signum resides in the last bit of the 4th word in the I256. I've tried swapping hi/low in the random tree generator but it didn't work, presumably because ethers does some swapping around or something when encoding. Unsure.\r\n\r\nSomething that did sort of work, though, is changing the range of `bits` from `0..=self.bits` to `0..self.bits`, but it would not generate negative numbers. Something interesting though: it seems that for `intN` with `N < 128` negative numbers from random trees are never generated currently.",

    "body": "The integers are already too big once you hit the first link, it just seems that the random tree generation is unsound somehow.\r\n\r\nI'm not entirely sure why, but the start of the tree is way bigger than it should be for anything < 256 bits, and somehow that is safe until x amount of runs in when the tree has been complicated enough - at this point `hi` is just above the maximum value allowed for i128, and `curr` ends up being the max value + 1.\r\n\r\nIt's a bit odd because I would assume we could take the random strategy from u256 that we already have and just cast it to an integer - and that's what we do, it just doesn't work :D Even weirder is that the edge tree works perfectly and it casts a u256 in the same-ish manner\r\n\r\nInitially I thought it might be because we do `self.bits - 1` in the edge tree generator, and that we didn't do that in the random tree generator, but applying that \"fix\" just results in no negative numbers being generated\r\n\r\nEdit: Actually, I wonder if generating a fully random U256 and shifting using a U256 like we do in the edge tree generator would work? Right now in the random tree generator we sort of generate each of the backing u64's individually, whereas in the edge tree we do something like `U256::from(1u8) << U256::from(self.bits - 1) - 1`. What if we used that as a mask?",
