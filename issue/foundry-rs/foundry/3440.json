I just want to add that relative imports in the dependent project suffer from this problem (which seems to contradict some earlier suggestions in this thread). I believe solc resolves those relative paths into relative paths, relative to the project root. Thus `import \"./SomeOtherFile.sol\";` in the dependent project resolves to `src/SomeOtherFile.sol` and then this matches `src/=src/`, which is remapped into the dependency.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that relative remappings.txt in `lib/...` should be prepended with `lib/...` as they're loaded into foundry's vfs or solc command-line builder?",
