It would be cool if forge deployment scripts supported some kind of convenient deployment tracking/export facilities like [hardhat-deploy's export functionality](https://github.com/wighawag/hardhat-deploy#6-hardhat-export).\r\n\r\nAs of now, the data/state is already being tracked in `out/` and `broadcast/` indeed! But it's all scattered around. What hardhat-deploy's export does is aggregate the essential deployment data, for a specific chain or for all, into a single file. You can then just drop this json file in your web app and have access to all the deployed contracts' ABI and addresses on the specified chains. It's just kinda handy and easier to automate updates.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
