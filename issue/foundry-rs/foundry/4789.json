  "body": "### Component\r\n\r\nForge\r\n\r\n### Describe the feature you would like\r\n\r\nSuppose you have a differential test that compares the bytecodes of a contract deployed using two different methods, e.g. see [`deployPermit2`](https://github.com/Uniswap/permit2/blob/db96e06278b78123970183d28f502217bef156f4/test/utils/DeployPermit2.sol#L12).\r\n\r\nNow, imagine the contract-under-test takes a storage record of its `address(this)` in the constructor. In this case, the two deployment methods would produce two slightly different bytecodes (only ~20 bytes would be different), so the differential test would fail.\r\n\r\nThere are various ways to fix this using `vm.ffi`, but it would be nice to have a native find-and-replace cheat so that users don't have to exit Solidity in this scenario.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n**Late edit**: it looks like I could use Solady's [`LibString`](https://github.com/Vectorized/solady/blob/2c7fa305e443b0e69abff24810dc814a9202f966/src/utils/LibString.sol#L354) for this.",
