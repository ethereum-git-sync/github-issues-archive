Use `cargo vendor` then inside the `.cargo/config.toml` file just add the following\r\n```\r\n[source.crates-io]\r\nreplace-with = \"vendored-sources\"\r\n\r\n[source.\"https://github.com/bluealloy/revm\"]\r\ngit = \"https://github.com/bluealloy/revm\"\r\nreplace-with = \"vendored-sources\"\r\n\r\n[source.\"https://github.com/gakonst/ethers-rs\"]\r\ngit = \"https://github.com/gakonst/ethers-rs\"\r\nreplace-with = \"vendored-sources\"\r\n\r\n[source.\"https://github.com/roynalnaruto/svm-rs\"]\r\ngit = \"https://github.com/roynalnaruto/svm-rs\"\r\nreplace-with = \"vendored-sources\"\r\n\r\n[source.vendored-sources]\r\ndirectory = \"vendor\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nContext: supporting vendored dependencies would enable forge to be added to `nixos`. Rust compilation on nixos can only be done through vendored dependencies.\r\n\r\nI understand that this might not be a priority, no worries!\r\nThanks again for making great software!",
