It would be great if we can have similar functionality for excluding files during `forge build`\r\n\r\nOur use case is that we have a folder with solidity files and we use both hardhat and forge in that folder. Some files are only needed for hardhat build and tests. \n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
