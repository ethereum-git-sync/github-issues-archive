    "body": "Good catch! This looks to be an issue with the way Chisel's `runner` & `executor` handle the final statement of the `run()` function (See [here](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/master/chisel/src/executor.rs#L43)). I believe we could add a special case if the final statement is an assembly / unchecked / regular scope block that will fix this up, will look into it when I'm back online for the week.",
