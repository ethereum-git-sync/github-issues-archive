  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nMany users use node-as-a-service providers like Alchemy, Infura, or Quicknode to run their transactions. If a user `broadcast`s a transaction, it will be stored in the `broadcast` folder, and includes the RPC URL.\r\n\r\nThese RPC URLs oftentimes contain sensitive information like API keys, and should not be pushed to git. So I'd love to see `/broadcast` be included in `.gitignore` by default. Right now it's:\r\n\r\n```\r\n!/broadcast\r\n/broadcast/*/31337/\r\n/broadcast/**/dry-run/\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I'd like to see:\r\n\r\n```\r\n!/broadcast\r\n/broadcast/*/31337/\r\n/broadcast/**/dry-run/\r\n/broadcast\r\n```\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
