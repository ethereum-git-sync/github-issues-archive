You can reproduce the bug by cloning my repo [here](https://github.com/pcaversaccio/snekmate) and run `forge test`.\r\n\r\nAn example failed action: https://github.com/pcaversaccio/snekmate/runs/8168667052?check_suite_focus=true\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25297591/188266009-e773c7ae-978e-443b-b74b-da5c0246aa16.png)\r\n\r\nLocally it looks like that:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25297591/188266068-2f894df3-7d1d-4ca0-a651-6f87ad3ac625.png)\r\n\r\nSeems to be related to a memory allocation issue, but not an expert.\r\n\r\nAs comparison, I used an older foundry version (`forge 0.2.0 (fb1f0aa 2022-08-29T19:50:24.7749584Z)`) for which the tests worked. So there has been a bug introduced in the meantime I guess.",
