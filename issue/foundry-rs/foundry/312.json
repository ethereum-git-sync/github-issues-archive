  "body": "Add an `flatten` command that would grab a contract and its dependencies and print to stdout. With the other issues around `verify-contract`, this would provide at the very least users the ability to get forge's best guess at what the compiler is doing with the standard-json input and allow a user to tweak and manually verify if needed. Also I imagine this will surface issues around `verify-contract` for debugging it.\r\n\r\ni.e.:\r\n```solidity\r\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\r\n\r\nimport \"./ContractDep.sol\";\r\n\r\ncontract Contract is ContractDep {\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwould print out:\r\n```solidity\r\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\r\ncontract ContractDep {\r\n     uint256 myVar;\r\n}\r\ncontract Contract is ContractDep {\r\n}\r\n```",
