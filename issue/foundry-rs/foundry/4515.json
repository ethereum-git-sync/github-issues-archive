Reading and sharing just the addresses makes it necessary to use a script that prints them out. I use something like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport json\r\n\r\nP = \"../broadcast/Deploy.Goerli.s.sol/5/run-latest.json\"\r\n\r\nf = open(P)\r\nd = json.load(f)\r\n\r\n# there are some dups that we need to filter out\r\ncontractNames = []\r\nfor k in d[\"transactions\"]:\r\n    contractName = k[\"contractName\"]\r\n    if  contractName not in contractNames:\r\n        print(contractName.ljust(12), k[\"contractAddress\"])\r\n        contractNames.append(contractName)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would like to create and integrate a forge command for that. Is this also interesting to others?\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
