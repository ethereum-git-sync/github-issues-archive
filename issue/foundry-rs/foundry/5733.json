  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nTests in Foundry are run against a standard EVM implementation which works well for most cases. However, some chains (notably rollups) modify the behaviour of the EVM in different ways.\r\nFor example, Optimism charges a separate L1 Fee once the transaction has been submitted as a batch to L1, outside of the standard execution fee charged by all chains. \r\n\r\nIt would be great to capture chain-specific details while running tests. One way for this could be to run foundry tests on an external node (like op-geth), where the functionality for running foundry tests (support for cheats etc) is implemented by a middleware between foundry and the node.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Additional context\n\nhttps://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/build/transaction-fees/#the-l1-data-fee",
