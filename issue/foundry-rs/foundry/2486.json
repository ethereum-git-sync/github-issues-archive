  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nThe `solc` optimizer has historically been a source of bugs in smart contracts.\r\n\r\nAfter a couple of years of stability, Solidity 0.8.x's optimizer had some outstanding [bugs](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.15/bugs.html) that could lead to catastrophic problems even when code is correct.\r\n\r\nWhile one can appreciate the gains in gas costs that the optimizer brings, this should be an opt-in instead of the [default option](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/config?highlight=optimi#optimizer), since it can introduce bugs for seemingly correct code. Let's not underestimate [the power of defaults](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-power-of-defaults/).\n\n### Additional context\n\nOther tools in the industry also don't enable the optimizer by default:\r\n\r\n- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/guides/compile-contracts#configuring-the-compiler)\r\n   > optimizer: an object with enabled and runs keys. Default value: { enabled: false, runs: 200 }.\r\n- [Truffle](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/blob/3e7a319ed898eebbd6d9cd76aafb904d1ba8ad35/packages/core/lib/commands/init/initSource/truffle-config.js#L85-L97)\r\n    >  //  optimizer: {\r\n    >  //    enabled: false,\r\n    >  //    runs: 200\r\n    >  //  },\r\n- [Dapp Tools](https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools/tree/master/src/dapp#configuration)\r\n    > DAPP_BUILD_OPTIMIZE | 0 | -- | -- | --\r\n\r\nSo anyone coming from them who are not willing to use the optimizer can easily forget to disable it.",
