However, per [EIP-161](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-161) contract nonces start at 1.\r\n\r\nEither:\r\n1. This cheat should be updated to conform to this behavior to. For the selfdestruct use case you'd have to etch the code to be empty first then reset nonce, or use `setNonceUnsafe` to make the order independent\r\n2. This cheat should be left alone but we should document why it behaves this way and note that it can result in an invalid EVM state\r\n\r\nWhile decrementing nonces can be an invalid state transition, lots of forge testing involves invalid state transitions, so this is ok. However I *think* actual invalid EVM states never (or least infrequently?) occur in forge, but the current behavior introduces that more concretely. As a result, I'd suggest option 1\r\n\r\ncc @joaquinlpereyra",
