To solve this problem currently, I return to the original snapshot state.\r\n\r\nSimple repro:\r\n\r\n- `CREATE2` deploy a contract\r\n- Change `chainId` to an ID via `vm.chainId` that is not equal to the original `chainId`\r\n- Redeploy via `CREATE2`\r\n- Will revert due to [EIP-684](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/684)",

I understand there's a point to clean up the evm state if you change chain IDs, but, it severely overloads the `chainId` cheatcode. I'll close this for now but feel free to reopen if you think this should be discussed further. I can see how the current behavior is useful for simulation or CTF purposes",

The reason why such a feature is desirable to me is that in my [`CreateX`](https://github.com/pcaversaccio/createx) tests I had to mock contract creation frontrunning and redeployment events on other chains, and snapshot reverts can become annoying. But maybe it's an edge case...",
