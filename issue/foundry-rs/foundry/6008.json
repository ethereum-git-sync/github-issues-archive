To solve this problem currently, I return to the original snapshot state.\r\n\r\nSimple repro:\r\n\r\n- `CREATE2` deploy a contract\r\n- Change `chainId` to an ID via `vm.chainId` that is not equal to the original `chainId`\r\n- Redeploy via `CREATE2`\r\n- Will revert due to [EIP-684](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/684)",
