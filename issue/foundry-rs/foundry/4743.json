  "body": "### Component\r\n\r\nForge\r\n\r\n### Describe the feature you would like\r\n\r\nIn the forge test log output, it would be really helpful if the logger added 'hints' to do common conversions to improve readability. For example, display `uint256` values denominated in ether.\r\n\r\nFor example, transforming this:\r\n```\r\n0x8d2C17FAd02B7bb64139109c6533b7C2b9CADb81::releasable(0x2f66c75A001Ba71ccb135934F48d844b46454543) [staticcall]\r\n    │   ├─ [1362] DelegatedPaymentSplitter::releasable(0x2f66c75A001Ba71ccb135934F48d844b46454543) [delegatecall]\r\n    │   │   └─ ← 100000000000000000\r\n    │   └─ ← 100000000000000000\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo\r\n```\r\n0x8d2C17FAd02B7bb64139109c6533b7C2b9CADb81::releasable(0x2f66c75A001Ba71ccb135934F48d844b46454543) [staticcall]\r\n    │   ├─ [1362] DelegatedPaymentSplitter::releasable(0x2f66c75A001Ba71ccb135934F48d844b46454543) [delegatecall]\r\n    │   │   └─ ← 100000000000000000 [0.1 ether]\r\n    │   └─ ← 100000000000000000 [0.1 ether]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would massively help when testing/debugging. I am sure there are more automatic conversions which could be implemented as hints, but this seems like the most obvious.\r\n\r\nI would suggest that they have a relatively low contrast colour so that they are not distracting, but can be seen when looking for them.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nI got the idea from the Chrome debugger, which annotates variable values in the current context\r\n\r\n<img width=\"562\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/169475/232112429-8fbf9dab-3c36-48bd-9aa0-64c1a41d283b.png\">\r\n",
