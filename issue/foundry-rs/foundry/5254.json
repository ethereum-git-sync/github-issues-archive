    "body": "I'll spend some time re-familiarizing myself with terminal color theory (i.e., I am by no means an expert in this area). My original bug post made some potentially incorrect assumptions, one of which was that the invisible color was \"white\". At the alacritty site you posted, if the octal `037` examples (visible when you scroll down a bit), possibly corresponding to `code 37` you linked above are labelled not as \"white\" but \"light grey.\" Perhaps this is an attempt by alacritty to avoid having a any foreground color which corresponds pure white. I.e. maybe they arbitrarily decided for them \"37\" won't be \"white.\" No idea here.\r\n\r\nAnyway, thinking more clearly about this problem, what is to be avoided really is the use of a color which is equal to the background color of the current terminal. If there exists a way to query the latter, the former can be avoided. I'm having trouble remembering if there is a mechanism for the flow of terminal information in that direction, but there must be, since at least terminal window size can be obtained by editors.\r\n\r\nI guess this is worth noting to the solidity team as well. I have opened a bug linking this bug for them (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14378)",
