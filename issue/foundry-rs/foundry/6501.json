The function is output with its signature in the stack trace instead of a \"human readable\" `[0] console::log(\"\")`. In my examples I used it as an additional parameter, but also just using `console.log(num)` where `num` is any number (type) does not work properly. However, `console2.log(...)` works fine. But that on the other hand does not support parameter replacing, so e.g. `console2.log(\"A string %s in a string!\", \"< I am a string >\");` does not work, the `%s` is not replaced (not sure if it's a bug or just working as should for `console2.log(...)`).\r\n<img width=\"494\" alt=\"num1\" src=\"https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/assets/85028981/60575309-b168-4fe7-87e2-5e098509dd11\">\r\n<img width=\"280\" alt=\"num2\" src=\"https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/assets/85028981/1675041f-ba01-428a-a6fb-f8b1edd303b4\">\r\n",
