    "body": "> I would suggest that the deployer of the script contract should be influenced by the `--sender` flag unless doing so is infeasible/would break other workflows?\r\n\r\nThat would be rad, been struggling with this for months, I can't test scripts that deploy contracts which implement stuff like Ownable which uses `msg.sender` in the constructor. And so I thought, well, what if I try to prank before calling the `run()` function on the deployed script contract? But then I get `FAIL. Reason: You have an active prank. Broadcasting and pranks are not compatible. Disable one or the other`, which makes me think that the same problem would come up if `--sender` were to be used?",
