Forge will produce the following error:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nUpdating dependencies in /Users/prb/Projects/prb-proxy/lib\r\nerror: pathspec '/Users/prb/Projects/prb-proxy/lib' did not match any file(s) known to git\r\nError:\r\ngit submodule exited with code 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt looks like Foundry assumes that there is a `lib` directory and that there are some submodules in there.\r\n\r\nYou can quickly reproduce the bug using [PRBProxy](https://github.com/PaulRBerg/prb-proxy) and the instructions provided here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/crytic/slither-action/issues/44#issuecomment-1838832654\r\n\r\nThis is a blocker so a fix would be appreciated üôè \r\n\r\nCc @DaniPopes @mattsse",
