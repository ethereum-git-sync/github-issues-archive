I would prefer not to disable `--via-ir`.\r\n\r\nDid you, by chance, override the `optimizerSteps` in your Foundry config? I noticed that if I set it to either `` or `dhfoDgvulfnTUtnIf`, I get the strange behavior reported by you. But if I remove this configuration completely, the `warp` cheatcode works as expected.",

    "body": "Hey @paulrberg !\r\n\r\nHonestly my solution was just to redesign the test suite to get around this issue. In our case, changing some constants around to re-evaluate block.timestamp in different expressions allowed the value to change properly, i.e.\r\n```\r\nuint256 startTimestamp = block.timestamp;\r\n... startTimestamp + 10 // 11\r\nuint256 newTimestamp = startTimestamp + 100); // 101\r\nwarp(newTimestamp)\r\n... startTimestamp + 50  // 51\r\n```\r\n\r\nI did tinker around with optimizerSteps, but couldn't isolate the correct step easily and gave up to do the hacky way out :D",
