Then let's say the contract has a public function \"getPrice()\" which returns 5. Then I modify the source code of \"ContractA\" in \"ContractA.sol\" so that \"getPrice()\" returns 10. \r\n\r\nNow the REPL environment returns 10 when I invoke \"getPrice()\", even though I haven't reimported the contract and I am working the with already launched instance. Therefore it appears Chisel allows us to arbitrarily rewrite local blocks, because we can overwrite already deployed contracts.\r\n\r\nchisel --fork-url sepolia\r\nimport {ContractA} from \"src/ContractA.sol\"\r\nContractA internal test = new ContractA(arg1,arg2);\r\ntest.getPrice();           //returns 5\r\n//modify source code\r\ntest.getPrice();          //returns 10",
