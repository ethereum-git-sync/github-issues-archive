They recently launched a public testnet.\r\n\r\nCurrently, their deployment pipeline only works with Hardhat. Details: https://v2-docs.zksync.io/dev/guide/hello-world.html#initializing-the-project-deploying-smart-contract\r\n\r\nObviously, I'd prefer to use Forge. I'm not sure what it would take. It looks like we'd have to support using a custom solc. Just opening this as a stub issue to track potential future zksync support.",
