    "body": "Well the other issue was also on Windows and used `forge script` directly - `forge test --debug` calls `forge debug`, which calls `forge script`. The debugger in `forge script` does not seem to work in some cases on Windows as described in the other issue - I think the case was if you specified *both* path *and* contract name, which is exactly what `forge test --debug` always does",
