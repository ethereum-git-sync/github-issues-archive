  "body": "### Component\n\nForge, Anvil\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\n### Background\r\nWhen running tests using Foundry, it is possible to specify a `--rpc-url` to the `foundry test` command. When doing so, Foundry just queries and copies the state of the chain specified at the `--rpc-url` endpoint to the locally running testing node. Nevertheless, other Smart Contract development frameworks (hardhat) do provide a direct way to publish tests on an actual node, which can be tremendously useful for effective fork and staging testing.\r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\nImplement test transactions actually being published to anvil when specifying `--rpc-url` to a local anvil node. This would allow for more accurate fork-testing and external sources being able to use / query transaction data.\r\n\r\nThis feature could be used to effectively perform fork testing and integrate external sources into the testing environment.\n\n### Additional context\n\n### Discussed in https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/discussions/5421",
