    "body": "So it seems like it is because of the way the remappings are set up, but I'm still investigating exactly what happens.\r\n\r\nEssentially, each of your packages has a remapping for itself. I think this is because all the packages depend on each other somehow, so you need to have all of the remappings defined in case the dependency uses it, correct?\r\n\r\nIn any case, if you build e.g. the package `core`, then any source file in that package will end up having an invalid absolute path. You can verify this by just running `forge build` and inspecting the `.ast.absolutePath` field in the artifact for e.g. `Divider.sol`. All other paths are well-formed, which is interesting - if you instead compile e.g. `fuse`, then all paths are well-formed, except for any file in the `fuse` package, e.g. `PoolManager.sol`.",

    "body": "@fedealconada sorry for taking so long,\r\n\r\nI had a look, and one thing that's obvious is that this setup uses circular dependencies, (core imports from fuse, fuse imports from core)\r\n\r\nI checked the solc compilerinput which looks ok, there's something weird with the output however because it contains duplicate entries for `Divider.sol`: `src/Divider.sol` and `/src/Divider.sol`, this is usually a sign that solc fails to look up an import of a file in the json compilerinput (which works like a virtual file system) and instead tries to find it on disk and also adds this to the compileroutput.\r\n\r\nI wasn't able to find the root cause for this but it's definitely related to the relative imports, perhaps in combination with circular setup there are some weird edge cases...\r\n\r\nhowever I was able to resolve this by tuning the remappings and point to the `src` dir instead, this is also the default dapptools style\r\n\r\n```text\r\n    '@sense-finance/v1-utils=../utils/src',\r\n    '@sense-finance/v1-core/=./src',\r\n    '@sense-finance/v1-fuse=../fuse/src',\r\n```\r\n\r\nafter I replaced the imports in the sol files, the issue was resolved\r\n",

    "body": "Thanks for reporting this @fedealconada. Another data-point here.\r\n\r\nI'm working on a project that was seeing the same \"could not read source code\" error when I ran `forge coverage`. In our case, ~~there weren't circular dependencies~~ there were circular dependencies, but they didn't have to be resolved in order to get the coverage tool working. The real issue seemed to be a nested dependency tree. The project had one submodule (call it A), and A itself had a submodule (call it B). The project imported from both A and B, and thus had remappings to shorten imports from B.\r\n\r\nI eventually got `forge coverage` to work on a frankenstein branch by moving the two submodules directly into `src` and deleting the corresponding remappings. But it'd obviously be great if this didn't have to be done.\r\n\r\nEDIT: see above",
