(Different Token Addresses, Contract Owner vs. non-owner, Contract vs. EOA etc)\r\n- Run a set of tests both before and after the upgrade of a contract\r\n\r\nThe feature would ideally allow the user to:\r\n- [ ] Parameterize a single test\r\n- [ ] Parameterize a whole test collection (contract)\r\n- [ ] Specify multiple parameters in which case the test(-collection) will be run for all combinations\r\n- [ ] Set the values to parameterize  dynamically (for example in the `setUp` method) (optional)\r\n- [ ] Pass filter arguments to `forge test` to only run a subset of the originally specified parameter space (similar to `--match-test`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nOne testing library that does this fairly well imo is pytest (see [here](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/parametrize.html)).
