  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nWhen using `forge script`, it's possible to add `--account` to a use a keystore account. However, `vm.startBroadcast` in the script won't use the address from the account. To fix this, you need to pass `--froms` with the address of the account, resulting in something like: `forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --account wallet --froms <ADDRESS>`\r\n\r\nIt would be great if `forge script` fetches the address from the account and passes it to `vm.startBroadcast` automatically. Otherwise, it's quite annoying to keep getting the account's address manually.\n\n### Additional context\n\nThis feature will create the experience of using keytore accounts easier, which is a much safer option than using the private key from `.env`.",

    "body": "I recognize there might be an edge case where automatically setting `--froms` to the account address may be breaking, so I was thinking a workaround might be getting the account address with `cast`. However, `--froms $(cast wallet address --account <ACCOUNT>)` asks for the password twice.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we can have a single `--fromAccount` that fills both `--account` and `--froms $(cast wallet address --account <ACCOUNT>)` using a single password?",
