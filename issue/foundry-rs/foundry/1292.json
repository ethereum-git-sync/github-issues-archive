The benefit of including this within forge is mainly convenience and forge should already know all the target .sol files to watch.\r\n\r\nThis can be accomplished currently using the `entr` tool with: `find contracts -name \"*.sol\" | entr forge test`\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_",
