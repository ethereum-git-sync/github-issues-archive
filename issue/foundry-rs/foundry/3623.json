I cleared out a few hundred gigs from various project folders (mostly node_modules), but then got another low disk warning a day or two later. When I looked at my disk usage, it was steadily decreasing every few seconds.\r\n\r\nI later found that this was all due to anvil running with interval mining turned on and a block time of 1s (I know that this is edge-case-y but I am trying to mimic block times for a custom Optimism node used for [OPCraft](https://dev.optimism.io/opcraft-autonomous-world/)).\r\n\r\nAfter some more digging with `ncdu`, I found that anvil was creating _gigabytes_ worth of 8-9mb JSON files, buried in a folder under `/private/var/folders`:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/508855/200196093-cffb68f6-1129-4019-83df-8268f50f678f.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/508855/200196100-2aaf5cab-5f41-4ea0-bf3f-04d328a3d980.png)\r\n\r\nI'd like to ask for a few things here:\r\n- is it possible to reduce the amount of data being logged by anvil?\r\n- can anvil use a directory name that makes it clear that these logs come from anvil? and that they're safe to delete/prune?\r\n- can a CLI command be added to safely flush whatever the configured log directory is?\r\n",
