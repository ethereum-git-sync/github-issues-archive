For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl -X POST --data '{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"method\":\"eth_blockNumber\",\"params\":[],\"id\":1}' http://127.0.0.1:8545\r\n```\r\n\r\nWorks with hardhat node, but anvil will throw:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":null,\"error\":{\"code\":-32600,\"message\":\"Invalid request\"}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy suggestion would be to either:\r\n1. Improve error message (wrong content-type?)\r\n2. Assume it's JSON and make it work anyway.\r\n\r\nI can work on a fix if you all agree this is a good idea.",
