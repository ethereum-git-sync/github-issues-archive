  "body": "### Component\n\nForge\n\n### Describe the feature you would like\n\nIt would be great to be able to suppress the file output of `forge script` for the purposes of dry-runs. The use case I have for this is preventing file writes during an e2e test - I'd like to have devs be able to run these tests locally without polluting the `broadcast/` folder.\r\n\r\nThe `--silent` flag relates to the `solc` output as far as I can tell. So unsure how best to expose this option to the user.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
