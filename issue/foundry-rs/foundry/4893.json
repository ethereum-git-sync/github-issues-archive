This would be useful when we need to deploy code with a complex constructor to a specific address, let external calls from a contract we cannot control execute different code on different accounts when we fork the chain, etc. These cannot be easily achieved using `vm.deal`, `vm.etch` or `vm.accesses`\r\n\r\nThis operation is hard to implement in Solidity but easy in revm. \r\n\r\nExample: \r\n```\r\nvm.cloneAccount(0x35c9dfd76bf02107ff4f7128Bd69716612d31dDb, 0xeCf9571038d92097a6C09A8d75713fEE69877211)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich should clone (code, state, balance, nonce) of 0x35c9dfd76bf02107ff4f7128Bd69716612d31dDb to 0xeCf9571038d92097a6C09A8d75713fEE69877211.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_",
