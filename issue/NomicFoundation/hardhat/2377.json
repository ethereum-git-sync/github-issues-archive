The best way to do this is to include a [Minimal Reproducible Example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example). If you can't do that, then include a link to your repo, and the steps to reproduce the problem. The easiest it is to reproduce your problem, the faster we are going to be able to fix it.\r\n\r\nIf you are submitting a feature request, please take the time to clearly describe your use case, and not only your proposed solution.\r\n\r\nThis issue will be automatically assigned to a Hardhat team member.

An issue being assigned does not mean that it's being worked on.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\n\r\nHi all,\r\n\r\nI believe I have found a problem regarding the verification of subcontracts, e.g. contracts deployed using the `new` keyword inside of another contract's function call.\r\n\r\nWhenever I attempt to verify the contracts using hardhat-etherscan, the following error shows up:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58761920/153693878-8fea479f-a392-44e2-90c5-55a7d716b1d1.png)\r\n\r\nI am wondering if this is a hardhat issue or an etherscan / ftmscan issue, or hopefully, it is neither and I have just missed a crucial step.\r\n\r\n## Troubleshooting\r\n\r\nI have resolved this same error in the past by correcting the constructor arguments. As such this was my first thought, so I made sure that the constructor arguments I was passing in were indeed correct.\r\n\r\nI found a [stack overflow issue](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/27991/how-do-you-verify-a-contract-on-etherscan-that-is-deployed-by-another-contract/43698) on the topic about the same issue which states that a few years ago it was an etherscan problem, however there is now conflicting advice saying it is indeed possible.\r\n\r\nOne of the recommendations was to manually encode the arguments, so instead of passing in my regular arguments I passed in the encoded arguments using:\r\n`hre.ethers.utils.defaultAbiCoder.encode([\"string\"], [\"Argument\"]);`\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this was still not successful.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n### Details\r\n\r\n**It should be noted that the contract that deployed the subcontract was a proxy, however, I have seen this in [OpenZeppelin's own documentation](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/writing-upgradeable#creating-new-instances-from-your-contract-code) for proxies as a perfectly accepted practice so I cannot see this causing the problem**\r\n\r\n**It should be also noted that the contract's code got verified to Etherscan as a part of the verification process for the [implementation contract I deployed](https://ftmscan.com/address/0x6c8c4ef02069cfd5ea025eafb8ff4b0d9ab99dc7#code) (LPoolToken.sol), but yet this code won't verify for the contract itself**\r\n\r\n- Network: Fantom mainnet\r\n- Block explorer: Ftmscan\r\n- [Contract that deployed subcontract (proxy)](https://ftmscan.com/address/0x5DF64a6D9A76f3808560DC071e2e67a7fF4a20A2)\r\n- [Subcontract](https://ftmscan.com/address/0x034f91d348ce6e69b4972fe327a3014ddba5ec83)\r\n- Subcontract code:\r\n```solidity\r\n//SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-only\r\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\r\n\r\nimport {ERC20} from \"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol\";\r\nimport {Ownable} from \"@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol\";\r\n\r\ncontract LPoolToken is ERC20, Ownable {\r\n    constructor(string memory name_, string memory symbol_) ERC20(name_, symbol_) {}\r\n\r\n    function mint(address account_, uint256 amount_) external onlyOwner {\r\n        _mint(account_, amount_);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function burn(address account_, uint256 amount_) external onlyOwner {\r\n        _burn(account_, amount_);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n- Function code that deployed the subcontract code:\r\n```solidity\r\n    // Add a new token to be used with the pool\r\n    function addLPToken(\r\n        address[] memory token_,\r\n        string[] memory name_,\r\n        string[] memory symbol_\r\n    ) external onlyRole(POOL_ADMIN) {\r\n        for (uint256 i = 0;
