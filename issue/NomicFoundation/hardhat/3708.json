  "body": "We used to have an `e2e` package for e2e tests, but we [removed it](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/pull/3707) because it was slow and brittle. It was useful a couple of times, but not enough to justify the maintenance cost.\r\n\r\nWe should replace it with something though. This needs some definition, but here are some thoughts about what we should include:\r\n\r\n- Only run in the `main` branch. I don't think it's important to slow down PRs, we mainly care about not releasing stuff that breaks these tests.\r\n- Notify us if they fail\r\n- Run the sample projects (same tests that the old e2e tests used to do)\r\n- Run tests in some real projects, like OpenZeppelin\r\n- Run tests with some important community plugins that are not included in the sample projects, like smock\r\n- Check that Hardhat's `.d.ts` files can be consumed by older versions of typescript (this implies defining a support policy for typescript versions)\r\n\r\nOpen questions:\r\n- What's the best way to do this? Should we have some scripts like in the previous version, or use pure github actions?\r\n- Should they live in this monorepo or in a separate repository?",
