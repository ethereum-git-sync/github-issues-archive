  "body": "The `allowUnlimitedContractSize` setting is now project wide. This means that if one of your contracts (e.g. a mock) is above the contract size limit, you have to disable for all your tests. This can hide the fact that some other contract is above the size limit, when it shouldn't.\r\n\r\nAdding a `hardhat_allowUnlimitedContractSize` RPC method would give more fine-grained control over that, and let you avoid that situation.\r\n\r\nThis should be fairly straightforward to implement. We have to instantiate a new VM with the new config value, and replace the one that's inside the `HardhatNode` class.",
