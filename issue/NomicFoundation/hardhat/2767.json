  "body": "(I believe we don't have an issue for this yet, so opening this one)\r\n\r\nPlugins cannot add new JSON-RPC endpoints, but it would be great if they could. There are two interesting scenarios:\r\n\r\n- Providers like Alchemy have some custom endpoints (for example, `alchemy_getTokenBalances`). This means that, if an app relies on those, the app won't work when connected to Hardhat Node. Allowing custom endpoints would let Alchemy create a `hardhat-alchemy` plugin that adds this.\r\n- Flashpots has some custom endpoints too. See [this issue](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/issues/2759) for more details.\r\n\r\nRelated issues:\r\n- https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/issues/2767",
