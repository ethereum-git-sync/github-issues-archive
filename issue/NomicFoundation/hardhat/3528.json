It can also happen that the pending block is full but there are more txs in the mempool; this happens with just one tx in the in-process network because the full block gas limit is used as the estimation.\r\n\r\nAs part of this, we should update [this section](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network/docs/explanation/mining-modes#mempool-behavior) of the docs.\r\n\r\nThe right method for this is probably [`txpool_content`](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interacting-with-geth/rpc/ns-txpool#txpool-content)",
