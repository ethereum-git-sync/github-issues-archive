  "body": "This is the main issue for a recurring problem related to static calls from ethers.js to Hardhat that revert without return data (for example, by hitting a `require(false)`).\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nDeploy this contract in Hardhat:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract Foo {\r\n  function f() public {\r\n    require(false);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand call `foo.callStatic.f()`. This should throw an error, but it doesn't.\r\n\r\nThe reason is that the plain RPC response from Hardhat is this:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\r\n  \"id\": 1,\r\n  \"error\": {\r\n    \"code\": -32603,\r\n    \"message\": \"Error: Transaction reverted without a reason string\",\r\n    \"data\": {\r\n      \"message\": \"Error: Transaction reverted without a reason string\",\r\n      \"data\": \"0x\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `\"data\": \"0x\"` part causes ethers to _not_ throw. I reported this in the ethers.js repo six months ago (https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/issues/3038) and assumed it would be fixed, but it hasn't yet.\r\n\r\nFor reference, this does work in geth. The raw response for the same call is:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\r\n  \"id\": 1,\r\n  \"error\": {\r\n    \"code\": -32000,\r\n    \"message\": \"execution reverted\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Decision to make\r\n\r\nOur options are:\r\n\r\n1. Wait until this is fixed in ethers, and close this issue when/if that happens. \r\n2. Change our response to omit the `data` field if it's empty. This is technically a breaking change, but I think it's better than ethers not working correctly for these scenarios.\r\n3. Finally, we could consider adapting our `EthersProviderWrapper` in the `hardhat-ethers` plugin to somehow intercept `eth_call` responses and remove the `data` field if it's `0x`. I gave this a quick try to see if it was possible but it wasn't immediately obvious how to do it.\r\n\r\n### To-do\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add a test for this in `hardhat-ethers`\r\n- [ ] Re-enable the `hardhat-chai-matchers` tests that we disabled because of this issue",
