The best way to do this is to include a [Minimal Reproducible Example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example). If you can't do that, then include a link to your repo, and the steps to reproduce the problem. The easiest it is to reproduce your problem, the faster we are going to be able to fix it.\r\n\r\nIf you are submitting a feature request, please take the time to clearly describe your use case, and not only your proposed solution.\r\n\r\nThis issue will be automatically assigned to a Hardhat team member. This person will act as the point of contact between you and the team, but won't necessarily fix it nor address it in any way. An issue being assigned does not mean that it's being worked on.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI'm using hardhat with the circom plugin and I am having a problem compiling contracts resulting in the mentioned error.\r\n\r\nIf I run `rm -r ./artifacts/circom` this fixed the problem. I think hardhat is detecting those files as an ABI which they aren't.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to prevent this from occuring? I will need the `public.json` and `proof.json` in `./artifacts/circom/` for my unit tests.\r\n\r\nI am calculating them manually with `snarkjs` as a workaround for now.\r\n\r\nI don't think hardhat should fail to compile if these files exist in `./artifacts`",
