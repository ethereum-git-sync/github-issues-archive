  "body": "Currently the node task is a monolithic task and for my use case (in buidler-deploy) I have to rewrite it to add my modification.\r\nIt would be great if the node task was broken up into at least these 3 internal task : \r\n\r\n- TASK_NODE_GET_PROVIDER (this would accept the option for the provider and would return the provider)\r\n- TASK_NODE_CREATE_SERVER (this would accept the option and  would return the server)\r\n- TASK_NODE_WAIT_FOR_SERVER\r\n\r\nThis way,my override of the node task can override the provider if needed, do something after the server is created (but before it get in the final `await`\r\n\r\nNote: Why does buidler does not reuse the bre.network.provider?\r\nThis is what buidler-deploy does (and the reason I would need to override TASK_NODE_GET_PROVIDER)\r\nThe benefits are :\r\n- other plugin can act on the provider (otherwise they act on the ghost bre.network.provider which is not used)\r\n- does not have 2 provider in memory\r\n\r\n",
