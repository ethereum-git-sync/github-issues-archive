  "body": "Hello, I am a new user to buidler.\r\n\r\nI followed the quick start guide here: https://buidler.dev/getting-started/#quick-start\r\n\r\nBuidler asked me to install these libraries:\r\n```\r\nnpm install --save-dev @nomiclabs/buidler-waffle@^2.0.0 ethereum-waffle@^3.0.0 chai@^4.2.0 @nomiclabs/buidler-ethers@^2.0.0 ethers@^5.0.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter installing those libraries npm reports \"found 978 vulnerabilities (970 low, 8 high)\".\r\n\r\nIt doesn't seem like a good idea to use software to write smart contracts that have 978 vulnerabilities.  Can I have some input/data/reassurance about this?\r\n\r\nI ran `npm audit fix` to fix the vulnerabilities and that fixed 964 of 978.  Will that break anything? \r\n\r\n npm reports: `14 vulnerabilities required manual review and could not be updated` \r\nHow do I manually review and fix the last 14?\r\n\r\nI am using Windows 10.\r\n\r\nThanks",

Those warnings are triggered by ens and ganache packages that `ethereum-waffle` installs. They are not coming from code we control nor directly depend on.\r\n\r\nWe don't use the parts of waffle that trigger the warnings though, so you are safe.",
