The process is the hardhat node process, managed as a subprocess.\r\n\r\nNow, `process.kill()` kinda kills the process but the port is still occupied by another process.\r\nI can force kill the process in the terminal but I am not sure how to properly kill the process now.\r\n\r\nDid anything change in Hardhat, regarding the node daemon, that would cause this??\n\n### Minimal reproduction steps\n\n* Start process in Python (roughly):\r\n\r\n```python\r\npre_exec_fn = _linux_set_death_signal if platform.uname().system == \"Linux\" else None\r\nself.process = Popen(\r\n    self.build_command(), preexec_fn=pre_exec_fn, stdout=out_file, stderr=out_file\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen stop it:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nprocess.kill()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis used to work, and it works on Anvil and Ganache... but it no longer works for Hardhat and I am not sure what to do.\n\n### Search terms\n\nprocess, kill, node, python",

This was a more recent change tho so I wouldnt be surprised if it is related.",
