  "body": "Currently, when I want to perform multiple hardhat-chai assertions on the same transaction, I have to save the transaction to a variable and then perform each assertion separately:\r\n```ts\r\nconst tx = await contract.someCall();\r\nawait expect(tx).to.emit(contract, \"SomeEvent\");\r\nawait expect(tx).to.changeEtherBalance(alice, 1000);\r\n```\r\nIt would be great to instead be able to chain them with `.and` like\r\n```ts\r\nawait expect(contract.someCall()).to.emit(contract, \"SomeEvent\")\r\n    .and.to.changeEtherBalance(alice, 1000);\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr is this somehow already possible?",
