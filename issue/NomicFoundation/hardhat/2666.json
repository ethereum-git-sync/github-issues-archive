  "body": "`console.log` works by encoding the payload with an ABI signature. however, in some cases the types used are the type aliases, instead of the ABI types. for instance, the following signature uses `(uint)` instead of `(uint256)`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/blob/fd1f7f8cdb06d8e4ee7fb5fce15c4c48730ca45c/packages/hardhat-core/console.sol#L24-L26\r\n\r\ncurrently, vyper's `print` function uses the standard ABI types for calculating method IDs. we could hardcode workaround rules specifically for the `print` function, but as a matter of cross-language/tooling compatibility it seems it would be better to use the standard ABI types!",

    "body": "I guess a more general design would be for the console address to expose a single method whose signature is `log(string,bytes)` (method id: `0x23cdd8e8`). The first argument is a string containing the signature of the data to be decoded (e.g. `\"(uint256)\"`, or `\"(string,uint256)\"`), and the second is the ABI encoded payload. This would allow hardhat to decode any kind of logged data, instead of just the existing hardcoded signatures.",
