    "body": "Hi @krasi-georgiev, thanks for opening this issue.\r\n\r\nTo clarify, this would mean supporting these endpoints, right?\r\n\r\n- `eth_sendBundle`\r\n- `eth_callBundle`\r\n- `eth_sendPrivateTransaction`\r\n- `eth_cancelPrivateTransaction`\r\n\r\n(I'm not sure if the `flashbots_*` endpoints would be necessary)\r\n\r\nI think that, rather than adding these endpoints to hardhat itself, we would be interested in adding enough support so that this can be done in a plugin. This means letting plugins add new endpoints (something we've been wanting to do for a while) and making sure that those custom endpoints are powerful enough to do something like this.\r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks again for raising this up!",

That is, it should let you interact with the provider in any way within the call. So, yes, you should be able to use `hardhat_setCoinbase` inside the custom call.",
