  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nI am doing the following things to deploy a contract with the [hardhat_setCode](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network/reference/#hardhat-setcode) JSON-RPC method:\r\n\r\n1. Deploy a contract the usual way (via the `CREATE` opcode) with [waffle.deployContract](https://github.com/paulrberg/hardhat-set-code-bug/blob/26d9775121ba31e3361aa2f969a10283d0cac4b4/test/greeter/Greeter.ts#L22)\r\n2. Load the runtime bytecode of that contract into a variable via `getCode`\r\n3. Set the runtime bytecode at a custom address\r\n4. Re-create the ethers.js contract at the custom address used in step 3\r\n\r\nWhen I attempt to call a view method on this contract, I am getting only empty strings back. That makes my tests fail:\r\n\r\n> AssertionError: expected '' to equal 'Hello, world!'\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Clone https://github.com/paulrberg/hardhat-set-code-bug\r\n2. Install dependencies with `yarn install`\r\n3. Create a `.env` file by following the `.env.example`\r\n4. Generate TypeChain bindings via `yarn typechain`\r\n5. Run `yarn test`\r\n\r\nTo make the tests pass, you can uncomment [line 35](https://github.com/paulrberg/hardhat-set-code-bug/blob/26d9775121ba31e3361aa2f969a10283d0cac4b4/test/greeter/Greeter.ts#L35).\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- hardhat@2.6.2",
