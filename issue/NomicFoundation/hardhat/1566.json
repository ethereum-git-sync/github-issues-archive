  "body": "# Hardhat throws a strange error when trying to call smart contract functions\r\n## Description:\r\nWhen trying to call a smart contract function running on hardhat, it throws confusing errors. (All of this has been tested on the cheapETH network with no errors.)\r\n\r\n## Environment:\r\nOS: Manjaro linux 5.10.42\r\nVer: 2.3.0\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce:\r\n1. Deploy this smart contract to the hardhat network:\r\n```\r\npragma solidity 0.8.0;\r\n\r\ncontract CoolNumber {\r\n    int8 coolNumber = 0;\r\n    \r\n    function GetCoolNumber() public view returns (int8) {\r\n        return coolNumber;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    function SetCoolNumber(int8 n) public {\r\n        coolNumber = n;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n2. Compile and then deploy the smart contract\r\n3. Run this python script with ABI.py in the same folder:\r\n\r\n**main.py**\r\n```\r\nimport web3\r\nfrom ABI import abi\r\nimport time\r\n\r\nWeb3 = web3.Web3\r\n\r\npolling_interval = 5\r\naddress = '0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3' # replace this with the smart contract address\r\n\r\n\r\ndef main():\r\n    w3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(\"http://127.0.0.1:8545\"))\r\n    contract = w3.eth.contract(address=address, abi=abi)\r\n    while True:\r\n        x = contract.functions.GetCoolNumber().call()\r\n        print(x)\r\n        time.sleep(polling_interval)\r\n\r\n\r\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n    main()\r\n```\r\n**ABI.py**\r\n```\r\nabi = [\r\n    {\r\n        \"inputs\": [\r\n            {\r\n                \"internalType\": \"int8\",\r\n                \"name\": \"n\",\r\n                \"type\": \"int8\"\r\n            }\r\n        ],\r\n        \"name\": \"SetCoolNumber\",\r\n        \"outputs\": [],\r\n        \"stateMutability\": \"nonpayable\",\r\n        \"type\": \"function\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        \"inputs\": [],\r\n        \"name\": \"GetCoolNumber\",\r\n        \"outputs\": [\r\n            {\r\n                \"internalType\": \"int8\",\r\n                \"name\": \"\",\r\n                \"type\": \"int8\"\r\n            }\r\n        ],\r\n        \"stateMutability\": \"view\",\r\n        \"type\": \"function\"\r\n    }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n4. Alternatively in the hardhat console type `const coolNumber = await (await ethers.getContractFactory(\"CoolNumber\")).attach(\"0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3\")`\r\n5. Then type: `await coolNumber.GetCoolNumber()` but replace the address with the contract address.\r\n\r\n## Actual behaviour:\r\nIn hardhat console when trying to call `GetCoolNumber()`:\r\n```\r\n> await token.GetCoolNumber()\r\nUncaught:\r\nError: call revert exception (method=\"GetCoolNumber()\", errorArgs=null, errorName=null, errorSignature=null, reason=null, code=CALL_EXCEPTION, version=abi/5.3.0)\r\n    at step (/home/manjaro/gitstuff/solidity-stuff/node_modules/@ethersproject/contracts/lib/index.js:48:23)\r\n    at Contract.<anonymous> (/home/manjaro/gitstuff/solidity-stuff/node_modules/@ethersproject/contracts/src.ts/index.ts:321:44)\r\n    at Interface.decodeFunctionResult (/home/manjaro/gitstuff/solidity-stuff/node_modules/@ethersproject/abi/src.ts/interface.ts:384:23)\r\n    at Logger.throwError (/home/manjaro/gitstuff/solidity-stuff/node_modules/@ethersproject/logger/src.ts/index.ts:225:20)\r\n    at Logger.makeError (/home/manjaro/gitstuff/solidity-stuff/node_modules/@ethersproject/logger/src.ts/index.ts:213:28) {\r\n  reason: null,\r\n  code: 'CALL_EXCEPTION',\r\n  method: 'GetCoolNumber()',\r\n  errorArgs: null,\r\n  errorName: null,\r\n  errorSignature: null,\r\n  address: '0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3',\r\n  args: [],\r\n  transaction: {\r\n    data: '0xdba6cc19',\r\n    to: '0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3',\r\n    from: '0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266'\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIn python trying to call `GetCoolNumber()`:\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/home/manjaro/PycharmProjects/onest/venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/web3/contract.py\", line 1513, in call_contract_function\r\n    output_data = web3.codec.decode_abi(output_types, return_data)\r\n  File \"/home/manjaro/PycharmProjects/onest/venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/eth_abi/codec.py\", line 181, in decode_abi\r\n    return decoder(stream)\r\n  File \"/home/manjaro/PycharmProjects/onest/venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/eth_abi/decoding.py\", line 127, in __call__\r\n    return self.decode(stream)\r\n  File \"/home/manjaro/PycharmProjects/onest/venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/eth_utils/functional.py\", line 45, in inner\r\n    return callback(fn(*args, **kwargs))\r\n  File \"/home/manjaro/PycharmProjects/onest/venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/eth_abi/decoding.py\", line 173, in decode\r\n    yield decoder(stream)\r\n  File \"/home/manjaro/PycharmProjects/onest/venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/eth_abi/decoding.py\", line 127, in __call__\r\n    return self.decode(stream)\r\n  File \"/home/manjaro/PycharmProjects/onest/venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/eth_abi/decoding.py\", line 198, in decode\r\n    raw_data = self.read_data_from_stream(stream)\r\n  File \"/home/manjaro/PycharmProjects/onest/venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/eth_abi/decoding.py\", line 305, in read_data_from_stream\r\n    raise InsufficientDataBytes(\r\neth_abi.exceptions.InsufficientDataBytes: Tried to read 32 bytes.

    "body": "> As the warning says, you are making a `eth_call` in an account with no code. That usually happens when you use two different instances of the hardhat network. For example, if you have a script that deploys the contract and another that uses the contract, and you do `hh run deploy.js && hh run useContract.js`, each script will create, use and destroy a temporary, in-process hardhat network.\r\n> \r\n\r\nSir, Do you mean it will deploy our project on a completely different network if we use `\"npx hardhat run scripts/sample.js\"` rather `\"npx hardhat run scripts/sample.js --network localhost\"`?? So where is the network that the first deployment command points to? \r\n\r\nlocalhost is different from the default network of the Hardhat? \r\n\r\nI guess localhost refers to the network we see on the terminal by typing \"npx hardhat node\"\r\n\r\nPlease correct me wherever I am wrong!\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n",

Otherwise you would have to do something like \"start a node in one terminal, run `hh test --network localhost` in another terminal, then kill the node in the first one\". You can think about the in-process Hardhat Network as a shortcut for that (there are other subtle differences though, like the fact that there's no HTTP involved).",

Sometimes the script passes without any issues and sometimes the node gives out the warnings which fails the script.
