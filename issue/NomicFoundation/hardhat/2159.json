  "body": "The value of the `gas` config of the Hardhat network is equal to the block gas limit by default. For the rest of the networks, the default value is `\"auto\"`, which means that `eth_estimateGas` is used when an explicit gas limit is not specified. The reason this value is different for the Hardhat network is performance: if you don't estimate the gas, transactions are executed significantly faster.\r\n\r\nThis was fine before the London hardfork, but now this default behavior causes an issue in a fairly common situation:\r\n\r\n1) You are forking mainnet. This means that (by default) the base fee will match the one in the mainnet.\r\n2) You impersonate an account that doesn't have a lot of ETH (unlike the default ones, that have 1000 ETH each)\r\n\r\nThese two factors mean that the base price of the tx (`gasLimit * gasPrice`) will likely be higher than the balance of the impersonated account. This leads to an error that is frequently being reported:\r\n\r\n```\r\nInvalidInputError: sender doesn't have enough funds to send tx. The max upfront cost is: ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe solution here is easy: to use `\"auto\"` as the default `gas` value for the Hardhat network too. This will have an impact on our performance, so to partially compensate for that, we also need to add a \"Performance optimization\" guide. This should include the tip of using a fixed gas limit for faster execution, and also some explanation about pinning a block number when forking (this is already [documented](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network/guides/mainnet-forking.html#pinning-a-block)).",
