  "body": "I think the reversion of default EVM version of the Solidity compiler back to `paris` (from `shanghai`, currently the latest) warranted a minor (instead of patch) version number increment (e.g. 2.18.x), as the behavior and outputs have been changed.\r\n\r\nPeople who have been developing without issue based on what was default may only *find out by surprise* after updating and noticing that all of their contracts got recompiled. Others may not even notice it and proceed with deployments. Such an automatic downgrade of EVM version and recompilation may not be welcome.\r\n\r\nA version update from 2.17.2 to 2.17.3 appears on the surface to be a bug fix, so most people may not check the change log whenever there are such small patch version number increments.\r\n\r\nAlso, people who newly install hardhat may want and expect to only use the latest versions of everything and would only accept a downgrade if they must. So such a downgrade would not be welcome for those who use Ethereum or Polygon zkEVM, as the `PUSH0` EVM opcode works fine on those.\r\n\r\nMaybe there should be a new message about this when users actually do a compile so that they can take action beforehand instead of letting hardhat do an automatic downgrade almost invisibly.\r\n\r\nOne idea may be to no longer have `evmVersion` optional, so that an error appears, forcing the user to choose which one they really want to use and to add it explicity into hardhat.config.js.\r\n\r\nAlso, it may be good to print the actual solc version and EVM version that is being used when compiling. I show the hardhat solidity settings in my own hardhat-yul repository, e.g.: https://github.com/SKYBITDev3/hardhat-yul/blob/9f842908faef020ed37e36b27edb30a3a5c52e44/src/compilation.ts#L113\r\n",
