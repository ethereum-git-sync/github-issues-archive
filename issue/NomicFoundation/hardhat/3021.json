  "body": "Repro steps:\r\n\r\n1) check out https://github.com/thecointech/thecoin\r\n2) yarn && yarn build\r\n3) cd ./libs/contract-tools && yarn emulator\r\n4) cd ./libs/contract-core && yarn dev:live\r\n\r\nThis should take about 5 mins to get up and running, which is a lot less than it'll take me to build a minimal repro: but if you run into any issues I'll try and do the legwork to make something smaller.\r\n\r\nThis starts a local node, attempts to deploy an upgradeable contract.  This all seems pretty straight-forward, the only unusual thing about this is that I am running on Windows.\r\n\r\nERROR: \r\nI'm getting a ECONNRESET nearly every time when running the scripts un-interrupted.  However, if I put a breakpoint under the various web calls (or in  undici's `onData` & `onComplete` to add a pause after every web call) the deploy finishes successfully.  Viewing the output from `node` there are no error messages and it appears that the request is serviced correctly.\r\n\r\nMy suspicion is that it's some kind of timing error, perhaps a 2nd request is logged before the first has finished cleaning up after itself and while it is waiting for it's response the 1st call closes the connection (again, handwavy somehow?)\r\n\r\nWORKAROUND:\r\n\r\nI'm fairly confident the provider is the source of the issues, because if I replace the hre provider with a (mostly-standard) ethers version the deploy works correctly:\r\n```\r\n  const owner = await getSigner(\"Owner\"); // Returns JsonRpcSigner\r\n  //@ts-ignore These two types are compatible, \r\n  hre.network.provider = owner.provider!;\r\n```\r\n",
