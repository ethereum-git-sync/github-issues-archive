  "body": "We should add a page under hardhat.org/support that explains how to get help. Something like:\r\n\r\n- If you have questions, use our discord server (should we add the github's discussions page too?)\r\n- If you think you've run into a bug and you have reproduction steps, open an issue. Sending a minimal reproducible example will increase the chances of us working on it.\r\n- If you have a feature request, open an issue (or start a discussion?)\r\n\r\nBesides adding this page, we should show it in hardhat's `--help` output. Mocha does something very nice:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/417134/139300068-85c2528d-e939-48a1-ae7a-b248572e634c.png)\r\n",
