    "body": "Just wanted to add that when using solc directly you can even add *context* to a remapping which would let you substitute that particular version of `IERC20.sol` only in `Contract.sol` while keeping the other files unaffected:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    ...\r\n    \"settings\":\r\n    {\r\n        \"remappings\": [\"@ext-library/contracts/Contract.sol:@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol=Path/To/@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol\"],\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee [Import Remapping](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/path-resolution.html#import-remapping) in the docs.\r\n\r\nIt's already supported in Standard JSON so letting user specify remappings in his Hardhat config should be straighforward. The problem is that remappings affect import resolution which means that Hardhat would have to parse them and properly take them into account in the code that locates imported files on disk. The use case described in this issue is pretty niche so I can understand the team not wanting to complicate the code by adding this feature.",

Is it to change the version of the library?\r\n\r\nI thought I'd add since it's been some time since this ticket was opened. With a lot of repos using dapptools/foundry the openzeppelin files are now found in lib. \r\n\r\nDapptools and the vscode plugins defer to remappings.txt so have no problem finding OZ source but hardhat won't look outside of node_modules for the OZ dependencies.\r\n\r\nWhile dapptools is useful for testing in solidity, many of us still prefer our deployments and tasks make use of hardhat. Unfortunately, without the ability to do remapping like solc/dapptools/vs-code plugins do, hardhat and dapptools don't play nice in the same repo.\r\n\r\nOnly workaround is to copy paste OZ files which is a security anti-pattern (OZ themselves will call you out for \"vendoring\" files if they see that while auditing you).",
