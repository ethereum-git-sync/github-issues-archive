Instead, we are about to release a feature that lets you add any network in your config.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about that [here](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/tree/main/packages/hardhat-etherscan#adding-support-for-other-networks). Notice that this isn't released yet, but you can install it with the `rc` branch: `npm i @nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan@rc`\r\n\r\nThis can also be packaged into a community plugin, check [this example](https://github.com/fvictorio/hardhat-custom-chain-plugin-example) to learn how. I would wait until the feature is properly released in the `latest` tag before doing that though.",
