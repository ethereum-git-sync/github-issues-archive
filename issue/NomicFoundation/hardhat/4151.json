  "body": "If you use fixtures and `hardhat_reset`, you will likely run into an error like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFixtureSnapshotError: There was an error reverting the snapshot of the fixture.\r\n\r\nThis might be caused by using nested loadFixture calls in a test, for example by using multiple beforeEach calls. This is not supported yet.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat message is misleading, and also a lie: we support nested loadFixture calls now.\r\n\r\nTwo things to do here:\r\n- Update that error message\r\n- Check if there's an easy way to detect that there was a reset and act accordingly (just clear the fixtures array in that case I guess?)",
