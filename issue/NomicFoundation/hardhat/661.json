  "body": "I'd like to use solhint's junit formatter as part of our CI workflow, but it appears that the `check` task added by `buidler-solhint` doesn't provide a way to set the formatter. Optimally we'd be able to pass `--formatter junit` to the `check` task in order to customize this.\r\n\r\nIt appears that this plugin already has partial support for custom formatters, but that this has not been surfaced to the user interface. https://github.com/nomiclabs/buidler/blob/0183504555c2aed2e3ea7e63b6ddeb656ce7d4f7/packages/buidler-solhint/src/index.ts#L12",
