The best way to do this is to include a [Minimal Reproducible Example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example). If you can't do that, then include a link to your repo, and the steps to reproduce the problem. The easiest it is to reproduce your problem, the faster we are going to be able to fix it.\r\n\r\nIf you are submitting a feature request, please take the time to clearly describe your use case, and not only your proposed solution.\r\n\r\nThis issue will be automatically assigned to a Hardhat team member. This person will act as the point of contact between you and the team, but won't necessarily fix it nor address it in any way. An issue being assigned does not mean that it's being worked on.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI'm writing a plugin where user config can be a string or RegExp (for filtering). However, when trying to use the RegExp, hardhat crashes with `TypeError: RegExp.prototype.global getter called on non-RegExp object`. This is because the RegExp isn't actually bound to the original object. [This StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36394479/proxies-on-regexps-and-boxed-primitives) describes the problem and a potential solution.\r\n",
