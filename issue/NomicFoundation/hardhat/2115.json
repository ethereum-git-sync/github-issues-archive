  "body": "I'm trying to run OpenZeppelin tests using the new, experimental IR code generator of the Solidity compiler (`viaIR: true`) and I'm running into failures that do not happen when using the default code generator. I tracked it down to Hardhat's stack trace module misdetecting a revert caused by an integer overflow as `CONTRACT_TOO_LARGE_ERROR`.\r\n\r\nI think that the most likely cause is that some the current heuristics make too strong assumptions about the output from the default code generator and need to be updated to handle the new one as well.

    "body": "No, it definitely overflows. The test sets `amount` to `MAX_UINT256` and both `amount` and `fee` are `uint256`. Any non-zero fee will cause an overflow [at line 72 in `ERC20FlashMint.sol`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v4.4.1/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC20FlashMint.sol#L72):\r\n```solidity\r\nrequire(currentAllowance >= amount + fee, \"ERC20FlashMint: allowance does not allow refund\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut your case is interesting nevertheless. Were you using the IR-based codegen (i.e. `viaIR: true`)? If not, then it means that it's not only the new codegen that breaks this heuristic and this bug should get a higher priority.\r\n\r\nIn any case, thanks for the workaround - might help some people who run into this and find this issue - but the point here is to fix the problem at its core. It's not even my own code, it's OpenZeppelin :) and with the current heuristic it will stop passing the tests once we make the new codegen the default and deprecate the old one (which should happen some time next year).",

    "body": "Hi @cameel , sorry for the delayed reply here. \r\n\r\nWhile this is definitely a bug, and there are likely others that exist revolving around IR-based codegen, the fixes to fully support `viaIR: true` would be nontrivial at best. Do you have an expected timeline on when IR codegen will become stable? That would greatly help us in figuring out where exactly to prioritize this issue within our own timeline.\r\n\r\nFor the time being I'll label and add to our backlog.\r\n\r\nThanks!",

    "body": "Getting the IR codegen out is actually one of the big milestones we have planned for Q1 2022 so you can expect this to happen soon. It's already feature-complete and we're at the stage where we're testing it with bigger projects and tweaking the optimizer to ensure that it's as efficient or better than the current codegen. It likely won't become the default for some time yet - we need better support on the tooling side for that to happen.\r\n\r\nThis bug report is actually one of the things that came out of that testing. We have a test suite that compiles selected external projects and runs their tests as a canary to detect any unintended breaking changes in the compiler that would affect them. I'm currently adding viaIR runs for these projects and this bug is for example a blocker for the OpenZeppelin test. Most of the projects we want to test have switched to Hardhat recently so we have a bit of a chicken and egg problem here :)",

    "body": "Great!\r\n\r\nI don't think code generation will change very much. Most of the work now is on improving the optimizer, fixing bugs and dealing with \"stack too deep\" in the Yul-EVM transform. All the structure is already there and we're working within that structure rather than still extending it.\r\n\r\nWe actually consider it pretty stable already. It has no show-stopper bugs. No guarantees yet but, honestly, the remaining work is more about making it more efficient than making it work at all. From what I have seen so far compiling various projects, the only real problem is the \"stack too deep\" error. It does happen more frequently and some projects cannot compile via IR at all due to this at the moment (see https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12343). But the fix for that is our new Yul->EVM transform and dealing with it only requires some incremental tweaks. Other than that, in projects that did not have this problem I haven't detected any breakage or tests failing with the new codegen and still passing with the old one. Except for the ones where viaIR breaks heuristics of course.\r\n\r\nWe'd like to see it as default as soon as possible but I think we'll have to wait for the tooling to catch up. Otherwise that will be a bad experience for users. We'll definitely need to coordinate that somehow. This would be a good topic to discuss on the tooling channel.\r\n\r\nMaking it experimental sounds good to me. It's still marked as experimental in the compiler as well. We're not yet at the point where users actually want that in production so we really only need enough support to be able to test it in a more complete configuration with both the compiler and the framework.",
