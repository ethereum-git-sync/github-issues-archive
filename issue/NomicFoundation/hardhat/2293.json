  "body": "I have a plugin that leverages a global param \"environment\" that allows one to specify environments within a network.\r\n\r\nIt would be lovely if it was possible to add new parameters to Hardhat that were globally accessible by plugins. Then, my plugin could pick up these parameters \"under the hood\" so to speak, for use for tasks and such that need them.\r\n\r\nThe current strategy is to wrap `task` with a task that always has an environment flag, which is really tacky and also requires the the user to manage the environment arg.\r\n\r\nSomething as simple as `hre.args` containing argument values specified by some extendCLI function would be nice.",
