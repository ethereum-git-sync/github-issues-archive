  "body": "Hi!\r\n\r\nI am receiving the following issue randomly when I call the borrow function on `LendingPool.sol` in my tests on an aave fork with some architectural changes. The error happens next to the emit Borrow event as you can see by the picture:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45543880/134660064-d7e5b4f7-3876-4c3b-8be1-19a651a6a175.png)\r\n\r\nCopy paste of the message for context:\r\n```\r\n  Error: Transaction reverted and Hardhat couldn't infer the reason. Please report this to help us improve Hardhat.\r\n      at LendingPool._sendLogPayload (hardhat/console.sol:12)\r\n      at LendingPool.log (hardhat/console.sol:173)\r\n      at LendingPool._executeBorrow (contracts/protocol/lendingpool/LendingPool.sol:934)\r\n      at LendingPool.borrow (contracts/protocol/lendingpool/LendingPool.sol:269)\r\n      at InitializableImmutableAdminUpgradeabilityProxy._delegate (contracts/dependencies/openzeppelin/upgradeability/Proxy.sol:41)\r\n      at InitializableImmutableAdminUpgradeabilityProxy._fallback (contracts/dependencies/openzeppelin/upgradeability/Proxy.sol:70)\r\n      at processTicksAndRejections (internal/process/task_queues.js:95:5)\r\n      at async HardhatNode._mineBlockWithPendingTxs (node_modules/hardhat/src/internal/hardhat-network/provider/node.ts:1582:23)\r\n      at async HardhatNode.mineBlock (node_modules/hardhat/src/internal/hardhat-network/provider/node.ts:435:16)\r\n      at async EthModule._sendTransactionAndReturnHash (node_modules/hardhat/src/internal/hardhat-network/provider/modules/eth.ts:1494:18)\r\n      at async HardhatNetworkProvider.request (node_modules/hardhat/src/internal/hardhat-network/provider/provider.ts:108:18)\r\n      at async EthersProviderWrapper.send (node_modules/@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers/src/internal/ethers-provider-wrapper.ts:13:20)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the same error, without using hardhat/console.sol (again, doesn't pop everytime so have to re-run tests many times to trigger it). It shows as if the error comes in the Borrow emit event.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45543880/134661524-da5f9113-8f89-4c40-9b88-359fc99e4a26.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis seems related to #1320 , but due to its random behavior (doesn't happen on every test run) I can't really find the true source of the problem. \r\n\r\nOne note is that our contract code is almost next to the size limit and our tests do multiple borrows in rapid succession when this happens (a batch of 5 times 4 in this test suite). When the issue appears it usually happens next to the 4th or 5th borrow in that batch (we use a for loop in the tests to call borrow). Could there be some limit on hardhat itself to the event logs that are produced? We are using the latest hardhat version '2.6.4' if it helps.\r\n\r\nThis is hindering our CI/CD implementation so if there's anything I can do on my side to support solving or reproducing it better, let me know!\r\n\r\nThank so so much\r\n\r\n\r\n",
