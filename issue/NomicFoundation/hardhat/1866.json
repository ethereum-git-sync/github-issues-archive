  "body": "Ethers.js provider usually inherits from the `abstract-provider` class. This class includes a `getFeeData()` function, which sets the maxPriorityFeePerGas to 2.5gwei at the provider level. This can be overridden to change the value.\r\n\r\nIt is really useful to be able to set such values at the provider (or signer) level rather than in each transaction. This makes sure any oversight is covered, and also that these settings are applied if we pass the signer/provider to a module (like @openzeppelin/upgrades).\r\n\r\nThis works well with ethers alone, but the provider that comes with @hardhat/ethers is different:\r\n\r\n- it is a proxy, which doesn't let us override functions like `getFeeData`\r\n- for some reason, it doesn't use `getFeeData`, and apply its own `maxPriorityFeePerGas` of 1gwei\r\n- AFAIK, and as far as the documentation is concerned, there is no way to change that priority fee in the config.\r\n\r\nMy solution has been to wrap `network.provider` into an `ethers.provider.FallbackProvider`, but then I lose control over the signer (JSONRPC signers cannot be connected to another provider easily) ... and its a huge mess\r\n\r\n## Request:\r\n\r\nIn hardhat.config.jon, allow setting a custom `maxPriorityFee` per network\r\n\r\n```\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  networks: {\r\n    mainnet: {\r\n      url: process.env.MAINNET_NODE,\r\n      accounts: { mnemonic: process.env.MAINNET_MNEMONIC },\r\n      maxPriorityFee: ethers.utils.parseUnits('2.51', 'gwei'). // ‚Üê THIS\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n",

Or would it be monkey-patching? (We are already doing that for ethers, tbh, but we want to avoid doing it even more :sweat_smile: )",
