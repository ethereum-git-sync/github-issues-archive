  "body": "### Issue\r\n\r\nWhen running `buidler test`, I am getting inconsistent error messages between local development and CI.\r\n\r\nSee failed build on CircleCI here -> https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/mstable/mStable-contracts/779/workflows/04af01d0-9f17-43a6-9094-f64c03ebff5b/jobs/782/steps\r\n\r\nRunning the same command (`yarn test`) locally shows tests passing.\r\n\r\n```\r\npackage.json:\r\n\r\n`test`: `...; yarn buidler test;`\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can't see why this would be happening, since in both circumstances it should be using the projects `buidler` version. I assume something is different about the `buidler evm`. Fwiw, I had some issues getting the tests to pass even on local\r\n\r\nEdit: For some reason it works with neither `expectRevert.assertion` or `expectRevert.unspecified` - in the former it complains about 'invalid opcode', and in the later about 'revert'..",
