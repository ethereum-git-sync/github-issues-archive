If you guys e.g. use fetch, then [fetch-mock](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fetch-mock) is a pretty good choice. But it'd depend on whether it's usable with TSC and how complex it is to find the fetch instance to monkeypatch.\r\n\r\nShameless plug, I have my own lib for testing that really spins up a temporary HTTP server using express: https://github.com/TimDaub/expressively-mocked-fetch ",
