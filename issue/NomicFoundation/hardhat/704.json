  "body": "I believe that I have my provider and contract object formatted correctly, however an event listener for a function in my contract which requires gas never fires. Default listeners (such as 'block') work fine. Additionally, I always get a \"WARNING: Calling an account which is not a contract\" error in the EVM console whenever I call a view function. I am lead to think that the deployed contract and the client are not actually connected, so no events are firing and it can't view state through a view call, while still eating gas for other functions which have errors that don't display in the console. \r\n\r\nHere is the code by which I am assigning my contract object.\r\n```javascript\r\nlet provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum);\r\nlet signer = provider.getSigner(0);\r\nlet contractInstance = new ethers.ContractFactory(abi, bytecode);\r\nlet viewInstance = new ethers.ContractFactory(abi, bytecode);\r\nlet contractAddressSpecified = contractInstance.attach(\r\n\"0x7c2C195CD6D34B8F845992d380aADB2730bB9C6F\");\r\nlet viewAddressSpecified = viewInstance.attach(\r\n\"0x7c2C195CD6D34B8F845992d380aADB2730bB9C6F\");\r\nlet contractSigner = contractAddressSpecified.connect(signer);\r\nlet viewSigner = viewAddressSpecified.connect(provider);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI derive the contract address from a deploy script:\r\n```javascript\r\n\tconst provider = await new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(\r\n\t\t\"http://127.0.0.1:8545/\"\r\n\t);\r\n\r\n\tconst Contract = await ethers.getContractFactory(\"Contract\");\r\n\tconst deployContract = await Contract.deploy();\r\n\r\n\tawait deployContract.deployed();\r\n\r\n\tconsole.log(\"Contract deployed to \", deployContract.address);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen I call the contract like so:\r\n```javascript\r\nlet ctm = await contractSigner.fireFunction(\"Input\");\r\nctm = await ctm.wait();\r\nconsole.log(\"receipt\", ctm);\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo which the transaction 'succeeds' based on the status of the tx receipt, but provides no further data and does not fire an event.",
