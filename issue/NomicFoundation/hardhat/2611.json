  "body": "Sometimes when I create a new sample project with `npx hardhat`, I see this option in the prompted messages, but I can't seem to find any information at all in the documentations about what these \"anonymous crash reports and basic usage data\" are? Also there's no instruction whatsoever on how to turn this thing on/off with an already created project, and last but not the least, it seems this prompt just appears randomly, that when creating the same sample projects with exactly the same steps (`mkdir` a new folder, `npm init` in the new folder, ` npm install --save-dev hardhat` in the new folder, and run `npx hardhat` in the new folder), sometimes I get this prompt while other times the process just finishes without showing this prompt.\r\n\r\nSo anyone can explain what these \"crash reports and usage data\" really include? Is there anyway to turn it on/of with an existing project? And why it appears sometimes but not others when creating new sample projects? Even better if there can be something in the official documentations on this? Thanks.",
