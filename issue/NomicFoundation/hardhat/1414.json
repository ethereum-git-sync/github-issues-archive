The reason is that in the `TASK_COMPILE_SOLIDITY_EMIT_ARTIFACTS` subtask we do this:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat/blob/1830ef48f495e5121d86a708f7a629fc67883554/packages/hardhat-core/src/builtin-tasks/compile.ts#L797-L809\r\n\r\nThat is, we are not passing `output.sources` to the `TASK_COMPILE_SOLIDITY_GET_ARTIFACT_FROM_COMPILATION_OUTPUT`.\r\n\r\nI think the best solution is to add the **whole** output as an extra parameter. Then, an user overriding that task can do:\r\n\r\n```\r\noutput.sources[sourceName]\r\n```\r\n\r\nand do whatever they want with that.",
