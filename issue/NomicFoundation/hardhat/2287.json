When you look at the output of a script that does this, the output is just confusing and annoying.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, why is it \"already verified\" if I just deployed it and invoked the etherscan verify in the same script execution? JUST HOW? \r\n\r\nThis is a failure inside the plugin and/or etherscan api. I've told it to verify something I deployed moments earlier. It **cannot** be \"already verified\". \r\n\r\nI suspect some kind of handshake / timeout / retry bungle.
