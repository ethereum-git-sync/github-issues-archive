  "body": "We have a `gasPrice` option in the network config that lets you set the default gas price (or use `\"auto\"` by default).\r\n\r\nThere are two problems with this:\r\n- If you set a number for the gas price, Hardhat will use legacy transactions instead of EIP-1559 txs.\r\n- Even if we fixed that, there's no way to configure the default `maxPriorityFeePerGas` value\r\n\r\nI think the solution is to add just one new field, `maxPriorityFeePerGas`. If it's set, only EIP-1559 txs will be sent.\r\n\r\nBut there are a lot of combinations here that we need to define:\r\n\r\n- What happens if `gasPrice` is `auto` but `maxPriorityFeePerGas` is set to some number?\r\n- How does `gasMultiplier` affects the priority fee value?\r\n- What is the default value of `maxPriorityFeePerGas`? Does `\"auto\"` makes sense here? What would that even mean?\r\n\r\nRelated issues:\r\n- https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/issues/1866, which is about being able to do this for ethers",
