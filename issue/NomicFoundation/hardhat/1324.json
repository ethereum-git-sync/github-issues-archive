  "body": "Hi. I noticed that batch requests seem to only be supported when using http and not websockets. Looking at [handler.ts](https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat/blob/master/packages/hardhat-core/src/internal/hardhat-network/jsonrpc/handler.ts) it seems like a trivial fix. Since I need this for my project I will fork hardhat and implement it. Are you interested in a PR for this?\r\n\r\nSearch terms: BatchRequest",

    "body": "Hi @fvictorio. I made a quick and dirty edit that seems to work for at least receiving and executing the array of transactions, but to get them to execute in parallell we would also have to update the EIP1193Provider to also support batch transactions. [Here's the edit](https://github.com/Miyou/hardhat/commit/c5feb8a06378f00dc588eaa6d2368eedd16b5c0c). It can be tested with the following snippet which works after the edit is applied, but not before: `npx wscat -c 127.0.0.1:8545 -x '[{\"method\":\"eth_blockNumber\",\"params\":[],\"id\":1,\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\"},{\"method\":\"eth_blockNumber\",\"params\":[],\"id\":1,\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\"}]'`.\r\n\r\nSince this works for now I'll continue with other tasks on my project, but if you are interested I could clean the code up a bit and submit a PR?",
