I'm sorry to hear of your trouble, but it wouldn't make sense for us to disable support for Node 12 on all platforms simply because it doesn't work on one platform. However, if its any consolation to you, our policy is to discontinue support for Node versions two months after they reach End-of-Life status, and for Node 12 that status was reached on April 30, 2022.",
