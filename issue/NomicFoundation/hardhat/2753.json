  "body": "Hi!\r\n\r\nAfter the latest hardhat release (2.9.6), I noticed that some tests for the project I work for began to fail. After investigation it appeared that the following assembly code no longer returns chainId value that is configured in the `hardhat.config.js`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nassembly {\r\n   id := chainid()\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can find minimal reproducible example in this repository: \r\nhttps://github.com/kasperpawlowski/hardhat-mre\r\n\r\nI believe that this is pure oversight. The logic is written in a way that when `_forkBlockNumber` is undefined, `_forkNetworkId` is returned as `chainId` which shouldn't be the case I guess. I noticed that the bug was introduced in the following commit:\r\nhttps://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/commit/0d4a30f535a9c5ea196ce1da8e1d6de0a88418c3\r\n\r\nIt seems that the bug is simple to fix, take a look here:\r\nhttps://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/compare/master...kasperpawlowski:fix-chainId?expand=1\r\n\r\nIt went unnoticed because the tests for `chainId` are currently skipped for the non-fork mode. Please look at the branch I linked above. If you agree with my analysis I'll be happy to create PR.",
