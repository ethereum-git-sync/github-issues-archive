  "body": "We should change how `console.log` is implemented, and log immediately when it's called.\r\n\r\n`console.log` is implemented by inspecting the transactions' execution traces after they have finished executing.\r\n\r\nIn the context of a non-forked Hardhat Network, this is approximately the same as executing as soon as `console.log` is called, as transactions are executed really fast.\r\n\r\nWhen forking, transactions can take a long time to run, so logging at the end is not the same. For example, users may want to interrupt them if a log shows that something went wrong, which is not possible.",
