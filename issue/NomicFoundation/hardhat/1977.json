  "body": "I was going through the documentation of how to create a task at https://hardhat.org/guides/create-task.html#creating-a-task and have a couple questions:\r\n\r\n# Task Creation\r\n1. Why is the recommended library `web3.js` instead of `ether.js`? If it's just for historical reasons, I'd be more than happy to update the documentation accordingly if someone üëç . I personally think `ether.js` is easier to use for most cases.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n2. The task I created let me list out all my local wallets and there balances but I couldn't figure out how I could set a custom initial balance on all my wallets in hardhat tests. Is it possible? If so, could someone point me in the right direction?",

You can read more about it here: https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network/reference/#config -- Note that we don't use github issues for support questions though.\r\n\r\nI'm closing this issue, but if you send the PR will review it and merge it.\r\n\r\nThanks",
