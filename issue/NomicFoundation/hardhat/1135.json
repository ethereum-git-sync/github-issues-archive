    "body": "# The three steps journey to solve this issue\r\n\r\nI am happy to contribute to this issue with the results of my investigation in order to aid the development of this wonderful project. As it was pointed out by @imkrish by here and our _Discord_ channel there seems to be some lack that could be tackled in order to improve _HardHat_.\r\n\r\nThe tests linked to this issue are these:\r\nhttps://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat/blob/974362a5f7af53b9c1b1617f708da40c5b422f39/packages/hardhat-waffle/test/fixture-projects/hardhat-project/test/tests.js#L15-L39\r\n\r\nThese tests return correct results, taking into account the exception thrown by the methods below:\r\nhttps://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat/blob/974362a5f7af53b9c1b1617f708da40c5b422f39/packages/hardhat-waffle/src/waffle-chai.ts#L64-L80\r\n\r\nOf course these methods **could be properly included in HardHat** by adding to the `packages/hardhat-waffle/src/waffle-chai.ts` file (the one which extract has been shown above). In order to do so there are thre steps to accomplish:\r\n\r\n## First step: Add the `require` and delete the throwers\r\n\r\nThe function definitions above should be deleted and the corresponding requires should be used for each one of these methods:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nconst { supportCalledOnContract } = require(`${waffleChaiPath}/matchers/calledOnContract/calledOnContract`);\r\nconst { supportCalledOnContractWith } = require(`${waffleChaiPath}/matchers/calledOnContract/calledOnContractWith`);\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Second step: Add `history` to the provider used\r\n\r\nMy investigations led to understand why this has been taken out of the _Hardhat_ routes. It seems that a `history` getter should be embedded under the mock provider used. This could be seen at the `waffle-chai` repository, particularly at https://github.com/EthWorks/Waffle/blob/8c5942d326c43673257f02e92c37b45c6d2d3ec1/waffle-chai/src/matchers/calledOnContract/calledOnContractValidators.ts#L13-L17 where the validation takes place, a `callHistory` method should be present at the mock provider used. At the `waffle-chai` tests this is accomplished by using `MockProvider` from `@ethereum-waffle/provider` as shown in https://github.com/EthWorks/Waffle/blob/8c5942d326c43673257f02e92c37b45c6d2d3ec1/waffle-chai/test/matchers/calledOnContract/calledOnContractWith.test.ts#L1.\r\n\r\nThis could be accomplished at our project by adding to our mock provider used something similar to what is found at https://github.com/EthWorks/Waffle/blob/8c5942d326c43673257f02e92c37b45c6d2d3ec1/waffle-provider/src/MockProvider.ts and https://github.com/EthWorks/Waffle/blob/8c5942d326c43673257f02e92c37b45c6d2d3ec1/waffle-provider/src/CallHistory.ts. But, the mock provider is not used at the matchers tests.\r\n\r\nThis is the step I am stuck and could not solve by now, as some modifications need to be accomplished. Should I add the history to the main _HardHat_ provider? That would be set at the `createProvider` method at `packages/hardhat-core/src/internal/core/providers/construction.ts`.\r\n\r\n## Third and last step: Modify tests (maybe the first step for the TDD people)\r\nTests present below should be modified in order to accomplish the expected task to be accomplished. \r\nhttps://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat/blob/974362a5f7af53b9c1b1617f708da40c5b422f39/packages/hardhat-waffle/test/fixture-projects/hardhat-project/test/tests.js#L15-L39 ",
