Otherwise you could be signing a replayable transaction. In most cases this will be safe, but we are erring on the side of being paranoid here.\r\n\r\nSo, that being said, I think we should close this in favor of #2305? I'm going to tentatively do that, but please let me know if you disagree and I'll re-open.",
