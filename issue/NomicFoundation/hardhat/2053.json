    "body": "this happens because ws subscriptions are implemented as filters, which have a deadline of 5 minutes and get removed after that if you haven't called `eth_getFilterChanges` to poll them, which you obviously don't need to do if you're receiving changes through a websocket.\r\n\r\ni think the way to fix this is just to ignore the filter deadline for subscriptions, since polling a websocket filter to keep it active doesn't really make sense.",
