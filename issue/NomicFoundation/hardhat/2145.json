  "body": "By default, once you start to make use of chai assertions which are not functions e.g. \r\n`expect(await contract.someFunction()).to.not.be.undefined;`\r\nESLint complains with the [no-unused-expressions](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-unused-expressions) rule. It's a common enough issue that someone created a new ESLint rule in [eslint-plugin-chai-friendly](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-chai-friendly) which correctly changes the default ruleset to allow such chai expressions.\r\n\r\nI propose that we add this to the advanced (and advanced-ts) sample projects. I've already made the necessary changes in a [commit here](https://github.com/GavinPacini/hardhat/commit/c72b6034634644abe52422ad5cb49fbf76c3dec3) and if there is some consensus (as required by the PR rules), I'll open a PR.",
