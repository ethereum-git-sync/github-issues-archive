  "body": "When I use `@openzeppelin/hardhat-upgrades` to deploy conntracts, I encountered a confusing situation, here it is:\r\n```typscript\r\n    // deploy.ts\r\n    const ITToken = await ethers.getContractFactory('ITToken')\r\n    console.log(await ethers.provider.getTransactionCount(owner.address))\r\n    const itToken1 = await upgrades.deployProxy(ITToken, [])\r\n    console.log(await ethers.provider.getTransactionCount(owner.address))\r\n    const itToken2 = await upgrades.deployProxy(ITToken, [])\r\n    console.log(await ethers.provider.getTransactionCount(owner.address))\r\n```\r\n\r\n```cmd\r\n0\r\nITToken 0x9fE46736679d2D9a65F0992F2272dE9f3c7fa6e0\r\n3\r\nITToken 0xCf7Ed3AccA5a467e9e704C703E8D87F634fB0Fc9\r\n4\r\n```\r\n\r\nsee! The second deployed only  has one contract! **Whether there is a configuration to ensure the complete deployment of each execution of deploy.ts? I have a code that predicts the contract address that doesn't work well**, like this: \r\nps: targetContract and ProxyAdmin are reused in the second execution, so I have to modifier the nonce to `nocne+1` or reboot network node to ensure `expectPledgeNftPool` is correct...a little annoying...\r\n```typescript\r\n    const expectPledgeNftPool = ethers.utils.getContractAddress({\r\n        from: owner.address,\r\n        nonce: await ethers.provider.getTransactionCount(owner.address) + 3,\r\n    });\r\n```\r\n",

Two inconsistent behaviors make me unable to predict the contract address with fixed `getContractAddress`, As you said, it's related to OpenZeppelin, thanks again!",
