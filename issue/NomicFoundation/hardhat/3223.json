    "body": "> Btw, if you are interested in sending a PR that fixes this, I think it should include:\r\n> \r\n> 1. Trimming the mnemonic (probably in `src/internal/util/keys-derivation.ts`, although you could argue that it should be done in the config resolution... maybe both places should do it)\r\n> 2. Adding a couple of tests that check that the same keys are generated for `mnemonic`, `\\n${mnemonic}`, `    ${mnemonic}`, `${mnemonic}   ` and `${mnemonic}\\n` (you can add those in the `./test/internal/util/keys-derivation.ts` test suite).\r\n\r\nThanks for the suggestion!\r\nPlease let me fix this!",
