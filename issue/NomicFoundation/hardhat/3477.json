  "body": "The way Hardhat currently searches for a config is:\r\n- Hardhat searches for a `hardhat.config.ts` in the current directory, and then in the ancestor directories.\r\n- If none is found, the search starts over from the current directory, but a `hardhat.config.js` file is searched instead.\r\n\r\nThis is problematic [in some scenarios](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/issues/2669). Instead, we should search for any possible config file in the current directory, and then in the parent directory, and so on.\r\n\r\nI believe this is technically a breaking change, so I'm going to mark it as so. But you could argue it's a bug fix. If a lot of people need this and we are not about to release a new major soon, I could consider doing it in v2, since I feel it's unlikely to break someone's workflow. But, [you know...](https://xkcd.com/1172/)",
