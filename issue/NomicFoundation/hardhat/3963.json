I am writing a javascript program that generates sdk api code for Solidity programs in hardhat environment, but it seems like the hardhat config file doesn’t support export. My assumption is that there's a restriction in hardhat, so I thought it might be best to open an issue about it to support programs that want to function in hardhat environment ",
