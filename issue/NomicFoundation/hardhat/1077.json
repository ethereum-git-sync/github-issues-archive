  "body": "It would be amazing to have more stack trace support for contract dependencies that are not compiled in your hardhat project, but that you instantiate during e.g ` mainnet forking` tests and that are verified on Etherscan. \r\n\r\nAs far as I understand hardhat needs to generate some build and debug files for a contract to be fully supported. \r\n\r\nIf the source code and compile information is available from Etherscan maybe one way to circumvent this restriction is to have hardhat pull the source and compile info from Etherscan during runtime and compile the contracts and generate the needed build and debug files for them, to allow stack traces. \r\n\r\nMaybe one could let hardhat know it should do that for certain contract addresses.\r\n\r\nA config like: \r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nforking: {\r\n     verifiedExternalContracts: [ \"someAddress\", \"someOtherAddress\" ] \r\n```\r\n\r\ncould let hardhat know what contract instances to go and try to pull info from Etherscan and compile locally for. \r\n",
