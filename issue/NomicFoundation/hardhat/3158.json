  "body": "Hi.\r\nI'm having a similar issue to #2980 despite using the proposed solution from https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/issues/2980#issuecomment-1208451537\r\n\r\nMinimal steps to reproduce:\r\n1. npm init\r\n2. npm install hardhat\r\n3. create sample project and install its dependencies\r\n4. in test/Lock.ts add:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  async function testFixture() {\r\n    const { lock, unlockTime, lockedAmount, owner, otherAccount } = await deployOneYearLockFixture();\r\n    // do anything or nothing here. doesn't matter.\r\n    return { lock, unlockTime, lockedAmount, owner, otherAccount };\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nadd two sets of test cases:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    describe(\"B\", function () {\r\n      it(\"B\", async function () {\r\n        const { lock, unlockTime, lockedAmount, owner } = await loadFixture(\r\n          testFixture\r\n        );\r\n      });\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    describe(\"A-B\", function () {\r\n      it(\"A\", async function () {\r\n        const { lock, unlockTime, lockedAmount, owner } = await loadFixture(\r\n          deployOneYearLockFixture\r\n        );\r\n      });\r\n\r\n      it(\"B\", async function () {\r\n        const { lock, unlockTime, lockedAmount, owner } = await loadFixture(\r\n          testFixture\r\n        );\r\n      });\r\n    });\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe second B fails with:\r\n```\r\nFixtureSnapshotError: There was an error reverting the snapshot of the fixture.\r\n\r\nThis might be caused by using nested loadFixture calls in a test, for example by using multiple beforeEach calls. This is not supported yet.\r\n      at loadFixture (/private/tmp/test-hardhat/node_modules/@nomicfoundation/hardhat-network-helpers/src/loadFixture.ts:47:15)\r\n      at processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:96:5)\r\n      at async Context.<anonymous> (/private/tmp/test-hardhat/test/Lock.ts:147:59)\r\n  \r\n      Caused by: InvalidSnapshotError: Trying to restore an invalid snapshot.\r\n          at Object.restore (/private/tmp/test-hardhat/node_modules/@nomicfoundation/hardhat-network-helpers/src/helpers/takeSnapshot.ts:33:15)\r\n          at processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:96:5)\r\n          at async loadFixture (/private/tmp/test-hardhat/node_modules/@nomicfoundation/hardhat-network-helpers/src/loadFixture.ts:44:7)\r\n          at async Context.<anonymous> (/private/tmp/test-hardhat/test/Lock.ts:147:59)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe pattern seems to be that when you have a fixture A and a fixture B that calls A internally:\r\n```\r\nfunction A() {\r\n  // deploy\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction B() {\r\n  const { token } = await A();\r\n\r\n  // make a TX\r\n\r\n  return { ... }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen when you make a test with fixture B, then with fixture A, and then with B again, the second B always fails.\r\nIf you remove the A test from between the two B tests it works and both B tests pass.\r\nIt's as if the call to fixture A after the call to fixture B broke fixture B somehow.",
