  "body": "I have fully functional tests that run fine, but after a while of coding hardhat simply stops doing anything. I know this isn't any faulty code, because I revert back to a commit that was working and it still will not work anymore. The only thing that makes sense is bad cache, but I've repeatedly tried `yarn cache clean` aswell as `yarn hardhat clean` . To be honest this is extremely frustrating to not be able to seamlessly test. I'm running `2.9.0`. I pulled the same repo and commit into another device, and it would work fine! But again, as I progressed with my work it just suddenly stops again with no outputs or explanations. I use `yarn hardhat node` to spool up the local instance before calling the test.\r\n\r\n```\r\nyarn hardhat test ./test/unit/x.js --network localhost\r\nyarn run v1.22.18\r\n$ /media/rayyan808/5011995d-72e1-4299-bff9-8e7e5d313863/rayyan808/Documents/ELYXR/elyxr-deploy/node_modules/.bin/hardhat test ./test/unit/x.js --network localhost\r\n\r\n\r\n  0 passing (0ms)\r\n\r\nDone in 1.35s.\r\n```",
