  "body": "I was just setting up Builder when I faced an error code which the documentation asked me to report:\r\n```Error BDLR402: File /nathan/LocalCoinSwap/smart-contracts/ethereum-escrow/node_modules/@openzeppelin/contracts-ethereum-package/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20Detailed.sol belongs to a library but was treated as a local one.```\r\n\r\nI had a contract in a subfolder, with the following line which references an import from a node_module which was installed on a subdirectory level to my root Buidler installation:\r\n```import \"../node_modules/@openzeppelin/contracts-ethereum-package/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20Detailed.sol\";```\r\n\r\nI was able to resolve the error and successfully compile by installing @openzeppelin/contracts-ethereum-package in my Buidler root directory, and then changing the import line to:\r\n```import \"@openzeppelin/contracts-ethereum-package/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20Detailed.sol‚Äù;```\r\n\r\nNo big deal as I fixed it, but figured it was worth reporting as asked. I guess the issue the compiler had here is with the relative file path specification in imports, leading to this BDLR402 error",
