That isn't happening anymore.\r\n\r\nI ran the following command:\r\n```\r\nnpx hardhat clean && npx hardhat clean --global && rm -rf node_modules && yarn install && npx hardhat compile;\r\nnpx hardhat test;\r\nnpx hardhat test;\r\n```\r\n\r\n<img width=\"630\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/assets/5858247/a8067ed0-0bcc-4e4a-bff8-f7d643e3252b\">\r\n\r\nUnless `--no-compile` is specified, this behavior adds ~60s to each test run.  It's impractical to update all the callsites to address this regression.\n\n### Minimal reproduction steps\n\n```\r\nnpx hardhat clean && npx hardhat clean --global && rm -rf node_modules && yarn install && npx hardhat compile;\r\nnpx hardhat test;\r\nnpx hardhat test;\r\n```\n\n### Search terms\n\nhardhat compile every time, hardhat compile before testing",

    "body": "Hey @amarpatel, if you are running `npx hardhat compile` twice and it's compiling both times, then that's either a bug in Hardhat or something strange in your setup. The reasons why Hardhat would compile the second time are that you changed something in the files or in the solidity config, or that the cache directory was removed, or something like that.\r\n\r\nIf this is a bug, then we'll need some way to reproduce it. If you can give me or @ChristopherDedominici temporary access to your repo, we can take a look. If that's not possible, then the only thing you could do is try to create a separate reproduction repo that you can share (for example, by eliminating all the code you can while preserving the unexpected behavior).",
