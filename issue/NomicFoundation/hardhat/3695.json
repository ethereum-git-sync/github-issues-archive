  "body": "### Describe the feature\n\nWhenever a contract has several functions with the same name and different signatures, the functions are only accessible if called by their signature. In such cases, when a function is called as a function of the contract object, it throws the error of `TypeError: <function name> is not a function`. Instead, it could be helpful to show a more appropriate Error message where it points the user towards using the signature.\n\n### Search terms\n\n_No response_",
