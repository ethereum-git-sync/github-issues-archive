    "body": "Hey @Korkey128k, I think something doable and reasonable that we can do is to modify the `hardhat-etherscan` plugin so that the source of the verified contract is the first one to show up in the Etherscan contract code page. Do you think this would be enough?\r\n\r\nMore generally, I think we could do something so that you can provide a sorting function that lets you define the order of the shown contracts. But this is a bit harder to do and less valuable IMO.",
