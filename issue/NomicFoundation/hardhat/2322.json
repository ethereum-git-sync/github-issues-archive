  "body": "**Update by @alcuadrado: This issue is no longer present. Delete your `package-lock.json`/`yarn.lock` and reinstall hardhat to fix it.**\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe [documentation](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network/reference/#hardhat-impersonateaccount) says that:\r\n\r\n> Hardhat Network allows you to send transactions impersonating specific account **and contract addresses**.\r\n\r\nThis was indeed the case previously. However, when using Hardhat v2.8.3, sending a transaction from an impersonated contract address produces the following error:\r\n\r\n> invalid sender address, address is not EOA (EIP-3607)\r\n\r\nThe code that throws the error is located in the `@ethereumjs/vm` package: [src/runTx.ts#L305](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/blob/64b48b0/packages/vm/src/runTx.ts#L305-L309) and was added in [`2e92010`](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1568/commits/2e92010224a172d50afa044bc19b624a29047b44) as a part of https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1568. Notice that there's no check for whether [EIP-3607](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-3607.md) is implemented in the network.\r\n\r\nTrying to manually remove the code at the address being impersonated via the `hardhat_setCode` RPC call allows to do simple transfers from that address, but contract calls for some reason fail without a revert reason.\r\n\r\nI think that an exception should be made for an impersonated contract address even if EIP-3607 is implemented in the network being forked since impersonating a contract is a very useful technique that makes writing fork tests much easier. We use this technique a lot across our test codebase.",
