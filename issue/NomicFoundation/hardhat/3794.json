  "body": "### Version of Hardhat\n\n2.13.0\n\n### What happened?\n\nFor a while now I've gotten this warning at pretty much every `npx hardhat compile`:\r\n```\r\nYou are using a version of Node.js that is not supported by Hardhat, and it may work incorrectly, or not work at all.\r\n\r\nPlease, make sure you are using a supported version of Node.js.\r\n\r\nTo learn more about which versions of Node.js are supported go to https://hardhat.org/nodejs-versions\r\n```\r\n\r\nafter upgrading hardhat from 2.12.0 to 2.13.0, I got a slightly different message:\r\n`WARNING: You are using a version of Node.js that is not supported, and it may work incorrectly, or not work at all. See https://hardhat.org/nodejs-versions'\r\n\r\nI just now upgraded from node v19.6.0 to 19.8.1, thinking that would solve the problem, but it didn't.\r\nIs Hardhat unsupported for more recent versions of Node? Although if that was the case, I'd think I'd have gotten this warning a few months ago, and I'm pretty sure I didn't.\r\n\r\nThis issue seems similar to previous issue https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/issues/2461 , which was closed but doesn't seem to have been resolved.\n\n### Minimal reproduction steps\n\n`npx hardhat compile` w/ v 2.13.0 of hardhat and version 19.8.1 of node via nvm\n\n### Search terms\n\nYou are using a version of Node.js that is not supported by Hardhat",

    "body": "Hey @NeverFearTomorrow, let me explain what's going on here.\r\n\r\nIn previous versions of Hardhat, we were using the [`\"engines\"`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/package-json#engines) field in our `package.json` with the versions we supported (which are explained [here](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/reference/stability-guarantees#node.js-versions-support), the tl;dr is that we officially support all active LTS versions). The problem with that is that in some cases (when using yarn v1, I think), that field was enforced and that made Hardhat unusable. A warning is a more realistic thing: we don't technically support that version, but things will probably work.\r\n\r\nI hope that explains it! The PR that made this change is https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/pull/3507, if you want more details.\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this now. If you find that warning too annoying, you can downgrade to node v18 to make it go away. If you think that there should be some way to disable it entirely, please open a new issue with that feature request. I guess we could add an environment variable or something to disable it.",
