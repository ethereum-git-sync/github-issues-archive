  "body": "Hi, all\r\n\r\nRecently, I encounter a problem when running \"npm hardhat compile\". Here are the detailed steps:\r\n\r\n    ➜  amm-arbitrageur git:(master) npx hardhat --version\r\n    2.6.1\r\n    ➜  amm-arbitrageur git:(master) npm install --save-dev ts-node typescript\r\n\r\n    added 1282 packages in 1m\r\n\r\n    85 packages are looking for funding\r\n    run `npm fund` for details\r\n    ➜  amm-arbitrageur git:(master) ✗ npx hardhat --version\r\n    2.1.2\r\n  \r\nWhy the version of hardhat has been changed from **2.6.1** to **2.1.2**?\r\n\r\nActually, I encounter the [same issue here](https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat/issues/1280). The terminal was stuck when downloading the compiler. After some investigation, I find the fix of [this issue](https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat/issues/1280) has been merged. So I want to use the latest hardhat version.\r\n\r\nI have no idea when the hardhat version has been changed.\r\n\r\nCould someone give me some advice? BTW, my OS is macOS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks.",
