  "body": "Hello. Last days I'm trying to check how my project would work with block from the past. And I decided to check the blocknumber that I have forking mainnet in Hardhat. As I see in docs hardhat forks the latest block : \"Hardhat Network will by default fork from the latest mainnet block\". But what I received:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(\"https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/%22);\r\n\r\nconst { ethers } = require(\"hardhat\")\r\n\r\nblock = await provider.getBlockNumber()\r\n```\r\n16034315 from provider.getBlockNumber //current block from provider\r\n\r\n`block = await ethers.provider.getBlockNumber()`\r\n16034309 from ethers.provider.getBlockNumber // minus 6 blocks\r\n\r\nAnd if I understand it correctly `ethers.provider.getBlockNumber()` shows a forking mainnet.\r\nWhy do I have this difference in 6 blocks if I didn't pin a block from the past?",

    "body": "Good question, that part of the docs is a bit misleading. We actually fork the latest block minus [some value](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/blob/421898ea284ef323bc0d9d00c73d0c750051b810/packages/hardhat-core/src/internal/hardhat-network/provider/utils/reorgs-protection.ts#L8) (that depends on the network) to avoid reorg issues.\r\n\r\nDo you think that sentence would be more accurate if it said something like \"Hardhat Network will by default fork from a recent mainnet block\"?",
