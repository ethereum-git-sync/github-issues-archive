  "body": "I was debugging and testing some libraries and contracts using hardhat with hardhat-ethers. The docs [Library Linking](https://hardhat.org/plugins/nomiclabs-hardhat-ethers.html#library-linking) mentions that \r\n\r\n> Some contracts need to be linked with libraries before they are deployed.\r\n\r\nAs a beginner, I found it a little bit confusing what criteria determine whether a library needs to be linked or not. After some digging online and experimenting, it seems that a library that does not contain external functions will not need to be linked since they will be inlined. I think it might be a good idea to either 1) include a short sentence explaining it, or 2) link to an external resource that explains which library needs to be linked which will not (like this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3985#issuecomment-383848718) or the [solidity docs](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.6/contracts.html#libraries)).\r\n\r\nI know the plugin gives a prompt when libraries are not correctly linked and tells us exactly what needs to be linked. It can still be useful for people trying to figure out why a library needs to be linked. ",
