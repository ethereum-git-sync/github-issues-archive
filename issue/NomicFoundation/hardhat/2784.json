Since this is almost surely a user error, it would make sense to show a warning or throw an error (I'm inclined towards a warning).\r\n\r\nThe same check might make sense for other paths (like `sources`) but not for every path (it doesn't make sense for the `cache` and `artifacts` path). I think just doing it for the `test` path is enough, but I'll leave that open for now.",

    "body": "Since `sources` and `tests` are user paths (i.e. HH does not create them) it makes sense at least a warning that would give you some feedback. Personally I would prefer an error (because it certainly is) which would require immediate attention, since it's clearly something that you didn't intend to configure that way.\r\n\r\nHowever the check and error (for `tests:path`) should be triggered only when you are actually using the `test` command, so if you are not using HH for testing directly, you don't have to set a `tests:path` if you use a custom dir with mocha. In that case HH has nothing to do with it, so it should not bother you about that.\r\n\r\nThe `sources` seems more widely used, so it should probably generate an error for any command.",
