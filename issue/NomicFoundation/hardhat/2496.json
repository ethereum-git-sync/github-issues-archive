  "body": "(Edit by @fvictorio: this issue is blocked by https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/issues/3042)\r\n\r\nWe store our keys (private, Alchemy, Etherscan, etc.) in AWS Secrets Manager. We'd like to pull them directly from there for use in `hardhat.config.ts`. However, this is an asynchronous action and, since Hardhat needs to be loadable via `require` call, configuration must be synchronous.\r\n\r\nHowever, could the library add setters for things like `network` so we can set these values at runtime?\r\n\r\nOur use-case involves running Hardhat in a Fargate container in AWS so setting our private key as an environment variable so it can be read in via `hardhat.config.ts` is more risk than we're willing to take. We're able to set a custom provider using `ethers` to get things like `deploy` working. However, when using `@openzeppelin/upgrades` plugin to call `deployProxy`, they access the hardhat network config provider directly instead of using our configured `ethers` provider, so deployment fails. I'm sure other plugins operate in the same way.\r\n",

Something like `const hre = createHardhatRuntimeEnvironment(config)`. If we had that, you could create the config in an async way and then initialize the `hre` and use that. Still not the best solution, but better than the other workaround, and it would be useful in many other scenarios\r\n\r\nThis seems like it would work great. Is this planned and/or is there a GitHub issue I could follow or help out on? Our only alternative to get this working in the short term is to fork either Hardhat or the `@openzeppelin/upgrades` plugin. I'd much prefer to have a mainline solution to the problem so we can avoid forking.",
