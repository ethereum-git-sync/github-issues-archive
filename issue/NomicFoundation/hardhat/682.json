  "body": "Hi! I'm building (buidling?) a project using [scaffold-eth](https://github.com/austintgriffith/scaffold-eth), which in turn embeds Buidler in a create-eth-app (and does some other cool things).  The basic structure (that I need for this issue) is:\r\n```\r\nproject\r\n├── node_modules\r\n│   └── openzeppelin-solidity\r\n├── packages\r\n│   ├── buidler\r\n│   │       ├── contracts\r\n│   │       └──  package.json\r\n│   └── react-app\r\n├── package.json\r\n├── yarn.lock\r\n```\r\nThere are calls to the `openzeppelin-solidity` package in the contracts located in `packages/buidler/contracts`. When I try to compile with the contracts pointing to `node_modules` in the project root, I get `BUIDL401: ... is outside the project`. I tried making a phony `node_modules` inside the `buidler` folder, and copying the contracts to there, but then I get `BUIDL402: File belongs to a library but was treated as a local one`. (The docs say to raise an issue if you get this error, so I figured I would, even if I got it because of an ugly hack I tried.)\r\n\r\nI could copy the OZ contracts into the `contracts` folder I suppose, but figure that the library is popular enough that I should raise the issue. It could be that this is more of an issue with `scaffold-eth` than Buidler - I plan on raising it there, too.\r\n\r\nWhat do you propose I do to get the contract calls to OpenZeppelin to work?",

    "body": "Actually, I did it now instead. The repo is here: https://github.com/wschwab/scaff-zep-concept\r\n\r\nIt's a `scaffold-eth` setup, so after you clone, you could just use `yarn compile` and it'll use buidler to compile. \r\n\r\nRight now I have a contract `test.sol` pointing at OpenZeppelin contracts that I put in a mock `node_modules` in the `buidler` directory ('packages/buidler`). This was what gave me the BUIDL402 before, and did again when I tested it now. \r\n\r\nWhen I had it point at the OpenZeppelin contracts in the root `node_modules` I got the BUIDL401. If you'd like to test this yourself, edit the path in `packages/buidler/contracts/test.sol` by having the import go three directories up (right now it only goes one up):\r\n```\r\n../../../openzeppelin-solidity/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol\r\n```\r\nThanks again!",

    "body": "Ah, I see. The `.gitignore` has `node_modules` in it, so my hack of putting a new `node_modules` at that level didn't get pushed. I should've thought of that.\r\n\r\nIn any event, you hit the problem anyway: I've been using paths that include the path into `node_modules` instead of just calling the package by name. I'm not sure why specifying the whole path fails, but that fixes everything. I'll close, as this seems to fix any issue.\r\n\r\nJust to reiterate in case someone else is having a similar problem. Don't import using:\r\n```\r\nimport '../../../openzeppelin-solidity/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol';\r\n```\r\nimport using:\r\n```\r\nimport 'openzeppelin-solidity/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol';\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks for the help!\r\n",
