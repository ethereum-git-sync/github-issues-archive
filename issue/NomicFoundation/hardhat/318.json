  "body": "Wrote my first buidler plugin and was (again) very impressed with:\r\n+ how straightforward it was \r\n+ how well designed the plugin system is \r\n+ how nice the infrastructure for getting started is. \r\n\r\nThis is a great architecture for tool builders. \r\n\r\nMy [plugin](https://github.com/cgewecke/buidler-gas-reporter) is a simple override of `TASK_TEST_RUN_MOCHA_TESTS` which modifies the config passed to mocha and calls `runSuper`.\r\n\r\nOne thing I would have liked to do is to have the plugin be `off` by default (because it slows tests down and provides info you don't need to see on every run) but allow the user to toggle it on with a cli flag, e.g.\r\n```\r\nnpx buidler test --gas\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause the `TEST_` tasks already define params this doesn't seem possible. It might be nice if plugins could extend BuidlerArguments arbitrarily for cases where they don't necessarily expect to be run by default - i.e when they expect to be optionally invoked as an addition to a commonly used built-in.
