We can already call evm mine in a loop, the goal is to be able to avoid this and skip an arbitrary about of blocks without a huge amount of cost. I trust that @mul1sh has got this ;)",

To avoid this situation in the future, I'd recommend commenting in the issue first, letting us know that you are willing to put a bounty on it.\r\n\r\nAlso, I believe the reason for this feature request is to make this RPC call instant/almost instant, and the approach of iterating mining new blocks falls short on that front. Something far more involved is needed to make this performant, possibly changing our blockchain's architecture, keeping gaps between blocks.\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "I think any solution that tries to actually mine the blocks probably won't work. In our case, we need to mine about 100.000 blocks and a delay of about 1 second would be fine. But this is currently off by several orders of magnitude, so you would have to dramatically improve mining speed and a lower level somewhere.\r\n\r\nBut that would still not solve this issue for users who run simulations that cover months or years, such as vesting schedules, minting curves, etc.\r\n\r\nI think one solution would be to simply increase the block number by 100.000. so we would go from block 12 to block 100.012. And the blocks in between simply don't exist. This would break some things, but for testing, this would be gold. So as long as the documentation clearly states that this helper function breaks some functionality, it would be great for testing over larger block ranges.",

    "body": "I've been digging a bit deeper on this, and I think a nice compromise would be to mine blocks with a block reward of 0 when this method is used. This way, if there are no pending txs, the state root shouldn't change (⚠️ this should be confirmed ⚠️), so there's no need to run them in the VM, but just create them and add them to the blockchain data structure. This should be almost instant.\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned before, #1087 changes how new blocks are created, so I'd rather wait for it to land. It adds a bit of complexity to this \"mining empty blocks\" thing.\r\n\r\nFinally, if creating 100s of empty blocks is also slow, we may be able to modify the `Blockchain` so that it can have \"gaps\" and create the missing blocks on demand.",

Read [the docs](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network/reference/#hardhat-mine) to learn more, but the tl;dr is that you can now do this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// mine 256 blocks\r\nawait hre.network.provider.send(\"hardhat_mine\", [\"0x100\"]);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI hope you find it useful, and please let us know if you find any issues around this feature.",
