Maybe that doesn't happen with `setContext`? Or maybe another mechanism has to be used?\r\n\r\nBesides, the docs say it's deprecated, which I didn't notice before:\r\n\r\n> In the past, custom context was called \"extra\" and set via a method like setExtra(), which is deprecated.\r\n>\r\n> Custom data set using setExtra appears in the \"Additional Data\" section of an event. By contrast, each key set using setContext gets its own section on the issue page, with the section title being the key name.\r\n\r\n",
