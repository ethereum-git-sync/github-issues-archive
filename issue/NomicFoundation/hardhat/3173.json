The compilation is rerun multiple times during the deployment process, which is not necessary as it's assumed the compilation was already called before running the deployment. \r\n\r\nIn the example below I want to deploy three contracts (with `hardhat-deploy` plugin) and then verify them. The contracts will be compiled before the deployment and then each `verify:verify` execution will compile them again.\r\n```\r\nconst ContractA = await hre.deployments.deploy(\"ContractA\")\r\nconst ContractB = await hre.deployments.deploy(\"ContractB\")\r\nconst ContractC = await hre.deployments.deploy(\"ContractC\")\r\n\r\nawait hre.run(\"verify:verify\", { address: ContractA.address })\r\nawait hre.run(\"verify:verify\", { address: ContractB.address })\r\nawait hre.run(\"verify:verify\", { address: ContractC.address })\r\n```",
