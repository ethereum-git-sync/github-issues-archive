    "body": "Hey @Rishabhraghwendra18, sure. This is how I would approach this change.\r\n\r\nFirst, a lot of new tests need to be added here: https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat/blob/master/packages/hardhat-core/test/internal/core/config/config-validation.ts There are two kind of networks, the hardhat network and the http networks. And there are several cases:\r\n\r\n- A private key that is not a string\r\n- A private key that is not valid\r\n- Private keys that are valid, but with and without the `0x` prefix (both should work. I think we already have tests for those).\r\n\r\nThe second part is the manual validations that @alcuadrado mentioned. The hardhat network part of those starts here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat/blob/d4d9e5e28bcf6c65f2b03bcd765fc7a0da04366c/packages/hardhat-core/src/internal/core/config/config-validation.ts#L229\r\n\r\nAnd the one for http networks starts here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat/blob/d4d9e5e28bcf6c65f2b03bcd765fc7a0da04366c/packages/hardhat-core/src/internal/core/config/config-validation.ts#L306\r\n\r\nI would say that you start by adding the (failing) tests and create a pull request with those. Then we can validate that those make sense, and then you can work on making them pass.",
