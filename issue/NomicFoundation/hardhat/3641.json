  "body": "### Version of Hardhat\n\n9.4.0\n\n### What happened?\n\nI\"m kind of confused actually.  when I run `npm hardhat --version` I get **9.4.0**, but the npm page says the latest version is **2.12.6?**\r\n\r\nThe reason I started looking whether to update is because I started getting this message:  **_You are using a version of Node.js that is not supported by Hardhat, and it may work incorrectly, or not work at all. Please, make sure you are using a supported version of Node.js.To learn more about which versions of Node.js are supported go to https://hardhat.org/nodejs-versions_**\r\n\r\nSo I upgraded node to version 19.6.0, which I gather is current, but I'm still getting that same message. \r\n\r\nI tried to upgrade hardhat but got this message: \r\n```\r\nnpm WARN EBADENGINE Unsupported engine {\r\nnpm WARN EBADENGINE   package: 'hardhat@2.12.6',\r\nnpm WARN EBADENGINE   required: { node: '^14.0.0 || ^16.0.0 || ^18.0.0' },\r\nnpm WARN EBADENGINE   current: { node: 'v19.6.0', npm: '9.4.0' }\r\nnpm WARN EBADENGINE }\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Minimal reproduction steps\n\n`hh test` produces this error in vs code, or `npx hardhat node` in the terminal.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Search terms\n\n_No response_",
