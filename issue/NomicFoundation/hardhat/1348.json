  "body": "Hi There,\r\n\r\nI've just forked main-net on my machine and am using an Alchemy hosted node per the instructions. I was hoping to impersonate an account on my forked main-net but am having issues with the Signer that I would like to impersonate.\r\n\r\nAttached is a code sample. I've created a function to simply print the total supply of a deployed contract. When I run that function on workingSigner it prints the expected totalSupply of the token, whereas when I run the same function with the second impersonated signer I get the error: \"Error: contract not deployed (contractAddress=\"0x1f9840a85d5aF5bf1D1762F925BDADdC4201F984\", operation=\"getDeployed\", code=UNSUPPORTED_OPERATION, version=contracts/5.0.12)\"\r\n\r\nAny help would be much appreciated. Thanks!\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39660195/112234936-59353700-8c89-11eb-948a-eaa3ab17fab0.png)\r\n",
