  "body": "This subtask is executed during parallel mode too, but mocha then creates new processes to run the tests, so any changes done to the HRE in that subtask won't be reflected in the tests.\r\n\r\nHere's a workaround for the time being: https://github.com/fvictorio/hardhat-parallel-tests-setup-workaround\r\n\r\nIn a sense, this issue is related to #2680, because we could drop this subtask if `require` worked in serial mode. That way you could register your setup using Mocha's root hooks in a way that works both in serial and parallel mode and whose behavior is more predictable.",
