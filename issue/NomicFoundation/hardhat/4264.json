    "body": "Hey all, skimmed the linked convo. So IIUC the goal of this policy is to minimize the chance that devs deploy contracts that cannot work due to unsupported opcodes. Going to think out loud a bit here...\r\n\r\nGiven that goal, I think what we want is \"top 10 chains by \\<some developer-related metric\\>\" to minimize the *number* of affected devs. Of course any metric we choose can be gamed and will have flaws. TVL is probably a reasonable enough proxy for developer actively, and it's nice because it's easy to measure. But it is easily swayed by whales, and it wouldn't surprised me that TVLs are artificially inflated due to illiquid tokens with unrealistic prices. Regardless, it's an easy choice for a first pass.\r\n\r\nLonger term something like \"number of contracts deployed\" over a time period might be more representative, but that is probably harder to get data for (and still gameable). \"Total gas used\" is a similar metric, but gets tricky since e.g. arbitrum has different gas metering\r\n\r\nFWIW I do want to add a caniuse.com-like view to EVM Diff, so you can see all chains that support a given EIP/opcode, but I don't have a timeline for that\r\n\r\n",
