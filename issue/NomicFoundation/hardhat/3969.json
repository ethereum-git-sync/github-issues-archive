This also means dropping the `--no-compile` flag, which is a breaking change that should've been included in the first version. We are going to accept this and do it as 1.1.0. The way this works is that we try to get the bytecode that matches the deployed bytecode and, if we can't find it, we instruct the user to compile the project (maybe with `--force`? the exact error message is TBD).\r\n- Rename `HardhatEtherscanError` to `HardhatVerifyError`",
