    "body": "The `tracer` option would definitely add value, and give more power to devs for debugging transactions using various tools on top of hh.\r\n\r\nI think this `tracer` option is superior to the one I previously proposed in https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/pull/2545 and it allows to input general logic to filter the response, hereby optimising the rpc overhead, which is crucial for complex txs which are currently generating a very huge response. I understand team is currently resolving with higher priority issues first. If this issue is still far from being looked at, would you guys mind if I try to implement this and make a PR?",
