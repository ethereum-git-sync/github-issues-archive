In such cases, the Hardhat node might crash with an OOM error when calling `JSON.stringify` on a big trace.\r\n\r\nI think it already was an issue with Geth, and that's why they added [`debug_standardTraceBlockToFile`](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/rpc/ns-debug#debug_standardtraceblocktofile)\r\n\r\n",
