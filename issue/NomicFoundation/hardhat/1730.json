    "body": "Hey! I was having the same issue and started looking into this.\r\n\r\n> There might be an assumption in the plugin that \"no metadata\" means \"solidity <0.4.7\", which is of course totally wrong.\r\n\r\nThis is correct. The assumption is made here: https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat/blob/27b3842d6e270fc516cc7fec8266746deb6c2b7b/packages/hardhat-etherscan/src/solc/metadata.ts#L31-L44\r\n\r\nAside from that, you can see from the error message that it thinks @ZumZoom is compiling with `0.7.6`, but if you look at the Hardhat config linked, it's really compiling with `0.7.6+commit.3b061308`. There are multiple versions of the OVM compiler for a given solc version, as seen here where there are two different 0.7.6's:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17163988/127240864-fe36c8e4-4896-4533-a98c-42bb5ccfa404.png\" width=500px />\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore I think a change also needs to be made in the [`TASK_VERIFY_GET_COMPILER_VERSIONS`](https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat/blob/27b3842d6e270fc516cc7fec8266746deb6c2b7b/packages/hardhat-etherscan/src/index.ts#L540-L566) method. It seems this method is only looking in the ordinary `hardhatConfig.ovm.solcVersion` field to find the compiler version, but with the `@eth-optimism/hardhat-ovm` plugin the compiler version is specified in a different field as you can see in @ZumZoom's code [here](https://github.com/ZumZoom/ovm-hardhat-etherscan-example/blob/6c9f7d9581e0821b2f09e7114132d83f05267516/hardhat.config.js#L7-L9).\r\n\r\nI'm happy to get in a PR for this, but any additional guidance on the changes required would be appreciated!",
