Also, this is not caught during config validation; instead, it happens the first time a request is sent.\r\n\r\n[This comment](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/issues/2244#issuecomment-1121306153) also seems to suggest that an \"only absolute URLs are supported\" message can be shown when an empty string is used; maybe that depends on the OS or it happens in other scenarios.",
