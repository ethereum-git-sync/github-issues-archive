The best way to do this is to include a [Minimal Reproducible Example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example). If you can't do that, then include a link to your repo, and the steps to reproduce the problem. The easiest it is to reproduce your problem, the faster we are going to be able to fix it.\r\n\r\nIf you are submitting a feature request, please take the time to clearly describe your use case, and not only your proposed solution.\r\n\r\nThis issue will be automatically assigned to a Hardhat team member. This person will act as the point of contact between you and the team, but won't necessarily fix it nor address it in any way. An issue being assigned does not mean that it's being worked on.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Description of the issue\r\n\r\nAt [LUKSO](https://github.com/lukso-network), we are looking to easily + automatically verify contracts (like [Universal Profiles](https://docs.lukso.tech/standards/universal-profile/lsp3-universal-profile-metadata)) on the L14 network.\r\n\r\nVerifying contracts via the RPC endpoint of the L14 Blockscout instance is quite complicated. We currently rely on manual verification by flattening Solidity files.\r\n\r\n\r\n- blockscout/blockscout#5448\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be great if we could add the L14 network to the list of networks available on the [hardhat-etherscan](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/tree/master/packages/hardhat-etherscan) package.\r\n\r\nThis would help us (the team) tremendously and would provide a better developer experience for people building on LUKSO. Verifying contracts on L14 from any hardhat project would be as simple as **running the command**\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpx hardhat verify --network luksoL14 DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_ON_L14\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would then be more developer/user friendly to interact with them via the L14 explorer using the contract methods fields.\r\n\r\n## Proposed solution\r\n\r\nAdd the LUKSO L14 test network to the list of networks under the `@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers` package.\r\n\r\nI have proposed the following PR and tested locally on my fork :)\r\n\r\n- #2597 \r\n\r\nI was pointed to this solution by @vbaranov who introduced Sokol and xDai networks in #2122",
