  "body": "### Describe the feature\n\nHi, \r\n\r\nCurrently hardhat-network-helpers [setNonce](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network-helpers/docs/reference#setnonce(address,-nonce)) give me this error, when I try to reset the `nonce` of an `impersonatedSigner` on an `Ethereum hardhat network fork` \r\n\r\n`InvalidInputError: New nonce (0) must not be smaller than the existing nonce (6)` \r\n\r\nI think `setNonce` should not be so restrictive. \r\n\r\nMy use case for resetting the nonce to a low nonce is strong here as in my testing I want to be able to deploy contracts on a local fork at the exact same address that they were deployed on the `ethereum fork`. This is because the contracts rely on `constant` address values for e.g. access restrictions. \r\n\r\nThe only other way I can achieve having same address deployments locally would be via [setCode](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network-helpers/docs/reference#setcode(address,-code)), but I would prefer emulating our same-address deployment mechanism that relies on fixed deployer nonces. \n\n### Search terms\n\nsetNonce, hardhat-network-helpers",
