  "body": "Firstly thank you for this tool, I started using it on my other two projects a few moths ago, really awesome stuff :)\r\n\r\nI am trying to switch the wildcards.world smart contracts to use buidler while testing our next version; but I'm running into the issue I'll describe below. I've put everything in a branch so it should be very easy to reproduce on your side. It is (from what I can see, unless I'm missing something) a pretty major bug, as I am unable to use buidler until this is worked out.\r\n\r\nThe most similar issue I could find is this https://github.com/nomiclabs/buidler/issues/9 but it would appear Buidler has changed a lot since then!\r\n\r\n# Background:\r\n\r\nThe wildcards contracts used to and still do use truffle + ganache.\r\n\r\nWhen I switched to buidler I started getting strange errors where the contract would start to refuse to deploy (but deploy completely fine on ganache with the same gas limit). I have with lots of trial and error gotten the contract to a state where commenting out/or in a single line changes if it can deploy or not!\r\n\r\n# How to reproduce:\r\n\r\n`git clone -b js/working-buidler https://github.com/wildcards-world/contracts.git`\r\n`cd contracts`\r\n`yarn`\r\n\r\nRun the buidler tests (that work):\r\n`yarn run test -- ./test/test_gas_limit_steward_deploy.js`\r\nRun the ganach/truffle tests for comparison:\r\n - Run ganache in a separate terminal with `ganache-cli -l 95000000 ` (Yes, the block gas limit is set about 10x not really part of the issue, just made it comfortably high to eliminade doubt).\r\n- `truffle test --network test ./test/test_gas_limit_steward_deploy.js`\r\n\r\n_all the above should pass without no issues - it is the 'control' in this experiment. It should print that \"Deploying the steward contract used: 5332541\"_\r\n\r\nThen go to line 86 and 89-92 of `./contracts/WildcardSteward_v2.sol` then comment and comment those two lines respectively:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6032276/82200485-5ba76180-98ff-11ea-8cbd-263c762b9874.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nThen run the two tests for buidler and truffle/ganache again. This time buidler will say \"Transaction run out of gas\" and truffle/ganache will work as expected.\r\n\r\nThe transaction would of course use more gas; but I've sepcifically set the blockGasLimit and gas to be extremely high. So that isn't the issue.\r\n\r\n`buidler.config.js`:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6032276/82154934-834fe880-9871-11ea-83a5-595e98660d69.png)\r\n\r\n`./test/test_gas_limit_steward_deploy.js`:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6032276/82154949-9b276c80-9871-11ea-8e6f-eb02f5914037.png)\r\n\r\nThose specific lines aren't particularly imortant; simply adding a bit more code causes this issue.\r\n\r\nThank you. Please tell me if there are any other things I can help with.",
