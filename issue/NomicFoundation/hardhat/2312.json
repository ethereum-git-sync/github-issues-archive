  "body": "_I'm creating this issue as temporary documentation of a bug that has already been fixed._\r\n\r\nMany users have reported that when deploying a contract to Mumbai or another Polygon (ex Matic) network using ethers, they were getting an incorrect address.\r\n\r\nThis was due to a bug in the implementation of Polygon's nodes. This bug was already fixed, and a fixed version of Polygon is being deployed to the different RPC providers. [MaticVigil](https://maticvigil.com/) has already deployed it, and we confirmed that the fix works correctly.\r\n\r\n## Technical explanation\r\n\r\nThe reason this bug manifested as an incorrect addres was that ethers computes the address of the newly deployed contracts locally, based on the information it gets by calling `eth_getTransactionByHash` using the hash of the deployment transaction. \r\n\r\nThe bug in the Polygon node was causing the `from` field of the object returned by `eth_getTransactionByHash` to be incorrectly set to `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`. This only happened if the transaction being requested was pending/not-confirmed.\r\n\r\nethers made the `eth_getTransactionByHash` request mentioned above right after sending the deployment transaction, so most of the time it wouldn't be confirmed, and the `from` field would be the zero address. \r\n\r\nThe `from` field is used in the contract address computation, so it being incorrect lead to the contract's address being incorrect.",
