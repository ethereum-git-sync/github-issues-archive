We do this by first reading its `package.json`, and resolving from there. \r\n\r\nAlso, as Hardhat is case sensitive, we need to be able to get the root of the library, and we also do that this way.\r\n\r\nNote though that npm doesn't let you install a github repo if it doesn't have a `pacakge.json`.",
