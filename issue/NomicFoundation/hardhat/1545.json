There is a chance that we write corrupted data when this happens.\r\n\r\nThere is at least one user report that points to this happening. I'm not 100% sure if this is the reason, but it's worth checking if we are following best practices with respect to gracefully shutting down the node.\r\n\r\nMy first guess is that we should register a SIGINT handler in the node task, and to call `server.close()` there before exiting the process.\r\n\r\n",
