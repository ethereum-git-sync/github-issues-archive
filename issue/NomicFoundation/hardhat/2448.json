The best way to do this is to include a [Minimal Reproducible Example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example). If you can't do that, then include a link to your repo, and the steps to reproduce the problem. The easiest it is to reproduce your problem, the faster we are going to be able to fix it.\r\n\r\nIf you are submitting a feature request, please take the time to clearly describe your use case, and not only your proposed solution.\r\n\r\nThis issue will be automatically assigned to a Hardhat team member. This person will act as the point of contact between you and the team, but won't necessarily fix it nor address it in any way. An issue being assigned does not mean that it's being worked on.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this is just something I'm doing wrong or a bug, but I have a contract that looks something like this:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract Staking {\r\n  SomeERC721Contract public immutable nftContract;\r\n\r\n  constructor(SomeERC721Contract nftContract_) {\r\n    nftContract = nftContract_;\r\n  } \r\n\r\n  function someFunction() public {\r\n    nftContract.hello();\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI can deploy this fine, but when I go to verify the contract, I can't seem to figure out how to pass the instance of `SomeERC721Contract` to the verifier. In my hardhat deploy script I can just pass in the address for the contract and it seems to convert it to the contract instance itself, but on verify it goes into the fallback verification step and then fails with some generic error. Any ideas?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nKyle",
