  "body": "I'm observing a very weird behavior on our monorepo where we are using buidler with waffle to compile the contracts for one of the packages\r\n\r\nCurrently migrating the monorepo to use ethers v5 but unfortunately I can't use with buidler with ethers v5 even using the plugin suggested in #481. Unsure if it's plugin's fault or waffle which would expect ethers v4\r\n\r\nDecided to install ethers v4 explicitly for this package but because of Lerna's hoisting, Buidler was using ethers v5. Created an exception for no-hoisting for packages labelled with nomiclabs which moved the modules to the package directory\r\n\r\nThis is where the new issue started, Buidler will always display the initial CLI prompt for creating a config file despite exisiting on in the package directory.\r\n\r\nUnsure what caused this issue since the only change would be the migration of ethers v5 across packages and moving the nomiclabs package to the specific package directory. Also I couldn't find any flags for targeting the config file directly in the documentation which could be useful to debug.\r\n\r\nAny ideas? @alcuadrado  @fzeoli ",
