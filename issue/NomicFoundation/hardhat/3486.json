We should add some mechanism to let users and plugins extend this.\r\n\r\nThis could be done with a file with a interface or something like that, but I think it would be even better to have some extensibility point that can asynchronously search for a selector. This would let us use things like Etherscan and 4bytes.\r\n\r\nRelated issue: #701",

So, when generated that way, the signature of the custom errors should be known, correct?\r\n\r\nIs there a technical limitation preventing Hardhat from using the custom error signatures in those ABIs (no need to \"guess\" at them)?",

    "body": "The problem in that case is that that information is mainly just passed to ethers (the `hardhat-ethers` plugin itself doesn't do much).\r\n\r\nIn principle we could make the `hardhat-ethers` plugin make extra work on those calls and, if it's connected to a Hardhat network, pass that extra information to the node so that it \"knows\" about those errors.
