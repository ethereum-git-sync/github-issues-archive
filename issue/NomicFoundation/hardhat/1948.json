Any change to that initialization process needs to be done in each of them. This is error-prone. We should have a central factory function for them instead.\r\n\r\nThese entry points are:\r\n* `packages/hardhat-core/src/internal/cli/cli.ts` \r\n* `packages/hardhat-core/src/internal/lib/hardhat-lib.ts`\r\n* `packages/hardhat-core/src/register.ts`",
