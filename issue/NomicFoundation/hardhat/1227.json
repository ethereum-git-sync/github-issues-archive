  "body": "I have a fully functional project: https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-contracts/commit/c83d7ecee75051f580cb419fb41ef7ade72486d8. You can run its tests with `yarn install && yarn test`, they are all passing.\r\n\r\nBut when I use the `RadicleToken` contract constructor inside `Phase0` contract, `RadicleToken` tests verifying a transaction revert message start breaking. Everything else is working including revert messages from other contracts: https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-contracts/commit/42c9132f4b28d8045e8781a477d44a8ca323bdcd.\r\n\r\n```\r\n      delegateBySig failed because of an unexpected reason\r\n      + expected - actual\r\n\r\n      -Transaction reverted and Hardhat couldn't infer the reason. Please report this to help us improve Hardhat.\r\n      +RadicleToken::delegateBySig: invalid signature\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `Phase0` contract isn't used anywhere in the tests, it's never deployed or even referenced. It's a piece of dead code which breaks hardhat seemingly by just existing :thinking:\r\n\r\nThe project uses hardhat 2.0.6, but upgrade to 2.0.8 doesn't fix the issue.",
