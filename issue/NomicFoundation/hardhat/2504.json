    "body": "I think it's part of the consensus rules that each block must have a timestamp that is different from the previous block's. That's why we enforce this.\r\n\r\nThat being said, `hardhat_mine` already does things that are not technically valid. For example, the mined blocks don't have a valid `parentHash` (to do that, we would need to create all blocks, and that wouldn't be possible in constant time). And, of course, we have things like `hardhat_setStorageAt`, etc.\r\n\r\nSo I don't think it's unreasonable to consider adding support for this. But it would be interesting to first understand better why you would need that behavior. Can you expand on this:\r\n\r\n> this is relevant when testing fee calculations, for example\r\n\r\n?\r\n",

    "body": "In our case, we have a bunch of bootstrapping to do to initialize our local environment with a bunch of contracts. Currently this takes ages since we have automine turned OFF with a second interval. These contracts have various dependencies so we essentially deploy each contract one by one to simplify things. With automine turned ON, this bootstrap takes like 3 seconds. With it off, it takes like a minute+.\r\n\r\nThe issue is, with automine turned ON and the timestamp constantly increased, the time quickly becomes a few minutes in the future, which causes all further development after bootstrapping to go wonky since the timestamps are desynchronized.\r\n\r\nIdeally, we could bootstrap our environment, then set the timestamp back to the current time. Or manually set the time interval to be 0 seconds during bootstrapping and then re-enable it.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I'm missing another simple solution, but this makes iteration quite a pain when setting up a local environment.",

    "body": "@impguard that's really strange. Even if you have interval mining enabled, all your transactions should be sent to the mempool and then after a second all of them should be mined.\r\n\r\nMy guess is that you have a script that does something like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst foo = await Foo.deploy()\r\nawait foo.deployed()\r\n\r\nconst tx = await foo.someMethod()\r\nawait tx.wait()\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn that case, each `.deployed`/`.wait` call will wait until the transaction is mined, and therefore each deployment/transaction will take up to one second.\r\n\r\nIn that case, I think you have two options:\r\n\r\n- Write your script so that it doesn't wait for each tx to be mined\r\n- Enable automining during your setup and then disable it after everythin is ready. Notice that you can do this [programmatically](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network/docs/explanation/mining-modes#using-rpc-methods).\r\n\r\nAnother alternative is to manually mine a new block after sending each transaction. You can do it with [the network helper](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network-helpers/docs/reference#mine([blocks],-[options])) (recommended) or with the low-level JSON-RPC `hardhat_mine` method.",

    "body": "@fvictorio you're right about what we're doing. The problem is we require our contracts to be mined and deployed since the contracts have dependencies on one another. so parallelization of their deployment can only be done to a shallow extent.\r\n\r\nYour two options won't work. (1) Writing the script so deployments aren't awaited won't work for the above reason. (2) Enabling automining produces the timestamp issue described in this Issue. About 200+ or so requests are sent out during our bootstrapping and the timestamp gets pushed out into the future during automining. Waiting for the timestamp to sync back properly essentially defeats the point of automining.\r\n\r\nManually mining doesn't really help either. What we really would like is automining and a resetting of the timestamp.",

That will help us properly prioritize it.",
