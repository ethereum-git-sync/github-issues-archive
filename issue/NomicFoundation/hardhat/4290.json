  "body": "The way we are using solc right now means that the default import callback is used, and this checks the file system if a file is not available in the virtual file system.\r\n\r\nWe don't want this behavior because it can lead to irreproducible builds.\r\n\r\nThe only way to disable this right now is to create an empty directory and use `--base-path ${tmpDir}`. In some future versions we might be able to use the flag suggested [here](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14484).\r\n\r\n`--base-path` is not available in all the solc versions we support though. We need to find the first version that supports it, and only add this parameter in those cases. This means that (really old) solc versions can run into the reproducibility problem, but it doesn't seem worth it to look for a workaround for those versions.",
