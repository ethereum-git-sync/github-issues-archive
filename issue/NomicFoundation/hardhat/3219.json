    "body": "Makes sense, thanks for reporting this!\r\n\r\nIf I remember correctly, anonymous events cannot be filtered, so they can't really be distinguished from other anonymous events. This means that this would need a different API that just means \"an anonymous event was emitted\" and, in your example, `'Update'` wouldn't be used in the assertion. Something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nawait expect( c.connect(a).cancel(n) ).to.emitAnonymous(c).withArgs(n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nDo you think that would be acceptable?",
