Resolved by setting gas limit `create2.deploy(bytecode, salt, {gasLimit: 9000000}) `. Btw commenting out all `console.log` in the code also resolve this. Hope this helps",

    "body": "Hey @sirpy, more than one year later but I guess that's better than never.\r\n\r\nI think this is caused by #3469. You can check [this comment](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/issues/3145#issuecomment-1241740929) for an explanation.\r\n\r\nThe workaround in this case is to use an explicit gas limit, or to explicitly call `estimateGas` and use that. For example, your test would become something like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n  it(\"[@skip-on-coverage] [hardhat BUG] should deploy with linked library\", async () => {\r\n    const uf = await ethers.getContractFactory(\"UniswapV2SwapHelper\");\r\n    const uniswap = await uf.deploy();\r\n    const Contract = await ethers.getContractFactory(\"CompoundStakingFactory\", {\r\n      libraries: { UniswapV2SwapHelper: uniswap.address }\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    const salt = 308932532;\r\n    const gasEstimation = factory.estimateGas.deployCode(salt, Contract.bytecode);\r\n\r\n    const tx = await (\r\n      await factory.deployCode(salt, Contract.bytecode, {\r\n        gasLimit: gasEstimation\r\n      })\r\n    ).wait();\r\n\r\n    const event = tx.events.find(_ => _.event === \"ContractCreated\");\r\n    expect(event).to.not.be.undefined;\r\n  });\r\n```\r\n\r\n@discoteq-cmd I would guess you are running into the same problem, since the bytecodes sent to factories can get huge.\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this in favor of #3469.",
