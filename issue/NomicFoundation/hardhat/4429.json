(\"0x167\" for example)\r\nIf we create a smart contract, that uses this address and write a test for it with your tool, we get the following **error**:\r\n<img width=\"1095\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/assets/10372129/af08f7cb-0930-47d9-9ac7-64e246b7a935\">\r\n\r\nA little something from the **\"--show-stack-traces\"** flag ... \r\n<img width=\"1117\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/assets/10372129/860438fb-122d-446a-9027-68769f7cce6f\">\r\n\r\nCan you please have a look?\r\nWe would really like for you to support our project.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if I can do anything else to help US solve this. \r\n\r\nBest of wishes,\r\nStefan\n\n### Minimal reproduction steps\n\n- Create a normal out of the box **hardhat** project. \r\n`npm install --save-dev hardhat`\r\n`npx hardhat init` --- use TypeScript \r\n- add the 4 contracts and test file in the [GitHub gist](https://gist.github.com/stefan-stefanooov/08191e704db60aacda6e6c7d0332969c.js) \r\n- run the tests\r\n- we also use this [tool](https://www.npmjs.com/package/solidity-coverage) for our code-caverage \n\n### Search terms\n\nhedera hashgraph hardhat precompile address code-coverage",
