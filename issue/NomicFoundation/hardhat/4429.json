    "body": "Hey @stefan-stefanooov, I can confirm that your transaction is reverting, but that doesn't necessarily mean there's a bug in Hardhat.\r\n\r\nIf you think this is happening because the code assumes that some precompile exist, then the problem is that the Hardhat network only has Ethereum's standard precompiles. If you want to simulate those, then you need to have some bytecode in those addresses with the same functionality (you can use `hardhat_setCode` for that).\r\n\r\nI'm tentatively closing this, but I can re-open it if there's indeed a problem on our side.",
