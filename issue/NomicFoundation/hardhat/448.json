  "body": "Currently, the (built-in) [tasks documentation](https://buidler.dev/guides/create-task.html) is a bit... lacking. \r\nWe only have a link to the [src/builtin-tasks](https://github.com/nomiclabs/buidler/tree/master/packages/buidler-core/src/builtin-tasks) folder and that's it. Any user or developer interested would have to look deep into the sources to understand what is going on. \r\n\r\nA suggestion to improve this, could be writing a README doc per task, and bundle it together with the task file, inside a folder of the same name. This way, the task would also gain a \"modular-like\" feel which could give room for more complex structures in an already familiar way.\r\n\r\nAlso, we could improve the project tasks documentation by actually enumerating the existing built-in tasks, with links that display the proper doc of the task.\r\n\r\nAny feedback?",
