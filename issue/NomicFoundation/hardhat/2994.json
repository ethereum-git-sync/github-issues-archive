But you removed many amazing features that made the old configuration great.\r\n\r\nFor instance, how do I add the following in an easy way?\r\n- eslint configs\r\n- automatic solidity formatting with prettier\r\n- solhint configuration\r\n\r\nIs there hardhat config that helps set this up? It can take hours to figure out how to make prettier work with eslint so it would save programmers valuable time.",
