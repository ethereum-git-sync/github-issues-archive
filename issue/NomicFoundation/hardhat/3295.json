  "body": "### The Problem\r\n\r\nWhen attempting to use a custom solidity compiler that was not released yet the hardhat-core tests fail with `HardhatError: HH11: An internal invariant was violated: Trying to get a compiler before it was downloaded` since the `_getCompilerBuild` function returns `undefined` because the compiler version does not exist in the `list.json`.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/blob/5c31db69a0981440c17dc7d24f8deeeaf5bc8f32/packages/hardhat-core/src/internal/solidity/compiler/downloader.ts#L225\r\n\r\n### To reproduce the bug\r\n\r\nYou can reproduce the bug by setting `HARDHAT_TESTS_SOLC_VERSION` to a non-released version like in the script below.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\n\r\n(\r\n  wget -c https://binaries.soliditylang.org/bin/soljson-v0.8.16+commit.07a7930e.js -O soljson-v0.8.16.js\r\n  export HARDHAT_TESTS_SOLC_PATH=$(pwd)/soljson-v0.8.16.js\r\n  export HARDHAT_TESTS_SOLC_VERSION=0.8.18 # <---- some version that was not released yet\r\n  mkdir -p tmp && cd tmp\r\n  git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat.git\r\n  cd hardhat\r\n  ./scripts/run-tests-with-custom-solc.sh\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nSetting a custom compiler with `HARDHAT_TESTS_SOLC_PATH` should be possible even though the version is not a solc release. Note that in the script above the version `v0.8.16` was used as an example, but it could be your own solidity local build: `export HARDHAT_TESTS_SOLC_PATH=<your_solidity_repo>/build/solc/solc`\r\n\r\n",

And with 0.8.16 it was passing for us only due to cache. After removing cached compiler binaries, tests fail.",
