  "body": "If you upgrade Hardhat to 2.5.0 and fork from mainnet with London enabled, **and** if you are using an old version of ethers, ethers will rely on the `eth_gasPrice` endpoint for its gas price. Since that method is hardcoded to return 8 gwei, the transaction will fail if the base fee in mainnet is above that.\r\n\r\nTwo possible solutions here:\r\n\r\n1. Do something smarter for `eth_gasPrice` when London is enabled. Maybe `2 * baseFeePerGas` would be enough.\r\n2. Forward the `eth_gasPrice` call to the remote node during forking.",
