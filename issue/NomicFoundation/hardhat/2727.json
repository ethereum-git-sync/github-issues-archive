The best way to do this is to include a [Minimal Reproducible Example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example). If you can't do that, then include a link to your repo, and the steps to reproduce the problem. The easiest it is to reproduce your problem, the faster we are going to be able to fix it.\r\n\r\nIf you are submitting a feature request, please take the time to clearly describe your use case, and not only your proposed solution.\r\n\r\nThis issue will be automatically assigned to a Hardhat team member. This person will act as the point of contact between you and the team, but won't necessarily fix it nor address it in any way. An issue being assigned does not mean that it's being worked on.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nI'm currently writing deploy logic for my project and I think I ran into a sort of \"bug\" that is actually a composition of expected behaviours.\r\nI'm using the OZ upgrades plugin in my deploy task. What happened is that when I ran my deploy, I expected to see a deployment of a new logic contract since I had modified it, but instead only saw a deployment of the proxy contract, reusing a previous logic contract deployment. At the time, I thought this might be a bug in the plugin but I'm guessing now it might have been due to an outdated build being observed by the plugin.\r\n\r\n## My options for solving this\r\n\r\nOne way to solve this would be to invoke the compile task from my deploy task, but I would rather query if the build is up to date and interrupt the deploy task with an error if that is not the case.\r\n\r\nThis could be a subtask but other simpler APIs may be fine too. I'm guessing using a subtask is better for compatibility with the vyper build pipeline but I'm not sure.",
