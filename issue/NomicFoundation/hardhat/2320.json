  "body": "Hi,\r\nAs the title says, I had `throwOnTransactionFailures: false` in the config but my `sendTransaction` with the ethers wrapper was throwing.\r\nAfter some debugging I found that it wasn't actually sendTransaction but the estimateGas call before it:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[+] sending tx\r\neth_blockNumber\r\neth_chainId\r\neth_estimateGas\r\n  Contract call: <UnrecognizedContract>\r\n  From:          ...\r\n  To:            ...\r\n  Value:         0 ETH\r\n\r\n  Error: VM Exception while processing transaction: reverted with reason string '...'\r\n      at <UnrecognizedContract>.<unknown> (...)\r\n      at <UnrecognizedContract>.<unknown> (...)\r\n      at <UnrecognizedContract>.<unknown> (...)\r\n      at async EthModule._estimateGasAction (/node_modules/hardhat/src/internal/hardhat-network/provider/modules/eth.ts:425:7)\r\n      at async HardhatNetworkProvider._sendWithLogging (/node_modules/hardhat/src/internal/hardhat-network/provider/provider.ts:138:22)\r\n      at async HardhatNetworkProvider.request (/node_modules/hardhat/src/internal/hardhat-network/provider/provider.ts:115:18)\r\n      at async EthersProviderWrapper.send (/node_modules/@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers/src/internal/ethers-provider-wrapper.ts:13:20)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe fix for my code was setting the gas myself instead of letting hardhat estimate it. My issue was that it looked like sendTransaction was throwing which is confusing cause it looked like hardhat was ignoring the conf.\r\n\r\nI think my solution would be to have a warning/notice message if `throwOnTransactionFailures: false` and `eth_estimateGas` throws but not sure if it's the best solution or even if a solution is needed. \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you need more details.",
