  "body": "### Version of Hardhat\r\n\r\n2.13.1\r\n\r\n### What happened?\r\n\r\n1) hardhat node prints out `console.log` from a contract only in case of failure, if the contract completed successfully it does not print anything at all \r\n2) I have committed my simple program\r\nhttps://github.com/unegare/hardhat_trash\r\nto replay the issue, `test/SimpleRouter.ts` should be run on `npx hardhat node --fork <alchemy-mainnet>`\r\nif it is run as it is committed, no logs are printed by `node`;\r\nif `revert('qwerty');` is uncommitted-out, the test fails and log is printed.\r\nthe very line with `revert`:\r\nhttps://github.com/unegare/hardhat_trash/blob/master/contracts/SimpleRouter.sol#L141\r\n\r\nOn top of that if `revert` is committed out then balances are not changed, but if `revert` at the end of the function is added then logs provide information  that in actual fact  balances were changed, but ... reverted after that for the sake of `revert`. If there's no `revert` then the same transaction happens and logs in `npx hardhat test` show no change in balances. As though the transaction was not committed at all.\r\n\r\nThe issue can be simplified with such a thing that a repeat call to the `v3swap` function should fail since `isNotLocked` modifier should fail. But it does not fail. Which means that the state was not committed after the success transaction.\r\n(since https://github.com/unegare/hardhat_trash/blob/master/contracts/SimpleRouter.sol#L143 is commented out and the `_sender` storage variable is not `0x0` any more )\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Minimal reproduction steps\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpx hardhat node --fork <mainnet>\r\nnpx hardhat test test/SimpleRouter.ts --network localhost\r\n```\r\nthere would be no logs in the node tab.\r\n\r\n### Search terms\r\n\r\nconsole-log",
