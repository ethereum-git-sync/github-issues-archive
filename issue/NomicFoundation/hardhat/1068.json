  "body": "When DeFi trading there are 2 types of placement you might want to make in a block:\r\n\r\n**Front position:**\r\nThe trader wishes to place a transaction at position 0 within a block, or as high as possible. In this situation, the trading opportunity arises with the new block, and all traders fight to get their transactions confirmed first by offering high fees.\r\n\r\nBecause the opportunity arises with a new block, HardHat is already the ideal testing library thanks to main-net forking.\r\n\r\n**Back position:**\r\nThe trader wishes to place a transaction directly behind a target transaction. When miners see multiple transactions with the same fee the transactions are placed in a random order. Therefore traders submit multiple transactions with the same fee as the target, to increase the likelihood of placing directly behind the target.\r\n\r\nThe problem with regular main-net forking for testing the back position is that the opportunity disappears by the time the next block arrives.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I'd like to request that HardHat can fork at a transaction position as well as a block, so that contracts can be tested against opportunities which require back positioning.\r\n\r\nThank you!",
