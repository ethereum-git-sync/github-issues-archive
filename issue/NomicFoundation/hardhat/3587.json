Do you guys know where the compiler is stored so I can add a volume for it? I can't seem to find the location.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!",

    "body": "It depends on the system, but in your case it sould probably be under `~/.cache/hardhat-nodejs/`.\r\n\r\nDepending on how you are building your image, you might just force a download when the image is built. Something like:\r\n\r\n```dockerfile\r\nRUN mkdir foo && cd foo && npm init -y && npm install hardhat && touch hardhat.config.js && mkdir contracts && touch contracts/Foo.sol && npx hardhat compile && cd .. && rm -r foo\r\n```\r\n\r\n...give or take. This will use the default compiler version though, so you might want to replace `touch hardhat.config.js` with something like `echo 'module.exports = { solidity: \"0.8.17\" }' > hardhat.config.js`\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this for bookkeeping reasons, but if you have some specific question feel free to leave another comment.",
