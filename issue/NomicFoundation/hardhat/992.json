  "body": "Hi, \r\n\r\nI think it would be cool if `hardhat` network could have a config to [hardhat_reset](https://hardhat.org/guides/mainnet-forking.html#resetting-the-fork) automatically between test files or maybe even `describe` function blocks. \r\n\r\nI guess similar to what Truffle does with their \"clean room environment\"  and [contract](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/testing/writing-tests-in-javascript#use-contract-instead-of-describe-) function.",
