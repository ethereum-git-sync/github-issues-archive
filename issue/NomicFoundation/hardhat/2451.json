  "body": "Edit by @fvictorio: reproduction steps [here](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/issues/2451#issuecomment-1366089200) and [here](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/issues/3600).\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nI've recently upgraded Hardhat to the latest version and one of my [tests](https://github.com/hifi-finance/hifi/blob/f3cb5431edd53945d15557d26d3349858515156e/packages/flash-swap/test/integration/flashUniswapV2/effects/uniswapV2Call/index.ts#L57) started to fail. Did you, by chance, change the Hardhat Network to return a different revert reason when calling an external function on an EOA?\r\n\r\nMy test used to check for this error:\r\n\r\n> function call to a non-contract account\r\n\r\nBut now the contract reverts with this:\r\n\r\n> function returned an unexpected amount of data\r\n \r\nIt seems to me that if the answer is \"no\", then this could be a recently introduced bug (potentially caused by some changes in the Solidity compiler itself). The former error message is much more specific, and it's clearer to the developer what went wrong. The latter is vague and doesn't reflect the fact that there has been an attempt to call a non-contract account.\r\n\r\nHardhat is now returning a [RETURNDATA_SIZE_ERROR](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/blob/4e35c9295badc835c574bb49a8a268569ea7123a/packages/hardhat-core/src/internal/hardhat-network/stack-traces/solidity-errors.ts#L248) error instead of [NONCONTRACT_ACCOUNT_CALLED_ERROR](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/blob/4e35c9295badc835c574bb49a8a268569ea7123a/packages/hardhat-core/src/internal/hardhat-network/stack-traces/solidity-errors.ts#L251-L252).\r\n\r\nThe latter is what I'd expected Hardhat to return because the test is set up to perform a call to a non-contract account.\r\n\r\n## More Details\r\n\r\nThis is the line that triggers the revert in my contract:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/hifi-finance/hifi/blob/f3cb5431edd53945d15557d26d3349858515156e/packages/flash-swap/contracts/uniswap-v2/FlashUniswapV2.sol#L190\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- hardhat v2.8.4\r\n- solidity v0.8.12",

    "body": "@anajuliabit Not yet, but I'll try to bump this issue's priority. That doesn't mean we'll be able to get it fixed super soon, but it should move it a bit forward in our (huge) backlog.\r\n\r\nI should mention that, while this is definitely a bug and something we want to fix, I don't think it's a good idea to assert this kind of error messages in the tests. The inferred errors are mainly about helping you understand why something failed. Plus, we don't consider them part of the stable API, meaning that we could change what they say at any time and break your tests (although we try not to).",
