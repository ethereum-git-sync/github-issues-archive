I deployed a contract in Goerli, with address `0x8B880183845BdDd1FbAa2410FEe8dcf167883a99`, that has a `getChainId()` method. The contract was deployed at block 7440181. So the test should simply be: fork goerli at that block and call the `getChainId()` method. It should return 5 instead of 31337.",
