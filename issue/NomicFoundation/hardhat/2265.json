  "body": "As other users have mentioned, like [here](https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat/issues/2193) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethdev/comments/qpadg6/handling_private_keys_w_hardhat/), the current recommended way to store keys isn't ideal. Right now, the convention is to put the private key as an environment variable, which many new engineers have mistakenly pushed up to github. \r\n\r\nOther frameworks like [brownie](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [dapptools](https://dapp.tools/) have built in encryption for the keys, where you input your key into the command line, and it stores the key in a [keystore] (https://kb.myetherwallet.com/en/security-and-privacy/what-is-a-keystore-file/) json file, which means you can only access it with a password. This solves two issues:\r\n\r\n1. It removes accidentally putting your key in plaintext into a file in your project \r\n2. It encrypts your key so even if you do accidentally do something with it... it's encrypted.\r\n\r\nI think the API for this would look some like as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpx hardhat accounts import\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd you'd be prompted for your private key, account name, and a password. \r\n\r\nThen, when you do `npx hardhat accounts list` it adds the name of the account.\r\n\r\nThen, if your `hardhat.config.js`, you can just pick the name of your account, or maybe the address, or something.

    "body": "Hey, we needed something like this so we ended up building it into a hardhat plugin: https://github.com/edgeandnode/hardhat-secure-accounts. It's still early stages and will keep improving it but we've been using it for a bit so thought about sharing here.\r\n\r\nThe plugin uses ethers wallet encryption to store menmonics using keystore files in your project folder; when unlocking you get a prompt that lets you choose which account and password to use. We tried to build it to be flexible for most use cases, so you can unlock and get a wallet, a signer or a provider. It adds a couple tasks and extends the hardhat environment, I suggest taking a look at the README if you are interested in. \r\n\r\nHere is a quick sample of how you could use it, first import a mnemonic into the project:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpx hardhat accounts new\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen use it on your scripts/tasks/etc:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport hre from 'hardhat'\r\n\r\nconst wallet = await hre.accounts.getWallet()\r\nconst signerWithAddress = await hre.accounts.getSigner()\r\nconst provider = await hre.accounts.getProvider()\r\n```",
