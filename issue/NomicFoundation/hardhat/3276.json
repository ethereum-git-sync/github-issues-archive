    "body": "Hi @theodale, this is done on purpose to prevent possible replay attacks. You can explicitly set the `chainId` in the config to match the one in the forked network.\r\n\r\nThat being said, this seems to be a common point of frustration. So maybe we could include a flag (disabled by default) that makes the chain ids match. We should document that it's a somewhat insecure thing to do but that it's fine if you know what you're doing.\r\n\r\nI'm going to adapt the title of your issue to reflect this.",
