  "body": "Solidity `0.8.3` was released today.  I attempted to verify a contract compiled with this Solidity version, but `hardhat-etherscan` returned a generic error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nError in plugin @nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan: The contract verification failed.\r\nReason: Fail - Unable to verify\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe same code compiled with `0.8.2` was verified successfully.  It seems that Etherscan does not yet support version `0.8.3` because it doesn't appear on the web form dropdown.  If this is in fact the reason for the failure, and if it is possible for Hardhat to detect this situation, it would be helpful if the error message were more specific.",

It would be extra work that's probably not worth it and, more important, it would mean that when etherscan adds support for a new version we need to release a new version of `hardhat-etherscan` and people need to upgrade.\r\n\r\nI'll keep this open for a while in case there happens to be some way of doing this, but unless etherscan improves its error messages there's nothing we can do.",
