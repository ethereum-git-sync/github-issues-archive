  "body": "A new hardhat project can be initialized by running `npx hardhat`. But running the same command inside a Hardhat project does something different (it prints the help). This results in a lot of users being confused when they try to initialize a project without realizing that some parent directory has a Hardhat config, because then they get the help info instead of the project initialization prompt. This happens a lot.\r\n\r\nInstead of that behavior, we should have an explicit `npx hardhat init` command (it can be called some other way, but `init` is the obvious choice). If you **are not** inside a Hardhat project, then the usual project initialization stuff is shown. If you **are** inside a project, an error message would be shown, indicating the location of the detected Hardhat config.\r\n\r\n`npx hardhat` will continue to have the same behavior when you are inside a project. If you **are not** inside a project, then a proper error message should be shown, explaining this and suggesting the user to run `npx hardhat init` if their intention was to initialize a project. This is very important because there is a lot of documentation and educational material out there that has the plain `npx hardhat` step.\r\n\r\nOf course, as part of this we should also update all the relevant parts of our documentation, and let people know about this change so that they can update their docs or articles.\r\n\r\n- [x] Merge a PR to add `init` command\r\n- [ ] Merge a PR to update the docs. This PR should be merged after that the code is released (Docs PRs are instantly released)\r\n- [ ] Reach out to the main tutorials/docs that are using hardhat to inform about the deprecation \r\n ",
