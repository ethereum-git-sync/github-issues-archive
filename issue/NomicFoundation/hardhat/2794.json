  "body": "Hi, I'm trying to verify contracts on Ropsten and getting the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nError in plugin @nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan: The contract verification failed.\r\nReason: Fail - Unable to verify\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo make sure the problem wasn't my setup, I tried to verify the Greeter contract from Hardhat's scaffolding.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n* `npx hardhat init`\r\n* Choose `Create an advanced sample project that uses TypeScript`\r\n* Add your environment variables to `.env` (Private key + Etherscan)\r\n* In `contracts/Greeter.sol` add a dumb function or do any small change, this is so Etherscan doesn't match your bytecode to an existing, similar deploy\r\n* Deploy your contract `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network ropsten`\r\n* Add a `scripts/ropsten.js` file with the following contents `module.exports = [\"Hello, Hardhat!\"];`\r\n* Run `npx hardhat verify --network ropsten --constructor-args scripts/ropsten.js <address>`\r\n\r\nThis is probably an Etherscan issue, but I wanted to leave it here so people don't lose time thinking there's an issue with their setup like I did yesterday.",
