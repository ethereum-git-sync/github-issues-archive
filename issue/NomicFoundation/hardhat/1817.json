  "body": "So currently I'm working on an ERC721 Contract based of OpenZeppelins implementation.\r\nThe implementation lives in a file called ERC721.sol and this file by its own compiles without any problems.\r\nThe moment I try to import it into another file and try to compile it. It crashes.\r\nException is:\r\nError HH606: The project cannot be compiled, see reasons below.\r\n\r\nThese files and its dependencies cannot be compiled with your config. This can happen because they have incompatible Solidity pragmas, or don't match any of your configured Solidity compilers.\r\n\r\n  * contracts/Contract.sol\r\n\r\nTo learn more, run the command again with --verbose\r\n\r\nRead about compiler configuration at https://hardhat.org/config\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more info go to https://hardhat.org/HH606 or run Hardhat with --show-stack-traces\r\n\r\nThe pragma statements are the same everywhere.\r\n\r\nTruffle is able to compile it without any issues.\r\n\r\nThank you for your help!\r\n",

    "body": "As the error message says, when you import a dependency you can end up with something that cannot be compiled. For example, you might be using solc 0.8.3 and this contract, and that will compile fine:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\npragma solidity ^0.8.0\r\n\r\ncontract Foo {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut if you then import some file that uses `0.8.2` (without the `^`), then the file will not be compilable.\r\n\r\nThat's just an example, the specific reason here depends a lot on what you're doing.\r\n\r\nI'm closing this since I'm pretty sure it's expected behavior. \r\nPlease use [our Discord server](https://hardhat.org/discord) if you have further questions.",
