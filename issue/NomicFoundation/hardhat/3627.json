We have to copy the foundry.toml to root directory and modify `src` path in the copied foundry.toml so hardhat-foundry can read from it and compile. It would be helpful to be able to configure path of foundry folder in hardhat config so hardhat-foundry can fetch the foundry.toml file in the foundry folder and compile.\r\n\r\n### Search terms\r\n\r\nhardhat-foundry",
