  "body": "Hello Hardhat team! Turns out I raised a PR before looking at the contribution guidelines. So I'm creating this issue for posterity since I already fixed the issues that I'll be mentioning below. Here's the PR: #1924 \r\n\r\n## There's a documentation mismatch in this page: https://hardhat.org/guides/scripts.html\r\n- `Greeter deployed to: ...` mismatches with `Greeter address: ...` in the terminal command example\r\n- the example where the `node scripts/sample-script.js` command is run, the output differs from the `sample-script.js` previously mentioned right before it. It's a bit confusing for beginners that are following along with the page.\r\n- fixed in https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat/pull/1924/files#diff-f9a3c2fc8a27b0a441830a2b9c19758376a692261bf7e22ca1ac477232147e4eR68\r\n<img width=\"1177\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-10-03 at 5 23 29 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6848941/135778784-63d51111-3a2c-426b-adbe-5d3695e4ac66.png\">\r\n\r\n## I added another example in the Docs, in this page: https://hardhat.org/guides/waffle-testing.html#testing-from-a-different-account\r\n- The _Testing from a different account_ section falls short of what usually is done when unit testing from a different account\r\n- I added one more example for the common case of unauthorized users that are trying to make unauthorized transactions or function calls. So I've added an example at the bottom of that section.\r\n- I also link to Waffle's documentation for more information. I initially had trouble finding this out, so I'm improving it for the developers that will follow after me.\r\n- https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat/pull/1924/files#diff-c3ab0dc7763b1058e698f05d251a86f98a7e7ee3726795eb8c4b10cc4de57170R158-R169\r\n\r\n## Added a `Tip` in this page https://hardhat.org/guides/deploying.html : \r\n- The tip is about using `npm run` scripts feature. I know it gets dense explaining `npx` and `npm` to beginners, but that's also why I link to `npm` documentation.\r\n- I've also added more scripts to the `package.json` so that users can use the shorter commands like `npm start` or `npm t` or `npm run deploy`. It's a lot shorter than having to type `npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js`\r\n- Fixed here: https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat/pull/1924/files#diff-50d7c39a9430d37971aa76858165ab4f7921c4cc4340b28e9b673ce6982e63cfR11-R15\r\n\r\nI'm open for improvements in the documentation that I wrote. Thanks.",
