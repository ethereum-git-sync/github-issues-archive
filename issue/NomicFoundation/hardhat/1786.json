  "body": "In [the docs](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network/reference/#hardhat-network-methods), there are inconsistent ways of making calls to the hardhat network -- sometimes using typescript `hre.network.provider.request` and other times using regular javascript `network.provider.send`. I think the hre prefix is a typescript thing.\r\n\r\nA fix could be either to make them consistent or just clarify that one is using typescript and the other isn't\r\n\r\n<img width=\"799\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-08-11 at 1 18 56 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2431257/129074260-42ef9fb1-d101-41a5-87b0-cadbb778f942.png\">\r\n",

    "body": "Thanks for the feedback @jrfrantz, this is something we've talked about before so it's useful to know that it can bug people.\r\n\r\nI'm personally inclined to always use `hre`, because I feel docs should err on the side of being explicit. But, on the other hand, that wouldn't reflect actual usage, since I think most (javascript) users just use the globally injected values.\r\n\r\nMaybe what you suggested makes sense: use `hre` only for the typescript sections, even if it technically can be used in javascript too.",

    "body": "Will defer to you but share my perspective in case helpful: \r\nI learned to program web3 apps IN hardhat (via the hackathon-boilerplate tutorial), so I didn't come in knowing about concepts like setting up a local node, or how to use ethers.js. \r\n\r\nAs a result I didn't realize until my second project that I had previously been using hre.ethers in javascript, which wasn't quite the same as the ethers.js that I could install with npm. It was only then that I understood why sometimes the tutorial had me using hre.network.provider vs the ethers.js tutorial had me creating a new provider by connecting to alchemy via URL. Maybe using hre everywhere would have clarified (or maybe it's more complication than it's worth).",
