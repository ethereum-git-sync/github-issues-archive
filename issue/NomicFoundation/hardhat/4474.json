    "body": ">I would disagree with that. Solidity-coverage not properly handling the hardhat env extension is a major drawback that can't simply be ignored.\r\n\r\nFor more context I think the problem was caused by: \r\n+ using extendEnv to [cache signers from the initial provider instantiated by hardhat][1] \r\n+ solidity-coverage creating a new provider (and losing a relationship to the cached accounts)  \r\n\r\nIt's kind of related to  #1374 and #3491 although there are places in Hardhat itself (notably hardhat_reset) where the provider is recreated and it's possible doing this kind of stuff in extendEnv would run into trouble there too? Not certain. \r\n\r\nIdeally the coverage tool would be entirely passive, rely on source-maps & a tracer api, and never touch the provider. This is difficult to get right though (for example, see [Foundry coverage issues][2]\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4657/commits/74bab8140dececbb72b827ca8fa75e96437c9f49\r\n[2]: https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues?page=2&q=coverage",
