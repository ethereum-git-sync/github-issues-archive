  "body": "Typescript projects are always typechecked. You can opt-out of that with `TS_NODE_TRANSPILE_ONLY=1`, but most users don't know about this and it means unnecessary friction (since most of the time you probably don't want to typecheck).\r\n\r\nWe want to improve this. There are some things to do:\r\n\r\n1. Consider replacing `ts-node` with [`swc`](https://swc.rs/). Alternatively, just always set the transpile-only flag when using `ts-node`.\r\n2. Add some mechanism for explicitly typechecking the project, like a `typecheck` flag (or we could just use the existing `check` task).\r\n3. Document this where appropriate.",

Add a `--typecheck` global flag. When used, `ts-node` will perform typechecking as it does now.\r\n3. Make the necessary changes in the [typescript guide](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/guides/typescript).",
