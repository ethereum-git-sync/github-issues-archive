  "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\n## Limitation\r\nRight now I'm running Hardhat inside a Node/NestJS application, where I compile my Typescript files and copy the build folder to a Docker image. I also use PM2, which forces me to call scripts with `node` and not `npx hardhat --network matic run dist/main.js` in order to use the cluster module for multi-core node servers.\r\n\r\nThis becomes a problem starting with Hardhat, since `const hardhat = require('hardhat')` tries to load the TS `hardhat.config.ts` and also loads a lot of boilerplate modules like `ts-node` and `tsconfig/paths` which I'm trying to avoid in production.\r\n\r\nNot only that, I want to keep using Jest as my unit and e2e test provider, since it has features like `watch`, and NestJS expects modules to be started in a dependency injection / factory method manner.\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\nI'm suggesting allowing the `hre` variable to be created with a method like `createHre(hardhatConfig, tasks)`, where the developer put it's arguments in his own way (like config and tasks), without forcing him to load unnecessary modules or having global variables. This will allow `hre` to run in way more environments.\r\n\r\nSomething similar to what is already done in https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat/blob/d142f685125bfa29e5593016f5b4e7cc4a22b003/packages/hardhat-core/src/internal/lib/hardhat-lib.ts#L42\r\n\r\nDue to Hardhat's limitation on this topic, I'm using hardhat just for compiling and typechain, and pure ethers for the blockchain interaction\r\n\r\nThank you",
