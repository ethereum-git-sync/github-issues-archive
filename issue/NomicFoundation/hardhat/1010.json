  "body": "As discussed with @fvictorio on Telegram, \r\n\r\nit would be great to have a compiler [overrides](https://hardhat.org/guides/compile-contracts.html#multiple-solidity-versions)  setting that makes it so that you can e.g. import 1 contract from a npm package and have your `overrides` configs for that contract compilation also apply to all of its internal contract dependencies that might live and be imported inside the npm package. \r\n\r\nSomething like: \r\n\r\n**NPM package:**\r\n```solidity \r\npragma solidity >=0.6.3;\r\n\r\ncontract Bar {\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\npragma solidity >=0.6.3;\r\n\r\nimport \"./Bar.sol\"\r\n\r\ncontract Foo is Bar {\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Hardhat project**:\r\n```solidity \r\npragma solidity 0.7.4;\r\n\r\nimport \"@bar/contracts/Foo.sol\"\r\n\r\ncontract X is Foo {}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`hardhat.config.js`\r\n```javascript\r\n\"dependency/contracts/Foo.sol\": {\r\n  version: \"0.6.3\",\r\n  transitive: true\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**With the goal that `Foo.sol` and its internal dependency `Bar.sol` are both always compiled with `0.6.3` .** \r\n\r\nEdit:\r\n\r\nMaybe it's also good to explain the Use Case I have in mind that would benefit from such a config option: \r\n\r\nI am using `forking` a lot when testing stuff and this means I test a lot of contract dependencies who I instantiate from an ABI and whose artifacts are not in my project. This means that they don't benefit from the great debugging features `hardhat network` brings because they don't have a `build-file` associated with them. \r\n\r\nSo my idea is to `import` all my test dependencies contract source code in a `Dependencies.sol` contract from an `npm` package and let `hardhat compile` generate outputs for those too. \r\n\r\nMost of the times this means importing many contracts with different compiler requirements. \r\n\r\nThis is not a big problem with the current `hardhat` compiler settings and overrides. But it get's messy as soon as some of those contracts have **wrong** pragma statments like \r\n\r\n```solidity\r\npragma solidity >= 0.6.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhen actually it should be \r\n\r\n```solidity\r\npragma solidity ^0.6.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen you get into a situation where if you want all of them and their internal dependencies to be compiled with `0.6` and not anything higher, you have to dig into the contract file and `override` every one of its internal contract dependencies too in the `overrides` config. \r\n\r\nI know this might seem stupid because developers should get their pragma statements right in the first place. \r\n\r\nBut it would be great to have a more powerful overrides option in case they don't.
