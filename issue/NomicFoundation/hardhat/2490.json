  "body": "**Hardhat version 2.9.1**\r\nI do a `delegatecall()` to a `sweep` function in another contract throw a proxy. Delegated sweep should:\r\n* Throw exception if msg.sender is not owner (does not fail)\r\n* Call to another contract, erc20 and transfer funds\r\n\r\nThis delegate call is not reading the state in delegated contract nor writing storage in token contract. I can transfer tokens in direct calls, but not among contracts. Also is not raising exceptions.\r\n\r\nSeems related to [#1320](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/issues/1320)\r\n\r\n```\r\ncontract UserWallet {\r\n    Controller controller;\r\n\r\n    constructor(address controllerAddress) {\r\n        controller = Controller(controllerAddress);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function sweep(address _token, uint256 _amount)\r\n        public\r\n        returns (bool, bytes memory)\r\n    {\r\n        (_amount);\r\n        return controller.sweeper.delegatecall(msg.data);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`controller.sweeper` is a proxy address (deployed from Controller) that transfers funds (tokens) from an ERC20 contract.\r\nIn my tests, delegated `sweep`'s modifier requirements are not raising an exception. Also, when an authorized account is calling, tokens in ERC20 are not moving. ERC20 is deployed during the test execution.\r\n\r\nMaybe there are more related cases [like this](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/114783/solidity-0-8-delegatecall-does-not-mutate-contracts-storage).",
