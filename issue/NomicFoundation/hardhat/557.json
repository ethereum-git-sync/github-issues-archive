    "body": "This could be simulated with [Import Remapping](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/path-resolution.html#import-remapping). The compiler already has a feature that lets you tell it that `https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol` is actually `@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol`. This would also solve the niche use case from #1014.\r\n\r\nAnother way to do this that is already supported by the compiler is a custom [Import Callback](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/path-resolution.html#import-callback). The advantage of this is that it would not require the user to explicitly say where the file is - the compiler would just ask Hardhat to provide file content and Hardhat could download it in the background. The downside is that only the [JavaScript interface lets you provide a callback](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-js#high-level-api) so this would not work with native compiler binaries via the `--standard-json` option.",
