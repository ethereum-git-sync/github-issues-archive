The best way to do this is to include a [Minimal Reproducible Example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example). If you can't do that, then include a link to your repo, and the steps to reproduce the problem. The easiest it is to reproduce your problem, the faster we are going to be able to fix it.\r\n\r\nIf you are submitting a feature request, please take the time to clearly describe your use case, and not only your proposed solution.\r\n\r\nThis issue will be automatically assigned to a Hardhat team member. This person will act as the point of contact between you and the team, but won't necessarily fix it nor address it in any way. An issue being assigned does not mean that it's being worked on.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe documentation for `evm_mine` says \"Same as Ganache\". However, In Ganache, I can pass in the number of blocks as the argument: https://trufflesuite.com/blog/introducing-ganache-7/#5-mine-blocks-instantly-at-interval-or-on-demand\r\n\r\ne.g. I can do `[{\"blocks\": 100}]` as my arguments to the RPC call.\r\n\r\nWhen I try to do this using `hardhat node`, I get the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nErrors encountered in param 0: Invalid value {\"blocks\":100} supplied to : (QUANTITY | number)/0\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt looks like it does not handle a JSON object with `blocks` keys and instead treats it like a timestamp.\r\n\r\nI would like to be able to mine more than one block without using timestamps.\r\n\r\n:)",
