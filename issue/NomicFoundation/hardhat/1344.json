  "body": "This is one of the strangest errors I've encountered. I might be missing something for sure. There's no way to explain the behaviour without repo. So, here it is:  https://github.com/novaknole/hardhat-bug\r\n\r\n* run `yarn` to install dependencies.\r\n* go to `hardhat.config.ts`, find the `PUT HERE` string and replace it with the private key of  RINKEBY network.\r\n* take a look at `./contracts/Test2.sol` and understand what it does. It just does nothing special.  `hardhat-deploy` just deploys `Test2` which deploys `Test` contract in the constructor. Seems all fine..\r\n* Now, go again to `./contracts/Test2.sol` and find the line `uint x = 8282`. Just remember this, we are gonna change back and forth (you will know why soon).\r\n* run `yarn deploy --network rinkeby`. This command deploys `Test2` contract with `DeterministicDeployment:true`.  After the command deploys it, verification starts. You can check what I am doing in `./deploy/verify.ts`. Basically,  I am trying to verify `Test` contract which was deployed from `Test2`'s contstructor. The `verify.ts` file should make sense. So basically, this step will deploy everything and verify `Test` just fine. (**STEP 5** for future reference)\r\n* change `uint x = 8282` to any other number, let's do it together and change it to `uint x = 8283`, so after running `yarn deploy --network rinkeby` again, it starts to deploy from scratch and not uses the already deployed code(that's what `DeterministicDeployment:true` does). So, this will also deploy the new contracts and verify `Test` contract just fine.\r\n* change `uint x = 8283` to `uint x = 8282` and run `yarn deploy --network rinkeby`. You will notice that this command isn't going to start deploying `Test2` which means `Test` won't also be deployed. All good. now, verification process of `Test` starts again.(NOTE: it was already deployed and verified in **STEP 5**, but we get an error:\r\n\r\n> \r\n> The address provided as argument contains a contract, but its bytecode doesn't match any of your local contracts.\r\n> \r\n> Possible causes are:\r\n>   - Contract code changed after the deployment was executed. This includes code for seemingly unrelated contracts.\r\n>   - A solidity file was added, moved, deleted or renamed after the deployment was executed. This includes files for seemingly unrelated contracts.\r\n>   - Solidity compiler settings were modified after the deployment was executed (like the optimizer, target EVM, etc.).\r\n>   - The given address is wrong.\r\n>   - The selected network (rinkeby) is wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo interesting. No idea what's going on, but I realized one thing.  \r\n\r\nLet's go to `contracts/Test2` and comment the line `_registerStandard(type(ERC1271).interfaceId); `. As soon as you do this and repeat all the steps above, the error won't show up..\r\n\r\n\r\nHope you can take a look at this as fast as you can.. no idea what's going on..\r\n",
