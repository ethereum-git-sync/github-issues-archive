    "body": "Hey Daniel! Thanks for offering your help üôåüèª\r\n\r\nWe've been thinking about how to implement this. The main issue we see is that there's not a finished standard about what a javascript ethereum provider should be. There's [EIP1193](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1193.md) but it's not ready yet. This complicates integration with the different plugins (e.g. buidler-ethers and buidler-web3).\r\n\r\nWhat we have in mind, as a temporal solution, is to implement something similar to [this script](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/blob/master/scripts/test.sh).\r\n\r\nThe idea is to override the `test` task to do this:\r\n1. Check if the network is `develop`. If it's not, do nothing special.\r\n2. Check if ganache-cli is running in the right port, if it's running, do nothing special.\r\n3. Start ganache-cli as a subprocess.\r\n4. Wait for ganache-cli to start working (the linked script does it with `nc` and `sleep`).\r\n5. Run the tests \r\n6. Gracefully kill ganache-cli.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\nI've just pushed [a branch](https://github.com/nomiclabs/buidler/tree/ganache-cli/packages/buidler-ganache) with an empty plugin with all of its boilerplate ready. You should be able to implement this in its [index.ts](https://github.com/nomiclabs/buidler/blob/ganache-cli/packages/buidler-ganache/src/index.ts), and to test it [here](https://github.com/nomiclabs/buidler/blob/ganache-cli/packages/buidler-ganache/test/tests.ts).\r\n\r\nAlso, I created a [CONTRIBUTING.md file](https://github.com/nomiclabs/buidler/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) with some info about our dev workflow.\r\n\r\nYou may also want to check out [this guide](https://buidler.dev/documentation/#plugin-development-best-practices)\r\n",
