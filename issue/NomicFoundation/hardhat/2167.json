    "body": "Hey @drortirosh, thanks a lot for suggesting this. As @djh58 said, the workaround for now is to set `networks.hardhat.chainId` in the config. There are also some shenanigans you can do with environment variables to be able to change the chain id from the command line (I can expand on this if you want).\r\n\r\nWe are planning to make a `hardhat-network-cli` binary to let users start a hardhat network instance outside of a hardhat project. That command will have several parameters like this. I wonder though how to call a \"use the same id as the remote network\" param. Since that's a somewhat unsafe thing to do (for replay reasons), we don't want to do it by default, nor to make it _too_ easy to do. Maybe a verbose param like `--unsafe-use-remote-chain-id` could work.",

    "body": "@fvictorio @drortirosh  I think that's a valid risk. \r\n[Here's](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/providers/types/#providers-TransactionRequest) what's in Ethers' docs:\r\n> If the chain ID is 0 will disable EIP-155 and the transaction will be valid on any network. This can be dangerous and care should be taken, since it allows transactions to be replayed on networks that were possibly not intended. Intentionally-replayable transactions are also disabled by default on recent versions of Geth and require configuration to enable.\r\n\r\nIf the chainId isn't specified it defaults to 31337 on Hardhat. Although even if you specify it to say 1, unless you're also configuring the gas price to be \"market rate\" that there's a good chance the transaction would fail on a live network. \r\n\r\nUltimately, it probably isn't a good idea to use a local fork with a real wallet with private keys, unless you're 100% sure your development environment is safe. [Impersonating](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network/reference/#hardhat-impersonateaccount) allows you to simulate sending actual transactions to a fork (or a regular hardhat network) and is a lot safer.\r\n\r\nThe only downside is you can't sign messages with it, so if that's something you're trying to mock out your best bet is to use a dummy account without any actual Ether ",

    "body": "> can you please expand on the way to set chainId from commandline?\r\n\r\nSure. In your Hardhat config you do something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  chainId: Number(process.env.HARDHAT_CHAIN_ID)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then you run your command like this: `HARDHAT_CHAIN_ID=123 npx hardhat test`\r\n\r\n> Also, is it possible to set a new chainId in the middle of a test suite?\r\n\r\nUhm, I don't think that's possible, at least not in an easy way.\r\n\r\n> What is the recommended way to run test on multiple chainIds?\r\n\r\nI guess it depends on your use case. First thing that comes to mind (although far from ideal): have two separate directories in your tests and then do:\r\n\r\n```\r\nHARDHAT_CHAIN_ID=123 npx hardhat test test/a/**/*\r\nHARDHAT_CHAIN_ID=456 npx hardhat test test/b/**/*\r\n```\r\n\r\n(I haven't tested this, but in theory it should work)",
