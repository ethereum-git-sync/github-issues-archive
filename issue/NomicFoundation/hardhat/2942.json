  "body": "I'll preface by saying that this worked for me last week and reverting to an older branch demonstrates the same behavior. \r\n\r\nAfter deploying my contracts and verifying that they exist on the block explorer, I'm calling the verify task against the attached contracts. \r\n\r\nI get the following: \r\n`Nothing to compile\r\nNo need to generate any newer typings.\r\nSuccessfully submitted source code for contract\r\ncontracts/SeasonOne.sol:SeasonOne at 0xd6837D0A13678fAeC5bF7A8720463Ed92C9B07cF\r\nfor verification on the block explorer. Waiting for verification result...`\r\n\r\nThis will hang indefinitely until killed. No error is returned and it doesn't seem to time out either. I will submit manually but figured that this at least shows that there needs to be a timeout. Not sure if there are other uncaught errors causing this to hang. I'll happily share anything else necessary to help reproduce. \r\n\r\nOther information: \r\n\r\nRepo: https://github.com/coinlander/Coinlander/\r\nBranch: main\r\nNetwork: Arbitrum Testnet \r\n\r\n",
