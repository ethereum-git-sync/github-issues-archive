I am deploying contracts on a non-hardhat backend service and need to verify for them on etherscan as they are created, so I just need the flattened version of the contract and its dependencies, but its just not clear how to work the flattener.

    "body": "That clarification would help.\r\n\r\nA brief entry in the website documentation would be handy, just would save a lot of time for newbies.\r\n\r\nThe syntax is a bit confusing if what you are trying to do is flatten a single contract, and all of **its** dependencies.  I had to figure out by trial and error that if want to flatten ContractA which imports B and C whether I needed to \r\n`flatten [ContractA, ContractB, ContractC] ` or\r\n`flatten contracts/ContractA.sol, contracts/ContractB.sol, contracts/ContractB.sol` or\r\n`flatten contracts/ContractA.sol > flattened.sol` etc.\r\n\r\nAn example or two would save a lot of time, and also some note about resolving conflicting SPDX identifiers, and that the flattener cant deal with cyclic dependencies even though the compiler seems to manage it without a problem.\r\n\r\nThanks.  Now I am fighting with verify, same sort of issues around constructor arguments.  I took me a lot of fooling around to figure out how to put more than one constructor argument on the command line, whether they need quotes, commas etc.  and that apparently there is no way to verify on the command line if the constructor takes a struct as an argument etc.\r\n\r\nAll of this would be a lot easier with just a few more examples of the right way to do it in the documentation on the website \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ",
