It just hangs for a long time making the test suite unnecessarily slow. But all the test setups and assertions are running fine and fast, only the test just wont exit\n\n### Minimal reproduction steps\n\nRun a test suite that involves deploying new contracts, executing transactions and performing assertions, on a live network like goerli, arbitrum goerli, etc.\n\n### Search terms\n\ntest, hang, exit, live network, testnet",
