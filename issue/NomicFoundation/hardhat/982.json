That is not the case in Hardhat (you can read about that [here](https://hardhat.org/guides/compile-contracts.html#artifacts)).\r\n\r\nFrom what I see in [their API](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/test-environment/0.1/api#contract), one alternative is doing this:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst GreeterArtifact = artifacts.readArtifactSync(\"Greeter\")\r\nconst Greeter = contract.fromABI(GreeterArtifact.abi)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI haven't tested it, but maybe that works. There's also a chance that you need to pass `GreeterArtifact.bytecode` or `GreeterArtifact.deployedBytecode` as the second argument, I'm not sure.",

    "body": "Thanks @fvictorio.\r\nIndeed the problem manifested when I was trying to migrate from `buidler` to `hardhat`. Most of the migration when seamlessly, with this as the most notable exception.\r\n\r\nI didn't try your solution, but I was able to get around the issue by installing `@nomiclabs/hardhat-truffle5`, and using the truffle syntax.\r\nFor reference, the substituted lines are commented out\r\n``` solidity \r\n//const { accounts } = require('@openzeppelin/test-environment');\r\n\r\n//const MyContract = contract.fromArtifact('Greeter');\r\nconst Greeter = artifacts.require('Greeter');\r\n\r\nconst { expect } = require('chai');\r\n\r\n//describe('Greeter test', function () {\r\ncontract('Greeter', (accounts) => {\r\n  it('Is able to compute hash', async () => {\r\n    const [owner] = accounts;\r\n    const greeter = await Greeter.new('Hello, world!', {\r\n      from: owner,\r\n    });\r\n    expect(await greeter.greet()).to.equal('Hello, world!');\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n``` \r\n\r\nThis is not a full solution to working with the openzenppelin test-environment, but other integrations such as  `@openzeppelin/test-helpers` work OK.\r\n\r\nI'll reopen if I'll find a fix or need something specific from `@openzeppelin/test-environment` that I can't do without :) \r\n\r\nAppricate the answer",
