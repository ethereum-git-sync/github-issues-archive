  "body": "Buidler is a great framework, but it lacks official support or documentation for Jest. I've talked about this with @alcuadrado before and he agrees that maybe a guide would be helpful, so I created this issue to track this.\r\n\r\nNote that Jest is by far the most popular framework, but most of the crypto world is not aware. My theory is because most crypto people are from the backend world. And Jest is largely a frontend-driven phenomenon:\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-05-21 at 11 05 26 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/943555/82572866-02d00700-9b53-11ea-893e-2554838aab2a.png)\r\n\r\nSource: https://npmcharts.com/compare/mocha,jest,chai\r\n\r\nI will try to take some time to experiment with different setups and report back here.",
