  "body": "Hardhat Network can recognize method calls that exist in the compiled output of the project. But it could happen that for some reason there are transactions that are not recognized (maybe the artifacts weren't loaded for some reason, or in the upcoming fork mode). \r\n\r\nTo improve this, we could have a set of known selectors that are always available. We should define which ones to have, ideally based on data. But a first iteration could just have some cherry-picked ones (ERC20 methods for example).\r\n\r\nRelated: #3486",
