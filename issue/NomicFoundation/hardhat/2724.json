I ended up on this adventure:\r\n\r\n1) Create a solidity smart contract method with enough arguments that it produced a stack too deep error.\r\n2) Do research on optimizer and viaIR. Enable it.\r\n3) Realize that tests fail with viaIR on?\r\n4) Find this thread.\r\n5) run npm install hardhat@ir\r\n6) re-run npx hardhat compile; npx hardhat test\r\n7) Profit?",
