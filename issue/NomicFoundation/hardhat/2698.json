  "body": "When calling `eth_getStorageAt`, the parameter validation in `isRpcQuantityString` (src/internal/core/jsonrpc/types/base-types.ts:127) uses the following regex to validate the 1st-place parameter (the storage location):\r\n\r\n    /^0x(?:0|(?:[1-9a-fA-F][0-9a-fA-F]*))$/\r\n\r\nThis regex won't match values with leading zeros. Thus, the following is a valid string:\r\n\r\n    0x1\r\n\r\nAnd this is not:\r\n\r\n    0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001\r\n\r\nThe superb `cast` utility from [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) left-zero-pads its parameters. This leads to the following frustrating error:\r\n\r\n    $ cast storage 0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2 0x1\r\n    \r\n    Error:\r\n      0: (code: -32602, message: Errors encountered in param 1: Invalid value \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001\" supplied to : QUANTITY, data: None)\r\n\r\nThe [spec](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1474#quantity) appears to reject leading zeros, so it looks like Hardhat is implementing the spec correctly.\r\n\r\nBut other RPC endpoints appear to be more forgiving:\r\n\r\n    $ cast storage 0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2 0 --rpc-url https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/blah\r\n    \r\n    0x577261707065642045746865720000000000000000000000000000000000001a\r\n\r\nI'll cross-post this with the Foundry team, but wanted to raise it with the Hardhat team too, in case it makes more sense to allow Hardhat to deviate from the spec a little and strip the leading zeros.",
