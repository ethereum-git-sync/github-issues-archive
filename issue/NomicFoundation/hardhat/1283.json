The only fix I have yet found is to mount `~:/root` which is very non-ideal.\r\n\r\nI like being able to use docker for testing sometimes so I know it is the same node and npm config across platforms and when developing I often don't want to make a new docker image after every change. And of course I set it up with my IDE so it is just a quick one-line call.",

    "body": "Hey @Eadword, thanks for letting us know. I think the real underlying issue here is that hardhat shouldn't fail if it doesn't have access to one of those directories.\r\n\r\nOne possible solution here is to use the local `cache` directory for things like the telemetry config and the downloaded compilers, if the \"default\" ones cannot be written. I'm going to create a new issue about that.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I don't think we'll be able to work on that soon. Adding an environment variable, as you originally requested, makes more sense in this case, **but** my guess is that you'll still get this problem when Hardhat will try to download the compilers. So my guess is that using a different mount is your best shot right now.",
