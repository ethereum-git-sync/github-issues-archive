  "body": "### Describe the feature\r\n\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nIt seems that [vitest](https://vitest.dev/) is not fully supported by Hardhat: some tests from the [tutorial](https://hardhat.org/tutorial) run successfully with vitest, while others fail, probably due to the fact that Hardhat Chai matchers are not adapted to work with vitest. It is worth to support the Jest style of matchers as vitest supports them:\r\n* Jest style: `expect(...).toEmit(...)`, `expect(...).not.toRevertWith(...)`\r\n* Chai style: `expect(...).to.emit(...)`, `expect(...).not.to.be.revertedWith(...)`\r\n\r\nWhat is the current level of vitest support in Hardhat? Is is partially supported or it just works by chance? What are the plans to support vitest in Hardhat? Is it planned to adapt the Hardhat Chai matchers to work with vitest using the Jest style?I'm aware of the issue to [document vitest ussage](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/issues/3790) with Hardhat, but I feel that the Hardhat Chai matchers are not all working well with vitest.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nVlad\r\n\r\n### Search terms\r\n\r\nvitest hardhat matchers",
