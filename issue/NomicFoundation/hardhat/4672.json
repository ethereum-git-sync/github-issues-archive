Could be possible instead of store directly the values, store a command that allow to safely retrieve those values ? Something like `hardhat vars set VAR_KEY --command COMMAND_TO_GET_VALUE`.  Thanks in advanced\n\n### Search terms\n\n_No response_",

    "body": "Not right now. One problem is that the command would need to be run in a synchronous way every time the variable is fetched (the Hardhat config needs to be loaded synchronously, for certain design reasons). And if the command is somehow interactive (for example, if you need to enter a password or a 2FA), then things get weirder.\r\n\r\nThis is one thing we want to improve in the next major version of Hardhat: more powerful and secure stores of configuration variables.",
