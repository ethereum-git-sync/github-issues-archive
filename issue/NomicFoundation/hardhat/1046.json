  "body": "One of the unit tests in my project started to fail for no obvious reason after migration from buidler to hardhat. The test is using Waffle's mock contract, but maybe it is not relevant. I'm not sure how to provide a minimal reproducible example because the bug apparently manifests itself only in very specific circumstances. So here's the test:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/xuhcc/monorepo/blob/963d252f87f876a0e39bff46c95778dda93dcc8f/contracts/tests/round.ts#L210-L219\r\n\r\nThis is the part of the contract which is being tested:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/xuhcc/monorepo/blob/963d252f87f876a0e39bff46c95778dda93dcc8f/contracts/contracts/FundingRound.sol#L144-L145\r\n\r\nThe result:\r\n\r\n```\r\n     AssertionError: Expected transaction to be reverted with FundingRound: User has not been verified, but other exception was thrown: Error: Transaction reverted without a reason and without a valid sourcemap provided by the compiler. Some line numbers may be off. We strongly recommend upgrading solc and always using revert reasons.\r\n```\r\n\r\nInterestingly, the test passes if I insert `console.log` statement in the right place:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/xuhcc/monorepo/commit/177d7bae80e454af2661f1ba858dcbd376bd9d82#diff-b094db7ce2f99cbcbde7ec178a6754bac666e2192f076807acbd70d49ddd0559\r\n\r\n- hardhat v2.0.3\r\n- hardhat-waffle v2.0.0\r\n- ethereum-waffle v3.0.2\r\n- solidity v0.6.12",

    "body": "I think you might be getting an error similar to this one https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9006 The tl;dr is that in some solc versions, revert strings *sometimes* might not be correctly detected. I think that was supposed to be fixed (in 0.6.9 I think?), but maybe some more edge case is being triggered here. Notice that if you disable the optimizer, this problem doesn't happen (you have to enable `allowUnlimitedContractSize` if you do that, btw).\r\n\r\nIt is entirely possible that there's a fix that could be done on our side, but to be honest I don't think we'll have time to look into this soon. Plus, it might be the case that the problem comes from solc and not from hardhat.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what's your best course of action here. One option is to just check that the transaction reverts, and not the error message. It's less than ideal, but at least your tests will work again.\r\n\r\nAnother, more involved option is to run your tests in two modes: with and without the optimizer. So you'll need something like an environment variable to switch between the modes. When the optimizer is disabled, you disable it in the config, enable the unlimited contract size, and check the revert error in that test. When it's enabled, you only check that the tx reverts. Probably not worth the effort, though.\r\n\r\nYou can also try upgrading everything to solidity 0.7, but I can't promise that that will fix the issue :sweat_smile: ",
