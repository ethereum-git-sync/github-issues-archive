  "body": "Hardhat detects errors caused by a contract making a call to an address that it's not a contract, but only when the callee is a recognized contract (that is, we know its source). But with the mainnet forking feature, it's very common to run into this situation from an unrecognized contract.\r\n\r\nWe should be able to detect these scenarios, although it will mean some significant changes to the error inferrer.\r\n\r\nI created [a branch](https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat/tree/non-contract-call-from-unrecognized) with a failing test for this.",
