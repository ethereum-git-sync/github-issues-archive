    "body": "> * from what I understand, to `await` expect, `chai` needs an extra plugin\r\n\r\nNot exactly. If a custom matcher (like `revertedWith`) \"returns\" a promise, then it can be awaited. That's how waffle matchers are implemented under the hood.\r\n\r\nSo what's going on here is: you are using `hardhat-waffle`, which includes Waffle's chai matchers, which has matchers like `revertedWith`, that are \"promise-like\" and therefore can be awaited.\r\n\r\nAs far as I know, waffle doesn't add `chai-as-promised`. You should be able to double-check this by doing `await expect(Promise.resolve(1)).to.eventually.equal(1)`\r\n\r\nHope this answers your question, let me know if it doesn't.\r\n\r\n(As a side note: we are working on [our own chai matchers](https://www.notion.so/nomiclabs/Public-Hardhat-Chai-Matchers-11feb9185dd54591999f4e813f90c10c) and they _will_ include `chai-as-promised`. Do you think there's a problem with that, or it's just something you'd expect to see explicitly documented?)",
