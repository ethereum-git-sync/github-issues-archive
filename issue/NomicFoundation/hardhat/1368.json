  "body": "Hello :) \r\n\r\nIn almost all my projects, being php, js, ts... I'm using `dotenv` to store some constants that may differ depending on the environment. \r\n\r\nBut because having to prefix or suffix the env key is not ideal and doesn't really goes well with the idea of CI etc... I usually create an .env file for each environment (e.g: `.env`, `.env.prod`, `.env.staging`, `.env.development`) to override the default ones and create something specific by environment.\r\n\r\nIn hardhat, I would love to be able to do the same thing using a .env by network, and, in hardhat.config.js be able to do something like:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// get the current network \r\nconst network = arguments.network;\r\n\r\n// load the .env file associated to this network\r\nlet path = '.env';\r\nif (['rinkeby', 'polygon', 'mainnet'].indexOf(network) !== -1) {\r\n  path += `.${network}`;\r\n}\r\n\r\nrequire('dotenv').config({\r\n  path\r\n});\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * @type import('hardhat/config').HardhatUserConfig\r\n */\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n    solidity: '0.7.6',\r\n    networks: {\r\n        rinkeby: {\r\n            url: process.env.RPC,\r\n            accounts: [process.env.DEPLOYER_KEY, process.env.MINTER_KEY],\r\n        },\r\n        mainnet: {\r\n            url: process.env.RPC,\r\n            accounts: [process.env.DEPLOYER_KEY, process.env.MINTER_KEY],\r\n        },\r\n        polygon: {\r\n            url: process.env.RPC,\r\n            accounts: [process.env.DEPLOYER_KEY, process.env.MINTER_KEY],\r\n        },\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* or even much smaller\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n    solidity: '0.7.6',\r\n    networks: {\r\n        [network]: {\r\n            url: process.env.RPC,\r\n            accounts: [process.env.DEPLOYER_KEY, process.env.MINTER_KEY],\r\n        },\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n*/\r\n```\r\n\r\nWould it be possible for hardhat to make the arguments available in the `hardhat.config.js` in order to achieve something like this?\r\n\r\nThis also helps to save A LOT of if/else conditions in all the different scripts, and in CI environments, to not have a bunch of KEYS_{environment} defined.",

We also need to think carefully if this doesn't introduce weird edge cases (I believe it doesn't, but I haven't thought too much about it).\r\n\r\nI'm inclined to think this would be a good idea, since many times users have wanted to do something in the config based on the selected network.",
