  "body": "At the moment, Hardhat works pretty well with npm 7 or later, but it's not great for other package managers, especially when the Toolbox is involved:\r\n\r\n- Older versions of npm and yarn v1 don't auto-install peer dependencies, so every package has to be manually installed.\r\n- pnpm and the new yarn can auto install peer deps, but this is an opt-in behavior. AFAIK, this can be done via a a configuration file or a command line flag.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, our docs don't correctly reflect the fact that there are two yarns out there, nor they include pnpm. Maybe we can add a new tab for yarn berry and pnpm, or maybe there's another way to do this.\r\n\r\nIn any case, this is a tracking issue to, at least:\r\n\r\n- Make sure the project initialization correctly handles the different package managers. #3554 was a first step in that direction.\r\n- Improve the docs to better explain and reflect the fact that there are multiple package managers\r\n- If possible, improve errors related to missing peer dependencies to point the users in the right direction. Maybe having a central guide about this is necessary.",
