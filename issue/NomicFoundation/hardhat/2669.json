  "body": "I have a monorepo with hardhat using typescript and a node app also using typescript. I need to import hardhat from the node project to invoke a task programmatically.\r\nEverything works fine when running the app in dev (with ts-node). However, when I build the ts app into a js file for production, importing hardhat fails.\r\n\r\nThe error happens because when importing hardhat, it [looks for the configuration file](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/blob/767f68dee84d6a47cd40153a8ab8552f41a95d5e/packages/hardhat-core/src/internal/core/project-structure.ts#L19), and, since hardhat.config.ts exists, it tries to import it. However, this fails with the error: \r\n\r\n```\r\n/hardhat-test/hardhat.config.ts:1\r\nimport * as dotenv from \"dotenv\";\r\n^^^^^^\r\n\r\nSyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem is that hardhat always tries to import \"hardhat.config.ts\" before \"hardhat.config.js\". So, as long as the .ts file exists, importing hardhat will fail.\r\nAs a workaround, the build script has to compile hardhat.config.ts and then remove it.\r\nBut in some cases, this error can also happen in non-production environments, for instance, when importing hardhat from a nest.js app on dev mode.\r\n\r\n# Reproduction steps:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ npx hardhat\r\n> Create an advanced sample project that uses TypeScript\r\n```\r\n\r\ncreate app.ts\r\n```ts\r\nimport hre from 'hardhat'\r\n\r\nasync function main() {\r\n  await hre.run('help')\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nadd build script to package.json:\r\n```json\r\n\"scripts\": {\r\n  \"build\": \"tsc app.ts\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nbuild and run:\r\n```\r\n$ npm run build\r\n$ node app.js\r\n/hardhat-test/hardhat.config.ts:1\r\nimport * as dotenv from \"dotenv\";\r\n^^^^^^\r\n\r\nSyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n# Proposed solutions\r\n\r\n1. Catching the error when [requiring](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/blob/23567bbf220ba9708362b8a59b86e78a269dde05/packages/hardhat-core/src/internal/core/config/config-loading.ts#L28) \"hardhat.config.ts\", and if the error message matches \"SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module\", require hardhat.config.js. I personally prefer this solution since it requires no extra configuration.\r\n2. Add an optional env variable that allows specifying the hardhat config path. This will allow us to run the .ts config on dev mode and the .js file on production.\r\n\r\nIf any of these solutions are acceptable, I can prepare a PR.",

    "body": "I think a step in the right direction would be to take the closest config file no matter whether it is .js or .ts.\r\n\r\nThat would allow having a `./build` folder where a compiled project could function.\r\n\r\nRight now the behavior is:\r\n1. Scan for a .ts config file all the way up in the directory hierarchy, if it is found, use it\r\n2. If no .ts config file is found, look for .js\r\n\r\nThat means that if you have a .ts config file anywhere up in the dir structure, it is preferred over the closer compiled .js config file.\r\n\r\nBetter behavior would be:\r\n1. Start at the CWD\r\n2.  Is there a config file? \r\n * If there is one, use it. \r\n * If there are both .ts  and .js, throw an error\r\n * if there is none look into the parent directory, repeat 2.\r\n",
