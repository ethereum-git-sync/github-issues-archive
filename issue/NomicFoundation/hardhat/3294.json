    "body": "Hi @ZacxDev, I think there are two things to respond here.\r\n\r\nThe `ENOENT` issue was fixed in the latest release, so could you upgrade Hardhat and try again? The reason that happens is (probably) that you are using a system that doesn't have the `ld` loader ([this](https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/11/17/debugging-a-weird--file-not-found--error/) is a good explanation of the issue). The fix will recognize that the compiler is not working, and download solcjs instead, which is much slower but works in all systems where node.js works.\r\n\r\nWith respect to using a custom path for a solc, please check [this example](https://github.com/fvictorio/hardhat-examples/tree/master/custom-solc).\r\n\r\nI do think we should support that in core though, so I'm going to leave this feature request open.",
