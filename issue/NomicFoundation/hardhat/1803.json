Very similar to index.js/ts.\r\n\r\nThe feature request is: It'd be great if we could autofill `/index.sol` part if one is importing from a directory.",

    "body": "There was a similar idea proposed by @frangio in OpenZeppelin at some point: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/issues/1607.\r\n\r\nI just wanted to note that there are pretty important caveats if this were to be implemented in a naive way, by putting the content of `index.sol` under two different names (both `contracts/interfaces/index.sol` and `contracts/interfaces/`) in Standard JSON input. The problem can be avoided by using the [import remapping](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/path-resolution.html#import-remapping) mechanism in the compiler. See https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/issues/1607#issuecomment-870961978 for details.\r\n\r\nBasically, if Hardhat would pass `settings.remappings` to the compiler (not sure if it does or not), achieving this would be as simple as adding this to your config:\r\n```json\r\n    \"settings\": {\r\n        \"remappings\": [\r\n            \":contracts/interfaces/=contracts/interfaces/index.sol\"\r\n        ]\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that I used `interfaces/` rather than `interfaces` - using the latter would make it also match anything that starts with that name, e.g. `contracts/interfacesAndAbstractContracts` would get remapped to `contracts/interfaces/index.solAndAbstractContracts`, which is not what you want. The trailing slash in the import (i.e. `import ... from './interfaces/';`) also makes it clearer that this is not just a typical import.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Actually, this would not work with config alone - Hardhat has to also to be aware of the remappings to know that it should try to load `contracts/interfaces/index.sol` and not `contracts/interfaces/` when it encounters such an import.",
