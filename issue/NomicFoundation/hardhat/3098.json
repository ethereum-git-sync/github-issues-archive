Use `fs.realpath.native` and compare the result with the path we have.\r\n2. In case-sensitive file systems, this will always be true. But in case-insensitive systems it could be false. In that case, throw a \"wrong casing\" error.\r\n3. If a file is not found, then use the `getSourceNameTrueCase` function to check if the problem was a wrong casing. If it was, throw a \"wrong casing\" error. If not, throw a \"file not found\" error.\r\n\r\nStep 3 is unnecessary in case-insensitive file systems, but since we are doing this only when a file is not found, the extra work is not that important.",
