I tried upgrading to `hardhat ^2.16.1 `and that didnt change the behavior. \r\nBut after struggling all day I'm close to solving it. \r\n\r\nMy repo thats having the issue has >100 contracts , I temporarily removed 30 contracts and the `yarn hardhat compile` command was able to run, it was hanging for a while maybe 10-15 seconds but eventually completed and generated the artifacts . This is the good news. \r\n\r\nHowever I still need those 30 contracts & my project will keep growing. I tried using `yarn hardhat compile --concurrency 5` , up to the limit 9 but no luck. \r\n\r\nSince I'm assuming its a memory issue causing the `compile` command to hang and drop how can I increase the amount of memory hardhats `compile` command uses? \r\n\r\nOS: macOS Ventura 13.4.1\r\nNode: node v16.19.0 (npm v8.19.3)",

    "body": "Hi @fvictorio , so I tried to increase memory size with `NODE_OPTIONS=\"--max_old_space_size=4096` (also tried increased sizes) and unfortunately that didnt help. I also tried using the `hardhat --max-memory` flag and that also didnt help. \r\n\r\nRather than deleting 30 contracts I tried deleting just 1 contract and running \"`yarn hardhat compile --verbose`\", after which the `solcjs:run` step lagged for ~10 seconds and spit out a new error. Looks like it even sent a sentry event. \r\n\r\n> hardhat:core:hre Running task compile:solidity:log:run-compiler-start +4ms\r\n>   hardhat:core:hre Running task **compile:solidity:solcjs:run** +0ms\r\n> An unexpected error occurred:\r\n> \r\n> RuntimeError: table index is out of bounds\r\n>     at wasm://wasm/04ebca86:wasm-function[364]:0x292b4\r\n>     at wasm://wasm/04ebca86:wasm-function[21822]:0x715b0d\r\n>     at invoke_viiiiii (/Users/$USER/Library/Caches/hardhat-nodejs/compilers-v2/wasm/soljson-v0.8.13+commit.abaa5c0e.js:110:40866)\r\n>     at wasm://wasm/04ebca86:wasm-function[21824]:0x716162\r\n>     at invoke_viiiiiiiii (/Users/$USER/Library/Caches/hardhat-nodejs/compilers-v2/wasm/soljson-v0.8.13+commit.abaa5c0e.js:110:44016)\r\n>     at wasm://wasm/04ebca86:wasm-function[21826]:0x719c29\r\n>     at invoke_ii (/Users/$USER/Library/Caches/hardhat-nodejs/compilers-v2/wasm/soljson-v0.8.13+commit.abaa5c0e.js:110:39662)\r\n>     at wasm://wasm/04ebca86:wasm-function[21890]:0x72b720\r\n>     at invoke_iii (/Users/$USER/Library/Caches/hardhat-nodejs/compilers-v2/wasm/soljson-v0.8.13+commit.abaa5c0e.js:110:40323)\r\n>     at wasm://wasm/04ebca86:wasm-function[21892]:0x72c146\r\n>   hardhat:sentry:subprocess starting subprocess +0ms\r\n>   hardhat:sentry:subprocess **sentry event was sent** +3ms\r\n\r\n@fvictorio Do you know what could cause an issue like this with `hardhat compile`? Seems to keep dropping off at the `solcjs:run` step\r\n\r\nBtw after reading the verbose logs in the case of a successful run I noticed the step after `solcjs:run` is `log:run-compiler-end` \r\n\r\n> hardhat:core:hre Running task compile:solidity:solcjs:run +1ms\r\n>   **hardhat:core:hre Running task compile:solidity:log:run-compiler-end +2m**\r\n>   hardhat:core:hre Running task compile:solidity:check-errors +247ms\r\n>   hardhat:core:hre Running task compile:solidity:log:compilation-errors +0ms\r\n>   hardhat:core:hre Running task compile:solidity:emit-artifacts +0ms\r\n\r\nCould the issue lie within that step?
