    "body": "@fvictorio Thanks for looking into this! I tried upgrading to `hardhat ^2.16.1 `and that didnt change the behavior. \r\nBut after struggling all day I'm close to solving it. \r\n\r\nMy repo thats having the issue has >100 contracts , I temporarily removed 30 contracts and the `yarn hardhat compile` command was able to run, it was hanging for a while maybe 10-15 seconds but eventually completed and generated the artifacts . This is the good news. \r\n\r\nHowever I still need those 30 contracts & my project will keep growing. I tried using `yarn hardhat compile --concurrency 5` , up to the limit 9 but no luck. \r\n\r\nSince I'm assuming its a memory issue causing the `compile` command to hang and drop how can I increase the amount of memory hardhats `compile` command uses? \r\n\r\nOS: macOS Ventura 13.4.1\r\nNode: node v16.19.0 (npm v8.19.3)",

    "body": "> what kind of configuration can I do to have hardhat use `solc` & ignore `solcjs`?\r\n\r\nHardhat tries to use the native solc first and, if that doesn't work, it switches to solcjs (which is much slower but always works).\r\n\r\nSince you already tried `hh clean --global` and that didn't fix it, then we should figure out why the native solc is not working for you. To do that, find the path to the compiler and run it with the `--version` flag.\r\n\r\nIn macOS, you should run something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n~/Library/Caches/hardhat-nodejs/compilers-v2/macosx-amd64/solc-macosx-amd64-v0.8.17+commit.8df45f5f --version\r\n```\r\n\r\n(give or take, go down that dir path until you find the compiler that Hardhat downloaded, which in your case seems to be version 0.8.13)\r\n\r\nWhat output do you get?\r\n\r\n> so in the case I ever need to recompile the `artifacts` for all 100+ contracts I just need to delete a few contracts , run `yarn hardhat compile`, bring back the deleted and run `yarn hardhat compile` again.\r\n\r\nThat's terrible, let's see if we can find the root cause here :disappointed:",

    "body": "Hi @fvictorio , apologies for not responding. I'm still having this issue, same as @thanhnguyen2187 . \r\nI really do suspect its a memory issue because the `compile` only works once I delete enough contracts , looks like right now it works once I get down to 266 artifacts.\r\n ```\r\nGenerating typings for: 266 artifacts in dir: ../src/generated/contract-types for target: ethers-v5\r\nSuccessfully generated 401 typings!\r\nCompiled 225 Solidity files successfully\r\n```\r\nAnything greater than 266 will not work. \r\nI'm running on a MacBook Pro M1 Max , 32 GB\r\n\r\nI really think the solution for this would be to find where in local storage Hardhat uses and to wipe that completely because I didn't always have this issue. Seems like over time the allowed memory allocation for `HH compile` became smaller and smaller and this is the cause of the issue. ",
