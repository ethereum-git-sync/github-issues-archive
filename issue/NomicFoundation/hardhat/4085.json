I tried upgrading to `hardhat ^2.16.1 `and that didnt change the behavior. \r\nBut after struggling all day I'm close to solving it. \r\n\r\nMy repo thats having the issue has >100 contracts , I temporarily removed 30 contracts and the `yarn hardhat compile` command was able to run, it was hanging for a while maybe 10-15 seconds but eventually completed and generated the artifacts . This is the good news. \r\n\r\nHowever I still need those 30 contracts & my project will keep growing. I tried using `yarn hardhat compile --concurrency 5` , up to the limit 9 but no luck. \r\n\r\nSince I'm assuming its a memory issue causing the `compile` command to hang and drop how can I increase the amount of memory hardhats `compile` command uses? \r\n\r\nOS: macOS Ventura 13.4.1\r\nNode: node v16.19.0 (npm v8.19.3)",
