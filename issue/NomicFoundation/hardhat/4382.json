  "body": "### Version of Hardhat\r\n\r\n2.17.3\r\n\r\n### What happened?\r\n\r\nWe are using Lerna in our monorepo, and we have 2 packages with contracts. A GitHub action is used to compile the packages when changes are pushed to the repo. This uses Lerna to concurrently compile the 2 packages with contracts. Both attempt to download the same compiler at the same time, and sometimes it fails. It seems a concurrency issue probably due to opening the file from 2 different threads.\r\n\r\nWe have a workaround in which we have a third dummy package with a dummy contract for the same compiler version. We first run the compilation of the dummy package, thus triggering the download of the compiler. Then when we compile the other 2 packages the compiler is already available and it works.\r\n\r\nHowever this is a nasty approach that also adds a new dependency to our repo: every time we need to add a new compiler version to a package, we need to remember to add the same version to the dummy package so it downloads the proper compiler.\r\n\r\nThis bug was related, but it was never followed up: https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/issues/1925\r\n\r\n### Minimal reproduction steps\r\n\r\nPlease find a reproduction repo with instructions here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/robercano/hardhat-concurrency-issue\r\n\r\n### Search terms\r\n\r\nconcurrent download lerna hardhat compiler",
