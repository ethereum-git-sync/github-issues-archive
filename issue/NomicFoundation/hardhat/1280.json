    "body": "@martinoss it works with the `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY`, although it is still problematic in some cases where there intermediate steps or CI build steps that don't have internet access even with the proxies. \r\n\r\nIt would be nice if you could manually provide the solidity compiler `solc` binary and set the path in the `hardhat.config.js` so there isn't the default behavior of reaching out and pulling the list of compilers (`https://binaries.soliditylang.org/linux-amd64/list.json`) and then the compiler. \r\n\r\nTo get around this, I did some reverse engineering and provided the `list.json` and `solc` manually by side loading them into a docker image. Here is a sample, but the paths and params might change based on your NodeJS based docker image:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFROM my_nodejs_image\r\n\r\nENV HTTP_PROXY=http://myproxy.mycompany.com:8080\r\nENV HTTPS_PROXY=http://myproxy.mycompany.com:8080\r\nENV NO_PROXY=\".local,mycompany.com\"\r\n\r\nWORKDIR /opt/app-root/src\r\nCOPY .npmrc /opt/app-root/src\r\nCOPY package.json /opt/app-root/src\r\nCOPY yarn.lock /opt/app-root/src\r\n\r\nRUN yarn install\r\n# Copy source code\r\nCOPY . /opt/app-root/src\r\n\r\n# Manually Copy solidity compiler\r\nCOPY list.json /opt/app-root/src/.cache/hardhat-nodejs/compilers/linux-amd64/list.json        \r\nCOPY solc-linux-amd64-v0.7.3+commit.9bfce1f6 /opt/app-root/src/.cache/hardhat-nodejs/compilers/linux-amd64/solc-linux-amd64-v0.7.3+commit.9bfce1f6                                                                                                                           \r\nCOPY solc-linux-amd64-v0.8.4+commit.c7e474f2 /opt/app-root/src/.cache/hardhat-nodejs/compilers/linux-amd64/solc-linux-amd64-v0.8.4+commit.c7e474f2                                                                                                                                  \r\nRUN npx hardhat compile --verbose\r\n\r\nCMD [\"node\", \"/opt/app-root/src/server.js\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nOf course, you have to provide the right `list.json` for the right platform and the right binary for the `solc` version your using. Same with the paths.\r\n\r\nI think on MacOS, the default path might be:\r\n\r\n    /Users/myusername/Library/Caches/hardhat-nodejs/compilers/macos-amd64/\r\n\r\nand Windows might be something like:\r\n\r\n    C:\\Users\\myusername\\AppData\\Local\\hardhat-nodejs\\Cache\\compilers\\windows-amd64\r\n\r\nYour mileage may vary.

    "body": "Hi @alcuadrado. I wouldn't call it completely offline, but isolated or restricted mostly from many internet resources and offline at points in time. \r\n\r\nFor example, let's that you had a Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery pipeline (like, Jenkins, GitHub CI or GitLab CI) on an internal platform like GitHub Enterprise or GitLab Enterprise. This is pretty normal for many businesses and can be setup a variety of ways on different projects. We now want to use those tools with a HH project to automatically build, lint, test, security audit, and deploy our Smart Contracts into dev/review environment and possibly promote them into production. To do this, each step might be broken down into smaller steps that run on docker containers and also deployed on docker containers to where-ever they may run. \r\n\r\nIn some or many instances, the deployment of docker containers that run apps assume that they have everything on everything on it to when running and may not need internet access. For example, if we had an ExpressJS app, the Dockerfile would install of the NodeJS/npm dependencies, copy the source code and build (or transpile for TypeScript) and produce a runnable image ([kind of like this example from dockerhub](https://docs.docker.com/language/nodejs/build-images/)). Internet access to NPM or an internal NPM registry was needed for the build of the docker image, but not running it. Applications with greater complexity probably have multiple build steps in place of just one Dockerfile.\r\n\r\nIf we took that ExpressJS app container image that we just made, we could then run it in something like kubernetes, AWS or on a internal server. The ExpressJS app this example has no expectation using any internet access because all of the resources were provided for it and it can just run. Locking down network access to the environment adds additional security in many cases and we know all it needs incoming network path to the port running Express. \r\n\r\nLet's add HardHat to our ExpressJS App and let's say it does something. Everything works great until we run `npx hardhat compile` or some of the other `npx hardhat *` commands because HardHat wants to reach out to internet to get `list.json` and `solc` and then everything comes crashing down. \r\n\r\nThis isn't a knock against the way HardHat does this currently. I think it is awesome that HardHat sorts things out for you by automatically getting the right solidity compilers for your system! The complexity of `solc` compilers and solidity versions is a different issue completely and it is a great feature that hardhat can make the sometimes painful process of getting SmartContracts or solidity to work correctly much easier right out of the box. The drawback is that when we have to deviate from the pattern at all it makes things a bit more difficult. \r\n\r\nFor those who might say something like \"What about Mainnet or Rinky? Don't you need internet access for that?\". Forget about Mainnet and Rinky. You can run your own geth node or you can run Quorum, or HyperLedger Fabric or the AWS blockchain or something else. Just because you are working with SmartContracts and solidity doesn't mean they have to go on the Mainnet. \r\n\r\nDoes that help a bit?\r\n\r\n",

You can find `elmariachi/node16-pnpm:v1.1` [on docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/elmariachi/node16-pnpm). This is its the whole Dockerfile:\r\n\r\n```Dockerfile\r\nFROM node:16-buster\r\n\r\nRUN mkdir -p /root/.cache/hardhat-nodejs/compilers/linux-amd64 \\ \r\n  &&  wget -O /root/.cache/hardhat-nodejs/compilers/linux-amd64/solc-linux-amd64-v0.8.7+commit.e28d00a7 https://binaries.soliditylang.org/linux-amd64/solc-linux-amd64-v0.8.7+commit.e28d00a7 \r\n\r\nRUN npm i -g pnpm\r\n```\r\n\r\nV1.1 of my image contains the 0.8.7 compiler at the path where hardhat's compiler loader is looking for it and hence doesn't need to download it and can't fail anymore \\0/ ",

    "body": "I faced similar issue. However, for me hardhat is not able to download list of compiler versions behind corporate proxy. Tried a lot of things. No luck. After a lot of trial and errors, found a way to make this work. Download `list.json` \r\nand keep it locally at `C:\\Users\\<your-user>\\AppData\\Local\\hardhat-nodejs\\Cache\\compilers\\windows-amd64` (windows). Also, download the solidity compiler executable for windows (required version) from `https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases` and place it in the same folder mentioned above. Now, peruse your `list.json` and identify the object for the solc compiler version of interest. Rename the executable as with the long name given in `path` in that object. For e.g., if you need `solc` version `0.8.0`, the `path` in `list.json` for `0.8.0` version is `solc-windows-amd64-v0.8.4+commit.c7e474f2.exe`. Use this to rename the downloaded executable. Now, run `npm test`. This should fix the issue.",
