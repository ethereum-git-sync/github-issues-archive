The best way to do this is to include a [Minimal Reproducible Example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example). If you can't do that, then include a link to your repo, and the steps to reproduce the problem. The easiest it is to reproduce your problem, the faster we are going to be able to fix it.\r\n\r\nIf you are submitting a feature request, please take the time to clearly describe your use case, and not only your proposed solution.\r\n\r\nThis issue will be automatically assigned to a Hardhat team member. This person will act as the point of contact between you and the team, but won't necessarily fix it nor address it in any way. An issue being assigned does not mean that it's being worked on.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWe use `hardhat-etherscan` programmatically *during* our deployment process to automatically verify contracts as we go. We do this because we take various steps throughout the deployment where we need additional checks to help us confirm that certain contracts have not been tampered with during deployment. We use the task `verify:verify` which recompiles contracts:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/blob/48df7d37cccc8ce72233d73f2866c159c4212b74/packages/hardhat-etherscan/src/index.ts#L233-L234\r\n\r\nThis ends up being annoying during deployment because we've already compiled the contracts once when `hardhat deploy` is triggered. I'd like to see an option `noCompile` which will skip this re-compilation step if enabled. Would be super helpful!\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n",

    "body": "Hey @smartcontracts, this seems reasonable but things are a bit more complex here.\r\n\r\nWe actually compile twice during verification:\r\n\r\n1. The first time we compile just the file that has the contract that you are trying to verify (and its dependencies, of course). We do this to try to send as few files as possible to etherscan.\r\n2. If for some reason that compilation doesn't produce the same bytecode that has been deployed, which can happen in some edge cases, or if the verification just fails, we compile the whole project and try again.\r\n\r\nThis is not a very good strategy: we could try just sending the minimum set of files _without_ re-compiling first, and etherscan would let us know if it succeeded.\r\n\r\nThe reason I'm explaining this is because, if we just ignore that line when `--no-compile` is used like #2478 does, you'll get a compilation attempt anyway, which is probably not what you want.\r\n\r\nWe could skip both that line _and_ the \"verify with the minimal set of files\" attempt when `--no-compile` is used, which would mean losing that \"feature\", but maybe that's fine. Then, in another iteration, we could improve the minimal verification thing so that it doesn't re-compile, and add that logic back even when `--no-compile` is being used.\r\n\r\nSo, tl;dr: would you be fine with `--no-compile` **not** attempting to do a minimal verification (that is, with `--no-compile` always sending all the files in your project even if that might not be necessary)?",
