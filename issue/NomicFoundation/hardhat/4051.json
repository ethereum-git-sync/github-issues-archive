  "body": "### Version of Hardhat\r\n\r\n2.15.0\r\n\r\n### What happened?\r\n\r\nDuring the process of modifying [stack-traces tests](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/tree/main/packages/hardhat-core/test/internal/hardhat-network/stack-traces) I ran into the issue with compiled artifacts caching. I was changing the [optimizer options](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/blob/81e0d15da500cfc00e9b66551d5abf066baaf235/packages/hardhat-core/test/internal/hardhat-network/stack-traces/compilation.ts#L45-L54) but the tests behaviour did not change because the tests reused preciously cached compilation artifacts (even though the compilation options were different). As a workaround I was manually deleting those artifacts before each recompilation.\r\n\r\nPossible fix might be to validate that cached compilation options match actual compilation options before returning the artifacts [here](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/blob/81e0d15da500cfc00e9b66551d5abf066baaf235/packages/hardhat-core/test/internal/hardhat-network/stack-traces/test.ts#L265).\r\n\r\n### Minimal reproduction steps\r\n\r\n- run stack-traces tests\r\n- remove `details: optimizerDetails` from `optimizer` altogether \r\n- run stack-traces tests again\r\n\r\nThe tests will pass, however without the cache the test `0_8/console-logs/error/assert` will fail when run with `viaIR` enabled.",
