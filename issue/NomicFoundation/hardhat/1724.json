  "body": "I wanted to create a project using Hardhat environment. I've tried following the https://hardhat.org/getting-started/ tutorial from their side. In there, we have a TIP to install all required packages. Unfortunately when I run `npm install --save-dev @nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle ethereum-waffle chai @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers ethers` first I can see a lot of warnings about deprecated packages and then\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm ERR! code ENOENT`\r\nnpm ERR! syscall lstat\r\nnpm ERR! path git`\r\nnpm ERR! errno -4058`\r\nnpm ERR! enoent Error while executing:\r\nnpm ERR! enoent undefined ls-remote -h -t https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-abi.git\r\nnpm ERR! enoent\r\nnpm ERR! enoent\r\nnpm ERR! enoent spawn git ENOENT\r\nnpm ERR! enoent This is related to npm not being able to find a file.\r\nnpm ERR! enoent\r\n\r\nnpm ERR!

Why so many packages are deprecated during install? Is this getting-started outdated and I should start `hardhat` project in some other way?",

Maybe you are using an old version of npm/yarn, maybe there's something wrong with your npm/yarn cache, maybe it's something else entirely, but I'm pretty sure it's not related to Hardhat itself.\r\n\r\n> Is this getting-started outdated and I should start `hardhat` project in some other way?\r\n\r\nNo, it's not outdated and it should work.\r\n\r\nClosing this since I don't think there's anything we can do on our side.
