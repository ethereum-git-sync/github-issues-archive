  "body": "### Version of Hardhat\r\n\r\n2.11.0\r\n\r\n### What happened?\r\n\r\nWith Hardhat 2.10.2, all 70 of my tests succeed. But when I upgrade Hardhat one version to 2.11.0, exactly one test fails. The line that is reverting is a call to safeTransferFrom OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 in my contract. It throws a \"SafeERC20: low-level call failed\" error which is vague but usually indicates a gas problem. I already checked every possible assumption and the contract has sufficient gas.\r\n\r\nIs there anything that could have changed from version 2.10.2 to version 2.11.0 that could have introduced this bug, or revealed a bug already existing in my contract? I need to run this bug down because it could be a problem in the contract that is being revealed by some change in that hardhat version. (Versions after 2.11.0 also have the same error).\r\n\r\n### Minimal reproduction steps\r\n\r\n1. Install Hardhat v2.11.0.\r\n2. With solidity version 0.8.2, in a contract, run SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(IERC20(tokenContract), _msgSender(), address(this), amountOfTokens) (with appropriate allowance set beforehand and gas and tokens in wallets as appropriate for transfering).\r\n3. Call fails with \"SafeERC20: low-level call failed\".\r\n4. Repeating steps with v2.10.2, the same line succeeds.\r\n\r\n### Search terms\r\n\r\nHardhat SafeERC20 OpenZeppelin",
