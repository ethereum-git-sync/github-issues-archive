  "body": "## Description\r\nAs explained on [Discord](https://imgur.com/a/QmjhBLp), the [2.1.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nomiclabs/buidler-waffle/v/2.1.0) release for `@nomiclabs/buidler-waffle` broke the `loadFixture` function.\r\n\r\nThe root of the issue is in the [fixtures.ts](https://github.com/nomiclabs/buidler/blob/buidler-waffle-v2.1.0/packages/buidler-waffle/src/fixtures.ts#L43) file. If `overrideSigners` is not manually overridden by end-users, the default `loadFixture` function has this argument to 'undefined', as per its definition in [index.ts](https://github.com/nomiclabs/buidler/blob/buidler-waffle-v2.1.0/packages/buidler-waffle/src/index.ts#L32):\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nloadFixture: buidlerCreateFixtureLoader(buidlerWaffleProvider)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, there is no second or third argument, so `overrideSigners` ends up being assigned to 'undefined'.\r\n\r\n## Current Workaround\r\nFortunately, it is possible to band-aid this bug by creating a custom fixture loader, as per the [Waffle docs](https://ethereum-waffle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fixtures.html). Here's how I did it:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport { Fixture } from \"ethereum-waffle\";\r\nimport { Signer } from \"@ethersproject/abstract-signer\";\r\nimport { waffle } from \"@nomiclabs/buidler\";\r\n\r\nconst { createFixtureLoader } = waffle;\r\n\r\nexport function loadFixture(signers: Signer[]): <T>(fixture: Fixture<T>) => Promise<T> {\r\n  return createFixtureLoader(Object.values(signers));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Possible Solution\r\nThe definition of `loadFixture` should be changed to something like this:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nloadFixture: buidlerCreateFixtureLoader(buidlerWaffleProvider, await bre.ethers.getSigners()),\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would have made a PR, but:\r\n\r\n+ I'm not sure how to call `bre.ethers` from within that context\r\n+ The function type passed on to `extendEnvironment` is non-async so `await` functions cannot be executed",

This means that end-users must cast the `Signer` array as a `Wallet]` array, which works in most cases, but it goes against what Richard Moore (creator of ethers.js) [recommends](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/issues/263#issuecomment-639996802) doing:\r\n\r\n> Waffle should certainly not be using Wallet as their low-level Signer as Wallet is a fairly high-level Signer. The Signer sub-class should be what they use, since a Wallet requires a private key, which many situations do not have access to.\r\n\r\nPossibly related: https://github.com/EthWorks/Waffle/pull/355",
