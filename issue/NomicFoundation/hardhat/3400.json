  "body": "Hi, I would like to propose a \"Complete\"  button at the end of each page in [Tutorial](https://hardhat.org/tutorial) which marks the current as step as complete and moves to the next page and store these details in local storage so that they stay even after reloading the page. \r\n\r\nAnother modification can be made by changing the colors or adding something in the contents to show pending and completed tasks.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59679281/205758393-731a230c-cbf4-43ef-9d5e-e187f96243c0.png)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\nThank you for using Hardhat and taking the time to open an issue!\r\n\r\n**Note that this issue tracker is not a support channel.**\r\n\r\n- For help with Hardhat and Hardhat network, please use our [Discord server](https://hardhat.org/discord).\r\n- For help with ethers.js, please go to [its Github Discussions](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/discussions).\r\n\r\nIf you are reporting a bug, please include reproduction steps. The best way to do this is to include a [Minimal Reproducible Example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example). If you can't do that, then include a link to your repo, and the steps to reproduce the problem. The easiest it is to reproduce your problem, the faster we are going to be able to fix it.\r\n\r\nIf you are submitting a feature request, please take the time to clearly describe your use case, and not only your proposed solution.\r\n\r\nThis issue will be automatically assigned to a Hardhat team member. This person will act as the point of contact between you and the team, but won't necessarily fix it nor address it in any way. An issue being assigned does not mean that it's being worked on.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n",
