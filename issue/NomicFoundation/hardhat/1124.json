  "body": "When running tests with hardhat, it keeps slowing down the test execution and after some time the connection is lost from the HRE and we get the below error:\r\n\r\n```Error: Returned error: request to http://localhost:8545/ failed, reason: connect ECONNRESET 127.0.0.1:8545```\r\n\r\nJust before it shows the timeout error, we observed approx 6000+ calls to `eth_getBlockByNumber` on HRE console. This connection error issue is intermittent. Usually, it gets triggered during execution of `BErc20.spec.ts` test file.\r\n\r\nFollowing are the commands to reproduce this issue:\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/backstop-protocol/BCompound.git\r\ncd BCompound\r\ngit checkout hardhat-issue\r\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\r\nnpm i\r\nnpx hardhat compile\r\nnpx hardhat typechain\r\nnpx hardhat node (1st window)\r\nnpx hardhat test (2nd window)\r\n```",
