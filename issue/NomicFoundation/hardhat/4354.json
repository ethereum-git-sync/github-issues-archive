    "body": "@DefiCake I don't think it's actually failing. I ran your `scripts/connect.ts` script and I got the \"FAILED\" result, but that's just because the returned number is `0` and `0 || \"FAILED\"` evals to `\"FAILED\"`.\r\n\r\nI didn't try it with pm2 though. I just started a node with `npx hardhat node` and then ran both `curl` and that script. The curl call worked fine, and the script execution returned that because 0 is falsy.\r\n\r\nTentatively closing, will re-open if I'm missing something here.",
