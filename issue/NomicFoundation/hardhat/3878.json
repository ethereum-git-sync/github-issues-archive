  "body": "Hi, I'm trying to use hardhat in my nextjs application. I need to deploy contracts from my TS code during runtime (when user goes to `/api/contract/create` page). \r\n\r\nI'm trying to do it with HRE, but I receive HH5: HardhatContext is not created. Is there any way to create this context manually? \r\n\r\nIn other words, I don't want to use scripts/tasks (moreover, I can not do it on my Vercel servless hosting), I want to run code by myself.",
