  "body": "TL;DR : Lock example contract's amount is probably higher than the eth you have in your wallet resulting in a confusing error when first trying to deploy. \r\n\r\n- You are starting a new project and want to setup hardhat quickly with your testnet URL and private key as environment variables.\r\n- You try to the deploy the Lock contrat to see if everything is working\r\n- You get an error message \"INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS\" from the \"estimateGas\" method.\r\n- You think \"I don't have enough eth to pay for gas, I should get more. \r\n- After 15 minutes and a quick run to [this post](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/98395/insufficient-funds-for-intrinsic-transaction-cost) you realize it is not about the gas price, it's about trying to lock in a greater amount of eth than you got in your wallet. \r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Thanks @DavSab, that makes sense. Do you think changing it to 0.1 ETH would be better? If so, the only changes needed are to update this line:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/blob/ed86a550ab606e4214fca1109ff944ada78c6bc6/packages/hardhat-core/sample-projects/javascript/scripts/deploy.js#L14\r\n\r\nAnd this one:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/blob/ed86a550ab606e4214fca1109ff944ada78c6bc6/packages/hardhat-core/sample-projects/javascript/scripts/deploy.js#L22\r\n\r\nAnd the same lines in the [typescript script example](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/blob/ed86a550ab606e4214fca1109ff944ada78c6bc6/packages/hardhat-core/sample-projects/typescript/scripts/deploy.ts).\r\n\r\nFeel free to send a PR with these changes if you want and have the time.",
