  "body": "### Version of Hardhat\n\n2.14.0\n\n### What happened?\n\nHello, so it seems that vyper compile always compile files even when there is no changes. I think that is because we compare vyper pragma version from contract and vyper cache version, which are not same. Check this part of code and that method:\r\nhttps://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/blob/main/packages/hardhat-vyper/src/index.ts#L259\r\n\r\nDo you maybe have some task where you gonna fix that part?\n\n### Minimal reproduction steps\n\nCompile vyper contracts several times.\n\n### Search terms\n\nvyper, cache",
