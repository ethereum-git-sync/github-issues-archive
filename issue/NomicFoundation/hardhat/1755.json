  "body": "\r\nCurrently the hardhat cli creates a js sample project if we choose to create one from cli. If we need to make use of typescript, then we have to follow a set of manual steps to set it up as described [here](https://hardhat.org/guides/typescript.html). I was wondering whether we could have a feature introduced to have a typescript project created from cli itself by giving it as a choice in the cli while creating the sample project.\r\n \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15767732/128110189-6910b044-996f-4edf-ac23-ffa6ff5c1452.png)\r\n\r\nAdd an option here like : Do you need typescript?\r\n\r\nI can do a PR for this if needed.",
