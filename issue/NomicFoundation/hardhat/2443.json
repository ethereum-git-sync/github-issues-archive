I guess that we could accomplish this with snapshots if they worked in a different way than they do now.\r\n\r\n1. The chain is at block 1000. You take a snapshot `A`.\r\n2. You mine 2 blocks and take another snapshot `B`.\r\n3. You revert to the snapshot `A`. The latest block is again 1000.\r\n4. You mine 4 blocks (and the first two are different than the ones you mined in step 2).\r\n5. You take a snapshot `C`.\r\n\r\nNow you can go to snapshot `B` and then move to `C` to simulate a reorg.\r\n\r\nThis can't be done with our current implementation of snapshots because when you revert to `A` in step 3, the snapshot `B` is discarded.\r\n\r\nAlso, this is very convoluted. But it could be a building block on top of which something more ergonomic could be built (for example: a method that takes a block number and a group of transactions, and simulates a reorg by going back to that block number and mining all those transactions).",

I don't think the same will happen when using snapshots.\r\n\r\nfor example, chain is at 1000, mine a TX which emits an event A - trigger a reorg the same event A is sent with a flag A-removed, usually right after that if the same TX is included in the new block the same event might be repeated without the remove flag to mark it that regardless of the re-org it is still included in the new block. Ideally to make the tests extensive both cases should be doable - reorg where the TX is included in the new block and a re-org where the TX same TX is not included in the new block.",
