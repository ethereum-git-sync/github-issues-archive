We should investigate how to rely on that, since it's version-dependent.\r\n- We need to review how we are using viaIR in our tests (see also https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/issues/4050)\r\n- We should have a better explanation about all of this in our tests. [This discussion](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/discussions/4099) is interesting in that respect.",
