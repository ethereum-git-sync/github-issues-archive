  "body": "Currently hardhat offer a function `hre.artifacts.readArtifact`  (as well as other method in `hre.artifacts`)\r\nUnfortunately such `artifacts` field is hardwired at runtime creation with a specific folder and as a read-only field it is not supposed to be modified.\r\n\r\n`hardhat-deploy` (and even `builder-deploy` before) offer a mechanism for external import of artifacts, it support different format like truffle too. It does so with its own custom function so user can deploy these artifacts.\r\n\r\nBut since hardhat, as mentioned do not allow plugin to override the canonical way to get artifacts, other plugin that offer new features to artifacts are not aware of hardhat-deploy artifacts, even if they are compatible.\r\n\r\nThere are different approches to solve this. One approach is to allow plugin to hook into the `getArtifact` process so plugins can import artifact from other sources, even transforming it to fit hardhat expected format.\r\n\r\nThis way any plugin that add features to artifacts can access them via a standard mechanism\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Hi, I think this should be higher priority. The hardhat ecosystem is missing something to manage deployments, and something like `hardhat-deploy` is desperately needed. However it's currently a non-starter because _without this issue fixed_ hardhat-deploy is not compatible with other hardhat plugins like `hardhat-ether` and `hardhat-waffle`. Users and the `hardhat-deploy` maintainer @wighawag have to resort to dirty hacks to try and get it working, and it randomly breaks depending on different package managers, package versions and the phase of the moon.\r\n\r\nPlease consider prioritizing this higher, or at least taking an hour or two to sketch out \"the right way\" to do it in order for someone else to come in and help out.",
