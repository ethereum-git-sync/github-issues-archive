  "body": "Getting accounts is currently async. No problem with that at first sight unless you go deeper in mocha tests. If you need for some reasons to loop over your accounts in order to produce some tests it won't work properly:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n let accounts;\r\n  \r\n describe(\"test1\", () => {\r\n      before(async () => {\r\n            accounts = await ethers.getSigners();\r\n      })\r\n      \r\n      for (const recipient of [accounts[0], accounts[5]]) {\r\n            context(recipient === owner ? 'for self' : 'for another account', async () => {\r\n            for (let x = 0; x < 2; x++) {\r\n                 describe(`base token (${x ? 'ETH' : 'ERC20'})`, () => {\r\n                      it(\"blabla\", async() => { ... })\r\n                      it(\"blabla\", async() => { ... })\r\n                      it(\"blabla\", async() => { ... })\r\n                 }\r\n            }\r\n      }\r\n }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWill produce an error: `TypeError: Cannot read property '0' of undefined` and it is normal because as Mocha is passing through all describe (which is not async) to fetch each `it` tests, accounts is not yet initialized. For the notice, `before` and `beforeEach` hooks execute themselves after fetching all tests.\r\n\r\nAs of a solution, I'm proposing adding to hardhat a global variable, containing 10 default accounts like OpenZeppelin is doing in their [test-environement](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-test-environment/blob/master/src/accounts.ts) repo. Allowing the use of pre-defined accounts in a sync manner.",

    "body": "Because then what's the behaviour when you connect to Rinkeby for example? If you have a mnemonic/list of private keys for that network, then (assuming there are sync accounts available), the correct thing would be to expose those.\r\n\r\nWhen you connect to hardhat, you already have a mnemonic that gives you 20 accounts ready to use. So a consistent way of doing this is to just expose the accounts in the config. This is a problem for the `localhost` network connected to a local hardhat node (because in that case it relies on the remote accounts, and you can't get those in an async way), but in that case you either use the async ones, or you explicitly configure the `localhost` network so that it uses the same mnemonic than the `hardhat` network.\r\n\r\nI'm not that familiar with OZ, but I guess they can do that because they only run in an in-memory network, so testnets/other configured networks are not a problem, but they are in hardhat.",
