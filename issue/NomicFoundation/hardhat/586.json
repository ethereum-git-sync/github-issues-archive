  "body": "[Berry](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry) is yarn's v2 release and is disruptive in many regards. They replaced \"node_modules\" with a new [plug-n-play](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/pnp/) system that caches dependencies more efficiently.\r\n\r\nIn the docs for [Typescript support](https://buidler.dev/guides/typescript.html#plugin-type-extensions), you specify that we should add this to our `tsconfig.json` config:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"files\": [\r\n  \"./buidler.config.ts\",\r\n  \"./node_modules/@nomiclabs/buidler-ethers/src/type-extensions.d.ts\",\r\n  \"./node_modules/@nomiclabs/buidler-waffle/src/type-extensions.d.ts\"\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this is sadly not possible in yarn v2. I suppose that this is not a priority, but I wanted to open an issue about it anyways, in case more people stumble upon it and want to signal their support.",

    "body": "Thanks for opening this issue, @PaulRBerg!\r\n\r\nAs you mentioned, yarn 2 is very disruptive, and controversial. It's unclear if/when it will be successful enough to justify adapting Buidler. I think it may never be released as `yarn@latest`. Now that npm is owned by GitHub, and yarn is no longer maintained by Facebook, its future is even more unclear imo.\r\n\r\nI've been following pnp for some time and had already identified a [module of Buidler](https://github.com/nomiclabs/buidler/blob/development/packages/buidler-core/src/internal/core/execution-mode.ts#L10) that needs to be adapted. I haven't thought about the type extensions though. Have you found any other thing that needs to be changed?\r\n\r\nIf someone else does feel that Yarn v2 should be supported, please let us know in this issue.",

Not impossible, but hard.\r\n\r\nAs v2 is concerned, it looks super promising.

The \"buidler.config.ts\" file is not recognised when yarn v2 finds and executes buidler from pnp\r\n2.
