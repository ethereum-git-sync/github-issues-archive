    "body": "The node seems to be returning a transaction object where `accessList` is null (for a legacy transaction). As far as I can tell, this is [not spec compliant](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-apis/api-documentation/). Legacy transactions shouldn't include the `accessList` property.\r\n\r\nI'm going to keep the issue open for now, but it's not very likely that we'll adapt our code to this response. Instead, I suggest reaching to the team developing the client (I have no idea who that would be for Astar) and ask them to follow the spec. There's also a slight chance that this is a problem with Alchemy's backend, but it would be weird if it worked fine with Ethereum but not with other networks.",
