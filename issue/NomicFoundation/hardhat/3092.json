If the custom error doesn't exist, we should probably await and discard the promise. Or even better: we should still analyze the error (if it reverts) and show a better error message, something like \"The given contract doesn't have a custom error named 'NonExistent'. The transaction did not revert\" or \"The given contract doesn't have a custom error named 'NonExistent'. The transaction reverted with custom error 'Existent'\"",
