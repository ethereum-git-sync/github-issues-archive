The best way to do this is to include a [Minimal Reproducible Example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example). If you can't do that, then include a link to your repo, and the steps to reproduce the problem. The easiest it is to reproduce your problem, the faster we are going to be able to fix it.\r\n\r\nIf you are submitting a feature request, please take the time to clearly describe your use case, and not only your proposed solution.\r\n\r\nThis issue will be automatically assigned to a Hardhat team member. This person will act as the point of contact between you and the team, but won't necessarily fix it nor address it in any way. An issue being assigned does not mean that it's being worked on.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI have had no problem verifying contracts in the past and have my config set up properly and even have manually pasted multiple valid API keys (at different times) as the inputs the the apiKey: variable in the config, but I continually get the invalid API key error. I have tried multiple versions (2.0.0) and the latest 3.0 version and still have this error. I have exhausted all possible debugging steps and need to report this issue because my environment and verification setup is correct but this error keeps happening. Thank you\r\n",
