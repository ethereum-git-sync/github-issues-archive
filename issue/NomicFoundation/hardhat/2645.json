  "body": "I would like to be able to directly test private and internal methods of contracts using the hardhat test runner.\r\n\r\nOne possible way to implement this could be to convert `internal` and `private` methods in the contracts to `public`, internally, only when running `npx hardhat test`, so that unit tests can be written for functions that can't be accessed otherwise.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't seem to be a way around this other than always using `internal` rather than `private` and also writing a mock contract that inherits the `internal` and makes it public. Hardhat should be able to do something like that for the developer and inject it in the `ethers` contract object during unit tests.",

I'm aware the implementation for this would be hacky.\r\nMaybe instead of converting the functions, a preprocessor could copy them into new `public payable` functions prefixed with the contract name and function visibility. For example:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\r\ncontract Contract {\r\n    uint256 public value;\r\n    constructor() {\r\n        value = squareOf(2);\r\n    }\r\n    function squareOf(uint256 input) private returns (uint256) {\r\n        return input**2;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nbecomes:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\r\ncontract Contract {\r\n    uint256 public value;\r\n    constructor() {\r\n        value = squareOf(2);\r\n    }\r\n    function squareOf(uint256 input) private returns (uint256) {\r\n        return input**2;\r\n    }\r\n    function Contract__private__squareOf(uint256 input) public payable returns (uint256) {\r\n        return input**2;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n",
