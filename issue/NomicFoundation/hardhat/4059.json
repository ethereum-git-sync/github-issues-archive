I'm not sure if this would be a bug fix or a breaking change though.\r\n\r\nA less risky alternative is to do that only when `providerExtenders.length > 0`, similar to what we do here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/blob/8587456b744bc2f7a0e1ce1baff5b14db6a859a6/packages/hardhat-core/src/internal/core/providers/construction.ts#L246",
