The best way to do this is to include a [Minimal Reproducible Example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example). If you can't do that, then include a link to your repo, and the steps to reproduce the problem. The easiest it is to reproduce your problem, the faster we are going to be able to fix it.\r\n\r\nIf you are submitting a feature request, please take the time to clearly describe your use case, and not only your proposed solution.\r\n\r\nThis issue will be automatically assigned to a Hardhat team member. This person will act as the point of contact between you and the team, but won't necessarily fix it nor address it in any way. An issue being assigned does not mean that it's being worked on.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI notice it's possible to run:\r\n`getContractFactory(contractName).attach(address)` for addresses of contracts with different ABIs. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it should be fairly easy to issue a warning if \r\n\r\n1. The ABI results in selectors which the address does not contain\r\n2. The address contains selectors which cannot be generated from the ABI\r\n\r\nI think this could save confusion when accidentally using the wrong ABI",
