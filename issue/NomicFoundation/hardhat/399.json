  "body": "Buidler shouldn't recompile the contracts if they didn't change, but it sometimes does. This happens if there's a file in the `artifact` folder that is older than any contract.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this is that we are just comparing the contract sources against the oldest file in that folder, and recompile if it's older than the contracts. If recompiling doesn't modify it, it will always be older.\r\n\r\nThe most common way to get into this situation is by renaming or deleting a contract, as new compilations will generate other/fewer artifacts, without updating one of them.\r\n\r\nAs a workaround, you can run `npx buidler clean`, which will delete the `artifact` contract.",
