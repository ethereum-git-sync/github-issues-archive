    "body": "This is not super easy to do due to https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/issues/3074.\r\n\r\nThe best thing that comes to mind is this. First, in your `hardhat.config.js`, configure the chain id with something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnetworks: {\r\n  hardhat: {\r\n    chainId: process.env.CHAIN_ID ? Number(process.env.CHAIN_ID) : 31337\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen you can have a different test script that is something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"test:different-chain-id\": \"CHAIN_ID=31338 hardhat test test/some-test-that-uses-chain-id.js\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm using 31337 and 31338 as examples here. Also, I'm passing a single file to the test because I guess most tests won't be affected by a different chain id.\r\n\r\nA problem with this though is that it would mean two different runs, so your coverage report will still not cover that branch.\r\n\r\nI know it's a shitty solution, I hope we can get #3074 fixed somewhat soon, but it depends on a huge refactor right now.",
