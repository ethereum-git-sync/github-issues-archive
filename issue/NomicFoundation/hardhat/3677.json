  "body": "### Version of Hardhat\r\n\r\n2.12.5\r\n\r\n### What happened?\r\n\r\nAdvancing multiple blocks using `hardhat_mine` (via Hardhat Network Helpers) instead of iterated `evm_mine` resulted in a huge performance degradation for our test suite. \r\n\r\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/481465/219202518-82fa1211-2bea-4799-b37c-b6c7b31c1d90.png)\r\n\r\nRight before 20% are the tests that are using these methods. `hardhat_mine` clearly resulted in worse performance overall, and the execution time looks quadratic to me.\r\n\r\n### Minimal reproduction steps\r\n\r\nSorry no minimal steps as I wasn't able to reproduce in a small test suite with a large effect (may be due to `n` too small). You can see a test run that took 55m (same that was plotted above) versus the expected 20m [here](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/actions/runs/4185133628/jobs/7251751697).\r\n\r\n### Search terms\r\n\r\nhardhat_mine",
