    "body": "Hey @lukehutch, sorry for not responding before.\r\n\r\nI assume you are using ethers, correct? In that case, the stack trace won't have the javascript frame because there are some incompatibilities between how we do this and how ethers handle errors. It's something we want to improve, but (as far as I remember) it's not doable with the current version of ethers.\r\n\r\nI'll keep this open anyway because I'm not sure we have an issue tracking that problem.",
