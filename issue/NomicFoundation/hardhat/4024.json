  "body": "### Version of Hardhat\r\n\r\n2.14.0, 2.15.0\r\n\r\n### What happened?\r\n\r\nafter deploying a contract with hardhat I started the verify task.\r\nIt fails with the error \r\n```\r\nno license speccified in the source code for Vault (contracts/core/Vault.sol:Vault), Please use option --license <SPDX>\r\n```\r\nI was able to verify the contract with `npx cross-env NETWORK=\"sepolia\" hardhat --network sepolia etherscan-verify --license MIT --solc-input` but this is no permanent solution\r\nIf you look up the contract on sepolia testnet https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x49604f3222A8c533700A9670efB9Cc00BC634FFf#code\r\nyou can clearly see that the licence is indeed defined on line one of the contract despite what the verify task is claiming.\r\n\r\nThis has to be some strange condition. the deploy task deploys a bunch of contracts (>20) and this is the only one giving this error.\r\n\r\nIn addition other contracts got verified correctly but output states `already verified: USDG (0xAC9ba14917e4fe86D2238E4370D3779A097ffB26), skipping.`\r\nWhich can not be true on the first run of verification.\r\nThis happens if I change Vault.sol a bit and restart the deploy script and try to verify afterwards.\r\nSince Vault.sol address is a constructor parameter of USDG.sol it got deployed too but it seems that somehow it got verfied without me doing it explicitly. However etherscan state that the contract is indeed verified. I confirmed that as soon as the contract is deployed it is verified. So this might not be a hardhat thing but some etherscan magic.\r\n\r\n### Minimal reproduction steps\r\n\r\nDeploy the contract with \"// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\" in the fist line of code\r\nTry to verify the contract\r\n\r\n### Search terms\r\n\r\nverify SPDX-License-Identifier contract publish",
