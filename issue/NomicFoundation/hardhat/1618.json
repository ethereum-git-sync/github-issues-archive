We want to, at some point, add the capability of using \"external\" information (e.g., from etherscan), but it's not something we are working on right now\r\n\r\nThe easy fix is to add that contract to your project, for example using [hardhat-dependency-compiler](https://hardhat.org/plugins/hardhat-dependency-compiler.html)",

    "body": "I've just bumped into a case where this happens even when the custom errors is defined locally in my project.\r\n\r\nI have a custom error defined in contract B, which contract A interacts with via DELEGATECALL. When contract B reverts with that custom error, I am getting this error in the console when running my test:\r\n\r\n> AssertionError: Expected transaction to be reverted with TargetError, but other exception was thrown: Error: VM Exception while processing transaction: reverted with an unrecognized custom error\r\n\r\nThe `TargetError` is the custom error I defined in contract B. Hardhat is not picking it up because contract A is delegate calling, then is checking if the call succeeded or not and bubbles up the revert:\r\n\r\n```sol\r\n// Delegate call to the target contract.\r\n(bool success, bytes memory returndata) = target.delegatecall{ gas: stipend }(data);\r\nif (success) {\r\n    return returndata;\r\n} else {\r\n    if (returndata.length > 0) {\r\n        assembly {\r\n            let returndata_size := mload(returndata)\r\n            revert(add(32, returndata), returndata_size)\r\n        }\r\n    } else {\r\n        revert();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTherefore I think that adding support for \"external\" custom errors is more important that we initially thought.

If that succeeds, we assume that the match is real and show an error message with the decoded data (similar to what we do in the error inferrer). If not, we don't do anything and the fallback logic continues.\r\n- We didn't make a decision about the error message, but I think it should be at least a bit different to the one shown by the error inferrer, so that we can tell them apart if someone reports an issue around this.",
