After trace source code from hardhat-ganache and issues, I found this might be related: #952 and the fix commit: https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat/commit/71f268477bcd68afcf347d2700d2bf9253bbea3d#diff-f061864276d864bd266a85a7e2c9d97152e26740d2c770bffee605895d87c956\r\n\r\nI tried 2.0.0-rc.1, it didn't work. Anyway, I didn't see bump version commit after that commit, is this possible to release a new version of @nomiclabs/hardhat-ganache?",
