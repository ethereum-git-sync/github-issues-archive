  "body": "Hardhat `flatten` doesn't support circular dependencies. Some users want this functionality, yet it's not straightforward nor clear that it would work for them. Continue reading to understand why.\r\n\r\nHardhat flatten works by creating a topological order of the dependency graph. That is a sequence of files where every file comes after its dependencies. Then it concatenates the files in that order. This ensures that every symbol (e.g. a library, contract, function, etc) is defined before usage. Now, graphs with circular dependencies don't have a topological order, so this algorithm doesn't work.\r\n\r\nAn alternative is to analyze all the files and create a topological order of top-level definitions (e.g. contract definitions, libraries, etc). This should be possible because Solidity doesn't compile projects if you have cycles in those. The problem is that this is really complex. You need to parse and perform some semantic analyses on top of the sources (use-def analysis), and it should be really precise or it will fail. On top of that, we can't guarantee that the output generated by solidity will be equivalent to the non-flattened task, and this would make it not a good fit for contract verification.\r\n\r\n**As a general recommendation: avoid circular dependencies.** They are harder to reason about, harder to create tooling for, and normally forbidden by many compilers/runtimes. There are multiple refactors that can be applied mechanically to eliminate them.",
