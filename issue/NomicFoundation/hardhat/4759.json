  "body": "Our e2e tests have a several issues:\r\n\r\n- The shebangs are wrong\r\n- The temporary tests should be created outside the repository (for example, using `mktemp -d`, although I think `/tmp` is valid in the three runners used by the CI)\r\n- `npx` is always used, but it should only be used for `npm`. `yarn` and `pnpm` should use their own versions (which is just the same command; that is: `npx hardhat`, `yarn hardhat` and `pnpm hardhat`)\r\n- After fixing the shebangs, `bash` will be always used. This means that `echo` might not interpret `\\n` (it doesn't do it in the CI nor on my machine), so we should use `printf` instead.\r\n- We should add an assertion that no spurious, empty files are created in the root of the project. This function should work I think:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nno_empty_files() {\r\n  for file in $(find . -maxdepth 1 -type f); do\r\n    if [ ! -s $file ]; then\r\n      echo \"File $file is empty\"\r\n      exit 1\r\n    fi\r\n  done\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I fixed some of these things (not sure which one), the CI started failing for windows+pnpm, so we should look into that.",
