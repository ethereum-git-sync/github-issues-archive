The test just sends two transactions at the same time, and asserts that they were mined in the same block.\r\n\r\nSome comments:\r\n\r\n1. Tests do pass if you start a `hh node` and then run `hh test --network localhost`\r\n2. I created a similar example but using ethers instead, and the problem didn't happen.\r\n3. Our fork of `truffle-contract` is very old, so before investigating this we should update it (or stop using the fork if we can).",
