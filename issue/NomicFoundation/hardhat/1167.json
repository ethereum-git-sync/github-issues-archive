  "body": "Compilers produce warnings about the lack of licenses, so it's simplest to make sure that each file has a proper license at the top. However, when using hardhat flatten to produce a single contract that can be used on Remix, all of the licenses are left in tact in the new file. Although this seems to make the most sense, it produces an error when compiling within Remix, so it would probably be a better behavior if hardhat flatten consolidated the license lines into a single line to avoid the error.",
