  "body": "Thanks for the awesome tool!\r\n\r\n## Simple reproduction of issue:\r\n\r\n1. add a `revert()` or similar to somewhere in some hardhat contracts you have at hand. (check it shows the stack trace correctly)\r\n2. Add this anywhere in any of your contract files (doesn't need to be the one that you added the revert to):\r\n```solidity\r\nenum EnumThatBreaksThings {Option1, Option2}\r\nmapping(EnumThatBreaksThings => uint256) public thing;\r\n```\r\n3. Run the tests again, you won't get proper stack traces. Something like this will be shown instead:\r\n```\r\nat <UnrecognizedContract>.<unknown> (0xdc64a140aa3e981100a9beca4e685f962f0cf6c9)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Other info:\r\n\r\nI have run the code with the `--verbose` flag and this was the output.\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe Hardhat Network tracing engine could not be initialized.
