  "body": "(This issue was discovered and diagnosed by @wighawag in [solidity-coverage 573][1])\r\n\r\nIn the compile task, the location of sources is read from the config object. For example here:\r\nhttps://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat/blob/6ffb8baf0ede8c8c73b502bba826b0f8196604b2/packages/hardhat-core/src/builtin-tasks/compile.ts#L112\r\n\r\nThis allows a task to modify solidity files, store them in a temporary location, and direct the compiler to use them as inputs by changing the value of `config.paths.sources`.\r\n\r\nHowever `paths.artifacts` does not seem configurable in the same way because it's set like this:  \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat/blob/6ffb8baf0ede8c8c73b502bba826b0f8196604b2/packages/hardhat-core/src/internal/core/runtime-environment.ts#L77\r\n\r\nThis means a task can't write comp. artifacts to a temporary location and direct subsequent tasks to read from there.\r\n\r\nsolidity-coverage tries to set the sources, artifacts and cache paths, hoping these will be dynamically read.\r\n \r\n[1]: https://github.com/sc-forks/solidity-coverage/issues/573",

This has occurred to me as well - perhaps there's a way to virtualize the artifacts and have an 'in-memory' mode. And some `save` methods. \r\n\r\nI would actually prefer to stop modifying contracts or saving artifacts at all. Ideally the way forward for coverage is to rely on the EVM tracing engine here for source location data, rather than injecting traceable statements into people's Solidity code. \r\n\r\nIf #1035 can be resolved and it becomes clear that the stack trace can follow the execution path everywhere, I think it would make most sense on my end to migrate coverage in that direction. It's a much simpler, faster design.\r\n\r\nHowever, maybe there are other applications which would benefit from virtualized artifacts, not sure.    \r\n",
