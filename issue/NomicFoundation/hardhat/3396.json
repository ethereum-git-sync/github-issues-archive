The best way to do this is to include a [Minimal Reproducible Example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example).

An issue being assigned does not mean that it's being worked on.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI am attempting to determine whether or not a transaction is occurring within a known interval from current blocktime.  I understand that block.timestamp is not precise, but it should be accurate to at least the interval between blocks written to the chain (about 8 minutes +/- perhaps).  I am only looking to compare actual time to blocktime within a range of about 1 hour, so that shouldn't be a problem.    But block.timestamp reported on a local node running in my terminal reports block.timestamp as much as 40 hours different than UTC. I am not sure how the node calculates the block.timestamp when the node is running for a locally for a long time, but very few transactions are processed,  but it would be good if  the hardhat node was reporting time similar to what a live blockchain would report, so I can test smart contract functions which check time based on a range around the reported block.timestamp.  (i.e. closer to the real world experience.)\r\n",

That is, if you have a contract like this:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract Foo {\r\n  function getTimestamp() public view returns (uint) {\r\n    return block.timestamp;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand you deploy that contract and call `getTimestamp`, you'll always get the same value if no new blocks are mined. This is because `block.timestamp`, when read from an `eth_call` request, will return the timestamp of the last mined block.\r\n\r\nIf this is what's happening to you, then[ interval mining](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network/docs/reference#mining-modes) is one possible solution. This will periodically mine a new block, and so the timestamp will be more or less updated.\r\n\r\nIf that's not what's happening to you, that is if you are mining new blocks but the timestamp of the latest blocks is gradually (or suddenly) getting out of sync, then I will need proper reproduction steps.",
