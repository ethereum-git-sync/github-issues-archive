  "body": "### Describe the feature\r\n\r\nI think It can allow a string array like a tsconfig's path.\r\n\r\nCurrently, we are using multiple paths for some reason. Like this [repository](https://github.com/l-Zetta-l/lightweight-diamond-example). In this case, I used a folder named 'modules', and the contracts in this folder are also contract files, but it is made for referencing to use from the 'contracts' folder's contracts. It's kind of a like customized template or module source. So when deploying, I won't deploy the contracts that are in this 'modules' folder. In this folder, contracts have a very low relationship with our service directly.\r\n\r\nAnd only the contracts that have a direct relationship with our service are in the contracts folder, which contracts need maintenance or management.\r\n\r\nWe would like to request modifications so that the environment can be configured to have a richer folder structure and contract file management tailored to each service.\r\n\r\n### Search terms\r\n\r\n#config #userconfig #paths #sources #contracts #folder #directory",
