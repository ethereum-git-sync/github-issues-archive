I did find it shocking initially that Ethereum projects have such poor documentation in general.  Not to say Hardhat isn't doing a credible job, but standards overall in the ecosystem are pretty low if you are used to other ecosystems.\r\n\r\nConsider, for example, this: https://numpy.org/doc/stable/. That's a pretty high standard though ;).\r\n\r\nThis is the price we pay for working on something cutting-edge.  Realistically people can benefit a lot more from working on their own project than updating open-source documentation. I think Hardhat is doing a great job, considering all the disincentives to work on such things.",
