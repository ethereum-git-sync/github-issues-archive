Moreover if I try to send the whole balance twice it works.\r\n\r\n**expected behavior:**\r\nThe balance of the sender should be 0 after sending the total balance. The transfer should revert when trying to transfer twice the whole balance of an account.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce \r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/zgorizzo69/hardhat\r\n$ cd hardhat && vi .secret.alchemy\r\n// Enter your alchemy project ID\r\n$ yarn && yarn test\r\n```",
