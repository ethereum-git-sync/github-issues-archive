  "body": "I followed the tutorial and hit a problem at part 5 when testing the contract. \r\nWhen running this line `expect(await hardhatToken.totalSupply()).to.equal(ownerBalance);` the test fails. Below is the output. \r\n![failingtest](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30603522/147567949-61ee7b6c-99d7-4344-b40e-a612c5bdbcb0.jpg)\r\n \r\nI have no ideas why it is failing since when I print out the object values they are exactly the same. \r\n\r\n![objectvals](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30603522/147568087-dda0e048-b568-41ee-a1de-3e6132fa9894.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe second issue is when transferring the tokens. After transferring 50 tokens, isn't this statement wrong `expect(await hardhatToken.balanceOf(addr1.address)).to.equal(50);` since we are comparing an object to a integer?\r\nI made it work using this \r\n```\r\nconst addr1Balance = await hardhatToken.balanceOf(addr1.address);\r\nexpect(parseInt(addr1Balance.toString())).to.equal(50);\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n",
