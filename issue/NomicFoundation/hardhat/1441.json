    "body": "This is going to be a little harder than it seems. The problem is that geth supports `null` as a value in a bunch of places. Our guess is that _any_ value that is optional can also be null (again, in geth, but we try to be as compatible with it as we can). So the proper fix might be to modify the `optional` io-ts codec to accept both missing values and null values. But before doing that, we need to double-check that assumption about geth.",
