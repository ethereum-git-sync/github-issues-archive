  "body": "This is the main tracking issue for splitting Hardhat Runner and Network into separate packages. This needs research and design, but tentatively we should:\r\n\r\n- Have a different package for the Hardhat Network, that can be used for programmatically creating instances. This would be a big step towards having better support for working with multiple networks at the same time.\r\n- Define the interface of this package taking into account that its core will eventually be replaced with Rethnet.\r\n- Use the Hardhat Network package to create a `hardhat-network-cli` binary.\r\n\r\nRelated issues:\r\n- #2496\r\n- #692",

It's a rapidly evolving field, and tools like these that enhance our ability to work with multiple networks are in high demand. This feature will enable us to build more robust and versatile applications, ultimately contributing to the evolution and maturity of the cross-chain ecosystem.\r\n\r\nI'd appreciate it if you could share a tentative roadmap for this feature. Knowing the expected timeline would be incredibly helpful for planning my projects and for the wider community as we navigate the expanding landscape of cross-chain development. \r\n\r\nThank you for considering these enhancements to serve the growing cross-chain development community. We greatly appreciate your efforts. 🙇‍♂️",
