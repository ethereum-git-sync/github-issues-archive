I think this issue is probably affecting your current issue log it looks to me like these:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat/issues/2208\r\nhttps://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat/issues/2248\r\nhttps://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat/issues/2247\r\n\r\nMight all be related.  Also, I would like to suggest more robust error handling might help to communicate to devs more about the issue if they run into it. I will have more time over the weekend happy to take a look and possibly suggest some changes.  ",
