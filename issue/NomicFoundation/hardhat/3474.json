  "body": "If you start a Hardhat node and send an `eth_estimateGas` whose gas price (or max fee per gas) is lower than the current base fee, you get an ugly \"If you think this is a bug in Hardhat, please report it here\" error.\r\n\r\nThis happens often when interacting with a contract in the node using MetaMask. I guess MetaMask assumes local networks have a base fee of 0.\r\n\r\nA workaround is to set `initialBaseFeePerGas` to zero:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  solidity: \"0.8.17\",\r\n  networks: {\r\n    hardhat: {\r\n      initialBaseFeePerGas: 0\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut we should show a proper error in these cases.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, maybe we should just accept `estimateGas` calls that don't have a gas price above the base fee.
