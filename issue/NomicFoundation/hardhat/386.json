  "body": "Realized this problem when using https://github.com/gnosis/util-contracts to `extract-network` and `inject-network`. They expect a truffle formatted artifact and so expect each contract to have a network attribute even if it is empty.\r\n\r\nIt seems that when buidler compiles it doesn't not include an empty network object. I've been injecting deployed contract networks manually, but lots of contracts aren't deployed directly. That means they have no network object and gnosis's tool throws an error when they are encountered.\r\n\r\nIt's an easy fix in the Gnosis tool, but if buidler is actually trying to mimic the truffle artifact then it should actually just include an empty network object the way truffle does.",
