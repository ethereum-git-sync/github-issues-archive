  "body": "I would like to support Hardhat by implementing ephemeral preview environments, powered by [Uffizzi](https://github.com/UffizziCloud/uffizzi)\r\n\r\nUffizzi is an Open Source, full stack, previews engine, and our platform is available completely free for Hardhat (and all open source projects). An Uffizzi integration with Hardhat will provision preview environments for every PR opened on Hardhat in the cloud, allowing faster reviews, faster merges, and increased release velocity. \r\n[Here are the open-source projects](https://uffizzi.notion.site/) which are currently using Uffizzi to provision previews.\r\n\r\nUffizzi is purpose-built for the task of previewing PRs and it integrates with your workflow to deploy preview environments in the background without any manual steps for maintainers or contributors.\r\n\r\nI'll go ahead and create an Initial PoC for you if you think there is value in this proposal.\r\nI work on the Uffizzi project.\r\n\r\ncc @waveywaves",
