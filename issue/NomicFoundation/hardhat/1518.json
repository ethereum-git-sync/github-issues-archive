  "body": "As of today, task are limited by `Error HH9: Error while loading Hardhat's configuration.` when importing a file in a task (imported by the hardhat config file).\r\n\r\nThe reason why I'm bringing that up is that I have a deployment script that needs to import another file that use the `hre`. Of course I could pass again and again the `hre` from point A to B but that would be ugly, messy and definitely not practical for the dev experience.\r\n\r\nThat's why I'm proposing to introduce 2 types of task:\r\n- System task, that actually define the system and that hardhat needs to be initialized. (Most likely the same task as today.)\r\n- Script task, that are just simple task that doesn't do/change anything to hardhat configuration and doesn't need to be pre-loaded.\r\n\r\nThis would solve the issue mentioned above and also - for instance - solve the issue where tasks that use the typechain plugin cannot get built on first build.",
