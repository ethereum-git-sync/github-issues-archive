I found this function in `ethers`:\r\nhttps://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/blob/98910ba01efa774710eefa5a6a5836a8b271c654/src.ts/contract/contract.ts#L328-L347\r\n\r\nIt looks like the runner (which should be Hardhat's provider) didn't throw an error, and the function execution continued, and it called the `decodeFunctionResult` function.\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nCould be similar to https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/issues/3438\n\n### Minimal reproduction steps\n\n1. Clone https://github.com/wtree-id/offchain-resolver at `e14000d9c8d35d5e44dff234255fbd9304834f7f`\r\n2. `npm i`\r\n3. `npm run test -w @ensdomains/offchain-resolver-contracts`\r\n4. The test should fail\n\n### Search terms\n\ninvalid length for result data",
