  "body": "We should offer some functionality to preserve deployments' information between Buidler executions.\r\n\r\nOne possible solution is to create a plugin that extends the Buidler Runtime Environment with an object containing (at least) these two methods:\r\n\r\n* `getDeployedContracts`: Receives a TruffleContract and returns an array of contract instances. This method should warn if the deployed contract's bytecode doesn't match the local's one.\r\n\r\n* `saveDeployedContract`: Receives a contract instance, and saves its address. This method should warn if the contract was deployed to a testing/temporal network.\r\n\r\nUnder the hood, these methods should work with a JSON file looking something like this:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ninterface DeploymentsFile {\r\n  [chainId: number]: {\r\n    [contractName:string]: string[] // the addresses \r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny operation involving reading & updating that file has to be synchronous, and, if possible, atomic.\r\n\r\nOnce we have this plugin, deployment scripts could be written in this fashion:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nlet [token] = await deployments.getDeployedContracts(Token);\r\nif (token === undefined) {\r\n   token = await Token.new();\r\n   await deployments.saveDeployedContract(token);\r\n}\r\n\r\nlet [other] = await deployments.getDeployedContracts(Other);\r\nif (other === undefined) {\r\n   other = await Other.new(123, token.address);\r\n   await deployments.saveDeployedContract(other);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWriting them this way has the advantage of the scripts being resumable. If, for example, deploying `Other` fails because `123` wasn't a valid parameter`, you can correct it and re-run the script without having to re-deploy the `Token`.\r\n\r\nFinally, other things that we should consider:\r\n\r\n* We should also have some methods to \"forget\" about a certain contract.\r\n* Should we store the deployment parameters?",

    "body": "Hey,\r\nYou might want to checkout rocketh (https://github.com/wighawag/rocketh) it was optimized for a seamless deployment flow.\r\n\r\nI am starting to look at buidler to see if i could implement the same functionality in plugins but I am not sure yet\r\n\r\nrocketh supports the following thing :\r\n- stages (aka migrations in truffle parlance) that are run both for tests and deployment\r\n in test mode you can re-run them so your test can always act on a blank state. No need to duplicate code.\r\n- namedAccounts allow you to configure special account with name for each network.. Your tests can use them too. This make test more readable while preserving compatibility with deployment with real addresses. \r\n- when a failure happen while waiting for a deployment to be mined, rocketh save the tx hash so you can resume even for this case. When the stages are re-run It will wait for that transaction to complete. If this tx never finish, you currently have to delete the pending state. planning to add a prompt.\r\n- it saves a deployment file (only in non-test chain) that contains the solc output as well as the metadata. It also create a separate file for code verification that can be used as input for solc. These are meant to be stored on git and are used to check whether you want to redeploy a contract or not\r\n- Indeed it supports redeploy only if changes were made (checking arguments and/or bytecode) allowing you to feel confident in running the whole stages on the mainnet. \r\n- it supports bitski app wallet for deployment. You can have different wallet for the different networks\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Some thoughts on this.\r\n\r\n### Addresses location\r\n\r\nOne open question is where the addresses will be saved. I guess saving them in the `artifacts` directory makes sense. An alternative is to have a specific file for this. For example, the Gnosis team has a `networks.json` file in many of their projects ([example](https://github.com/gnosis/conditional-tokens-contracts/blob/master/networks.json)). This file is versioned and also published to npm, which makes it easier to use in a different project:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst networks = require('my/project/networks.json')\r\n\r\nconsole.log(networks[\"MyContract\"][\"1\"].address\r\n```\r\n\r\nOf course, this can also be done with artifacts if you commit and publish them.\r\n\r\n### Multiple instances\r\n\r\nThe other question I have is how to manage multiple instances of the same contract. In the current proposal, it seems like each new address is added to an array. My problem with that is that working with that seems a little cumbersome: you are relaying on the order in which your original deploy script was written.\r\n\r\nThe other problem with this, in my opinion, is that it defaults to a complex object when in most cases contracts have only one instance. So I think a nice alternative approach would be using some kind of map, and returning a single address for the given key:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nlet token = await deployments.getDeployedContracts(Token);\r\nif (token === undefined) {\r\n   token = await Token.new();\r\n   await deployments.saveDeployedContract(token);\r\n}\r\n\r\nlet anotherToken = await deployments.getDeployedContracts(Token, 'otherToken');\r\nif (token === undefined) {\r\n   anotherToken = await Token.new();\r\n   await deployments.saveDeployedContract(anotherToken, 'otherToken');\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n(This is just to illustrate the idea; I don't like that API for a couple of reasons that I won't detail because this is getting long enough already.)\r\n\r\nThe next question here is how to represent this on the artifacts/networks file.\r\n\r\n### Truffle\r\n\r\nThere's a feature request for this in Truffle since 2016, see https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/issues/237. They are also working on [a proposal](https://trufflesuite.github.io/artifact-updates/) to solve this and other related issues. I haven't read this document in depth; the analysis looks interesting, but the proposal seems unnecessarily complex. I think the approach proposed in this issue covers a lot of ground and it's flexible enough.",

I understand there is a long-term vision, but then there's the reality of developers needing a working deployment process _now_. So instead of compromising and supporting `hardhat-deploy` while Ignition is in development, the alternative is to tell developers to ignore that project and do everything manually with scripts?\r\n\r\nThis is an opportunity to work with creators of existing tools, and also create a clear migration path for users who have already chosen to use `hardhat-deploy`. Perhaps the author of hardhat-deploy can contribute to Ignition and collaborate. If `hardhat-deploy` is ignored, you're just leaving that part of the community behind. 🤷 \r\n\r\nIf I'm blowing this out of proportion then some clearer messaging on the current status of Ignition would be nice.",

We just try to make a clear distinction between our official plugins and the ones created by the community, because if it's an official recommendation then it becomes (partially) our responsibility too, and we are already understaffed for our _current_ projects.\r\n\r\n> Perhaps the author of hardhat-deploy can contribute to Ignition and collaborate.\r\n\r\nWe are on really good terms with @wighawag (or at least I would like to think we are!) and he has contributed some very useful feedback for Ignition from his experience with `hardhat-deploy`.\r\n\r\n> If hardhat-deploy is ignored, you're just leaving that part of the community behind.\r\n\r\nIt's not our plan to leave that part of the community behind. We are going to have both clear migration guides, and also Ignition is being developed in a way that should let anyone build on top of it, so there's a possibility that `hardhat-deploy` could use it as its engine under the hood for people that prefer its approach to deployments.\r\n\r\nI know we've not done a great job at communicating our relationship with `hardhat-deploy`. It's likely that we've been too conservative in order to not have extra work to do, but to be fair even doing this we still get a lot of support questions from people that don't realize that `hardhat-deploy` is a separate project. But, again, I really think we could've handled that without making it look like we are shunning it.",
