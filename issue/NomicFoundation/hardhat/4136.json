    "body": "Certainly understand your point.\r\n\r\nJust for my edification and so that we are on the same page, can you describe how this is useful in many testing scenarios -- assuming you mean in some way beyond the trivial \"I don't want to spend down my fee currency during tests\"?\r\n\r\nRealizing that, then this is not necessarily a bug when hardhat is pointed at certain providers (e.g., in testing nodes), but it seems that zero is a value that should not be emitted for transactions heading to a \"real\" chain i.e. in production.\r\n\r\nI don't want to bike shed this issue. I guess I'm just making the simple point that this is a bit of a weird value, and since hardhat is *calculating the fee* by delegating that calculation to the chain provider via a percentile, if a production dapp gets back zero, that's very likely a misconfiguration (maybe DNS is not pointed correctly and ended up giving you the test chain, whatever).\r\n\r\nSure I realize this is a pretty innocuous misconfiguration scenario, as the transaction is then likely to simply fail, but IF there is a design principle of not letting through out-of-bounds autogenerated values onto production chains, this seems like such a value.\r\n\r\nEDIT: ... and an alternate behavior would be to throw an exception so the admin can be alerted, and fix the problem.",
