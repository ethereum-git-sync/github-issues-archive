Whenever you buy a proxy, it requires authorization, which is not done in hardhat.\r\n\r\nBest way to solve it would be to get auth data by validating proxy formatted like:\r\nhttp://login:pass@ip:port\r\n\r\nI don't know how to fix it in hardhat repo, so that you could just merge it. My monkey solution was to hardcode it into ProxyAgent class like this:\r\n\r\n`this[kProxyHeaders]['proxy-authorization'] = `Basic ${Buffer.from('*login*:*password*').toString('base64')}``",
