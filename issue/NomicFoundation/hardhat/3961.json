Sorry for the lack of a profound explanation, I just discovered it randomly and seems like a incompatibility bug. Thanks for your help.\r\n\n\n### Minimal reproduction steps\n\n* Install and import \"@nomicfoundation/hardhat-foundry\" in hardhat.config.ts\r\n* Run coverage tests with `npx hardhat coverage`\r\n* Unimport \"@nomicfoundation/hardhat-foundry\" in hardhat.config.ts\r\n* Run coverage tests once again with `npx hardhat coverage`\n\n### Search terms\n\nfoundry, coverage",
