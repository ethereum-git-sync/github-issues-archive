I have seen that there is some kind of inconsistency in git log commit messages (maybe I am wrong because I am not a professional I am a student just getting started in open source) . I have given a PR template below please take a look , on how I see a PR template will be good for this repo . \r\n\r\nIt will be also good to have if any new contributor wants to make a PR so he should follow the rules as said in the template . \r\n\r\n**PR template:**\r\n```\r\n<!--\r\n\r\nPlease prefix the title according to PR:\r\n\r\nHere are some examples of good titles:\r\n\r\n- Feat (issue_number): Added 2 step authentication\r\n- Fix (issue_number): removed unclear error message on failed transcation\r\n- Doc (issue_number): Added Hindi language documentation\r\n\r\nAND PLEASE READ THE GUIDE: https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n\r\n-->\r\n```\r\nCurrently I can think of this template only , if anyone else want to add something let's discuss in the comment section below",
