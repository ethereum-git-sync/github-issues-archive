  "body": "> With go-ethereum setting a fromBlock greater than the latest block number does not return any events.\r\n\r\nHardhat is setting it to `latestBlock` instead. This means that if the latest block is 10 and you send a `fromBlock` of 11 and a `toBlock` of latest, you'll get the events fro mthe latest block. You should get nothing instead.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @sveitser in https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/issues/1773#issuecomment-1069642941_",
