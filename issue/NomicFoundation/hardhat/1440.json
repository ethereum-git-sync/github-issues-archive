I am in need of debugging a contract that works with signed numbers, so I resorted to using `console.logInt`:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nconsole.logInt(x.log2());\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I am logging multiple vars and it's becoming harder to know which is which in the console output. It'd be great if I could do this:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nconsole.logInt(\"x.log2\", x.log2());\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr even better, ditch the `logInt` altogether and overload the usual `console.log` to add support for signed integers.",

Is there some documentation about testing and how to add/configure json files to add this new tests? or some good practice to not making it in the wrong way?",

Hardhat documentation for console.log makes no mention of logInt (in the [tutorial](https://hardhat.org/tutorial/debugging-with-hardhat-network) or the [real documentation](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network/docs/overview#console.log)) and console.log is one of the things you expect to \"just work\" for basic types like ints. implementing my own `log(message, int, int)` is something I had to do when I was using truffle.\r\n\r\ntldr bump",
