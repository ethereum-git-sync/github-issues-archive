    "body": "> However, the previous size of the contract was: **`120709`** and there were no errors being thrown even though `allowUnlimitedContractSize` was unset (`false` by default).\r\n\r\nMy guess is this: the contract size limit is about the size of a _deployed_ contract, not the _deployment_ contract. The latter can be bigger than 24K as long as the resulting, deployed bytecode is under that limit.\r\n\r\nBut the deployment bytecode cannot exceed the block gas limit of the block. I think that's what's going on here. Try increasing the `blockGasLimit` in the Hardhat network config and see if that fixes it.\r\n\r\nOf course, the error that Hardhat is returning to you is wrong. I'm going to open an issue about that.",
