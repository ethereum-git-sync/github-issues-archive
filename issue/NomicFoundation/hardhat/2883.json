The best way to do this is to include a [Minimal Reproducible Example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example). If you can't do that, then include a link to your repo, and the steps to reproduce the problem. The easiest it is to reproduce your problem, the faster we are going to be able to fix it.\r\n\r\nIf you are submitting a feature request, please take the time to clearly describe your use case, and not only your proposed solution.\r\n\r\nThis issue will be automatically assigned to a Hardhat team member. This person will act as the point of contact between you and the team, but won't necessarily fix it nor address it in any way. An issue being assigned does not mean that it's being worked on.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIt is possible to cause an infinite loop in the source map parsing if an empty buffer ends up being passed through to this function. It will just loop forever.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/blob/98b7548525080c91a45cc3d3971f2d0248f62695/packages/hardhat-core/src/internal/hardhat-network/stack-traces/source-maps.ts#L76-L84\r\n\r\nI think that there should be a check added to ensure that this doesn't loop forever to prevent hardhat from crashing on bad input.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to create an empty buffer if the string passed to this function has a `0x` prefix.\r\nhttps://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/blob/98b7548525080c91a45cc3d3971f2d0248f62695/packages/hardhat-core/src/internal/hardhat-network/stack-traces/library-utils.ts#L20-L33\r\n\r\nThis is only possible if there is a bug in the creation of the compiler output JSON file which incorrectly serializes the object bytecode with a `0x` prefix.",
