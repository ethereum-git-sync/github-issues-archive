    "body": "> The problem here is that you are using an async function within a describe, and that's not supported by mocha. Your `describe` callbacks need to be synchronous.\r\n\r\nI didn't think **async describe** was an issue before, because if I changed to **async** everything worked for me as before. But now I realized that this word means nothing if we do not cause anything _asynchronous_ in the body. So I added `const test = await ethers.getSigner()` and now I have _0 passing_. +1 point to understanding asynchrony.\r\n\r\n",
