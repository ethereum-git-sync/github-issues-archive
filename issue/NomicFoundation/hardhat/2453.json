    "body": "Here's another case of this, though it's a bit different. This one fails only with the latest compiler built from `develop` branch (so should fail with latest nightly too). The thing is, if you remove `current()` or `increment()` function, it starts behaving like the other one, e.g. fails on versions >= 0.8.7.\r\n\r\nI found it while debugging a revert with `viaIR` in OpenZeppelin. It initially looked like something else or like a bug in their `@openzepeplin/test-helpers` library, but after reducing it to a small example, I think it's actually just another instance of this problem.\r\n\r\n### How to reproduce\r\nHere's a repro showing the problem both with `expectRevert()` from `@openzepeplin/test-helpers` and with `expect().to.be.revertedWith`.\r\n\r\n#### No failure on 0.8.12\r\n```bash\r\nmkdir test/ contracts/\r\n\r\ncat <<EOF > hardhat.config.js\r\nrequire(\"@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle\");\r\nrequire('@nomiclabs/hardhat-truffle5');\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n    solidity: {\r\n        compilers: [{\r\n            version: \"0.8.12\",\r\n            settings: {\r\n                viaIR: true,\r\n                optimizer: { enabled: true },\r\n            },\r\n        }]\r\n    }\r\n};\r\nEOF\r\n\r\ncat <<EOF > test/CountersTest.js\r\nconst { expectRevert } = require('@openzeppelin/test-helpers');\r\nconst { expect } = require('chai');\r\nconst CountersImpl = artifacts.require('CountersImpl');\r\n\r\nit('expectRevert', async function () {\r\n  const counter = await CountersImpl.new();\r\n  await expectRevert(counter.decrement(), 'Counter: decrement overflow');\r\n});\r\n\r\nit('expect().to.be.revertedWith', async function () {\r\n  const counter = await CountersImpl.new();\r\n  await expect(counter.decrement()).to.be.revertedWith('Counter: decrement overflow');\r\n});\r\nEOF\r\n\r\ncat <<EOF > contracts/CountersImpl.sol\r\ncontract CountersImpl {\r\n    function current() public {}\r\n    function increment() public {}\r\n    function decrement() public {\r\n        require(false, \"Counter: decrement overflow\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nEOF\r\n\r\nnpm install hardhat @nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle chai @openzeppelin/test-helpers @nomiclabs/hardhat-truffle5\r\nnpx hardhat test\r\n```\r\nOutput:\r\n```\r\n  ✔ expectRevert (528ms)\r\n  ✔ expect().to.be.revertedWith\r\n\r\n  2 passing (569ms)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Without `current()`\r\nIf you replace the contract with this (i.e. same thing but with `current()` removed):\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract CountersImpl {\r\n    function increment() public {}\r\n    function decrement() public {\r\n        require(false, \"Counter: decrement overflow\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nyou get\r\n```\r\n  1) expectRevert\r\n  2) expect().to.be.revertedWith\r\n\r\n  0 passing (548ms)\r\n  2 failing\r\n\r\n  1) expectRevert:\r\n\r\n      Wrong kind of exception received\r\n      + expected -
