  "body": "Is there already some way to have multiple hardhat instances with different configurations?\r\nIf there is please üôè let me know and you can ignore what's next...\r\n\r\nI think it could be beneficial if we could create a hardhat instance from a specific config file.\r\nSome advantages I can see:\r\n1. There are some plugins that are incompatible with each other, so you could have an instance with some plugins loaded and another one with some other plugins\r\n2. You can have different settings for different chains you use hardhat for\r\n3. Maybe we can also remove the `You are not inside a Hardhat project` error and don't limit the usage of hardhat to a folder where you will find a config file. This could open door to one for example creating a package from hardhat to be used in a project. You would import that package into the project.\r\n\r\nSample code:\r\n```ts\r\nimport hardhat from 'hardhat'\r\n\r\nexport const ethHre = hardhat({ configPath: './eth/hardhat.config.ts' })\r\nexport const hederaHre = hardhat({ configPath: './hedera/hardhat.config.ts' })\r\n```\r\n\r\nDoes this make sense to you? \r\n\r\n\r\n",
