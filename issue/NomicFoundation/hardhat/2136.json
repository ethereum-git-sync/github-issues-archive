  "body": "[dapptools](https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools) and recently [foundry](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2021/12/introducing-the-foundry-ethereum-development-toolbox/) both support fuzzing natively. We should support fuzzing with Typescript. This will help keep feature parity with similar smart contract devkits, and give TS users an additional powerful tool in their testing kit which currently doesn't exist, either natively in Hardhat nor as a plugin.\r\n\r\nI don't have a concrete suggestion for what the UX should be for this, but here are some ideas.\r\n\r\n1) Use code instrospection to detect which tests the user wants to make use of fuzzing (similar to how dapptools and foundry do it with `*WithFuzzing` suffix)\r\n2) Add a built-in hardhat function uses to wrap Mocha's `it` tests, which takes as its arguments the variables you want to fuzz against\r\n\r\nI have implemented some fuzz tests on my own using hardhat, and it would have saved me a lot of time, as well as encouraged me to write more comprehensive tests in the first place, if Hardhat had a ready-to-go tool for fuzzing.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to help implement this with the help of an existing Hardhat contributor.",
