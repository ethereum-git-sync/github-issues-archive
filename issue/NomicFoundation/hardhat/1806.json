  "body": "This issue is similar, but different to #1544.  The latter is requesting the ability to specify which tests `mocha` should run via CLI arguments to `hardhat test` which are glob patterns.  In contrast, this test is concerned specifying which tests to run via the hardhat config.\r\n\r\nI expected that this would be possible, since it is strongly implied by https://hardhat.org/config/#mocha-configuration which says:\r\n\r\n> You can configure how your tests are run using the `mocha` entry, which accepts the same options as Mocha.\r\n\r\nand links to https://mochajs.org/, under which [the config section](https://mochajs.org/#configuration-format) says:\r\n\r\n> Test files can be specified using `spec`, e.g., `\"spec\": \"test/**/*.spec.js\"`.\r\n\r\nPutting these together, I expected that setting my `hardhat.config.js` to something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  paths: {\r\n    artifacts: './build/contracts',\r\n    deployments: 'deployments',\r\n  },\r\n  mocha: {\r\n    spec: [\r\n      'test/**/*.test.js',\r\n    ],\r\n  },\r\n  defaultNetwork: 'hardhat',\r\n  ...\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nwould do the trick.  But it turns out that this `spec` config parameter is completely ignored!\r\n\r\nAFAICS, the guilty code is:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat/blob/854a149835ed0763bb7396189f299fd094409f61/packages/hardhat-core/src/builtin-tasks/test.ts#L21-L41\r\n\r\nwhich clearly hardcodes `**/*.js`, or `**/*.ts` if running in typescript mode.\r\n\r\nThis seems like a missed opportunity, because hardhat does indeed pass the `config.mocha` config object through to mocha:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat/blob/854a149835ed0763bb7396189f299fd094409f61/packages/hardhat-core/src/builtin-tasks/test.ts#L45-L54\r\n\r\nbut then any `spec` provided in the config is overridden since hardhat passes an explicit list of files to test through to mocha:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat/blob/854a149835ed0763bb7396189f299fd094409f61/packages/hardhat-core/src/builtin-tasks/test.ts#L96-L104\r\n\r\nIf the user doesn't pass a list of test files via the CLI, why not let mocha perform the discovery itself rather than having hardhat do it?  That way, mocha's existing test discovery configuration mechanism can be utilised.",

The user set a spec and passed some files: ???\r\n\r\nI mostly think that we should do what mocha does. It runs everything that's covered by the `spec` and the file. I just tried it in a new project.\r\n\r\nI have a few questions though:\r\n\r\n1. Does it work out of the box if we don't call any `addFile`? I believe that's part of the CLI \"part\" of mocha, and not really exported by the library interface. Take a look at [this file](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/blob/34643e4c0821aeb8d6977c1942bc106c9363789a/lib/cli/collect-files.js#L25).\r\n2. If we want to behave like mocha, or if it doesn't work out of the box, would we need to implement this \"collect-files\" functionality ourselves? Or can we use that file?",

    "body": "I believe this issue is still relevant.\r\n\r\nOn a more general note, my personal recommendation (which of course you are free to take or leave) is that it is often more productive to leave issues open until there is a clear resolution (e.g. a fix, or a decision such as \"we're not going to implement this\").\r\n\r\nWhen issues or feature requests are marked as closed without resolution, then people are more likely to miss them, resulting in duplicate reports.  And people searching for ways to contribute are more likely to miss them too.  Here's [someone else's blog post on the same topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/j9hi9x/an_example_of_why_bug_reports_and_feature/).\r\n\r\nHowever I understand it is annoying to have open issues going nowhere.  IMHO one solution for this is to label short-lived and long-lived issues differently to distinguish them.  Another is assigning issues to different milestones. This makes it clear to users which issues are likely to be fixed sooner rather than later.  This way you could disable the auto-closing of stale issues which the bot is currently configured to perform, whilst keeping the automatic addition of the `Stale` label.\r\n\r\nHope this is useful food for thought.  Thanks again!",
