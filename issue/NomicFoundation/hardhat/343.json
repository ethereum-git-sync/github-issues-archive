  "body": "It might be convenient if internal `TASK_COMPILE_COMPILE` consumed a solc output formatter task that other tasks can easily override. Immediate reason for wanting this is that I'm writing something that will inadvertently introduce many warnings. I'd like to suppress them without altering the other logic in that method.\r\n\r\nThis has wider application - for example Federico Bond wrote some nice error formatting for solc that ended up in [this merged PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5511). It's not enabled by default and disabled for anyone using the JSON I/O interface. That work could be emulated in JS and have additional features:\r\n+ sorting of warnings and errors\r\n+ warning aggregation (e.g display abi-encoder v2 warning once +  number of times);\r\n+ `--no-warn` \r\n+ error/warning totals\r\n\r\nBasically a plugin like this:\r\n```javascript\r\nusePlugin('pretty-solc');\r\n```\r\n```\r\nnpx buidler compile --pretty\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf there's any appetite here for a PR to decouple the output component, please just lmk and I will send one. \r\n ",

They were created when we were still in a prototyping phase. They need to be redesigned soon, before many plugins are created.\r\n\r\nApart from your idea, we have been discussing IRL that they should be redesign with multiple languages in mind. Do you have any other thought around this? Anything else you'd like to be able to do/modify in the compilation process?\r\n\r\nWe developed an experimental Vyper plugin, and we [ended up overriding the entire `compile` task](https://github.com/nomiclabs/buidler/blob/master/packages/buidler-vyper/src/index.ts#L13-L21), which is far from ideal.",

I don't have any brilliant ideas there unfortunately :) I *think* people have begun mixing Vyper and Solidity in the same project though - for example I believe I saw one which contains the Uniswap (vyper) contracts as a dep and tests Solidity contract interactions against it.
