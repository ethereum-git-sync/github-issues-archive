  "body": "Several users get confused when they do something like this:\r\n\r\n- They run `hardhat node` in a terminal\r\n- In another terminal, they run a script or their tests, without specifying a network\r\n\r\nThey expect that the node they started before will be used. Instead, an in-process Hardhat Network is launched. The proper way to use the launched node is to configure a network to point to `http://localhost:8545` and then use `--network localhost`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOne possible way to alleviate this problem is this:\r\n\r\n1. When a Hardhat Network is going to be started in-process, check if the port 8545 is open\r\n2. If it's open, use a RPC method to check if it's a hardhat node. (There's no such method right now, we could add a `hardhat_version` method or something like that).\r\n3. If it's a hardhat node, launch an in-process BEVM anyway, but print a clear warning indicating what's going on.\r\n\r\nThis is not a full solution. If someone does `hardhat node --port 9545`, this approach won't work. But it might help in most cases.",
