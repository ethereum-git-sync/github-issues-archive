  "body": "Our `ForkStateManager` uses (but doesn't extend) the `DefaultStateManager` from ethereumjs, and it does some weird things like this:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n  public isWarmedAddress(address: Buffer): boolean {\r\n    return DefaultStateManager.prototype.isWarmedAddress.call(this, address);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe should try to re-implement the whole class so that it extends the `BaseStateManager`. This class assumes that the constructor will initialize the `this._cache` property, which is an instance of `Cache` and it expects some callbacks to be implemented (`getCb`, `putCb` and `deleteCb`; check the constructor of `DefaultStateManager` for the details). We should implement those callbacks so that they fetch the data they need from the forked node, and see if that implementation works (if our tests pass, and if we can run some full blocks without errors).",
