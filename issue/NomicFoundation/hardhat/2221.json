  "body": "If the version pragma is specified in the file, and it changes, then this will be redundant with just checking the content hash.\r\n\r\nIf the file doesn't specify a version pragma, then this value will always be `DEFAULT_VYPER_VERSION`*, and so the comparison will also be unnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe equivalent code in the built-in compile task is meant to check if there was a change in the part of the solidity configuration that affects this file (for example, if the optimizer was toggled). Since we are using a simpler approach here in general: \r\n\r\n1) Add the full vyper config to the cache and, if it \r\nchanges, invalidate the whole thing and re-compile everything. This will have the effect of \"recompile if the version is changed\" but with a much simpler code.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @fvictorio in https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat/pull/2160#discussion_r778354313_",
