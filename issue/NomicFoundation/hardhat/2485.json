  "body": "Hi, according to the [doc](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network/reference/#gas), in hardhat config, `gas` will override `gasLimit`, and `gasPrice` will override `gasPrice` for every transaction. However, when I set a hardcoded value for the gas params:\r\n```\r\nnetworks: {\r\n  myNetwork: {\r\n      gasPrice: 204369036266, \r\n      gas: 53064000,\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI saw my contract deployment transaction only used `204369036266` as `gasPrice`, but didn't use `53064000` as `gasLimit`, and it queried `eth_estimateGas` and used the result for `gasLimit`.\r\n\r\nIs this expected? Did I misunderstand what the docs mean?\r\n\r\nBasically I am trying to use these hardcoded gas params for **every** transaction, including contract deployment and call, in truffle if I put the same setting in truffle config it will work, so I was wondering how should I do it with hardhat? Thanks for the help!",
