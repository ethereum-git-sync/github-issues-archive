(A bit hacky but could be an easy workaround.)\r\n* Built-in support for an array of networks and sequentially running the script on each of them. (Great DX, but probably not so easy to do.)\r\n* Changing `hardhat-ethers` to allow updating the provider in runtime.\r\n\r\nMy team can help building this functionality if you can provide some guidance.\r\n\r\nThank you.",
