As the message wasn't clear I spent a bit of time troubleshooting to find that it was because of the change of function parameter location from `memory` to `calldata`.\r\n\r\nMy problem is solved (I changed the locations back to `memory`) but I'm writing this issue just to inform and hope tht error messages can be more helpful.",
