  "body": "Our config validation uses the user config, and one of the validations is that all non-Hardhat networks have a URL.\r\n\r\nThis means that a plugin cannot add its own URL, because by the time the `extendConfig`s are executed, the user config has been already validated (see for example [this](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/issues/3221#issuecomment-1265098424))\r\n\r\nThe resolved config type will still need for the URLs to be mandatory, because we use that in some type guards to distinguish between the Hardhat network and other networks. So we'll probably need to use some dummy values during resolution, and then a post-validation step that checks that no URL has that dummy value.\r\n\r\nNeeds #3500",
