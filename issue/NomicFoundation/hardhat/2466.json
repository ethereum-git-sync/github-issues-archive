This is simple to check by putting a `require(false);`  next to any of the reported lines and seeing the tests fail which previously passed before the change.\r\n\r\nSorry to not have a minified test case yet I can share.\r\n\r\nBut I do have a workaround. Adding an event to the affected contract and putting a `emit` next to that affected line solves the problem.\r\n\r\nWanted to create this issue first because we have a workaround and that might be helpful for others.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nVersion: Hardhat 2.9.1",
