  "body": "## Motivation\r\n\r\nCurrently, to deploy a contract at the desired address on the hardhat network, the only way to do that seems to be the `hardhat_setCode`. The limitation of this approach is that it cannot run any constructor init code, just the runtime code.\r\n\r\nUsecase to deploy contracts at desired addresses are to mock contracts at CREATE2 addresses or even mock existing contracts on a mainnet fork. Plugins like [smock](https://github.com/defi-wonderland/smock) or [hardhat-deploy](https://github.com/wighawag/hardhat-deploy) or various different plugins, can then leverage this great feature of deploying contract at a dev specified address while deployment. \r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nThe introduction of a new hardhat API called `hardhat_copyAccount` takes in a source account address and a destination account address. It should fail if an account already exists (similar to UNIX cp). So it can take an additional optional param called `force`, to overwrite existing accounts.",
