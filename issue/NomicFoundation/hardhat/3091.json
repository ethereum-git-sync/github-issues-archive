    "body": "Hi @fabianorodrigo. In Waffle, `.revertedWith` matches the whole error message as a trick to match the error reason string within it. An unintended effect of that is that you can do things like what you were doing, were you are using `.revertedWith` to match the error message.\r\n\r\nIn this case, you should match the error message as you would do with any function. Since this is an async function, you can use something like [chai-as-promised](https://www.chaijs.com/plugins/chai-as-promised/) and write:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nawait expect(sendTx()).to.be.rejectedWith(\"function selector was not recognized\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat being said, I wouldn't recommend writing tests like this. The error messages for inferred errors are something that can change over time; we don't consider them part of the API.",
