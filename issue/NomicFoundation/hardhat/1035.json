  "body": "Hi. I experimented with the `experimentalAddHardhatNetworkMessageTraceHook` while adapting the solidity-coverage to use the Hardhat network. \r\n\r\nIt seems like tracing stops being able to associate VM steps with a bytecode whenever calls are forwarded from one contract to another. \r\n\r\nIn my case, [the hook inspects each step][1] of each trace for `pushData` values that are artificially injected into solidity code as a naive way of tracking source line locations hit while the VM runs. When execution jumps from one contract to another within a call, the availability of this data disappears. \r\n\r\nA reproduction can be found at: https://github.com/sc-forks/hardhat-lost-trace-repro\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/sc-forks/hardhat-lost-trace-repro/blob/cc82aef94bc27acfb8a4f34aa6ce6beacf1e2eba/test/test.js#L11-L25\r\n ",
