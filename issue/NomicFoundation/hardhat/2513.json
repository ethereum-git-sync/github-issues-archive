    "body": "We'll be working on this soon.\r\n\r\nTo do:\r\n- [ ] Add support for state overrides in eth_call. The implementation shouldn't be too hard: we should accept this parameter and then, before making the call, iterate over it and use the state manager to update those fields.\r\n- [ ] Add tests for this. This will probably take more effort than the implementation itself. It will likely mean adding some example contracts specific for these tests. I can help with this since it's not straightforward.",
