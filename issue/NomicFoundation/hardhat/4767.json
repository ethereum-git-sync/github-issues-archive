  "body": "I noticed this while reviewing an external PR where the linter was passing but it clearly had a slow import. The problem is that relative imports in modules that are _not_ one of the entry points are not correctly resolved.\r\n\r\nI think the problem is here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/blob/b626dc15b047773603964a66f7efa9982d188bda/packages/eslint-plugin-slow-imports/lib/rules/no-top-level-external-import.js#L83-L87\r\n\r\nThere are two issues with this code:\r\n\r\n1. The `resolve` function receives `context` and uses that to get the file name of the importing file. But this is wrong: `context` will always be one of the entry points (`cli/cli.ts`, `register.ts`, etc.), even for deeper modules. So this works for relative imports that are included in one of the entry points, but not for anything else.\r\n2. `absoluteModulePath` will be undefined if the relative path couldn't be resolved, but I think we should throw in that case. I don't see why we would have relative imports that cannot be resolved in code that compiles.\r\n\r\nThe reason our [e2e workflow](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/blob/b626dc15b047773603964a66f7efa9982d188bda/.github/workflows/test-slow-imports-rule.yml) didn't catch this is that we add a slow import to a file that is directly imported from `src/cli/cli.ts`, so it doesn't run into this problem.\r\n\r\nSo, we should:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make the workflow fail. This should be easy; we just need to duplicate the step that adds a slow import and use a deeper module.\r\n- [ ] Fix the issue.\r\n- [ ] Add an assertion that the resolved path is never `undefined`.",
