  "body": "# What's Wrong\r\nThe `node/recommended` plugin only does `js` import files, it complains with `node/no-missing-import` messages if the module is a typescript module. \r\n\r\n# Steps to Reproduce\r\n1. make a new hardhat typescript project\r\n2. make a new `hello.ts` file under `./scripts/hello.ts`\r\n```\r\nexport const hello = () => console.log(\"hello\");\r\n```\r\n3. import that file in the default `./scripts/deploy.ts` file:\r\n```\r\nimport { ethers } from \"hardhat\";\r\nimport { sayshi } from \"./sayshi\";\r\n\r\nasync function main() {\r\n// etc. etc.\r\n```\r\n4. At this point, my ide (Webstorm) complains: \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10492324/149679811-c02c197b-f666-44a3-baf2-f84749ee3e6b.png)\r\nIf you try running eslint, it will complain too... \r\n\r\n```\r\nyarn eslint scripts/*.ts\r\n# yada yada\r\n/Users/arshankhanifar/hardhat-debug/scripts/deploy.ts\r\n  7:23  error  \"./hello\" is not found  node/no-missing-import\r\n\r\nâœ– 1 problem (1 error, 0 warnings)\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Repo That Shows This\r\nHere's a [repo that shows this](https://github.com/ArshanKhanifar/hardhat-bug-demo)\r\n\r\n# Proposed Fix\r\nMaybe use `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended` instead? That's what [nounsdao ](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/blob/master/.eslintrc.js#L9) is doing. \r\n\r\n",
