    "body": "Hey @adamdry, the reason this doesn't work is that ethers.js, by default, uses polling to get events, and the polling interval is 4 seconds. If you add this at the end of your test:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nawait new Promise(res => setTimeout(() => res(null), 5000));\r\n```\r\n\r\nyou'll see the log being printed. (The `null` is just for the test to compile.) As far as I know, the only way for ethers to _not_ do this is to use a `WebSocketProvider`, but we can't do that for the in-process Hardhat Network.\r\n\r\nAlso, I don't think the polling interval can be configured :slightly_frowning_face: But maybe you can check [ethers.js discussions board](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/discussions) to see if someone asked about that.\r\n\r\nClosing this for now, but please re-open if you think there's something we can do on our side.",
