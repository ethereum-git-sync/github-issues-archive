The error is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTypeError: Cannot read property 'content' of undefined\r\n    at createSourcesModelFromAst (node_modules/hardhat/src/internal/hardhat-network/stack-traces/compiler-to-model.ts:72:42)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe underlying reason seems to be that the compiler input has `contracts/Foo.sol` and `hardhat/console.sol` as sources, while the compiler output has those two sources **plus** `node_modules/hardhat/console.sol`.\r\n\r\nThough using `import \"hardhat/console.sol\";` fixes the problem, we need to decide what we want to do when people use a relative path like that: do we throw an error if there is a relative import that goes through `node_modules`, or do we allow it and try to fix this? I feel like we've already discussed this in the past, but I can't find an issue/PR about it. @alcuadrado wdyt?",
