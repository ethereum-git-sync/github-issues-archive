    "body": "Hi @PipsqueakH. This is not possible right now because the way `console.sol` is done, there are \"hardcoded\" methods for all the basic types (and some combinations). You can take a look at [`console.sol`](https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat/blob/master/packages/hardhat-core/console.sol) to see what I mean.\r\n\r\nThere are some possible workaround around this, like parsing all `console.log` usages and generating the necessary code, but... it's hard, and honestly I don't think it's something we'll do soon.",
