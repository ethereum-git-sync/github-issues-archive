  "body": "### Version of Hardhat\n\n2.12.6\n\n### What happened?\n\nI have a preprocess function processing a remapping for imports. This works perfectly fine when running `hardhat compile` but it fails when running `hardhat coverage`. It seems like solidity-coverage plugin is working on files before preprocessing them or not even taking preprocess configuration into account.\r\n\r\nI tried using `.solcover.js` for applying the same preprocess function but I was not able to do it.\n\n### Minimal reproduction steps\n\n1. Get a repository of contracts with `solidity-coverage` plugin\r\n\r\n2. Create remappings.txt with remappings from your libraries to whatever you want like: `uniswapv2-core/=lib/v2-core/contracts/`\r\n\r\n3. Apply a remapping function like this example in hardhat config preprocess:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction getRemappings() {\r\n    return fs\r\n        .readFileSync(\"remappings.txt\", \"utf8\")\r\n        .split(\"\\n\")\r\n        .filter(Boolean)\r\n        .map((line) => line.trim().split(\"=\"));\r\n}\r\n\r\n// In HardhatUserConfig\r\npreprocess: {\r\n  eachLine: (hre: any) => ({\r\n    transform: (line: string) => {\r\n      if (line.match(/^\\s*import /i)) {\r\n        getRemappings().forEach(([find, replace]) => {\r\n        if (line.match('\"' + find)) {\r\n            line = line.replace('\"' + find, '\"' + replace);\r\n        }\r\n        });\r\n      }\r\n      return line;\r\n    }\r\n  })\r\n}\r\n```\r\n4. Run `hardhat compile` (Should work fine)\r\n5. Run `hardhat coverage` (Fails)\n\n### Search terms\n\nsolidity-coverage preprocess config remapping",

    "body": "A couple of things here:\r\n\r\n- This seems to be a solidity-coverage and/or hardhat-preprocessor issue, but both of those plugins are community plugins. This issue tracker is used for Hardhat itself and our official plugins.\r\n- Are you using preprocessor to be able to use Hardhat with Foundry? If that's the case, take a look at [our guide](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/advanced/hardhat-and-foundry) on how to use both tools together.\r\n\r\nTentatively closing, I'll re-open if this turns out to be a problem in Hardhat itself, but seems unlikely.",
