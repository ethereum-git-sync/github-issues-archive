We have about 8 cases of the three error types listed  - none of which are telling us what is broken or how to fix it.

    "body": "> fvictorio\r\n\r\nThis bug is real **bad** my friend, I think I have wasted probably 8-10+ hours on this one bug because it occurred a number times, it happens every time the script issues a `revert CustomEvent(args)` which is a new feature of Solidity that causes hardhat to behave poorly.   This issue is two fold, on one had when this type of issue occurs the line number of the test is completely and totally lost - you just get a puzzling error message with no hope of being able to find what line caused it - which is why we are seeing people encounter this bug on StackOverflow - because hardhat is handing out errors that is confusing the user base.\r\n\r\nPart two is even worse.  So with part two of the bug,  supportEmit() in emits.ts disregards events emitted by revert() - for some reason it is treating these two types differently when one overrules the other.  If a supported emit doesn't hit - then it needs to return the last item in the log or the last error - saying \"The test didn't see the event you were looking for, instead the transaction was reverted with _____ this happened on line XXX\".  The unit log output is missing this mismatch - which I think is resolved by returning the very last item in the log in the error message.  Even if there isn't revert - saying \"We didn't get this emit, function returned with '0'\" - would be better than \"Yo shits fucked, idk where - deal with it.\"  which is the current error message.\r\n\r\nemits.ts isn't the only one that barfs when it is expecting one outcome and instead there is a revert, which  is a bug in hardhat that won't express its self if don't use this feature of the language.  If you are expecting something, and nothing else exists - but there is a `revert Anything()` then the unit test should report back that the contract is reverting and why.  Instead, the revert message is lost and we don't even get a line number of the test that is stuck - which gives every developer a really really big frown face :( ",

    "body": "@TheRook I'm not sure I'm following what you're saying. The original issue is about custom errors but you are then talking about `.to.emit`, which is related to events?\r\n\r\nAnyway, re-reading the original issue, I see at least one problem:\r\n\r\n```\r\n.to.be.revertedWith('InvalidSignature(\"0xfc39486c750a6cd425dc41cc85f043e3fe29634868b5be6a5ad2e22c470e21b1\")');\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's not the way to assert that a custom error was thrown. `.revertedWith` is for reverts with reason strings (that is, things like `require(false, \"my error string\")`). That's why the error message is telling you that it was expecting it to revert with a given reason string, but that it reverted with a custom error instead.\r\n\r\nAs explained [in the docs](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-chai-matchers/docs/reference#.revertedwithcustomerror), you have to use `.to.be.revertedWithCustomError` for custom errors.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the line numbers, I created this contract:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract Foo {\r\n  error MyCustomError(uint code);\r\n  error MyOtherCustomError(uint code);\r\n\r\n  function f() public {\r\n    revert MyCustomError(123);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand wrote this test:\r\n\r\n```js\r\ndescribe(\"Foo\", function () {\r\n  it(\"Should revert with custom error\", async function () {\r\n    const Foo = await ethers.getContractFactory(\"Foo\");\r\n    const foo = await Foo.deploy();\r\n\r\n    await expect(foo.f()).to.be.revertedWithCustomError(\r\n      foo,\r\n      \"MyCustomError\"\r\n    ).withArgs(123)\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe test passes correctly. If I change it to `.revertedWith(\"MyCustomError(123)\")`, which is similar to what you were doing, the test (correctly) fails, and I get the line number of the test. Again, in previous versions the line numbers were not working, but in the latest version they should work. You can update with `npm i @nomicfoundation/hardhat-chai-matchers@latest`\r\n\r\nI did uncover a couple of problems while looking into this. One is that when we say \"with a custom error\" we should include the selector of the custom error, because that could be useful. The other one is that we are not handling rejected promises correctly in some scenarios, but that it's unrelated to your problem. I'm going to create separate issues for those.",

    "body": "@fvictorio  The lack of line numbers is 1/2 of this, the other 1/2 is that you aren't reporting what event was emitted.  The final event in the log will be a success event, if you are expecting a failure then the engineer should know what the mistmatch is - it should say \"XXX Event was emitted instead\" or \"No event emitted\".\r\n\r\nAlso Jesus Christ, words cannot express how much time we have wasted trying to fix tests that don't have line numbers.  Idk what kind of projects you use this for - but we are pushing over 400 tests and its literally impossible to find out what is filling without adding print statements :(\r\n\r\nThese error messages are so bad, I dread using your software. I'm sorry but telling me you don't need to list the event mistmatch doesn't make me feel any better about hardhat. ",
