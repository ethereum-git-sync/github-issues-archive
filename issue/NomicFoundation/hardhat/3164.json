  "body": "The merge of #2581 is causing problems when using the Foundry project's scripting features (see for example: https://github.com/gakonst/ethers-rs/pull/1687). Meanwhile, the workaround of using an earlier hardhat version (e.g. 2.9.4) also doesn't work due to possibly related problems:\r\n\r\n```\r\neth_feeHistory\r\n\r\n  Remote node did not answer to eth_feeHistory correctly\r\n\r\neth_feeHistory\r\n\r\n  Errors encountered in param 0: Invalid value 10 supplied to : QUANTITY\r\n```\r\nI say \"possibly related\" because the discussion in #2581  and #2230 seem to reference how hardhat handles quantity values, and whether leading zeros etc should be allowed. The root cause of the https://github.com/gakonst/ethers-rs/pull/1687 incompatibility appears to be an incorrect spec referenced in #2230 (closed) that indicated a 64 digit hext string was required. I've provided details in #2581 as to why hardhat should probably accept variable length hex strings, as supported by the current open rpc spec (which says {0,64} ), and the go-ethereum implementation (which does not force a length either).\r\n\r\nI'm opening this new issue because the discussion in #2581 is on an already merged PR and #2230 is already closed. I've also reported to the ethereum open rpc spec project that {0,64} should probably be {1,64} in their spec. Based on the above further error with eth_feeHistory called from foundry's scripting feature, I'm concerned that QUANTITY handling in hardhat or foundry and/or in the specs may also be an issue.\r\n",
