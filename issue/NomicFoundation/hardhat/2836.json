Ideally we wouldn't install this package, is it possible to remove this from the output?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\nThank you for using Hardhat and taking the time to open an issue!\r\n\r\n**Note that this issue tracker is not a support channel.**\r\n\r\n- For help with Hardhat and Hardhat network, please use our [Discord server](https://hardhat.org/discord).\r\n- For help with ethers.js, please go to [its Github Discussions](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/discussions).\r\n\r\nIf you are reporting a bug, please include reproduction steps.
