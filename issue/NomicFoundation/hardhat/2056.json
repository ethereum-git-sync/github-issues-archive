  "body": "Hi There,\r\n\r\nI'm running into a `ProviderError` while doing a kovan deployment and struggling to understand what the detailed response is from the RPC node:\r\n\r\n- `verbose` logging does not currently report RPC requests\r\n- `yarn link` does not seem to work well with hardhat (see here: https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat/issues/1222). By linking `hardhat-core`, I'm running into an error `Cannot find module 'debug'`.\r\n\r\n**Potential solutions**\r\n\r\nThe ideal solution would be to enable a logging option for RPC requests especially in light of provider errors that are not easily interpretable.\r\n\r\nA workaround solution would be to document a workflow to use `hardhat` with `yarn link`.",
