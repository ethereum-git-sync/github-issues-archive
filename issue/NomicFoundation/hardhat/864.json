  "body": "It seems buidler is reading the solidity source from disk for a specific file multiple time, when this file is imported by other file. \r\nThis pose problem because for preprocessor as there is no easy way to transform such file,\r\n\r\nmy plugin [buidler-preprocessor](https://github.com/wighawag/buidler-preprocessor) use an override of TASK_COMPILE_GET_RESOLVED_SOURCES but this is not sufficient as import will fetch the source file again (see `resolver.resolveImport` in `dependencyGraph.ts` (https://github.com/nomiclabs/buidler/blob/27cc18e197067fad18fcb81b53dbaea7905b50a7/packages/buidler-core/src/internal/solidity/dependencyGraph.ts#L47) ), and this time the preprocessor has no chance of being executed (issue : https://github.com/wighawag/buidler-preprocessor/issues/4)\r\n\r\nCould you reuse the already resolved files so even when doing resolver.resolveImport it can first check the already resolvedFiles \r\nbut I guess this would not be sufficient as I might want to overwrite external import too\r\nI guess the best would be to provide a hook to transform the solcInput after all dependencies are resolved the preprocessor can act on it afterward\r\n",
