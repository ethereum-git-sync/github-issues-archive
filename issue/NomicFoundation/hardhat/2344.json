  "body": "### Problem\r\nI deployed by contract to the BSC Testnet at https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/0x7D89a828Cac36DD57fa2aA5F08D11BF7877B66b1#code. I took a break; which is possibly relevant because I don't know how fast Etherscan matches a contract to a compiler. The I ran `npx hardhat verify --network bsctestnet 0x7D89a828Cac36DD57fa2aA5F08D11BF7877B66b1` but received the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nError in plugin @nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan: The contract you want to verify was compiled with solidity 0.8.2, but your configured compiler version is: 0.8.4.\r\n\r\nPossible causes are:\r\n  - You are not in the same commit that was used to deploy the contract.\r\n  - Wrong compiler version selected in hardhat config.\r\n  - The given address is wrong.\r\n  - The selected network (bsctestnet) is wrong.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nI don't believe any of the possible causes listed are to blame. I believe that either **Etherscan** or the **@nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan** are treating the Solidity version of Etherscan's \"Similar Match Source Code\" as the actual version.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2271599/152797800-77dbf822-2219-444a-98dc-81c26ecced3e.png)\r\n\r\nI ran the command again with `--show-stack-traces`, here's the stack trace that was added:\r\n```\r\n    at SimpleTaskDefinition.verifySubtask [as action] (C:\\REDACTED\\node_modules\\@nomiclabs\\hardhat-etherscan\\src\\index.ts:230:11)\r\n    at processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:96:5)\r\n    at async Environment._runTaskDefinition (C:\\REDACTED\\node_modules\\hardhat\\src\\internal\\core\\runtime-environment.ts:217:14)\r\n    at async Environment.run (C:\\REDACTED\\node_modules\\hardhat\\src\\internal\\core\\runtime-environment.ts:129:14)\r\n    at async Environment._runTaskDefinition (C:\\REDACTED\\node_modules\\hardhat\\src\\internal\\core\\runtime-environment.ts:217:14)\r\n    at async Environment.run (C:\\REDACTED\\node_modules\\hardhat\\src\\internal\\core\\runtime-environment.ts:129:14)\r\n    at async main (C:\\REDACTED\\node_modules\\hardhat\\src\\internal\\cli\\cli.ts:200:5)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's an excerpt of my yarn.lock file showing the version of hardhat-etherscan I'm using:\r\n```yml\r\n\"@nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan@^3.0.0\":\r\n  version \"3.0.0\"\r\n  resolved \"https://registry.yarnpkg.com/@nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan/-/hardhat-etherscan-3.0.0.tgz#06e0d59787f01f1296d829e8d43fece50e7ffff1\"\r\n  integrity sha512-E5s35dCHmzuY6pFqlgTdDGQr2xIyUJ3f91m6e7HYlPGz0FGzad9Nem/y0L7L3FHG4LPYg1UObkQVUzqBjtyAOA==\r\n  dependencies:\r\n    \"@ethersproject/abi\" \"^5.1.2\"\r\n    \"@ethersproject/address\" \"^5.0.2\"\r\n    cbor \"^5.0.2\"\r\n    debug \"^4.1.1\"\r\n    fs-extra \"^7.0.1\"\r\n    node-fetch \"^2.6.0\"\r\n    semver \"^6.3.0\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Question\r\nIs there any way for me to force the upload of my source code?\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Hey @benrobot, I think what happened here is that `0x7D89a828Cac36DD57fa2aA5F08D11BF7877B66b1` is the address of the proxy. What you probably want is to verify the implementation contract.\r\n\r\nAre you using the OpenZeppelin Upgrades plugin? If so, you can get the address of the implementation with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconsole.log(await upgrades.erc1967.getImplementationAddress(proxyAddress));\r\n```\r\n\r\nCheck [their guide](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/how-to-verify-a-contract-on-etherscan-bscscan-polygonscan/14225#upgradeable-contracts-and-proxies-11) to learn more.",
