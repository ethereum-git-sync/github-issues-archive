The best way to do this is to include a [Minimal Reproducible Example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example). If you can't do that, then include a link to your repo, and the steps to reproduce the problem. The easiest it is to reproduce your problem, the faster we are going to be able to fix it.\r\n\r\nIf you are submitting a feature request, please take the time to clearly describe your use case, and not only your proposed solution.\r\n\r\nThis issue will be automatically assigned to a Hardhat team member. This person will act as the point of contact between you and the team, but won't necessarily fix it nor address it in any way. An issue being assigned does not mean that it's being worked on.\r\n\r\n-->\r\nIMPORTANT FEATURE REQUEST: \r\nThere is currently no way of defining remappings either from hardhat.config.ts or from a remappings.txt or from env vars even tho the solc compiler does accept remappings. Ofc, it is fine for Openzeppelin contracts and big and well known ones, but then when you need to install your own or a not so well known library, then it wouldn't work.\r\nIn my case, I'd like to be able to import .sol files from the root folder of the project or from the contract folder of the project or maybe even from subfolders like a libraries directory. Ex: \"@libraries/\" instead of \"../../../../libraries\". The first way of defining path using \"@library\" is not only a lot cleaner but also more maintainable as if you moved your libraries directory or add it to a new project, all you'd need to do is change the remappings where as the second method would require you change every single path for every single time it was imported. It only make sense to use relative imports for files in the same \"submodules\" or unit that will stay together.\r\n\r\nadding this feature imo would be pretty trivial since SOLC compiler supports remappings already https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.7/using-the-compiler.html#base-path-and-import-remapping\r\nAll there would be needed is an additional config object or array for path remappings and to give that information to the compiler.\r\n\r\nDapptools and foundry both supports path remappings.\r\n\r\nThanks.",
