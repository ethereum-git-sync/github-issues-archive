This will mean adding several `eslint-disable no-console`, but that's probably fine.\r\n\r\nThe alternative is to have a single module that we use for printing stuff to the console, and only that file would have the rule disabled. That way we can add temporary `console.log`s statements for debugging purposes and use this module for \"real\" logs.\r\n\r\nI prefer the second approach, even if it's a somewhat bigger change.",

    "body": "Hi @jrocca82, sure, feel free to give it a try.\r\n\r\nI think this is what I would do:\r\n\r\n1. Add the `no-console` rule to `hardhat-core/.eslintrc.js`\r\n2. Create a `src/internal/util/logger.ts` file that exports a `log`, `warn`, etc. functions. These are just pass-through functions that call `console.log`, `console.warn`, etc.\r\n3. Fix all the new linter errors by doing `import * as logger from \".../util/logger.ts\"` and using `logger.log` instead of `console.log`\r\n\r\nJust doing it in `hardhat-core` is enough for now. We can do it in the other packages in a separate PR. I would actually wait until #3531 is done to do that, so that the logger can be shared and it's easy to import.",
