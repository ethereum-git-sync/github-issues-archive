  "body": "I have a feeling this is going to be a relatively niche issue, sorry in advance for that! Optimism's hardhat plugin makes use of a custom ethereumjs-vm fork that gets injected into hardhat and replaces the nomiclabs/ethereumjs-vm instance. It's a bit of a hack but it's worked surprisingly well. \r\n\r\nA few days ago we started seeing issues with hardhat tooling. @bobface did a great analysis and pinned it down to this change from about a week ago: https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat/blob/3be60c05dc7bd7c37da3a38ba64c62e75fade831/packages/hardhat-core/src/internal/hardhat-network/provider/node.ts#L1166-L1168\r\n\r\nThe custom ethereumjs-vm instance we used is throwing `VmError` errors, but technically isn't throwing hardhat's `VmError` errors. So the instanceof check fails and the `VmError` is thrown as an internal error (which ends up breaking everything down the line). \r\n\r\nWould it be possible to replace this check with a slightly weaker that accepts anything that looks like a `VmError`?",
