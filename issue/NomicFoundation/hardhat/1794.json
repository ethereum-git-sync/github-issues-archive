  "body": "Reproducing this is pretty easy:\r\n\r\n1. Create a hardhat project\r\n2. `hh console`\r\n3. Reset the network with an invalid URL, e.g.: `await network.provider.send(\"hardhat_reset\", [{ forking: { jsonRpcUrl: \"https://www.example.com\" } }])`\r\n4. Try to reset it to a non-forked state or to a valid URL: `await network.provider.send(\"hardhat_reset\", [])`\r\n\r\nThe last step won't work. The reason is a bit subtle. When you reset the network, the `node` is set to `undefined`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat/blob/854a149835ed0763bb7396189f299fd094409f61/packages/hardhat-core/src/internal/hardhat-network/provider/provider.ts#L321\r\n\r\nThen when `_init` is called, the provider will try to create a node:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat/blob/854a149835ed0763bb7396189f299fd094409f61/packages/hardhat-core/src/internal/hardhat-network/provider/provider.ts#L232\r\n\r\nBut this will fail, because the node creation (when forking) implies sending some transactions (for example, to get the nonces of the initial accounts). So the `_init` will fail.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that, if you then send a `hardhat_reset` call to fix this, **the init method will be called first because the node is undefined**. And since the `this._forkConfig` is still invalid, the node creation will fail again.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI'm not really sure what the right solution is. The first things that come to mind is that `_reset` should catch any error thrown by `_init` and restore the `this._forkConfig` value to the one it had before. This isn't perfect though: if the URL _in your config_ is wrong, then the same problem will happen. This is a more edge case, but it suggests that there is a design issue here.\r\n\r\nFor the record, I don't think any user has reported this, so this is a low-priority issue.",

I haven't quite isolated the cause but I have observed that calling `hardhat_reset` with an RPC that is down (which happens quite often) might render the hardhat node unusable and will require the node to be restarted. \r\n\r\nFor my purposes, I would like to be able to catch if there are any errors with `hardhat_reset` and try giving it a different provider but am unable for the reason above.",
