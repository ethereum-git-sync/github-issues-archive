  "body": "It would be useful to provide a shorthand for the common pattern of defining an `async function main` in a Buidler script which is then run with proper error handling.\r\n\r\nThis could be implemented by allowing the user to export an async function from their script.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nmodule.exports = async function main () {\r\n  ...\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead of running the script directly, Buidler can fork to a wrapper module that requires the user's script and if there is an exported function runs it with error handling.\r\n\r\nA downside of this approach is that such a script wouldn't be standalone, although this would be opt in since the code runs anyway and if there is no exported function Buidler would not complain.",
