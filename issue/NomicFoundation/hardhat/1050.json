    "body": "Put a little bounty on this. What I'm looking for:\r\n- Flattened files should only have ONE SPDX header. It could take the one from the main file OR optionally make this a config option. I like to keep the others as sometimes you're dealing with different licenses across files, so I rename the header to \"License-Identifier: \" (just remove the SPDX)\r\n- Consolidate pragmas. Multiple \"pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;\" declarations cause issues.\r\n- Have a way to specify the output file(s). Currently I pipe it to a file but have to manually remove stuff from the top and bottom.\r\nThis should make it possible to automatically generate flattened files.",

Also, I prefer to rename the headers instead of removing them, because I deal with projects where different files have different licenses. So since you already have done part of the work, if you also do renaming of license headers, removal of duplicate pragmas and either make the output non verbose or add ability to specify an output file (I keep having to remove lines from the top and bottom of the output), then I'm happy to pay out the bounty.

    "body": "@boringcrypto the renaming requirement (and maybe even the removal of abi encoder) feel like they might be too much for hardhat core. The removal of licenses and the setting of a single license are pretty generic, so they seem fine to me, but maybe we should stop at that point. Any other thing you need can be accomplished simply by overriding a task:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nsubtask(TASK_FLATTEN_GET_FLATTENED_SOURCE, async (hre, args, runSuper) => {\r\n  const flattened = await runSuper()\r\n  \r\n  // do extra changes to flattened output\r\n\r\n  return flattened\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nSorry for being a PITA. I know that adding extra flags that do more stuff is easy and it seems like a thing you can do for free, but it increases the codebase (and therefore the complexity of the project, and the likelihood of bugs) and it makes it harder to document.",

    "body": "I don't feel any of these should even be options. The function is called 'flatten', but the default behavior doesn't create a flattened version that compiles. So removing (or renaming) SPDX-License-Identifiers should be default behavior in my mind. And taking the SPDX of the main file and putting that at the top of the file. Removing compilation breaking pragmas should just be default. Who would NOT want this? So the only flag I envision is setting a new SPDX.\r\n\r\nWhat is the use-case in which you want to create a file that you can't use?\r\n\r\nIf this functionality is too complex for core, then flatten shouldn't be in core at all in my mind. Make it into an extra package if you need to. But it would be great if using flatten would do as the name implies... take multiple solidity files and create a flattened version.\r\n\r\nThe primary use of flattened versions I see is to deploy from flattened versions instead of multi-file. Makes things look a lot better in Etherscan.\r\n\r\nIf it is it's own package, you could later extend it with cool features like tree-shaking, so you only get code that's actually used. I often do this manually now before final deployments.",

This is what your PR does (with optional flags), and I think it looks pretty good. FWIW, I was already on the fence about adding that feature, but I'm inclined to think it can be merged.\r\n- Adding support for merging duplicated pragmas, etc. This is where _I think_ we might be crossing a line. I understand the argument that non-compilable flattened files are useless; I think it's a strong point. But I don't think we want to add that level of complexity to core, at least right now. I believe that \"the flatten task in core is pretty simple and straightforward, and if you want something more advanced you can use this third-party plugin\" is the approach that would work for us the best.",
