  "body": "Non-view functions that return a value don't expose that returned value in the JSON-RPC layer. The typical example is the ERC20 methods, which return a `success` value.\r\n\r\nRight now the only way to obtain that value is using `debug_traceTransaction`. While this works, it's also something many users are not aware of. Besides that, it also means decoding the return data yourself. So, some ideas:\r\n\r\n- Add a new network helper to get the return value of a tx.\r\n- Add a new chai matcher to assert that a given (write) tx returns some value.\r\n\r\nOf course, we can do both.\r\n\r\nThe main issue to figure out is how to decode the return data. In the case of the chai matcher, we could use the expected value as an implicit type: if the user does `expect(tx).to.return(true)` we know it's a boolean. But there are a lot of edge cases here.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the network helper, we either have explicit methods for each type and/or a generic one (maybe leveraging `parseAbi`?).",
