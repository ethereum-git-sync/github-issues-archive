  "body": "Hardhat currently has 316 transitive dependencies, spread across 14 different licenses and ~300 authors.  Not only does this make it a pain to work with since you need to fetch all of that and resolve all of those dependencies, it also increase security risks for users in the form of toolchain injection attacks.\r\n\r\nYou can visualize the full tree here: http://npm.anvaka.com/#/view/2d/hardhat\r\n\r\nThere are a relatively small number of culprits that bring in the majority of the cruft.  Some of them you probably can't get rid of but you may be able to apply pressure on getting them to get their dependency counts down.  Others I suspect can be dropped and yet others can be replaced with low dependency solutions.\r\n\r\nAs an example (not trying to shill, do your own research), `ethereum-cryptography` brings in a huge amount of transitive dependencies while `@zoltu/ethereum-crypto` has 0 dependencies.  This is just an example that often by just being a bit more careful about what you select you can solve the same problem with way fewer dependencies.",

The chart you linked really makes me feel uneasy.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this is not something we'll have the bandwidth to tackle in the next couple of months, as keeping up the upcoming hardforks and Solidity changes doesn't leave us a lot of extra time. That being said, we really want to improve on this when we have enough time.",
