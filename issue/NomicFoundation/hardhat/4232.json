  "body": "### Describe the feature\r\n\r\nSolc defaults the `evmVersion` parameter to shanghai since version 0.8.20. The main issue caused by this is that the compiler emits PUSH0 as an opcode. This opcode is supported on Ethereum L1 but as far as I know it hasn't been adopted on any other chain so far (except perhaps Gnosis Chain?). Most notably, it hasn't been adopted by L2s. On all these other chains, the PUSH0 opcode will be seen as an invalid opcode and cause the code to revert.\r\n\r\nHardhat relies on the solc default for `evmVersion`. Foundry, for reference, [defaults to paris](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/e05b9c75b4501d5880764948b61db787f3dd7fe0/config/src/lib.rs#L1732).\r\n\r\nThere is some knowledge about the potential issues caused by using shanghai, but I wouldn't count on it being widely known. At some point we will need to face EVM differences across chains and layers, and setting the default to paris simply delays this. However, setting the default to shanghai at this moment seems premature and is just asking for someone to deploy a broken contract to production.\r\n\r\nI suggest to set the default evmVersion to paris if the compiler version is >=0.8.20 and the user hasn't configured it themselves.\r\n\r\n### Search terms\r\n\r\nevmVersion paris shanghai push0",
