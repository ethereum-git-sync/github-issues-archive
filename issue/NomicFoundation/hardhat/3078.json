  "body": "Hi!\r\n\r\nIn commit 13b5cd2f19dd0ca69f89b2d04eb7d00e9c45898d, the validator for the slot param in `getStorageAt` was changed from `rpcQuantity` to `rpcStorageSlot`. The main difference is that the first disallows hex 0 padding and the second requires it.\r\n\r\nHowever, the `setStorageAt` method continues to use `rpcQuantity` for this field: https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/blob/f23d106048c2cd5d98bcb3e11596afbcb085afa8/packages/hardhat-core/src/internal/hardhat-network/provider/modules/hardhat.ts#L309\r\n\r\nThis means that a user who is reading from and writing to a slot has to make sure to pad zeros when reading and strip zeros when writing, which seems inconsistent and is generally a pain.\r\n\r\nShouldn't `setStorageAt` be changed to use the `rpcStorageSlot` validation on its slot parameter, for consistency with `getStorageAt`?",

This makes sense to me, although in this case I'd rather have a more permissive type that doesn't care if there are or there aren't leading zeros.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this is that `hardhat_setStorage` is not a standard method, so we don't have to follow the [spec](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis). What do you think?\r\n\r\nBtw, have you checked out our [network helpers](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network-helpers/docs/overview)? They abstract you from these kind of issues.",

I can confirm replacing my `setStorageAt` function below with the version from `@nomicfoundation/hardhat-network-helpers` resolved the problem.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport const setStorageAt = async (address: string, index: string, value: string): Promise<void> => {\r\n    const { ethers } = await import(\"hardhat\")\r\n\r\n    await ethers.provider.send(\"hardhat_setStorageAt\", [address, index, value])\r\n    await ethers.provider.send(\"evm_mine\", []) // Just mines to the next block\r\n}```",
