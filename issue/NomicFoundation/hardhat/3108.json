The test is designed to pass (`test/arb-tests/ozel-index.js`) without the `console.log()`.\r\n\r\nI'm not really sure -without any ts knowledge- how to build a minimal reproducible example since it's only one test that does 18 txs, and the bug can come in tx Num 4 or 11 or 14 or not come at all.\r\n\r\nIt's an on/off behavior that doesn't happen all the time, so I'm doubting of having a piece of code -from my end- that could always reproduce it. If you tried it out using my repo and the test succeeded (meaning, the issue wasn't thrown), try running it several times to see if you catch the doggy behavior.\r\n\r\nI'm currently finishing up with the development of a part of the larger project. Once I finish it, I'll try to bring a minimum example.  ",
