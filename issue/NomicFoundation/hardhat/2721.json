The best way to do this is to include a [Minimal Reproducible Example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example). If you can't do that, then include a link to your repo, and the steps to reproduce the problem. The easiest it is to reproduce your problem, the faster we are going to be able to fix it.\r\n\r\nIf you are submitting a feature request, please take the time to clearly describe your use case, and not only your proposed solution.\r\n\r\nThis issue will be automatically assigned to a Hardhat team member. This person will act as the point of contact between you and the team, but won't necessarily fix it nor address it in any way. An issue being assigned does not mean that it's being worked on.\r\n\r\n-->\r\nThis issue is regarding `console.sol` found at `packages/hardhat-core/console.sol`\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce\r\n1. Create or find an existing smart contract which you can run on a Hardhat network.\r\n2. Add a `console.log()` anywhere in the contract.\r\n3. Deploy your contract and call the function in which you added your blank log.\r\n\r\nExpected: You see nothing (or a new line)\r\nActual: You see the word undefined being printed to your screen\r\n\r\n\r\nOften to keep my JS logs organized, I will put a blank `console.log()` to create a new line in my terminal. However, doing so in Solidity code will result in `undefined` being printed to the screen. Below is a proposed solution that I have tested and found to work. I'll be creating a PR for this as well.\r\n\r\nIn `packages/hardhat-core/console.sol` on line 17\r\n\r\nReplace `_sendLogPayload(abi.encodeWithSignature(\"log()\"));` with `_sendLogPayload(abi.encodeWithSignature(\"log(string)\", \"\"));`\r\n",
