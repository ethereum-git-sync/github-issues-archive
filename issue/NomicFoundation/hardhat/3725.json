Plugin authors often impose the arbitrary restriction that these identifiers be formatted as fully qualified names, simply because it isn't obvious how to infer a fully qualified name from a non-fully-qualified name.\r\n\r\n[Here](https://github.com/frangio/hardhat-linearization/pull/1) is a PR I've opened to add support for non-fully-qualified names to a plugin.  I've managed to use the `readArtifact` function to generate the fully qualified name, but this approach requires more overhead (and an `await`) which would not be needed if the above private function were exposed publicly.\n\n### Search terms\n\nfully qualified name",
