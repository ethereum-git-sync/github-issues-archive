  "body": "I help maintain [solidity-coverage](https://github.com/sc-forks/solidity-coverage) and we are contemplating a substantial [rewrite](https://github.com/sc-forks/solidity-coverage/issues/346) over the next couple of months. I'd like to make the new version available as a buidler plugin (multi-platform accessibility is a [long-standing issue](https://github.com/sc-forks/solidity-coverage/issues/216) at SC), but I'd also like to export its sub-components in an `index.js` so people can write:\r\n```javascript\r\nconst coverage = require(\"solidity-coverage\");\r\n```\r\nand do whatever they want with those pieces. Additionally it might be easiest if we didn't have to maintain different modules for each development platform we integrate with. \r\n\r\nBuidler loads plugins from their package `main` \r\n```\r\n\"main\": \"dist/src/index.js\",\r\n```\r\n\r\nWould you be open to allowing plugins to declare something like a 'buidler' field in their package.json as an alternative to `main`? \r\n\r\n",
