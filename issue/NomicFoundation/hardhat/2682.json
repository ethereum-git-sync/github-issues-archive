    "body": "Hi @choigawoon. I think the best way for you to accomplish this is to use some proxy that adds support for https. For example, searching for \"https localhost proxy\" suggests [this package](https://github.com/cameronhunter/local-ssl-proxy). I haven't tried it though, but that's the kind of thing that you should probably use.\r\n\r\nI'm closing this because it's unlikely that we'll be able to work on this, at least not in the short/middle term.",
