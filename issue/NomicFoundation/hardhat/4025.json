You can still use Hardhat, but some features, like stack traces, might not work correctly.\r\n\r\nLearn more at https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/reference/solidity-support\r\n\r\nWarning: Contract code size is 27806 bytes and exceeds 24576 bytes (a limit introduced in Spurious Dragon). This contract may not be deployable on Mainnet. Consider enabling the optimizer (with a low \"runs\" value!), turning off revert strings, or using libraries.\r\n   --> contracts/core/Vault.sol:144:1:\r\n    |\r\n144 | contract Vault is ReentrancyGuard, IVault {\r\n    | ^ (Relevant source part starts here and spans across multiple lines).\r\n\r\n\r\nGenerating typings for: 6 artifacts in dir: typechain-types for target: ethers-v5\r\nSuccessfully generated 370 typings!\r\nCompiled 3 Solidity files successfully\r\n```\r\nI added hardhat-contract-sizer and the output for the contract in question is\r\n```\r\n |  Vault                 ·                   22.363  ·         0.000  │\r\n```\r\nwhich is perfectly fine and under the 24576 bytes limit. And deployment is working at least for the testnets\r\n\r\nI suspect there is a place where config override is ignored since my config defines a override for this specific contract\r\n```\r\nsolidity: {\r\n\t\tcompilers: [\r\n\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\tversion: \"0.8.20\",\r\n\t\t\t\tsettings:\r\n\t\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\t\toptimizer:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenabled: true,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\truns: 500000\r\n\t\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\tversion: \"0.6.12\",\r\n\t\t\t\tsettings:\r\n\t\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\t\toptimizer:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenabled: true,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\truns: 10\r\n\t\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t],\r\n\t\toverrides: {\r\n\t\t\t\"contracts/core/Vault.sol\": {\r\n\t\t\t\tversion: \"0.8.20\",\r\n\t\t\t\tsettings:\r\n\t\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\t\toptimizer:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenabled: true,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\truns: 200\r\n\t\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}\r\n```\r\nI came to this conclusion since since the values are identical if I remove the override setting or change the runs value to 500000\r\n\r\n### Minimal reproduction steps\r\n\r\n1) Create a contract with a high runs value that exceeds the contract size limit\r\n2) Make sure the contract size is lower than the size limit with a lower runs value\r\n3) create a configuration with the high runs value as default and the lower runs setting as override\r\n4) run hardhat compile\r\n5) optional check contract sizes with hardhat-contract-sizer plugin\r\n\r\n### Search terms\r\n\r\ncompile size limit warning",

    "body": "Ok, this is a minimal reproduction of this problem.\r\n\r\nFirst create two contracts: `Foo.sol` and `Bar.sol`:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n// Foo.sol\r\n\r\nimport \"./Bar.sol\";\r\n\r\ncontract Foo {\r\n  Bar public bar;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n// Bar.sol\r\n\r\ncontract Bar {\r\n  string s = \"\";\r\n\r\n  function f1() public {\r\n    s = \"asdf\";\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  function f2() public {\r\n    s = \"asdf\";\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  // ...297 functions more like this...\r\n\r\n  function f300() public {\r\n    s = \"asdf\";\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are three compilation scenarios here (I used solc v0.8.17 here):\r\n\r\n1. If you compile the project with the optimizer disabled, you'll get the contract code size warning. This is correct.\r\n2. If you compile the project with the optimizer enabled, you won't get the warning. This is also correct.\r\n3. If you compile the project with the optimizer disabled BUT use an override to enable the optimizer for `Bar.sol`, you'll get the warning.\r\n\r\nThe reason scenario 3 happens is because there are two compilation jobs being executed here:\r\n\r\n- First, both `Foo.sol` and `Bar.sol` are compiled together, with the optimizer disabled. This generated the warning, but the result of this compilation is only used to generate the bytecode for `Foo`, so the warning is misleading.\r\n- Then, `Bar.sol` is compiled on its own, with the optimizer enabled, and the resulting bytecode is used for `Bar`\r\n\r\nThe fix here is something that we actually considered doing once: only include the relevant contracts in the `outputSelection` entry of the compilation input. We didn't end up doing it because the performance gains didn't seem worth it, but this issue might be a good reason to do it anyway.",
