You can still use Hardhat, but some features, like stack traces, might not work correctly.\r\n\r\nLearn more at https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/reference/solidity-support\r\n\r\nWarning: Contract code size is 27806 bytes and exceeds 24576 bytes (a limit introduced in Spurious Dragon). This contract may not be deployable on Mainnet. Consider enabling the optimizer (with a low \"runs\" value!), turning off revert strings, or using libraries.\r\n   --> contracts/core/Vault.sol:144:1:\r\n    |\r\n144 | contract Vault is ReentrancyGuard, IVault {\r\n    | ^ (Relevant source part starts here and spans across multiple lines).\r\n\r\n\r\nGenerating typings for: 6 artifacts in dir: typechain-types for target: ethers-v5\r\nSuccessfully generated 370 typings!\r\nCompiled 3 Solidity files successfully\r\n```\r\nI added hardhat-contract-sizer and the output for the contract in question is\r\n```\r\n |  Vault                 ·                   22.363  ·         0.000  │\r\n```\r\nwhich is perfectly fine and under the 24576 bytes limit. And deployment is working at least for the testnets\r\n\r\nI suspect there is a place where config override is ignored since my config defines a override for this specific contract\r\n```\r\nsolidity: {\r\n\t\tcompilers: [\r\n\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\tversion: \"0.8.20\",\r\n\t\t\t\tsettings:\r\n\t\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\t\toptimizer:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenabled: true,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\truns: 500000\r\n\t\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\tversion: \"0.6.12\",\r\n\t\t\t\tsettings:\r\n\t\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\t\toptimizer:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenabled: true,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\truns: 10\r\n\t\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t],\r\n\t\toverrides: {\r\n\t\t\t\"contracts/core/Vault.sol\": {\r\n\t\t\t\tversion: \"0.8.20\",\r\n\t\t\t\tsettings:\r\n\t\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\t\toptimizer:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenabled: true,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\truns: 200\r\n\t\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}\r\n```\r\nI came to this conclusion since since the values are identical if I remove the override setting or change the runs value to 500000\n\n### Minimal reproduction steps\n\n1) Create a contract with a high runs value that exceeds the contract size limit\r\n2) Make sure the contract size is lower than the size limit with a lower runs value\r\n3) create a configuration with the high runs value as default and the lower runs setting as override\r\n4) run hardhat compile\r\n5) optional check contract sizes with hardhat-contract-sizer plugin\n\n### Search terms\n\ncompile size limit warning",
