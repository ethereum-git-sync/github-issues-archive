  "body": "Sometimes, after `hardhat-deploy` deploys the contracts, one of my `deploy` task is `verification`. so `hardhat-deploy` after deploying all contract runs `verify.ts` file which contains this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport { TASK_ETHERSCAN_VERIFY } from 'hardhat-deploy'\r\nconst func: DeployFunction = async function (hre: HardhatRuntimeEnvironment) {\r\n\r\n    await delay(30000);\r\n    await run(TASK_ETHERSCAN_VERIFY, {\r\n      apiKey: process.env.ETHERSCAN_KEY,\r\n      license: 'GPL-3.0',\r\n      solcInput: true,\r\n    })\r\n\r\n})\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, i wait 30 seconds , because without it, almost 80% of the time, it produces the error. Now, with 30 seconds, sometimes, I still get an error like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncontract ContractName failed to submit  : \"NOTOK\" [Object Object]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter this error, if you wait for some time, like 2-3 minutes and try running it again, then it works. sometimes it doesn't even after 2 minutes and works after 5 minutes.  This is a huge problem if I want this process to have on CI/CD without my interaction. I want to deploy contracts on rinkeby via CI/CD and verification should happen automatically too.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Problem:** `failed to submit  : \"NOTOK\" [Object Object]` I couldn't see where this error gets printed in the source of hardhat or hardhat-etherscan. Any idea ? `Object Object` might include some kind of text message to explain what the problem is.\r\n\r\none workaround I might see is  to have a chance to change the code so that it includes try/catch such as this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntry {\r\n    await delay(30000);\r\n    await run(TASK_ETHERSCAN_VERIFY, {\r\n      apiKey: process.env.ETHERSCAN_KEY,\r\n      license: 'GPL-3.0',\r\n      solcInput: true,\r\n    })\r\n  }catch(err){\r\n    console.log(err, ' Testing')\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would bring a possibility that in the catch block, I would call the verification again and again and again. but `catch` never gets executed.
