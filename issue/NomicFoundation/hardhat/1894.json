  "body": "If a user creates ethers providers (ex. connected to the mainnet) rather than specifying networks in hardhat configs wrong `gasLimit` is used. \r\n\r\n## Repro:\r\n0. Have no networks configured in hardhat config.\r\n1. Call `getContractAt` with provider connected to mainnet.\r\n2. Sending any tx using returned contract will have super high `gasLimit`. This happens because HH will assume that it's connected to local devnet and will execute this [`addGasToAbiMethodsIfNecessary`](https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat/blob/master/packages/hardhat-ethers/src/internal/helpers.ts#L310).\r\n\r\nMore context: https://twitter.com/krzKaczor/status/1440293100082008064\r\n\r\n## Solution:\r\n\r\nIf a network id from the provider doesn't match the one from the network config do not add gas to ABI methods. \r\n\r\nI can work on a fix if you agree that this is the right solution.
