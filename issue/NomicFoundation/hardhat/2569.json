    "body": "If this happens during the `removeObsoleteArtifacts` phase, it means the artifact in the `cache` folder exists, but doesn't exist in `artifacts`. This is somewhat a rare case, as two conditions must be matched: \r\n-  the `artifacts` folder was removed manually or in some clean-up process, but the `cache` folder wasn't. \r\n-  some changes to the codebase must be made to remove some Contract dependency so that it is not emitted to the artifacts folder. \r\n\r\nSo after the compilation, `Hardhat` tries to clean the obsolete artifacts, that it finds in `cache` folder, but throws the error as it is not found in `artifacts`. \r\n\r\nThe **workaround**: make sure the `cache` folder is removed during the cleanup\r\n\r\n**Desired** Hardhat **fix**: if the artifact can't be found in `removeObsoleteArtifacts` method, it should be silently skipped, as it was already successfully removed previously.",
