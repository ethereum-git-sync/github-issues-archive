  "body": "Some 3rd party libraries are not distributed via `npm install ...`. It can be difficult to install these in a way that `npx buidler compile` can find them.\r\n\r\nAn example is `ds-math` from https://github.com/dapphub/ds-math (this is the Maker project's safe math library). The library consists of a single solidity file, `math.sol`, which is easy enough to just copy into the `contracts` directory as expected by Buidler. But it would preferable to refer to the file in its library location, using a solidity import along these lines:\r\n\r\n```import \"ds-math/math.sol\";```\r\n\r\nThe recommended installation method of ds-math is to clone the git repository, or include it as a submodule in your own git project. Either way, the advice is to add a path mapping to the `solc` compiler command, something like `ds-math=lib/ds-math/src`.\r\n\r\nI may be overlooking a good way to handle this sort of import in Buidler.\r\n",
