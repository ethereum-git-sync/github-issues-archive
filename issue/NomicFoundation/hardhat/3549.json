  "body": "### Describe the feature\r\n\r\nWhen initializing a hardhat project (with `hardhat` command) using pnpm, `hardhat` will still try to use `npm` to install dependencies which may be considered an issue.\r\n\r\nBesides, `pnpm` by default wouldn't install peer dependencies unless `auto-install-peers` is [configured](https://pnpm.io/npmrc#auto-install-peers). It would be better if `hardhat` could prompt to help add those dependencies for the user if `auto-install-peers` is not enabled.\r\n\r\nWe may also need to update the docs showing how to use `pnpm` to create a hardhat project.\r\n",

    "body": "Thanks for opening this @Hopsken. Do you mind if we make this issue explicitly about installing dependencies with pnpm during project creation? We can open a separate issue for a pnpm guide, although I'm not sure how much content that would have.\r\n\r\nWith respect to using pnpm during the project creation, I think it should be fairly easy to do? I'll leave some notes in case you or someone else wants to give it a try.\r\n\r\nWe should add a `isPnpmProject` function similar to this one:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/blob/4d7f911a53fdde847b67a6024a8ebd896278e58a/packages/hardhat-core/src/internal/cli/project-creation.ts#L429-L431\r\n\r\nAnd then use it here to generate the right params:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/blob/4d7f911a53fdde847b67a6024a8ebd896278e58a/packages/hardhat-core/src/internal/cli/project-creation.ts#L487-L500\r\n\r\nThis part of the code is not very testable, so we usually do it manually. There are some tips about testing local changes [here](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#developing-locally).",
