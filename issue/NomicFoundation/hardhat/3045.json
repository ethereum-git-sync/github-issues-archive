  "body": "There are many reasons to support this, even if it's not consensus-valid. See for example the discussion in #2504.\r\n\r\nThe way we'll approach this is by adding a new option in the Hardhat network configuration (name TBD) that defaults to false to preserve the current behavior. When this option is enabled:\r\n\r\n- Two (or more) blocks mined within the same second will have the same timestamp. That is, we won't add 1 second to generate a different timestamp.\r\n- Some JSON-RPC methods will behave differently: `hardhat_mine` will accept an interval of 0, `evm_setNextBlockTimestamp` will accept the same timestamp as the one from the current block, etc.\r\n- We might need to revisit our assertions in the Network Helpers. We should stop validating timestamp-related things (assuming we are doing it) and just let the hardhat errors bubble up if something fails. We could also capture them and show a different error message, but if there is a better error message that should be done in the hardhat network, not in the helpers.",
