  "body": "### Version of Hardhat\r\n\r\n2.14.0\r\n\r\n### What happened?\r\n\r\nI hope to import everything from `@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox`, except I need to override the matchers using `@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle`. So when I do this:\r\n```\r\nimport '@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox';\r\nimport '@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle';\r\n```\r\nI got `Error: You are using both @nomicfoundation/hardhat-chai-matchers and @nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle. They don't work correctly together, so please make sure you only use one.`\r\n\r\nCan we make this a warning instead of error? Otherwise what's the best way to override matcher when using `hardhat-toolbox`? The only way I can think of now is to copy paste everything from `hardhat-toolbox` and change the matcher, but that doesn't sound like a clean solution\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Minimal reproduction steps\r\n\r\nput this in `hardhat.config.ts`\r\n```\r\nimport '@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox';\r\nimport '@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle';\r\n```\r\n\r\nand run hardhat command\r\n\r\n\r\n### Search terms\r\n\r\n_No response_",
