    "body": "> Is it possible to make this flag configurable in hardhat.config.ts?\r\n\r\nSadly, that's not possible right now. I'll try to explain why.\r\n\r\nWhen you run Hardhat with a typescript configuration, `ts-node` is loaded to run that config. It's at that stage that we have to decide if the code is typechecked or not. So, having a `typecheck` option in the config would mean that we'd need to read the config to decide if we are going to typecheck, but we need to decide if we are going to typecheck before loading the config...\r\n\r\nThat being said, I think we technically could do something like this:\r\n\r\n- If no `--typecheck` flag is passed, load the config without typechecking.\r\n- Before running whatever we are going to run, we check the config and see if the `typecheck` option is set to true.\r\n- If it is, we start over, but with typechecking enabled this time. (Or, alternatively, we just typecheck as a separate step before running the task.)\r\n\r\nBut that's way easier said than done, and I'm not sure it's worth the effort.\r\n\r\nI'm going to keep this issue open to see how much interest there is on this, but to be honest it's unlikely this will be a top priority soon :slightly_frowning_face:",

This means that if you make a solidity change and don't execute a compile and then rerun hardhat it uses the old bytecode. \r\n\r\nDo you know if there is a way to detect if during a hardhat execution if any files are recompiled?
