Reproduction repo: https://github.com/shark0der/hardhat-cache-issue\r\n\r\n@shark0der run into this when one of his tests failed while running in CircleCI, because the returned error was an `UNRECOGNIZED_CONTRACT_ERROR` instead of the expected revert.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if we have a workaround here. One per-task fix is to add the compilation result after compiling, instead of relying on the watcher. But this means that the compilation result will be added twice in the normal scenario, and also we need to do this fix in each relevant task (at least in `test` and `run`).",
