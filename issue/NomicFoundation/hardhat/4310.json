    "body": "Hey @0xdavinchee, sorry for not responding before. I think I know what's going on here, I'll try to explain it.\r\n\r\n`solidity-coverage` does automatically enable the `allowUnlimitedContractSize` flag. The reason it does it is that, before running the tests, the code is instrumented with coverage-measuring code. This increases the size of the bytecode, so it's really common for contracts to go over the limit when measuring test coverage.\r\n\r\nNow the thing is that, when you run tests in parallel _and_ measure coverage, that flag is not being correctly set, and you get that warning. I think the reason why it's not being correctly set is that mocha, in parallel mode, runs each test file in a separate worker process, but solidity-coverage only enables the flag in the \"parent\" process, which has no effect.\r\n\r\nFrom what I saw in `solidity-coverage`'s code, I don't think this is the only thing that won't work correctly with the plugin. Sadly I think the best you can do is use serial mode when running coverage, at least until `solidity-coverage` is adapted to work correctly in parallel mode (see https://github.com/sc-forks/solidity-coverage/issues/691).\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can enable the `allowUnlimitedContractSize` flag in your config when running coverage, but there isn't a good way to do that (you can't see the task that is being run from the config).",
