    "body": "Following up on this. `hardhat_setChainId` approach would be better as it would allow setting the chain id without resetting state (simulation of a network fork), but is quite a bit more invasive. I believe that both approaches would be ideal as the most often use-case to set the chainId is with a network reset. Having #3060 functionality would be better than requiring two rpc calls to reset network with a new chainId.",
