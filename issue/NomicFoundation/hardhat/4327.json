  "body": "Hi there, I am trying to replay past transactions using hardhat, and trying to check what happens for different orderings of transactions. I took a random block number 16906390 (https://etherscan.io/block/16906390), and wanted to replay txs 0,1 with different orderings (https://etherscan.io/tx/0x502cace0340dcb9d9f999e6797ce0f1003e2dac056cad3e1672cbe6a28781aa7, https://etherscan.io/tx/0x1536d47619aceab144d0cfe1c093ebbe1130242f134c4b1550aea3707008a7aa). \r\n\r\nI forked the chain using \"hardhat_reset\" to block 16906389 (one block before). Then I used the \"hardhat_impersonateAccount\" to the sender of the tx (tx.from). I gathered the from, to, gasLimit, gasPrice, and data from an Ethereum node to create a tx. Then I use signer.sendTransaction to send the transaction. \r\n\r\nHowever, I encounter an error when trying to execute the 1st tx. \r\n\r\n\"Error: VM Exception while processing transaction: reverted with an unrecognized custom error (return data: 0x815e1d64)\". \r\n\r\nThe transaction should execute without error because it is the first transaction in the next block in Ethereum, but it gives this error. \r\n\r\nI encounter the same error if I do the following method as well:\r\n\r\n await hre.network.provider.request({\r\n  method: \"eth_call\",\r\n  params: [currentTx, {\"blockNumber\" : \"0x\" + (16906389).toString(16)}],\r\n    });\r\n\r\nNot quite sure why this is happening, because if I call \"eth_call\" directly to the Ethereum node client using http and provide the same parameters, it does not error.  \r\n\r\nAny idea why hardhat is showing this error even though I provide the same transaction and try to execute it at the place where it was executed in the chain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
