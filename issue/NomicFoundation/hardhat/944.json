  "body": "first of all, great work on hardhat, people. i migrated my projects and i am loving it <3\r\nthe mainnet forking on hardhat network is particularly amazing!\r\nwhile migrating from ganache i noticed that my test cases are taking roughly twice the time, maybe a little more.\r\ni checked geth logs and saw that hardhat was making less rpc calls, but they seem to be sequential, while ganache makes more requests, particularly a lot of `eth_getTransactionCount` right at the beginning, but they seem to be in parallel, some of them returning not ordered (by `reqid`).\r\nis there some kind of optimization that can be done in this regard?",

(We already parallelize several of our remote RPC calls and, while there's probably room for improvement, I think we are already on the diminishing returns zone so I doubt we'll work on this anytime soon).",
