  "body": "I see many projects that rely on reading a mnemonic/private-key from the environment or an .env file using dotenv. The issue with that is that it is exposed on a file or bash and any other process can easily read.\r\n\r\nWe could have some type of account management like eth-brownie to keep accounts encrypted and unlock them whenever the user needs to sign. Having this feature can make it easier to then build hardware-wallet support on top.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n- https://github.com/aave/protocol-v2/blob/master/hardhat.config.ts#L32\r\n- https://github.com/graphprotocol/contracts/blob/dev/hardhat.config.ts#L72",
