It does not support having contract code spread into multiple folder.\r\n\r\nSometime, it is beneficial to break a project into separate git module. While it is possible to have the submodule as a sub folder in the project src path, it has the issue that every file of that submodule being present in the source path.\r\n\r\nIf buidler could support an array of path for contracts source path, this would aloow a project to have  other contract source as submodule in different folder.",

    "body": "Agreed that this would be nice. For instance, our core protocol architecture comes with three different extension systems. Each of these systems can have an arbitrary number of plugins (adapters into other protocols, etc.) and it would be nice if we could split them up into seperate packages within a monorepo architecture. I'm happy to work on this if that's something you'd like to support.\r\n\r\nInstead of allowing the `paths` to be specified as both an array of strings or a plain string I'd argue that it would be better to allow users to define multiple relative project roots similar to how e.g. Jest or other tools enable you to configure multiple projects in one configuration file.",

Defaults to the number of CPU cores - 1 (default: 7)\r\n  --force               Force compilation ignoring cache \r\n  --no-typechain        Skip Typechain compilation \r\n  --quiet               Makes the compilation process less verbose \r\n\r\ncompile: Compiles the entire project, building all artifacts\r\n\r\nFor global options help run: hardhat help\r\n```",
