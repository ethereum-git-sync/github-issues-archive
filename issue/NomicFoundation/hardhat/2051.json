  "body": "Solidity 0.8.10 skips the `extcodesize` check for external calls whenever it can be sure that the ABI decoding after the call to a potentially non-existing contract will always revert if that call returns data of length zero.\r\n\r\nWe added this because we expect it to be a gigantic gas-saver. This unfortunately breaks hardhat's heuristic to detect such a call to a non-existing contract. Sorry, we only discovered it after the release.\r\n\r\nTwo quick proposals to fix this:\r\n - use `--revert-strings debug` compiler option for debug builds - this will keep the excodesize check because it results in a different revert data. Upside: Also provides revert strings for other situations like ABI decoding failures. Downside: The deployed code gets larger and might hit the code size limit\r\n - detect calls to non-existing contracts on the EVM level - this can be done now since the call is actually made in that case. Upside: backwards-compatible, Downside: probably none? Maybe the traces need to be extended?",
