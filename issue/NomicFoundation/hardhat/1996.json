  "body": "### Issue description\r\nTesting contracts with `custom-errors` under certain conditions will miss the custom-contract description.\r\n\r\n### Context\r\nThis test is run via CI on a system that is deployed automatically where the deployment process involves updating some contracts and recompiling them.\r\n\r\nThe test (and deployment) involves the following steps:\r\n\r\n1. Create a snapshot\r\n2. Deploy the system (upgrading/changing some contracts and compiling them)\r\n3. Deploy some contracts (part of the tests)\r\n4. Execute the tests\r\n5. Restore the snapshot\r\n\r\n### Investigation done\r\nExecuting the test steps shown in **Context** will fail to detect the custom-contracts on the first run but will succeed on the following ones.\r\n\r\nI reduced the error condition to, instead of taking the snapshot, just accessing `hre.ethers.providers` before compiling the new/updated contracts. (commenting out https://github.com/leomassazza/custom-errors/blob/main/test/sample-test.js#L16 will make the test pass)\r\n\r\n### Reproduction Steps\r\n\r\nYou can find an complete example in this github repository (https://github.com/leomassazza/custom-errors) where this case is reproduced. You just need to checkout the repo, install the dependencies (npm install) and execute the tests removing any pre-created cache and artifacts.\r\n\r\nexecute: `rm -drf artifacts  cache && npx hardhat  test || npx hardhat test`\r\n\r\nIn fact, this command line will show that the first run will fail and will run it a second time where the tests will succeed. I added a console.log with the error picked by hardhat and there you can see the first run it shows:\r\n\r\n`---> Revert message received from hardhat:  Error: Transaction reverted without a reason string\r\n`\r\n\r\nwhile the second one will show:\r\n\r\n`---> Revert message received from hardhat:  Error: VM Exception while processing transaction: reverted with custom error 'SomeFancyError()'`\r\n",

    "body": "Sorry for the delay, @leomassazza, and thanks for the detailed reproduction script.\r\n\r\nThere are two things going on here:\r\n\r\n1. The first one is a bug that I fixed locally. When hardhat network doesn't recognize a contract (i.e. it doesn't have its sources), it doesn't trace it. This lead to an incorrect `Transaction reverted without a reason string` message being used when `VM Exception while processing transaction: reverted with an unrecognized custom error` was the right one.\r\n\r\n2. You are compiling some contracts after hardhat network gets initialized, so the contracts are not loaded. You can manually do that using `hardhat_addCompilationResult`, which takes the compiler version, input, and output. ",
