  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI am running hardhat node as 'out of process', so I am physically running\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpx hardhat node\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have the following in my hardhat config\r\n\r\n```\r\nnetworks: {\r\n    hardhat: {\r\n      loggingEnabled: false,\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe output of the methods being called are still there even though the logging has been disabled. You can see them when anything is talking to the node.\r\n\r\nThis wasn't what I was expecting..\r\n\r\nSo, if I then call the following, it does disable the logging\r\n\r\n```\r\n await hre.network.provider.send(\"hardhat_setLoggingEnabled\", [\r\n    false,\r\n  ]);\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo that worked, after successfully calling the \"hardhat_setLoggingEnabled\", no more logs can be seen.\r\n\r\nIs this correct ?\r\n\r\nI assumed that \"logginEnabled\" set to false should start the node with no logging but it does not.\r\n\r\nCan you confirm if this is correct, maybe I am misunderstanding the \"logginEnabled\" setting?\r\n\r\nThanks.",

This should be fixed in the next release after the PR gets merged, so feel free to keep an eye on that for updates! We'll also close this issue when we make that release as well.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
