  "body": "Hello nomiclabs,\r\n\r\nI started with the migration from Buidler to Hardhat in one of my repositories. https://github.com/NRS-Soft/nuclearistrack on the \"hardhat-migration\" branch. with this commit https://github.com/NRS-Soft/nuclearistrack/commit/4bd9ada21f82e9de1dd25c6746e3c4117cc22cb3\r\n\r\nI followed your guide https://hardhat.org/guides/migrate-from-buidler.html\r\nBut once completed the guide I get the following error message on `npx hardhat compile` or `npx hardhat test` command:\r\n```\r\n[Error: EISDIR: illegal operation on a directory, read] {\r\n  errno: -21,\r\n  code: 'EISDIR',\r\n  syscall: 'read'\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs far as I know it has something to do with Node trying to read from a directory where it hasn't the permission.\r\nI tried to change the paths in the `hardhat.config.js` countless times but couldn't make it work..\r\n\r\nIf you have any clues or eventually already encountered this problem please let me know, with Buidler everything worked fine.\r\nI tried it with Node 10, 12 and even 14.\r\n\r\nIf you need any further information to reproduce the issue or eventually there is something big I'm missing.\r\n\r\nThank you very much!",

Each time after running `npx hardhat clean` I'm able to run `npx hardhat compile` or `npx hardhat test` once and then I have to run `npx hardhat clean` again.

And for the ones like me a better error message would be great too. (If you don't mind I could check if I can make that happen)\r\n\r\nThanks @alcuadrado for the comment about committing artifacts and cache dirs, I do it because I need the compiled contracts in production. I'll see if I can generate the contracts during deployment.\r\n\r\nFor me this issue is closed.\r\n",
