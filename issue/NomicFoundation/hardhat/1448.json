  "body": "\r\n## Extending `hardhat-etherscan` to support multiple API keys\r\n\r\n**Summary:**\r\n\r\nThe [`hardhat-etherscan` plugin](https://hardhat.org/plugins/nomiclabs-hardhat-etherscan.html) currently provides an interface to provide one API key for auto-verification. In the current ecosystem there is a need for being able to support multiple API keys. This feature request looks at how `hardhat-etherscan` works now, and outlines potential solutions.\r\n\r\n### Current structure of `hardhat-etherscan`\r\n\r\nThe `hardhat-etherscan` enables auto-verification via an `etherscan` object in `hardhat.config`:\r\n```javascript\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  networks: {\r\n    mainnet: { ... }\r\n  },\r\n  etherscan: {\r\n    // Your API key for Etherscan\r\n    // Obtain one at https://etherscan.io/\r\n    apiKey: \"YOUR_ETHERSCAN_API_KEY\"\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n(code taken from [docs](https://hardhat.org/plugins/nomiclabs-hardhat-etherscan.html) for `hardhat-etherscan`)\r\n\r\n### Problems\r\n\r\nIn today's ecosystem, Etherscan has spun off block explorers for popular sidechains such as BSC ([BSCScan](https://bscscan.com/)) and Fantom ([FTMScan](https://ftmscan.com/)), making the naming convention of the plugin itself slightly misleading. This recommends renaming in future versions to `hardhat-verification`. If Blockscout explorers become available, this will be doubly true.\r\n\r\nIn addition, calling the object in the config `etherscan` has the same concern.\r\n\r\nNeither of these are meant to be the primary issue, though. The larger issue is that the `etherscan` object can only hold one API key at a time (via `etherscan.apiKey`). It would be valuable for projects deploying in multiple ecosystems to support multiple API keys.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Solutions\r\n\r\n#### 1. Long-term proposal\r\n\r\nIn the long term we would like to recommend renaming the plugin to `hardhat-verification`, and replacing the `etherscan` object in the config with `explorerApiKeys`, with the key being the name of a supported block explorer, something akin to:\r\n```javascript\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  networks: {\r\n    mainnet: { ... }\r\n  },\r\n  explorerApiKeys: {\r\n    etherscan: \"YOUR_ETHERSCAN_API_KEY\",\r\n    bscScan: \"YOUR_BSCSCAN_API_KEY\",\r\n    ftmScan: \"YOUR_FTMSCAN_API_KEY\",\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nRenaming the plugin and the object has the added benefit of backwards compatability - the `hardhat-etherscan` and corresponding `etherscan` object could remain supported without conflict.\r\n\r\nThis could in turn involve code on the backend matching block explorers with `chainId`s, so that Hardhat knows, for example, to match a `chainId` of 56 with Binance Smart Chain. (This would likely mean giving the key values of block explorers, as in the example above). Alternatively, the name of the key could be matched with networks provided in the `networks` object (in which case, instead of the keys above, they would carry the same name as the networks, for example `bsc` or `fantom`). This would likely be an inferior option, as it would require pasting the same key multiple times in order to cover testnets. (Especially in the case of Ethereum/Etherscan, it could require separate mainnet, Ropsten, Rinkeby, Kovan, and Goerli keys, even though all work with the same Etherscan API key.)\r\n\r\n#### 2. Short-term proposal\r\n\r\nThe most urgent item imho is supporting multiple API keys. Without introducing a new name and new structure, the current `hardhat-etherscan` plugin could be extended to support multiple keys by introducing an `additionalNetworks` object into the `etherscan` object:\r\n```javascript\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  networks: {\r\n    mainnet: { ... },\r\n    bsc: { ... }.\r\n    fantom: { ... },\r\n  },\r\n  etherscan: {\r\n    apiKey: \"YOUR_ETHERSCAN_API_KEY\",\r\n    additionalNetworks: {\r\n          bsc: \"YOUR_BSCSCAN_API_KEY\",\r\n          fantom: \"YOUR_FTMSCAN_API_KEY\",\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n```\r\nHere the keys in `additionalNetworks` could be matched to the names of provided networks. This would require providing the same key for, say, BSC's main and test networks, as mentioned above, but does not have the same overhead as Etherscan (also mentioned above), and might be acceptable.\r\n\r\n### Closing\r\n\r\nThis doesn't include the particulars of implementing any of the ideas here. I also don't intend for the suggested naming conventions and structures to be written in stone - there very well may be better ways to name or structure this. I'd be happy to work on a potential PR for this. \r\n\r\nThanks for taking the time to read this, and I'm looking forward to the feedback!",

Doesn't solve the multiple api key problem, but I couldn't verify my deployed contract without it. 🤷 ",

Here's a proper fix:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst getApiKey = () =>\r\n  switch (process.env.HARDHAT_NETWORK) {\r\n    case \"mainnet\":\r\n    case \"rinkeby\":\r\n    case \"goerli\":\r\n    case \"ropsten\":\r\n      return process.env.ETHERSCAN_API_KEY;\r\n    case \"polygon\":\r\n    case \"mumbai\":\r\n      return process.env.POLYGONSCAN_API_KEY;\r\n    default:\r\n      return \"\";\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother solution, since you'd use the same apiKey for multiple networks would be to create 2 `hardhad.config.js` files: one for ethereum and one for polygon, with the appropriate environment variable uses, and specify which file to use when running hardhat.\r\n\r\n",
