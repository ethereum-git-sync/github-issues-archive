Can you confirm if that's the case?\r\n\r\nI'm not actually sure if it's the same issue as #3091, since we have been able to test custom errors in the past when the error was recognized. e.g. `    await expect(contract.doSomething()).to.be.revertedWith(\"custom error 'Unauthorized()'\");`\r\n\r\nThough I agree with you that the problem seems specific to the chai matchers error message. Are those error messages generated from `solidity-errors.ts` instead of `error-inferror.ts`?\r\n\r\nWe did create our own patch for this on a fork of Hardhat if you're curious: https://github.com/jflatow/hardhat/commit/8cf3340fe146e77e411b5854c47ebc4d61fa7ec8. Basically, we added the custom error selector to the error message in [`solidity-errors.ts`](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/blob/5a9927dd2ecbb6bbe60b35972c5969981cc080f3/packages/hardhat-core/src/internal/hardhat-network/stack-traces/solidity-errors.ts#L274) since it was not present there.",
