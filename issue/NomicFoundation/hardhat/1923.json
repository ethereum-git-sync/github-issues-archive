Similarly, you can use `it.skip` to skip a single test.\r\n\r\nWith respect to compilation... that is somewhat harder. For the time being, I think there's a way to do that by overriding some subtasks. It's not very straightforward though. If there's enough interest (that is, more than one person wants to do that), I can make an example. or maybe a plugin.",
