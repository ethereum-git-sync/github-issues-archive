  "body": "### Describe the feature\r\n\r\nAs part of the curse of the early adopter, users may have created addresses with Ledger prior to them fully implementing BIP44, when they used [a different derivation path](https://github.com/MyCryptoHQ/MyCrypto/issues/2070). Such users should be able to use `hardhat-ledger`.\r\n\r\nOne possibility to capture most of these users (myself included) would be to add a `ledgerLegacyDerivationPath` option as a boolean in the network configs, alongside `ledgerAccounts` - or possibly combining them in to a `ledgerOptions`.\r\n\r\nA more general solution that would capture all possible issues would be to allow users to specify the derivation path themselves - e.g. `m/44'/60'/x'/0/0`. Again, either as a separate option or as part of a combined `ledgerOptions` property.\r\n\r\nOf course, the default behaviour should remain unchanged - most users are not impacted by this.\r\n\r\nI need this feature, and it is small, so would be keen to work on a PR myself. I am opening the discussion here to begin with, as requested in `CONTRIBUTING.md`, with the hope that someone can indicate which of these possibilities is most likely to get accepted.\r\n\r\n### Search terms\r\n\r\n_No response_",
