  "body": "Buidler compilation tasks need to be redesigned to support multiple Solidity versions natively. We want to take this opportunity to gather feedback and ideas from the community and add other improvements.\r\n\r\nThese are some of the ideas that different members of the community have mentioned:\r\n\r\n1. Support multiple Solidity versions\r\n2. Support multiple programming languages\r\n3. Let users set any solc config\r\n4. Per-network solc config\r\n5. Let the users customize the artifact format\r\n6. Make the compilation output overridable\r\n7. Add a quiet compilation mode\r\n\r\nI wouldn't focus on how to make this change backward compatible for now, but rather on how to modularize the tasks and how to redesign the compilation config.\r\n\r\n/cc @wighawag @fvictorio @ajsantander @justinjmoses @cgewecke",

We can set the optimization runs per target, as we compile each target separately \r\n2. Because of separate compilation, we can skip targets on compile if they haven't changed (though this really requires keeping ASTs of each source and figuring out if any of its deps have changed, which we don't currently do).\r\n\r\nFinally, as @cgewecke mentioned, I do think better compiler output is critical if we want more devs to simply chose buidler as a default. \r\n",

    "body": "Chiming in for Kyber (https://github.com/KyberNetwork/smart-contracts), as some have mentioned, (1) is most important for us as we want to ensure that whatever SCs we churn out is backwards-compatible with previous versions. (2), (3) and (6) is great for compostability (Eg. people building on Uniswap, Synthetix, Kyber, 0x, YFI etc.).\r\n\r\nBased on the preliminary version, I see that we'd be able to specify the no. of optimiser runs per contract, which is an awesome feature to have! Different contracts have different sizes, and hence we'd like to optimise each one as much as possible.\r\n\r\nVery excited for this!!",
