  "body": "In #1969 I was told that the tests in `hardhat-core` are supposed to work even without running `yarn build`. This is no longer the case now that extra tests for the `parallel` option were added.\r\n\r\nI noticed this when our tests in solc-js started failing ([4387](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solc-js/1085/workflows/f11eccff-0bb3-4057-98dd-90df8163ae88/jobs/4387)).
