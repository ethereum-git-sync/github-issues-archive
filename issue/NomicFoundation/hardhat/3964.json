The new contracts will be in the contracts folder directly.\r\nI did start with a contract simple\r\n/contracts/compare/libraries/utils/ReentrancyGuard.sol\r\nand want to compare it against\r\n/contracts/libraries/utils/ReentrancyGuard.sol\r\n\r\nI did create 2 mock contracts living in the /contracts/mocks folder.\r\nOne is using the old implementation the other one uses the new one.\r\n\r\nHowever one of my tests always fail and the reason is suprising.\r\nTo confirm I add an console.log in the new implementation and to my surprise all 2 Mock classes uses the new implementation even if one mock class is clearly referencing the old one.\r\n\r\nI uploaded  the project here https://github.com/ExumaGroup/exuma-contracts\r\n\r\n### Minimal reproduction steps\r\n\r\nclone repository\r\nnpm i\r\nnpm run build\r\nnpm run test\r\n\r\n### Search terms\r\n\r\nhardhat mocha contract",
