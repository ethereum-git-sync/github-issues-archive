  "body": "We want to remove Mocha from hardhat-core. Users should be able to just install and require a plugin (e.g., `@nomiclabs/hardhat-mocha`) to have the same functionality that they have now.\r\n\r\nSince this is a breaking change, we should do it in two phases.\r\n\r\n### Phase 1: create plugin and add warning\r\n\r\nFirst we should create and publish that plugin, and change the default `test` task so that it prints a warning after finishing, saying something like: \"The default test task is deprecated, please install and use \\<plugin-name>\"\r\n\r\nThe plugin would override the `test` task with the same implementation we have now, and without calling `runSuper`. That way the behavior wouldn't change, but the warning wouldn't be shown.\r\n\r\n### Phase 2: remove default implementation and throw an error in the `test` task\r\n\r\nAfter some time (~2 months) we should remove the dependency on mocha and change the default task to just throw an error indicating users to install `hardhat-mocha`.\r\n\r\n### Other considerations\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what this means for plugins. For example, I think this would break `hardhat-gas-reporter` if the plugin is required _before_ the `hardhat-mocha` plugin.",
