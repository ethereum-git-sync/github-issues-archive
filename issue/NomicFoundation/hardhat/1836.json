The `localhost` is running by `npx hardhat node`.\r\n\r\nAs you can see in the `hardhat.config.js`, at first I thought it may be related the the `London` hardfork, as we are adding many transactions into one block, the gasPrice may not be sufficient. But the `localhost` works fine with the `istanbul`  hardfork. As we dive deeper, it turned out that the gasLimit  seemed to be the reason why such transactions are dropped.",

    "body": "Hey @joyious, thanks for the reproduction repo and sorry for not getting back to you sooner.\r\n\r\nI can confirm this happens. This is what I've seen so far:\r\n\r\n- If you use `storage.estimateGas.store(1)`, the returned value is the same for the in-process hardhat network and for localhost.\r\n- But when a tx is sent, the gas limit used is different in both cases\r\n- Automining doesn't seem to matter, the same thing happens if I disable it\r\n- Using the default `hardfork` doesn't change the behavior either\r\n\r\n@alcuadrado maybe you have a quick guess about what could be happening here? Perhaps something related to the automatic gas provider?",
