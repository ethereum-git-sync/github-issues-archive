  "body": "If an async function is passed to `extendConfig` and an error is thrown within it (for example, a config validation error), the process will finish successfully anyway.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways we can do this:\r\n\r\n1. In runtime, just checking if the value returned by `extendConfig` is a thenable and throwing an error if it is\r\n2. With typescript, by rejecting functions that return a promise (this is involved by doable)\r\n\r\nThe problem with this is that it can break some plugins that are using an async function. Maybe we can start with a deprecation message and then add a proper error.",
