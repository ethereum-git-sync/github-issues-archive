The best way to do this is to include a [Minimal Reproducible Example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example). If you can't do that, then include a link to your repo, and the steps to reproduce the problem. The easiest it is to reproduce your problem, the faster we are going to be able to fix it.\r\n\r\nIf you are submitting a feature request, please take the time to clearly describe your use case, and not only your proposed solution.\r\n\r\nThis issue will be automatically assigned to a Hardhat team member. This person will act as the point of contact between you and the team, but won't necessarily fix it nor address it in any way. An issue being assigned does not mean that it's being worked on.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### The Issue\r\n\r\nI came across an issue which makes testing of Factories and Proxies impossible at the moment. I also created a repository that contains everything to reproduce the issues: https://github.com/itinance/study-factory-proxy  \r\n\r\ncalling a function of a contract address, which was created via `Clones.clone` from OpenZeppelins Minimal-Proxy-implementation reverts with CALL_EXECUTION when we attach the address onto a contract variable via `attach` or `getContractAt`.\r\n\r\nLets say we have a test, which \r\n1. creates a Sample Contract `Box`\r\n2. create a `Factory`-Contract and tells it the address of `Box`, which can be cloned within the Factory\r\n3. executes the `clone`-method of the Factory to receive a cloned `Box`-instance\r\n4. grabs the deployed address of this clone from the list of emitted events\r\n5. executes a normal function on this clone\r\n\r\nWhat happens is, that every function call to the newly created `Box`-instance will cause an `CALL_EXCEPTION` revert, when we use tests via hardhat.  This is NOT happening when we deploy on Rinkeby, GÃ¶rli or Mumbai.\r\n\r\nMy issue sounds like #2658, but we do not work across several nodes and script-executions here. We just stay within the same execution instance and the revert still happens.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nI created a runs-out-of-the-box example which can be checked here: https://github.com/itinance/study-factory-proxy and includes all the necessary steps, that I describe below.\r\n\r\nI have a Box-Contract and a Factory-Contract:\r\n1. Box: \r\n\r\n```\r\ncontract BoxV1 is Initializable {\r\n\r\n    uint public width;\r\n    uint public length;\r\n\r\n    function initialize(uint _length, uint _width) public initializer {\r\n        length = _length;\r\n        width = _width;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function area() public view returns(uint) {\r\n        return length * width;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Factory: \r\n```\r\npragma solidity ^0.8.9;\r\n\r\nimport \"@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol\";\r\nimport \"@openzeppelin/contracts/proxy/Clones.sol\";\r\n\r\nimport \"./BoxV1.sol\";\r\n\r\ncontract BoxFactory is Initializable {\r\n    event BoxDeployed(address instance);\r\n\r\n    address private _impl;\r\n\r\n    function initialize(address impl_) public initializer {\r\n        _impl = impl_;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function impl() public view returns(address) {\r\n        return _impl;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function createBox(uint _length, uint _width) public returns (address)\r\n    {\r\n        address clone = Clones.clone(_impl);\r\n        BoxV1(clone).initialize(_length, _width);\r\n\r\n        emit BoxDeployed(address(clone));\r\n\r\n        return clone;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn tests, I load Fixtures for the Box and the factory:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  async function deployFactory() {\r\n    const boxV1Factory = (await ethers.getContractFactory('BoxV1')) as BoxV1__factory;\r\n    const boxV1 = await upgrades.deployProxy(boxV1Factory, [0, 0])\r\n    await boxV1.deployed();\r\n\r\n    const boxFactoryFactory = (await ethers.getContractFactory('BoxFactory')) as BoxFactory__factory;\r\n\r\n    const boxFactory = (await upgrades.deployProxy(boxFactoryFactory, [boxV1.address])) as BoxFactory;\r\n    await boxFactory.deployed();\r\n\r\n    console.log(1, boxFactory.address);\r\n\r\n    return { boxFactory };\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  async function cloneMeABox_5x6() {\r\n    const {boxFactory} = await loadFixture(deployFactory);\r\n\r\n    const tokenTransaction: ContractTransaction = await boxFactory.createBox(5, 6 );\r\n    const receipt: ContractReceipt = await tokenTransaction.wait();\r\n    const boxAddress = findEventArgsByNameFromReceipt(receipt, 'BoxDeployed', 'instance');\r\n\r\n    expect(boxAddress).to.be.properAddress;\r\n\r\n    const contractFactory = (await ethers.getContractFactory('BoxV1')) as BoxV1__factory;\r\n    const box = contractFactory.attach(boxAddress);\r\n\r\n    // this is actually the same, leading to the same error\r\n    //const box = await ethers.getContractAt('BoxV1', boxAddress)\r\n\r\n    return {box};\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe actual failing test:\r\n\r\n```\r\n      const {box} = await loadFixture(cloneMeABox_5x6);\r\n      expect(await box.area()).to.eq(5*6);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen accessing `box.area`, it reverts with:\r\n\r\n>  Error: call revert exception [ See: https://links.ethers.org/v5-errors-CALL_EXCEPTION ] (method=\"area()\", data=\"0x\", errorArgs=null, errorName=null, errorSignature=null, reason=null, code=CALL_EXCEPTION, version=abi/5.7.0)\r\n>       at Logger.makeError (node_modules/@ethersproject/logger/src.ts/index.ts:269:28)\r\n>       at Logger.throwError (node_modules/@ethersproject/logger/src.ts/index.ts:281:20)\r\n> \r\n\r\n\r\nThis doesn't fail in \"real life\" with deployment on testnets like GÃ¶rli and Rinkeby. It only fails with using hardhat and running tests within hardhat.\r\n\r\nI tried to figure out, what happens here but I am lost. Has somebody faced this issue and can tell something about?\r\nThanks a lot!\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I'm not sure how you would accomplish that tbh.\r\n",
