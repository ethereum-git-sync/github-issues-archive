  "body": "### Describe the feature\r\n\r\nAs Goerli testnet deprecates with the end of the year, a lot of L2 networks change their testnets from Goerli-based to Sepolia-based. Along with those changes, the scan websites also add the support for Sepolia-based L2 testnets. But so far `hardhat-verify` does not include those new chains in https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/blob/main/packages/hardhat-verify/src/internal/chain-config.ts, which I think means that `hardhat-verify` will not work for them.\r\nHere are some L2 testnets I would like to see supported:\r\n* Arbitrum Sepolia (id 421614) - https://sepolia.arbiscan.io/ (already tracked in https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/issues/4582)\r\n* Base Sepolia (id 84532) - ArbiScan does not support it yet, but I got a following info from them about the support: '_At this point, Base Sepolia is already in the pipeline but there is no estimation when can we push the site to live. Stay tuned for more info and make sure to follow BaseScan's Twitter to yourself updated when it is already live._'\r\n* Optimism Sepolia (id 11155420) - https://sepolia-optimism.etherscan.io/\r\n\r\n\r\n### Search terms\r\n\r\nhardhard-verify sepolia arbitrumSepolia baseSepolia optimisticSepolia",
