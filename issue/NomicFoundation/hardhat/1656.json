I think that you could write the plugin under the assumption that either the `fe` command is available on the system (leaving it up to the user to put it in the `PATH`) or use a configuration option where the user can put in a `/path/to/fe`. The rest shouldn't be too hard, feel free to ping me for any questions that may arise.",
