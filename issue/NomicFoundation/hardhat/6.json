  "body": "We should decide which parts of buidler will be compatible with truffle, and why.\r\n\r\nMy current idea is that buidler should only be compatible enough to make migration from Truffle very easy. I think this is specially important for contracts' tests, which nobody will want to rewrite just to use another tool.\r\n\r\n`buidler test` now runs truffle-compatible tests, but that ties us to Truffle-contracts, or at least to its APIs. We should consider making explicit what's truffle-compatibility and whats native in buidler, like making those tests runnable with `buidler truffle-test`, or even create a `buidler-truffle` plugin.\r\n\r\nWe also implemented their networks configuration system, which is very focused on web3. Specially the  `provider` field  is normally used along `web3-provider-engine`, which we want to avoid and may block #5.",
