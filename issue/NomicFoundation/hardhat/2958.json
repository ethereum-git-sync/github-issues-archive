    "body": "@wbydo I think the problem is that you are missing all the toolbox's peer dependencies. These are installed automatically when you use npm 7 or later, but they aren't if you are using yarn or an older version of npm.\r\n\r\nWhen you initialize a hardhat project, you should get a prompt asking you if you want to install these, and it shows you the command to do it manually if you answer negatively. (Except on Windows, I think in that case you always get just the command to run) Maybe you forgot to run it? In any case, here it is:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  yarn add --dev @nomicfoundation/hardhat-network-helpers @nomicfoundation/hardhat-chai-matchers @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers @nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan chai ethers hardhat-gas-reporter solidity-coverage @typechain/hardhat typechain @typechain/ethers-v5 @ethersproject/abi @ethersproject/providers @types/chai @types/mocha @types/node ts-node typescript\r\n```\r\n\r\nI did that in the repo you shared and then everything worked fine.\r\n\r\nTentatively closing this, but let me know if you still think there's a problem on our side.",
