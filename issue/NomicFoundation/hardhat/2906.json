    "body": "There seem to be a couple of problems going on here.\r\n\r\nThe first issue, about the timestamp being way in the future... I don't know what's going on. And I don't think we can figure it out without reproduction steps.\r\n\r\n> When I repeat test my script \"test/Lock.js\" ,the local hardhat node's block.timestamp is bigger and bigger than my local timestamp.\r\n\r\nThis is probably caused by Hardhat increasing each block's timestamp by at least one second. We do this to follow the consensus rule that dictates that each block must have a different timestamp, but we are going to introduce an option to relax this condition.\r\n\r\n> I realized that latest() function returns the latest block timestamp and my custom error returns block.timestamp of the possible next block, so there is a difference in 1 sec between them.\r\n>\r\n> It will be great to have such a function to get the next possible timestamp of the block, which is proceeded by the current transaction, if it is possible at all. Anyways, I will be glad to hear any ideas on how to resolve my problem appropriately.\r\n\r\nThis would be hard to do because, in the normal case, the next block timestamp depends on, well, when the block was mined.\r\n\r\nWhat you can do is to use `setNextBlockTimestamp` to set the timestamp of the new block and then compare that in your test.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this issue now. If someone still has some problem, please open a new issue.",
