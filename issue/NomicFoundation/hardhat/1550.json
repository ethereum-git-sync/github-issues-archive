  "body": "Running the stack traces tests with 0.8.5 works for all tests but two: `0_8/call-message/external-call\r\ns/incorrect-returndata-size/test.json` and `0_8/create-message/external-calls/incorrect-returndata-size/test.json` (pretty much the same test).\r\n\r\nThe reason they fail is that the resulting stack trace contains the same frame twice (first as a `CALLSTACK_ENTRY` and then as a `RETURNDATA_SIZE_ERROR`). And the reason this is not filtered out by `ErrorInferrer.filterRedundantFrames` is that the stack trace it receives is something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nA - B - A\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere `B` is redundant and therefore removed.\r\n\r\nThis suggests that the fix is simply to run `filterRedundantFrames` multiple times until it gets a stable result but that seems to break the recursive calls tests.\r\n\r\nAt that point I stopped looking into this. The next step is to understand why the recursive test fails if you call `filterRedundantFrames` twice since I would expect that function to be somewhat idempotent (in this scenario).",
