  "body": "### Version of Hardhat\n\n2.14.0\n\n### What happened?\n\nI have been creating some tests and wanted to import `deployMockContract` from `ethereum-waffle`. \r\n\r\nIt seems `ethereum-waffle` is already installed in `@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox` which has inside `@nomicfoundation/hardhat-chai-matchers` which has inside `ethereum-waffle`. But I tried to look through the packages and did not find any of the needed export. So I have tried to install `ethereum-waffle` on my own. \r\n\r\nThen get an error from `@nomicfoundation/hardhat-chai-matchers` that I had already two instances of `ethereum-waffle` and followed me to look at migrating docs. There are suggestions, firstly, uninstall `ethereum-waffle`, and then, install `@nomicfoundation/hardhat-chai-matchers`. So, as it said, I uninstalled `ethereum-waffle`, but then reinstalled a `@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox` to update it if my workarounds could break something. As you might expect, this did not help me at all.\r\n\r\nPlease, provide a description or reference of how these packages are working and if there is a way to import `deployMockContract` from `ethereum-waffle`. Would appreciate any help \n\n### Minimal reproduction steps\n\n1. Create hardhat typescript project template from `npx hardhat` command.\r\n2. Make sure to use `hardhat-toolbox` package in this project.\r\n3. Try to import `deployMockContract` in any typescript file in this project from `hardhat-toolbox` package.\n\n### Search terms\n\nHardhat-toolbox, mock, deployMockContract, MockContract, ethereum-waffle, hardhat-chai-matchers",
