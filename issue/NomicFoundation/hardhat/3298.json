  "body": "Hi, I am currently researching about how to set optimize gas with hardhat that can send my deployment more faster. I try to do this by hardhat.config.js file.\r\n\r\ngoerli: {\r\n      url: `https://eth-goerli.g.alchemy.com/v2/${process.env.ALCHEMY_API_KEY}`,\r\n      accounts: [process.env.PRI_KEY],\r\n      gasPrice: 204369036266, \r\n    },\r\n\r\nI saw these 'gasPrice' [worked well ](https://goerli.etherscan.io/tx/0xb9c5048bbabe3b373afaf6e90cafe34627caf567fd9c7e2352e931d4826869e2)when I deploy my contract, but it is not the gas fee mechanism of eip-1559. \r\n\r\nso what I want to do is, change custom priority fee and set max base fee like we do on eip-1559 on hardhat.config.js when deploying the contract. \r\n\r\nI searched, but it seems that currently I couldn't find out how to do that. \r\nif this feature is not yet on hardhat, I definitely think this is necessary for gas fee optimization.",
