  "body": "When there is a test failure the engineer might need more information about the internal state of the contract, such as printing out the entire `rawLog` member so that all log events can be seen.  One step better would be to iterate over the contract's object and to print out all members to the user, which would include rawLog and other side-effects.\r\n\r\nMaybe this could be included in --verbose, or making a new switch.   I personally like the idea of justing adding --verbose to show more of the solidity state to help debug failing test cases.\r\n\r\nThere are other times when it might be better to print out just the log of the contract on event log failures, even without --verbose.  For example if you are looking for an event and it isn't found, then the log contains all events so the engineer can more easily see the mismatch. ",
