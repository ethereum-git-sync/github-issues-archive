  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nI'm using *systemd* to manage Lighthouse and *systemd* does its own timestamping. It would make the logfiles nicer and smaller if there would be an option to disable the Lighthouse timestamping.\r\n\r\n## Present Behaviour\r\n\r\nCurrently the logfiles of *systemd* do look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nMar 18 12:47:36 hostname lighthouse[1554781]: Mar 18 11:47:36.387 INFO New block received                      root: 0xdabf1994c1c90eb947fa16dfc7b303bbe0a6e03261462a7319b4e230d98559ee, slot: 3398336\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\nIt would be nicer this way:\r\n\r\n```\r\nMar 18 12:47:36 hostname lighthouse[1554781]: INFO New block received                      root: 0xdabf1994c1c90eb947fa16dfc7b303bbe0a6e03261462a7319b4e230d98559ee, slot: 3398336\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\nI would suggest a new flag like `--disable-timestamp-output`. This should only affect the console output (stdout, stderr), not the Lighthouse logfiles.\r\n\r\nAnother option could be `--log-format SYSTEMD`, `--log-format JSON` does already exist.",
