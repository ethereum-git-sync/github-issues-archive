  "body": "The validator_manager supports creating and importing validator keys. The creation command makes one big file containing all the keys; and the importer imports each key individually with a randomly generated password. There is no voluntary exit command via the validator_manager. This makes things a bit quirky.\r\n\r\n- I need to point lighthouse to one of the imported keys, since I can't use the dump containing many keys.\r\n- The only place where I have a set of keys is the validator itself, so I need to dig up the key from the live system.\r\n- I also need to look through the validator_definitions and extract the correct random password.\r\n\r\nIt's a bit of a PITA even for a single validator. Doing this for many gets annoying very fast.\r\n\r\nWould be nice to be able to generate voluntary exists via the validator_manager too.",
