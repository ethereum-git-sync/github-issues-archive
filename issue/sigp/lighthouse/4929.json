  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nThe rewards calculated by the rewards API for phase0 blocks have the potential to be wrong in the presence of _attestations from slashed validators_. The reason for this is that the phase0 calculation reuses the op pool's code for attestation rewards, which ignores slashings as an optimisation:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/441fc1691b69f9edc4bbdc6665f3efab16265c9b/beacon_node/beacon_chain/src/beacon_block_reward.rs#L164-L171\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/441fc1691b69f9edc4bbdc6665f3efab16265c9b/beacon_node/operation_pool/src/attestation.rs#L149-L152\r\n\r\nAltair and later blocks are not affected.\r\n\r\n## Version\r\n\r\nLighthouse v4.5.0\r\n\r\n## Detail\r\n\r\n- Validator x is slashed\r\n- Validator x attests in epoch N with one set of flags (e.g. target + source)\r\n- Validator x attests a second time in epoch N with a different set of flags (e.g. head + target + source)\r\n- Validator y includes both attestations from validator x in a block\r\n\r\n## Current Behaviour\r\n\r\nThe current API will reward the proposer (validator y) based on the flags of the attestation that was included in the block first (i.e. head + target).\r\n\r\n## Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\nThe API should reward the proposer based on the flags of the _best_ attestation included for validator x.

    "body": "Regarding the expected behaviour: In the phase0 spec, the proposer is rewarded at epoch boundaries in `get_inclusion_delay_deltas`. There, slashed attesters are skipped as we iterate over the return values of `get_unslashed_attesting_indices`. Therefore, shouldn't the expected behaviour be something like \"The API should not reward for the attestations of validator x if validator x is slashed at the adequate epoch boundary, and otherwise rewards for both attestations.\"? \r\n\r\nAlso, I am unsure about the notion of flags in this issue, since as far as I understand, that concept was introduced in Altair?",
