  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nSupporting the definition of parameters via a configuration file and associated CLI flag cuts back on terminal clutter and allows unique startup profiles to be saved independently. Moreover, setting parameters in this way also allows for a multifaceted approach to configuration in the sense of (precedent) ordered loading with the capability to provide targeted overrides (e.g. specifying a sane/base set of configuration settings via config and allowing overrides for certain settings using the client CLI).\r\n\r\nIt's may also be worth noting that it seems as though a significant amount of client architectures, similar in nature to `lighthouse` or otherwise, support config file loading.  \r\n\r\n## Version\r\n\r\n`v2.0.1`\r\n\r\n## Present Behaviour\r\n\r\nDefinition of client configuration settings is only supported via CLI flags/parameter values. \r\n\r\n## Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\n`lighthouse` clients support a CLI option which allows for specification of a path to a config file definition which contains the user/operator's desired configuration profile.\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\n**TBD** though there are numerous examples within the crypto and Rust based tooling ecosystems alone (e.g. `openethereum` [config docs](https://openethereum.github.io/Configuring-OpenEthereum)).",

    "body": "Great idea, and something I think we should definitely implement.\n\nI think the complications of Lighthouse's previous config file implementation stemmed from mutating the file to try to keep it in sync with the CLI params. I think the behaviour you describe makes a lot more sense: the file should be read-only from Lighthouse's perspective, has to be explicitly provided on the CLI (no surprising default location), consists _only_ of CLI flags, and is overridden by flags provided explicitly (no consistency checks between file and CLI).\n\nAs a format I think TOML would probably be best",
