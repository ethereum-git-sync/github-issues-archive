  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nIn Capella we can finally improve payload construction by fetching multiple payloads from the execution node at a time: https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/pull/352.\r\n\r\nThe `capella` branch doesn't yet support this. @ethDreamer had a previous prototype working with Nethermind which could probably be adapted.\r\n\r\nThis _isn't_ essential for Capella interop, but could be one of the finishing touches developed during/after interop.\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\nI think we could probably just start with adding `getPayloadBodiesByRangeV1`, as that's where the main benefit lies. We can enable this under the same conditions as other Capella methods (`capella_fork_epoch.is_some()`) or add a runtime flag if EL support is initially patchy.\r\n",
