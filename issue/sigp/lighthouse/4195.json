  "body": "## Description\r\nThere is currently no prometheus metric that provides visibility into the next withdrawal validator index.  This would be useful for monitoring when a validator's withdrawal might be processed.\r\n\r\n## Version\r\n\r\n4.0.2-rc0\r\n\r\n## Present Behaviour\r\n\r\nThere is no extant metric for such information reported to prometheus.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\nA metric named `next_withdrawal_validator_index` or something similar that returns the next index to be withdrawn.  Alternatively, a metric named `last_withdrawal_validator_index` may also be useful for reporting the last withdrawal index that was successfully processed is equally useful.\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\nCollect the information from the beacon state and report them to prometheus.\r\n",
