This messes with our haproxy liveness check a bit, which runs every 10s.\r\n\r\nRestarting Lighthouse will resolve this for a very short while.\r\n\r\nResyncing Lighthouse will resolve this for days/weeks, and then it occurs again.\r\n\r\n## Version\r\n\r\n`v4.5.222-exp-f1f76f2` - this is used for oDAO queries and otherwise is not fast enough\r\n\r\n",
