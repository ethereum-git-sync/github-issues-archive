  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nWhen using `lighthouse` as Erigon CL, I have no other \"lighthouse\" clients as peers and also have lower number of peers compared to using `ligthhouse` as Geth CL. For Sepolia network this is a huge difference. For other networks it's not that problematic.\r\n\r\n## Version\r\n\r\nTried with v3.5.1, v4.1.0, v4.2.0\r\n\r\n## Present Behaviour\r\n\r\nTwo situations, tested with all 3 versions mentioned above.\r\n\r\n1. Lighthouse as CL for geth. More peers in general for all networks (30-50). Prysm as most common, after that Lighthouse and Nimbus.\r\n2. Lighthouse as CL for erigon. Less peers in general for Sepolia (0-8). Nimbus/Prysm most common, maybe Teku sometimes. **But no lighthouse clients at all.** If one appears it drops immediately, it's like it's dropping all lighthouse clients for some reason. **This is the biggest issues for Sepolia**, as for that network there are only few Nimbus/Prysm/Teku clients we are finding in network.\r\n\r\nFor monitoring peers I was using `libp2p_peers_per_client` metric. And this situation is happening for last several months already.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\nI would expect lighthouse to behave almost the same nevertheless which EL client I am using.",
