Change the port of the `--eth1-endpoints` value to point to the JWT-authenticated port (e.g., Geth's `--authrpc.port`).\r\n1. Add the `--jwt-secrets` flag, pointing at the same file as the EE (e.g., Geth's `--authrpc.jwtsecret`).\r\n\r\nHowever, we can't do this until all the EE impls have released versions with JWT support. Otherwise, all of the current \"eth1\" calls will start failing due to a lack of JWT. So, I think the best strategy for now is to maintain the two flags.

    "body": "Thinking about this some more, I think I prefer a different strategy. I prefer deprecating `eth1-endpoints` in the long-term.\r\n\r\nThe path to deprecation has three phases:\r\n\r\n1. Have `eth1-` and `execution-` endpoints as distinct flags, both required for merge networks.\r\n   - This is where we are now.\r\n   - Non-merge networks (mainnet) still require non-auth support, since it's not stable/prevalent on EE impls yet.\r\n   - Merge networks *must* have auth support.\r\n   - Our [`eth1`](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/tree/stable/beacon_node/eth1) crate doesn't support auth yet.\r\n2. Allow users to supply `execution-` only (i.e., `eth1-` is option).\r\n    - To achieve this, we need to refactor the [`eth1`](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/tree/stable/beacon_node/eth1) crate to optionally use the auth functionality from [`execution_layer`](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/tree/stable/beacon_node/execution_layer).\r\n3. Make `eth1-` illegal and require all users to use `execution-`\r\n    - We do this when the Bellatrix release is imminent and it doesn't make sense to run without a merge-ready EE anymore.\r\n    ",

There is some more complexity, though. I have started to think along the lines of ensuring that the \"EE\" and the \"eth1\" should be the same nodes. It's a fairly remote scenario, but if we have a case where those nodes are different then we risk the scenario where they're on different chains. This could result in voting in an `eth1_data` that isn't compatible with the `execution_payload`s in the chain.\r\n\r\nAlong these lines, I'd been considering adding in a check to ensure that whenever we vote upon an `eth1_data` we also ensure that the `eth1_data.block_hash` is also present in one of the `execution_payload.block_hashes` in the canonical chain. It would have some edge-cases around the transition, but it would (practically) ensure that we never vote in an `eth1_data` that conflicts with a prior one. Voting in conflicting `eth1_data` is one of the scenarios that can break beacon chain liveness :scream: ",

    "body": "I have thought through this and come up with some use-cases and changes required to achieve them. I have already done *some* of this work in the abandoned #3160, but it's not necessarily the same as this.\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\n### Use case 1: Pre-merge\r\n\r\nThe user wants to use multiple eth1 nodes:\r\n\r\n`lighthouse bn --eth1-endpoints http://localhost:8545,http://shared-backup.com`\r\n\r\n### Use case 2: Post-merge\r\n\r\nThe user wants the \"eth1\" functionality to happen over the same JWT-authenticated connection as the engine API and they don't want to repeat themselves via `--eth1-endpoints`:\r\n\r\n`lighthouse bn --execution-endpoint http://localhost:8551 --execution-jwt ./jwt.key`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Changes to CLI Flags\r\n\r\n### Objectives\r\n\r\n1. Update our CLI so it no longer supports multiple execution endpoints (without removing internal support from the `execution_layer` crate, we can do that later).\r\n1. Allow users to specify `--execution-endpoint` and `--execution-jwt` flags *without* also needing `--eth1-endpoints`. This is how things should operate *after* the merge.\r\n1. Allow users to specify `--eth1-endpoints` separately and continue to use multiple eth1 nodes (i.e., maintain pre-merge functionality).\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n1. Rename the `--execution-endpoints` flag to `--execution-endpoint` (remove plural)\r\n    - Change it so it only takes a single value.\r\n    - Add an alias to the old `--execution-endpoints` value, so it's backwards compatible (unless multiple values are supplied)\r\n1. Rename the `--jwts-secrets` flag to `--execution-jwt`\r\n    - Change it so it only takes a single value.\r\n    - Add an alias to the old `--jwts-secrets` value, so it's backwards compatible (unless multiple values are supplied)\r\n    - The rename from \"jwt-secrets\" to \"execution-jwt\" is so that related flags are close together in alphabetical sort.\r\n1. Rename `--jwt-id` to `--execution-jwt-id`\r\n    - Add alias to `--jwt-id` for full backwards compat.\r\n1. Rename `--jwt-version` to `--execution-jwt-version`\r\n    - Add alias to `--jwt-version` for full backwards compat.\r\n    \r\n## Changes to internal functionality\r\n\r\n### Objectives\r\n\r\n1. Allow our current \"eth1\" crate to communicate with an eth1 node (EE) with JWT authentication (as per the engine API). This is how things should work post-merge.\r\n1. Maintain current support for non-JWT comms to retain pre-merge functionality.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n1. Move the RPC functions in [`eth1/src/http.rs`](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/stable/beacon_node/eth1/src/http.rs) into [`execution_layer/src/engine_api/http.rs`](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/stable/beacon_node/execution_layer/src/engine_api/http.rs).\r\n1. From the `eth1` crate, import the RPC functionality by importing [`execution_layer/src/engine_api/http.rs`](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/stable/beacon_node/execution_layer/src/engine_api/http.rs).\r\n1. Allow the `eth1` crate to take an *optional* JWT token.",

    "body": "> Will the execution-endpoint serve the same content as that what would have been served with port 8545\r\n\r\nYes that's correct. It will be a jwt-authenticated endpoint over which the execution engine will expose the engine namespace and all other namespaces that are exposed over the non-auth http endpoint (eth, net etc)",
