  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nIn order to function as a block producer, the beacon node (BN) must use connect to an eth1 node and obtain information about the eth1 chain.\r\n\r\nPresently, we only support this connection via HTTP-based JSON-RPC and I think we should add support for the IPC seeing as it's simpler and much faster. It would also make things a little nicer for our devops; we use the IPC for submitting deposits via `lighthouse account`, however we require the HTTP API for block production. This means that if we want to use the same geth instance for both tasks we we need to use both `--unlock` and `--rpc` which means we need `--allow-insecure-unlock` which is... wait for it... insecure.\r\n\r\nThe interesting part is is that we don't use the [`web3` crate](https://crates.io/crates/web3), instead we have this [http.rs](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/master/beacon_node/eth1/src/http.rs) file which contains all the neccessary logic to talk to an eth1 node via hyper. We originally used `web3` created however it panic-ed on me once so I decided that it was overkill when we can completely replace it with <400 lines of code. That being said, we now need IPC support so that <400 lines has probably expanded.\r\n\r\nI haven't done IPC comms via Rust before, but I suspect it's pretty straight forward and we can re-use the JSON datastructures we already have. Given that we accept the `endpoint` as `http://....` we could also just `ipc://` and make the change transparent to the upstream user.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
