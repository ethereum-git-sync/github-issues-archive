  "body": "The original purpose of the `fee_recipient_file` was to allow the user to change a validator's `fee_recipient` on the fly (that is, without restarting the validator client).\r\n\r\nBut there is now a new [validator keymanager API endpoint](https://ethereum.github.io/keymanager-APIs/#/Fee%20Recipient) for doing this. See:\r\n* #3173\r\n* #3213\r\n\r\nIn order to implement this API endpoint, we must persist changes to the `fee_recipient` made via the API in the `validator_definitions.yml` file. This will automatically override the settings in the `fee_recipient_file`.\r\n\r\nSo this endpoint not only makes the `fee_recipient_file` unnecessary, it makes it useless if the API endpoint is used.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, in the future, there will be additional configuration options that can be set on a per-validator basis (like the `gas_limit`). There's no point in having the `fee_recipient` be the only option that is set via a file, nor do we want to implement a new file type for each setting as it would become tedious to manage, especially when there are these API endpoints to change them.\r\n\r\nWe should remove the `--fee_recipient_file` functionality and manage these changes entirely via API endpoints. For options that don't yet have an official endpoint we should utilize [a PATCH endpoint](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/api-vc-endpoints.html#patch-lighthousevalidatorsvoting_pubkey).\r\n\r\nWe should remove this before the merge as most people will not have added it to their workflows yet.",

Each request would take just 10-100 milliseconds to run and the whole operation should complete in around a minute\r\n\r\nDo you envisage updating 1000s of fee recipients at a time to _different_ values? Or would you likely be updating them all to the same value? Would you be well-served by a method to update the default fee recipient, as @realbigsean describes here: https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/3213#issuecomment-1158014615 ?",

    "body": "@michaelsproul, we provide a service to customers, and multiple customer stakes' are allocated through our validators.\r\n\r\nWe could have 1000 fee recipients updated at the same time to different values or the same values. It all depends on how our customers update their records (for example, they can update their account to 1000 validators at once to the same address).\r\n\r\nThe default fee recipient is not used to manage the customer's fee recipient. Validators are shared, so the default one is a fallback.\r\n\r\nRegarding PR #3213, we already have the `default_fee_recipient` in the fee recipients file. I don't see any difference moving to the `validator_definitions.yaml` when there is an argument for it. I only see an advantage to someone that *only* use one fee recipient for all keys in the validator, which is not our case. Moreover, we don't often change the default one (it's a configured value, not changed dynamically like the mapping `public_key->fee_recipient_address`.\r\n\r\n",

If you could please migrate your tools to use the HTTP API before upgrading to our next release that would be greatly appreciated :pray: Thanks!\r\n\r\n(slightly more context here: https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/3213#pullrequestreview-1029418550)",

    "body": "@ricardolyn Based on a conversation with the Teku devs I think they're not re-reading the config file on every block proposal, but just doing it once per epoch.\r\n\r\nIf we do adopt the proposer config format in Lighthouse we'd likely do it with 2 separate flags `--proposer-config` and `--proposer-config-url`. This would allow us to only re-read the file on a IO notification from the OS (using something like https://github.com/notify-rs/notify). Unfortunately for the HTTP API we're out of luck and will just have to poll.\r\n\r\nAre you using files or the HTTP API in your Teku setup @ricardolyn?",
