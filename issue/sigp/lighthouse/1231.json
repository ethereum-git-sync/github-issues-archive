No log is generated\r\n\r\nEven worse, I have 3 validators, one of the validators had a `.lock` file in the validator folder. When starting the client interactivly the console spit back:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFailed to init validator client: unable to decrypt all validator directories: ValidatorDirError(DirectoryLocked(\"/home/lighthouse/.lighthouse/validators/<validatorid>\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich means all 3 of my validators have been offline because 1 validator had a file lock on it. I had to run the client in an interactive console to know what was going on.\r\n\r\n## Version\r\n`Lighthouse 0.1.2`\r\n\r\n## Present Behaviour\r\n\r\n.lock file prevents all validators from starting. No log is generated.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\nI would expect the other 2 validators to still be brought online, and an error message for the failure. I'd also expect things that are displayed to the console interactively to also generate logs messages...\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\nPut a `.lock` file in a validator directory",
