Moreover, when I miss the slot, I usually get a event which is completely blank and cannot be unmarshalled to JSON.\r\n\r\n## Version\r\n\r\nI'm using the v3.1.0 version.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\nI expect to receive head events for all the slots.\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how to resolve this.\r\n",

The current semantics of the `head` event is that it fires only when the head changes, so there won't be any event published if a slot is skipped (the proposer fails to publish a block).",
