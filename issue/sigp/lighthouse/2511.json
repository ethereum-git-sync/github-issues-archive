    "body": "Hmm, good point. Whilst I wouldn't consider #1269 to be a canonical specification of our signing scheme (I'd point to [this](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/api-vc-sig-header.html) instead), you're right that it would make sense that we'd follow the [IETF Signature spec](https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-cavage-http-signatures-01.html) and sign across the headers as well as the body (like you suggested). Having a signature across a `Date` header seems rather useful.\r\n\r\nAt present, this isn't a vulnerability since we're doing everything we promise in the docs. However, it's a great opportunity for improvement.\r\n\r\nThis will be a breaking change, so we can't include it in the `v1.5.x` series. Whilst `v1.5.0` is still unreleased, I don't think we should delay the release for this.\r\n\r\nThanks again @dnkolegov, much appreciated.\r\n",
