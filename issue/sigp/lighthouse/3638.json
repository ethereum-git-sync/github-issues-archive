  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nThere are a few places where we use `SystemTime::now` rather than the slot clock. These are fine when running on real machines with real clocks, but can cause issues in automated tests where the slot clock is spoofed but the system clock is not. For example, this condition trips on all our execution layer tests because of the `SystemTime::now`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/01e84b71f524968f5b940fbd2fa31d29408b6581/beacon_node/execution_layer/src/lib.rs#L1035-L1049\r\n\r\n## Version\r\n\r\nLighthouse v3.1.2\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\nReplace calls to `SystemTime::now` by calls to the slot clock. This may require plumbing the slot clock around. I suspect we might also want to put it behind an `Arc` rather than cloning it, so that it can easily be updated from a single place.\r\n",
