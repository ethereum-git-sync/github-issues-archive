  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nValidator clients using fallback beacon nodes may miss out on quality block proposals in some situations because they don't send proposer preparation and validator registration messages to any beacon node except the primary. If the primary fails before these messages are re-sent, then a fallback BN which lacks the preparations and registrations will be used instead, likely resulting in a block with 0 transactions, as the BN sends forkchoiceUpdated\r\n\r\nThis issue is mostly addressed by https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/3529, which broadcasts the proposer preparation messages. However it does not (presently) broadcast the validator registrations. This may be less of an issue, as the builder(s) probably remember the registrations from the primary beacon node.\r\n\r\nCC @realbigsean @pawanjay176 \r\n",

Both BN's connected to the same set of relays, so broadcasting registrations would end up doubling  the load of messages relays have to process\r\n2. Only the primary BN has a builder configured, assuming if we are on our fallback node we should be as conservative as possible. Here a broadcast wouldn't be beneficial and would just produce some `ERRO`'s \r\n\r\nI think generally registrations are sent with enough frequency and that relays cache them for long enough that we're OK to just send them to the first successful node. \r\n",
