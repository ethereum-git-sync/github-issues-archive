  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nThe validator client currently logs inability to connect to any beacon node as a warning: `WARN Unable to connect to a beacon node`\r\n\r\nThe same severity as a single beacon node being down when failover is configured: `WARN Offline beacon node`\r\n\r\nI'd like to see the inability to connect to any beacon node become an ERR or CRIT log, please. Something like `ERR Unable to connect to a beacon node`\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\n\r\nThis simplifies alerting. Instead of needing to parse logs for \"Unable to connect\", I can use `error_total` and `crit_total` to raise critical alerts that wake someone up, and `warn_total` as a non-critical alert that gets handled during business hours.\r\n",
