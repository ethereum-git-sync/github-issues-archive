Does this value need to be quoted for consistency with other integer types? Does it also need to be serialized into big-endian hex?\r\n\r\nWill there be any other additions into this fork beyond supporting Verkle Trees?\r\n\r\n## Current Testnets\r\n\r\n### Beverly Hills\r\n\r\nRunning unchanged Consensus (all) with Verkle-enabled Execution (Geth-only)\r\n[Testnet link](https://beverlyhills.ethpandaops.io/)\r\n\r\n### Kaustinen\r\nRunning Verkle-enabled Consensus (Lighthouse-only) with Verkle-enabled Execution (Geth-only)\r\n[Testnet link](https://kaustinen.ethpandaops.io/)\r\n\r\nCurrently running the full spec with the following changes:\r\n - `new_value` is omitted from the `SuffixStateDiff` container.\r\n - `ExecutionWitness` is added directly to the Bellatrix `ExecutionPayload` without any fork implementation.\r\n - Is currently using `Union[None, T]` for optionals.\r\n",
