We need to update our function.\r\n\r\nResources:\r\n- Our shuffle crate: https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/tree/master/beacon_chain/utils/shuffling\r\n- Spec update PR: https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/pull/65\r\n\r\n## Present Behaviour\r\n\r\n`RAND_MAX` is presently set to `2**24`.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\n`RAND_MAX` should be `2**24 - 1`.\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\n1. Change `RAND_MAX`\r\n2. Use [sigp/shuffling_sandbox](https://github.com/sigp/shuffling_sandbox) to generate some test vectors. There's only 1 test vector in there now, we should throw in multiple (make sure you use different list sizes).\r\n\r\nHint: shuffling_sandbox cmd: `$ python sandbox.py print --list-size LIST_SIZE`",
