  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\n_Parse_ the tests, but not necessarily _pass_ them. \r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nFor now, fork my [v0.5.0](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/308) branch and build on top of it. (Please don't commit to that branch directly).\r\n\r\nThere are test vectors here: https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-tests/tree/master/state. Note: one of them is 34Mb so we **don't** want to commit it to our repo -- we'll likely have to add a build script that pulls it from Github when they're run.\r\n\r\nI have started parsing the tests [here](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/37b8e9f39a50737bd7d74f984fc614d6bf6e5f49/eth2/state_processing/tests/tests.rs). It doesn't work last time I tried it but it _might_ work now we have the v0.5.0 objects. I'd be surprised if it works TBH.\r\n\r\n## Todo\r\n\r\n1. Ensure we can parse all of the above YAML test vectors in to Rust structs that we can later use to run tests.\r\n2. If you get around to it, make a [Rust build script](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/build-scripts.html) that pulls the vectors from github into a local dir (say, `state_processing/specs`) **without** adding them to the git tree.\r\n",
