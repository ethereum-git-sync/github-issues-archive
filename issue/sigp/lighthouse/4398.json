  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nWhen I ran Lighthouse under a profiler a while ago, one of the main consumers of CPU time was _attestation signature decoding_, i.e. converting SSZ bytes off the wire into the `AggregateSignature` type that exists inside `Attestation`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/c547a11b0da48db6fdd03bca2c6ce2448bbcc3a9/consensus/types/src/attestation.rs#L41-L45\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons this is expensive is that encoded signatures are compressed, and decompression is slow.\r\n\r\nWith changes like #3493 set to land soon, many of the aggregate attestations we receive on gossip could be ignored, _before their signatures are even checked_. This provides an opportunity to save some time that would be spent unnecessarily decompressing signatures.\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\nWe need to add a new type, or modify the existing types, so that aggregate attestations are initially decoded using a `signature: SignatureBytes` field instead of an `AggregateSignature`. One way to do this would be:\r\n\r\n- Add a new `LazyAttestation` type which uses `SignatureBytes` for the signature instead of `AggregateSignature`. Add a method on this type that converts it to a regular `Attestation` by calling `.decompress()` on the bytes, and then converts to an aggregate signature using [`From`](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/c547a11b0da48db6fdd03bca2c6ce2448bbcc3a9/crypto/bls/src/generic_aggregate_signature.rs#L230-L242).\r\n- Add a new `LazySignedAggregateAndProof` type which wraps `LazyAttestation`. Make sure that the gossip decoding uses this type instead of the full `SignedAggregateAndProof`.\r\n- Work out how to skip decompression for unviable attestations before they reach the batch signature verification step [here](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/c547a11b0da48db6fdd03bca2c6ce2448bbcc3a9/beacon_node/beacon_chain/src/attestation_verification/batch.rs#L28-L135). This will be the hardest part. We might want to add a step which filters subsets/duplicate aggregates out of the batch before signature verification. This might still waste a bit of time doing decompression if aggregates in the same batch are redundant, but that's probably an acceptable trade-off.\r\n\r\nHopefully these changes might result in lower CPU usage on low-end hardware. Machines with low validator counts that are only subscribed to a few subnets will likely see the most improvement, as the majority of attestations they verify are aggregates",
