  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nThe `account wallet create` command seems to ignore the global datadir option.\r\n\r\nAfter trying different things and looking at help commands, and then reading through the source code, it turns out that the \"datadir\" option is not used. Even though it is repeated in every command help screen.\r\n\r\nI needed the \"base-dir\" option under the account command.\r\n\r\n## Version\r\n\r\n`61496d8dad41525db95920737125c2942e07592c` (current master branch). Originally found on a merge of the ENR + health check PRs onto master. But all unrelated to the account cli work.\r\n\r\n## Present Behaviour\r\n\r\n`datadir` option is ignored, `base-dir` is only option for customization.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\nIf this basedir is not specified, it should default to `{datadir}/wallets`, to adapt to the use of the custom datadir. Instead of going straight to `~/.lighthouse/wallets`. It's confusing to see it end up being used, even though the datadir was changed.\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\nChange the defaulting to use datadir option before completely falling back to the default (when base-dir is not specified)\r\n\r\n",
