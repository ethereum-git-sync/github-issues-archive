  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nAdd manually imported validators to the slashing protection DB or add the ability to `--init-slashing-protection` per validator.\r\n\r\n## Version\r\n\r\n```\r\nLighthouse v1.3.0-3a24ca5\r\nBLS Library: blst-portable\r\nSpecs: mainnet (true), minimal (false), v0.12.3 (false)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Present Behaviour\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid having my validator password stored as clear text in `validator_definitions.yml` I used `lighthouse validator account recover` when creating my keys (using the `deposit` tool) on a different (air-gapped) computer for number of validators so that I can later copy both the secrets and validtor files to the server running lighthouse without exposing my mnemonic/passwords.\r\n\r\nDoing the above when starting the first validator works fine but after a couple of days I decided to add a validator and copy the generated secret and validator `voting-keystore.json` files to the server running lighthouse, the validator client will refused to start with the below error.\r\n\r\n`CRIT Failed to start validator client        reason: One or more validators not found in slashing protection database.`\r\n\r\nThat forced me to wait 2 epochs and restart the client with `--init-slashing-protection`.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\nLighthouse already auto-detects new validators as evident by the below log message:\r\n`INFO Completed validator discovery           new_validators: 1`\r\n\r\nAt that point lighthouse can add the new validator to the already existing slashing protection DB or if it's too risky perhaps add the option to `--init-slashing-protection <pubkey>`?\r\n",
