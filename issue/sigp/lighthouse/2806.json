  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nOne strategy for improving block processing times during re-org (https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/issues/2805) that I've been thinking about for a while would be to make it _extremely cheap_ to clone and duplicate `BeaconState`s. Currently a lot of our caches and optimisations dance around the fact that `BeaconState`s are huge 30-50MB objects that take 200ms+ to clone. Building a tree hash cache from scratch also takes ~1s.\r\n\r\nUsing persistent data structures that are copy-on-write, we could exploit the large amount of data shared between states at nearby slots. If each `BeaconState` were represented as a tree with `Arc` nodes, then we could keep a large number of them in memory, and use these to accelerate block processing. In smooth network conditions we could probably keep every state since finalization in memory: with and without blocks applied.\r\n\r\nOn the implementation side, we could revive my old implementation of the \"validator tree\" from EthDenver 2020, which lives in this defunct branch: https://github.com/michaelsproul/lighthouse/tree/validator-tree-ethdenver. It was inspired by talks with Proto about [Remerkleable](https://github.com/protolambda/remerkleable).\r\n\r\nThis issue is pretty vague currently, but I'll add to it as my thinking on it develops (it also links in to using some sort of diff-based representation to store states on disk).\r\n",
