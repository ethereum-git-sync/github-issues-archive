    "body": "Amongst the reasons that 32-bit support is a bit involved are:\r\n\r\n* For simplicity, it's nice to assume that `usize`s are 64 bits. The spec uses a lot of `u64`s as indexes into vectors, lists, etc, and they inevitably end up getting converted to `usize`s. Changing this in Lighthouse would require very careful consideration of all the places where conversions between the two are made (possible, but not a priority right now).\r\n* We're experimenting with [LMDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Memory-Mapped_Database) as a possible on-disk database. It uses memory mapped files to represent the entire on-disk database as virtual memory, which only really works on 64-bit+ machines, because the 4GiB of address space afforded by 32-bit architectures isn't enough to represent the entire database _and_ the rest of the process's memory.",
