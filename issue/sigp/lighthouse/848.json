  "body": "## Introduction\r\n\r\nPreviously we had an issue where the beacon state needs to be serialized with _compressed_ pubkeys but we need to do signature verification with _decompressed_ pubkeys. Decompressing is expensive so we want to avoid doing it every time we verify a signature. Our solution was to add an optional decompressed version to each `PublicKeyBytes` struct as a sort-of cache and just try and make sure that we keep that state in memory between block processing operations (it'll lose the decompressed versions if it goes to disk).\r\n\r\nThis works pretty well when you always built on top of a block that's in memory, but starts to fall apart when you have 100k validators and blocks are being built of old, non-cached blocks.\r\n\r\n## New solution\r\n\r\n#841 introduces a `validator_pubkey_cache: TimeoutRwLock<ValidatorPubkeyCache>` which is basically a never-shrinking list of all the _**decompressed**_ validator pubkeys we've seen, in the same order that they appear in the `BeaconState`. It relies heavily upon the idea that some `BeaconState` may have more or less validators, however they are always in the same order.\r\n\r\nWe can just use this cache during block processing and forget about dealing with the keys in the beacon state.",
