    "body": "> Is it possible to do a voluntary exit then reactivate the validator (ie, if i know my node needs to go offline for a few days)?\r\n\r\nVoluntary exits are permanent. If you want to go offline for a few days you can either soak up the penalty or use a fallback node. For short periods of time the losses from being offline should approximately equal the rewards from being online, so being offline for 2 days can be cancelled out by being online again for 2 days.\r\n\r\n> After the merge, how can we use a BLS withdrawal keypair to withdraw staked eth?\r\n\r\nThis hasn't been specified exactly yet, and won't be included in the merge hard fork. It will likely be some variant of signing an Eth1 (160-byte) address with your BLS withdrawal key, and then withdrawing the funds to the execution layer. We expect that this will ship in the fork following the merge (i.e. mid-late 2022).\r\n\r\n> Staking is a big commitment and I'd feel much more comfortable diving in if I saw some public documentation (either lighthouse-specific, or general) that clarifies those two issues, but I can't find any.\r\n\r\nFair point. I guess you saw the page on [Voluntary Exits](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/voluntary-exit.html), I agree it could do with some clarification that exits are irreversible, other than in the CLI message.\r\n\r\n[The Launchpad](https://launchpad.ethereum.org/) includes a better message on step 7 of the first page:\r\n\r\n![launchpad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4452260/137027477-22bc75db-3a55-4c7d-82ba-f22dd34b8abb.png)\r\n\r\n",
