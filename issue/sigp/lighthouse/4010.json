Not a whole lot of CPU time IIRC, but it's nice to avoid especially when we might have 16 in a block.\r\n\r\nIf we use `PublicKey` then decompression happens during SSZ deserialization and then never again. If we use `PublicKeyBytes` then decompression happens each time we verify the signature (e.g., once we we receive it on gossip and then once when we include it in a block).\r\n\r\nI think the only case for using `PublicKeyBytes` would be if we need to accept messages which have *invalid* public keys (like we do with `Deposit`). I don't think that's ever the case.\r\n\r\nI don't think this is a high enough priority to be included in the `v3.5.0` release.\r\n",
