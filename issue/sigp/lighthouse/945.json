  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nIt is currently possible to import a block into Lighthouse that conflicts with finality.\r\n\r\nFor this issue I'm going to refer to the [`gossip_multi_block`](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/tree/gossip-multi-block) branch, since it refactors block processing. Do not start to address this issue from `master`, build from `gossip_multi_block`.\r\n\r\n## Present Behaviour\r\n\r\nDuring import we use [`check_block_against_finalized_slot`](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/8b322631a4c1dd29794702c50d15369fa8c51384/beacon_node/beacon_chain/src/block_verification.rs#L571-L593) to check to see if a block conflicts with finalization. Whilst this is a useful cheap check, it is not sufficient to ensure that we never import a block that conflicts with finalization.\r\n\r\nConsider the following scenario:\r\n\r\n- The finalized slot is `128` and this slot contains a block.\r\n- Block `B` is provided with slot `129` and a parent at slot `127`.\r\n\r\n`check_block_against_finalized_slot` would accept `B`, since the slot of `B` is higher than the finalized slot, however, choosing `B` as head would revert the block at finalized slot `128`.\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\nReject any blocks where the parent block is less than or equal to the finalized epoch and it's root is not equal to the finalized root.\r\n",
