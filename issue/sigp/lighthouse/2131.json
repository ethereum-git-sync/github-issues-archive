  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nDiscv5 currently keeps IP voting history for 5 minutes as this is the time window for pinging peers. This makes it harder for malicious nodes to quickly manipulate our ENR IP, however it is less reactive. \r\n\r\nFor efficiency we also ping peers in our routing table every 5 minutes. This creates bursts of pings and again makes the ENR IP less reactive. We should revert back to using a DelayQueue structure for individual peers in the routing table and ping each peer with a 5 minute interval. \r\n\r\nThere is currently a known panic tokio's delayqueue, so we should hold off from doing this until that is resolved. tokio-rs/tokio#3270\r\n\r\n\r\n",
