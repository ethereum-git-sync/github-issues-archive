This has presented an issue for the eth1-sim where it's taking too long for the validator to read the keypairs so it can't:\r\n\r\n- Start the validators quick enough.\r\n- Start the finality, etc checks at the right time.\r\n\r\nThis is a fairly complicated issue as it involves dealing with async timing problems. That being said, it's very much solvable.\r\n\r\nHere's the `.github/workflows/test-suite.yml` except that should be re-added once the sim passes:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n  eth1-simulator-ubuntu:\r\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\r\n    needs: cargo-fmt\r\n    steps:\r\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v1\r\n    - name: Install ganache-cli\r\n      run: sudo npm install -g ganache-cli\r\n    - name: Run the beacon chain sim that starts from an eth1 contract\r\n      run: cargo run --release --bin simulator eth1-sim\r\n```\r\n",
