The rate-limit could maybe be as simple as a configurable delay after each batch, which should give the rest of the node some room to breath. Someone more familiar with sync would have a better idea (@AgeManning @divagant-martian).",

    "body": "Some thoughts - I dont think we go too fancy and have dynamic adjustments to load based on time of processing in the queue (but we could if someone really wanted to). Some simple ways to approach:\r\n- Configurable batch buffer sizes - We have a fixed buffer size, which keeps the processor busy with blocks (depending on its speed). If we set the batch buffer size to 1 for example, then we would process a block then start downloading another block. This would give some relief. \r\n- As diva suggested add a delay to sending back the processed block. Sync will only progress once a block processing has been submitted. So if we artificially slow down that process, sync will artificially slow down processing.\r\n- Adjust priorities in the beacon processor. Perhaps we could only process a beacon block from backfill once all other queues are depleted. As Backfill is not very important it should if a block stays there processing indefinately. Sync will just wait until it eventually goes through. \r\n\r\nJust my 2 cents.",

If it's already low priority and it's still interfering with other jobs, lowering the batch size should help.

    "body": "I wanted to add some notes after a discussion with @divagant-martian and @AgeManning this morning.\r\n\r\nBroadly, there are three components involved in back-filling right now:\r\n\r\n- The \"networking stack\"\r\n    - Determines the required blocks and downloads them from peers.\r\n- The [`BeaconProcessor`](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/stable/beacon_node/network/src/beacon_processor/mod.rs)\r\n    - Receives unvalidated blocks from the networking stack and queues them for validation/import.\r\n- The [`BeaconChain`](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/21dec6f603edd53ad8d2372941c77ab8098d3b5a/beacon_node/beacon_chain/src/historical_blocks.rs#L60-L63)\r\n    - Receives batches dequeued by the `BeaconProcessor` and verifies them, ultimately sending a result back to the networking stack so it can get more blocks.\r\n\r\nThe current consensus for rate-limiting is that it should happen in the `BeaconProcessor`. This is because the networking stack makes no assumptions about how fast the batches are processed and the `BeaconChain` makes no assumptions about how frequently it should process backfill batches. Therefore, it seems fine for the `BeaconProcessor` to receive batches and arbitrarily delay their processing as it sees fit.\r\n\r\nThe `BeaconProcessor` is effectively bunch of FIFO/LIFO queues and a [loop routine](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/38514c07f222ff7783834c48cf5c0a6ee7f346d0/beacon_node/network/src/beacon_processor/mod.rs#L1023-L1419) that pops messages out of an `event_rx: mpsc::Receiver<WorkEvent<T>>` channel and either:\r\n\r\n1. Processes the event immediately if there is a free \"worker\".\r\n2. If there are no free workers, queues the message for later processing.\r\n\r\nWe want backfill batches to follow a different flow. I believe that flow should look like this:\r\n\r\n1. A backfill batch from the network immediately goes into a newly-added FIFO queue (\"newly-added\" as in added by the PR that addresses this issue).\r\n1. A newly-added routine fires an event at some intervals which tries to pop a backfill batch from the FIFO queue.\r\n1. When a backfill batched is popped from the queue, it is sent to the existing `event_rx` channel where the `BeaconProcessor` will either process it immediately or queue it for processing with the next free worker (we can probably use the existing [backfill queue](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/38514c07f222ff7783834c48cf5c0a6ee7f346d0/beacon_node/network/src/beacon_processor/mod.rs#L986) for this).\r\n\r\nThis solution would allow us to do two things:\r\n\r\n1. Slow the import of batches, therefore reducing the total CPU time spent on backfill per slot.\r\n1. Perform backfill batch processing at very specific points in time. For example, we could do it half-way through each slot when we know that we're probably not producing/processing blocks/attestations.\r\n\r\n### Setting the batch import interval\r\n\r\nWhen slowing the import of batches, it's worth considering *how slow* we're making it. Nodes are required to store at least 33024 epochs (1,056,768 slots, ~5 months) of blocks to serve them to p2p peers (see [`MIN_EPOCHS_FOR_BLOCK_REQUESTS`](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/p2p-interface.md)).\r\n\r\nThe batch size is currently 64 slots, so if we're processing one batch of blocks per slot then we're looking at a backfill time of  `1056768 / 64 * 12= 198,144` seconds (~2.29 days). The entire chain at its current length would take `5590000 / 64 * 12 = 1,048,125` seconds (12.13 days).\r\n\r\nNotably, Lighthouse currently backfills the entire chain, although we might move to `MIN_EPOCHS_FOR_BLOCK_REQUESTS` in the future.\r\n\r\nSo, my feeling is that we probably want to speed this up by processing multiple batches per slot. I don't have a good feeling for how long it takes to process a batch. I think it would be important to check that first. Assuming it's ~500ms, I'd suggest process batches at the following intervals:\r\n\r\n- 6s after slot start.\r\n- 7s after slot start\r\n- 10s after slot start.\r\n\r\nThis is very hand-wavy, though. I think we would want to do some more analysis first. These intervals should be enough to get someone started on a solution, we can revist them later.\r\n\r\n### Disable rate-limiting\r\n\r\nI think we should also provide the option for use to disable backfill rate-limiting. This allows \"archive node\" users to just sync the entire chain as fast as they can.\r\n\r\nI suggest that we backfill rate-limiting by default, though.",
