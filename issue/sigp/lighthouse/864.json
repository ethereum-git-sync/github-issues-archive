  "body": "## Introduction\r\n\r\nEth2 uses Eth1 to onboard validators (via the deposit contract). Whenever an eth2 validator produces a block, they cast a vote on some info about the eth1 chain. At the end of each `ETH1_VOTING_PERIOD`, these votes are tallied and if there is a majority then new eth1 info is enshrined in the eth2 chain.\r\n\r\nTherefore, any eth2 validator should also connect their beacon node to an eth1 node (parity, geth, etc) so they can vote about the eth1 chain. However, eth2 nodes who aren't validating don't need to connect to the eth1 chain at all.\r\n\r\nLighthouse allows for a beacon node to _optionally_ have a connection to an eth1 node; specified by the `--eth1` flag. If the `--eth1` flag is not provided, the `BeaconChain::eth1_chain` field will be `None`.\r\n\r\nAccording to [this code](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/74c34d1602cd133289d7ff4cff6c1fb0da4463cf/beacon_node/beacon_chain/src/beacon_chain.rs#L1367-L1370), it's impossible to produce a block unless the `--eth1` flag has been provided.\r\n\r\n## Issue Description\r\n\r\nThe beacon chain also has an [operation pool](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/74c34d1602cd133289d7ff4cff6c1fb0da4463cf/beacon_node/beacon_chain/src/beacon_chain.rs#L134-L136). Much like the \"tx pool\" in eth1, it stores block operations (e.g., attestations, slashings, etc) so that they can be included in a block. Notably, the operations pool is _only_ useful for producing blocks, we don't use it for anything else.\r\n\r\nNow, if it's impossible to produce a block if `beacon_chain.eth1_chain.is_none()`, then there's no point in storing things in the operation pool. We can't possible include them in a block so they're just wasting space.\r\n\r\n## How to Resolve\r\n\r\n- Search [`beacon_chain.rs`](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/master/beacon_node/beacon_chain/src/beacon_chain.rs) for times where we add things to op pool (e.g., `self.op_pool.insert...`) and make it so their insertion is conditional on `self.op_pool.is_some()`.\r\n",
