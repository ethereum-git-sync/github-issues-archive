They just link to a 404 not found.\r\nThey were removed in this commit : 845f336a592f59344f9f035a9376c40299f2232e\r\n\r\n## Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\nI imagine ideally those documents should exist.\r\nIf they don't exist, I'd suggest simply removing the links.\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\nAdding back the files, unless this was wanted, in which case simply removing the links in the README should do.\r\n\r\nPS: First issue here, please let me know if I can improve anything. Thanks!\r\n",
