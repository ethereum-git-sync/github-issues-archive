  "body": "When critical updates are published, or there are urgent problems with the clients that need all stakers to intervene, there should be a way to quickly get this information out to all Lighthouse users. I recommend:\r\n *  Setting up an email list that stakers can subscribe to and on which highly critical information can be pushed\r\n * Additionally, setting up groups/accounts on other channels (twitter, telegram, etc.) can be helpful\r\n\r\nNot all users can be expected to constantly monitor discussion channels such as discord, so having a low-noise direct channel that reliably reaches all stakers is essential.",
