    "body": "This would be a `Synced` message that just happened to be half-way printing when a `Killed` message was fired.\r\n\r\nThis generally means you've run out of RAM and the OS has killed Lighthouse because it requires more memory than is available. That `Killed` message doesn't come from LH, it comes from the OS.\r\n\r\nWith that list of running apps it seems fairly likely that RAM was exhausted.\r\n\r\nI'll close this for now, but feel free to reopen if you disagree with my conclusion :) Thanks for reporting.",
