  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nI'm trying to test some withdrawal stuff on the local_testnet. I noticed that the `lcli insecure-validators` command generates validators but doesn't store their withdrawal key information, so it's impossible for me to send BLSToExeucutionChange messages. I checked and the command [does not expose](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/4d0955cd0baa6b919f961ea21f8473acd77db649/lcli/src/main.rs#L691) the ability to [store_withdrawal_keystore](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/4d0955cd0baa6b919f961ea21f8473acd77db649/lcli/src/insecure_validators.rs#L28) even though it could.\r\n\r\nCould we expose this parameter? I can write the PR if yes. If there's any reason why you haven't, or any other way I should be going about this, please let me know!\r\n",
