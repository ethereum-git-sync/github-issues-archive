  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nLighthouse may have some apis for managing  trusted peers, like dynamic adding trusted peers; deleting trusted peers and listing trusted peers. \r\n\r\nThis is useful, especially after having \r\n[Maintain trusted peers](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/4159)\r\n[Add a flag to disable peer scoring](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/4135)\r\n\r\nCurrently we could establish a stable connection bewtween A and B, two nodes, where both of them consider other as 'trusted peer'. But If node C wants to join them, A and B should  modify their lauch flags and restart. In some situaction, e.g. staking, it is not a good idea to restart nodes very often. Moreover, node wont pruning a trusted peer, even if it is offline forever. The only way now to drop that trusted peer is to restart node .\r\n\r\n## Version\r\n\r\nLighthouse 4.3.0\r\n\r\n## Present Behaviour\r\n\r\nHave to resrat the client if we want to update trusted peer infos\r\n\r\n## Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\nHave some Lighthouse APIs for updating trusted peer information\r\nFor example, /lighthouse/addTrustedpeer; /lighthouse/deleteTrustedpeer; /lighthouse/trustedPeers\r\n\r\n",
