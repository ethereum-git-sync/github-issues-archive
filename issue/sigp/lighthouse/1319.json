  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nA Graffiti is a 32-bytes long message that is part of a [BeaconBlockBody](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/beacon-chain.md#beaconblockbody). It could be used to signal all sorts of different things on the network.\r\n\r\n## Present Behaviour\r\n\r\nCurrently, lighthouse does not allow users to specify a Graffiti, and defaults to https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/95320f8ab0141a66cd660325a4a4474a82767d70/beacon_node/beacon_chain/src/beacon_chain.rs#L56\r\n\r\n## Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\nLots of users would like to be able to edit their Graffiti.\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\nAn easy way of fixing this would be to allow Graffitis to be specified via CLI. In the future, maybe other methods could be used (such as config files maybe?)...\r\n",
