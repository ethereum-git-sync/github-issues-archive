  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nPresently Lighthouse uses an opportunistic strategy for aggregating attestations added to the op pool. Any new attestation which can be aggregated with an existing one will be aggregated here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/6d5a2b509fac7b6ffe693866f58ba49989f946d7/beacon_node/operation_pool/src/attestation_storage.rs#L163-L174\r\n\r\nIn our collaboration with Satalia they prototyped a maximum clique enumeration algorithm for doing optimal aggregation. This issue is about adopting that optimal aggregation algorithm, while keeping our greedy algorithm for max coverage.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in working on this issue DM me and I can provide a copy of the code written by Satalia. They wrote a pure Rust implementation of the [Bron-Kerbosch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bron%E2%80%93Kerbosch_algorithm) algorithm which showed good performance during testing.\r\n\r\nWe would need to overhaul how we handle _unaggregated_ attestations in the `naive_aggregation_pool` so that we keep single attestations unaggregated. This might be somewhat delicate.\r\n\r\n## Version\r\n\r\nLighthouse v3.2.1\r\n",
