Many Ethereum users have lost ETH by not understanding the risks of having an open http port so non-stakers should be required to use `--http` if they want it open. This would follow the geth convention for security for web3 interactions where users have to use  `--http` or `--ws` with only IPC active by default without a flag. This may also make things easier for phase 1.5/2 when ETH transactions are activated.\r\n",
