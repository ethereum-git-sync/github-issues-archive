  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nSince we made the hot database sparse, disk reads of states have **increased** from around 100MB/min to 800MB/min. This is due to the loading of epoch boundary states when processing attestations, which bypasses the checkpoint cache.\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\nI have a work-in-progress implementation on my [`epoch-boundary-cache`](https://github.com/michaelsproul/lighthouse/tree/epoch-boundary-cache) branch that uses the existing checkpoint cache, but has the disadvantage of increasing the size of the checkpoint cache from 4 to 70 (it needs to be >64 in order to have a good chance of the two most recent boundary states being in the cache). It successfully reduces reads to about 50MB/min, but the memory usage has proved problematic for my node, even with 4GB of memory (70 states should only be 700MB max, so this could be a manifestation of #800).\r\n\r\nIn order to keep the cache small (or at least have that as an option), I think we could use an [LRU cache](https://crates.io/crates/lru-cache) and set its minimum size to something slightly larger than 4 (10 perhaps?). During the refactor I think it would also be beneficial to split the cache into separate block and state caches, as when we load an epoch boundary state we don't have a full checkpoint, but we may want to add it to the cache if it wasn't already there.\r\n",
