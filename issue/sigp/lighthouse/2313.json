  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nI recently noticed a `CRIT` error on a VC (sorry, I lost the log) that expressed the following:\r\n\r\n1. The primary BN timed out when trying to produce an attestation with `/eth/v1/validator/attestation_data`\r\n1. The secondary BN failed with [`AttestingPriorToHead`](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/3a24ca5f14c6e6d6612fd43eca82aa0c1e6aba16/beacon_node/beacon_chain/src/beacon_chain.rs#L946-L949)\r\n\r\nI believe this is because the timeout for HTTP calls on the VC is too long at 12s (one slot):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/3a24ca5f14c6e6d6612fd43eca82aa0c1e6aba16/validator_client/src/lib.rs#L59\r\n\r\nConsidering that attestation production happens 4 seconds into the slot, we should really have a timeout that's *less than* `12 - 4 == 8` seconds. I think an even smaller timeout would be better for attestations, they're very fast to produce and I think we should really be aborting if it takes longer that 1-2s.\r\n\r\nHowever, such a short time doesn't work well for block production which is rather heavy. As such, I think the best way to solve this would be to allow for different timeouts for different requests.\r\n\r\n## Version\r\n\r\n`v1.3.0`: https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/commit/3a24ca5f14c6e6d6612fd43eca82aa0c1e6aba16\r\n",
