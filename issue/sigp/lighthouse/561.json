  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nAdd a method to [`merkle_proof::MerkleTree`](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/96a327fe500fa762fd3aa3c70fa2a17eb2c4baed/eth2/utils/merkle_proof/src/lib.rs#L28-L42) to improve efficiency.\r\n\r\n## Detail\r\n\r\nWhen we're [producing the deposit contract merkle tree](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/7eb82125ef1652871ada2d72649082f33e4a04bd/beacon_node/beacon_chain/src/beacon_chain_builder.rs#L212-L233) we need to capture the state of the merkle tree as each deposit is added.\r\n\r\nPresently, we can construct a merkle tree from a list of roots but we cannot add a root/leaf after initialization. This results in creating many mostly-identical trees over and over again.\r\n\r\nIf we had a `MerkleTree::push_leaf(&mut self, leaf: Hash256, depth: usize)` method, we could avoid re-creating the tree.\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\n- Add the `push_leaf` method to `MerkleTree`, ensuring that the root and internal nodes are updated on each call.\r\n\r\nJust adding this method is sufficient for this PR, there's no need to go upstream and try and optimize any uses of `MerkleTree` yet.\r\n",
