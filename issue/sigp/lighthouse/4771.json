    "body": "Thanks for the report. Reopening this issue as this is a valid issue and reproducible. \r\n\r\nWe found a few issues with manually starting the testnet:\r\n\r\n1. The port used in the example \r\n```\r\n./beacon_node.sh $HOME/.lighthouse/local-testnet/node_1 9000 8000 http://localhost:6000 ~/.lighthouse/local-testnet/geth_1/geth/jwtsecret\r\n```\r\nis the wrong port to connect to geth. In the example given, it should be 7000 instead.\r\n\r\n2. The genesis.json is not updated with Shanghai/Capella time. This is fixed with having another file `setup_time.sh` \r\n\r\nThe fix is here (note that I revised the ports used so that it is consistent with the one when running [start_local_testnet.sh](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/stable/scripts/local_testnet/start_local_testnet.sh):\r\n#4749 ",
