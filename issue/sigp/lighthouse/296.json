  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nThis is a more involved first issue. Some learning may be required. \r\n\r\n@protolambda has created a number of optimised versions of LMD ghost in go. This issue is for porting one of these implementations into rust and lighthouse. \r\n\r\nThe repository containing the optimised go algorithms is [here](https://github.com/protolambda/lmd-ghost). \r\n\r\nIt would be useful to add the `simple_back_prop` ([here](https://github.com/protolambda/lmd-ghost/blob/master/eth2/fork_choice/choices/simple_back_prop/simple_back_prop.go)) to the current list of fork choices we have implemented. \r\n\r\nFor more information about LMD Ghost see references within #247.\r\n\r\nHave a look at the current implementation of how fork choices are implemented: https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/master/eth2/fork_choice/src/lib.rs (and modules within). \r\n\r\nThe `BitwiseLMDGhost` struct implement's Vitalik's optimised version which is also in @protolambda's repository, so you can compare implementations. \r\n\r\nThe new implementation should implement  the `ForkChoice` trait, which specifies what to do when an attestation or block is added. See the other implementations for examples. \r\n\r\nFor further details and more explanations don't hesitate to ask @AgeManning on the gitter channel. :) ",
