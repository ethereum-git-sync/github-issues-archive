  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nLMDB uses a lot of shared memory for caching, causing the resident set size to appear large, even when most of the additional memory can be instantly cleared for use if required. See:\r\n\r\n* https://symas.com/understanding-lmdb-database-file-sizes-and-memory-utilization/\r\n* https://blogs.kolabnow.com/2018/02/13/using-and-abusing-memory-with-lmdb-in-kube\r\n* https://github.com/ledgerwatch/turbo-geth#1-htop-shows-incorrect-memory-usage\r\n\r\n## Present Behaviour\r\n\r\nWe report the size of the whole resident set as the amount of memory that Lighthouse is using (the same as `htop`'s `RES` column).\r\n\r\n## Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\nWe should report the size of the resident set _less_ the **clean** shared memory. As mentioned in the KolabNow link above, the value shown by `pmap -x` for `Dirty` memory is the relevant value. We just need a way of accessing this from Rust (TODO).\r\n\r\nWe shouldn't rush into just reporting `RES - SHARED`, because that's inaccurate, and could mislead users into thinking that Lighthouse's memory usage is lower than it actually is -- leading to confusion when an OOM or other memory issue occurs unexpectedly.\r\n",
