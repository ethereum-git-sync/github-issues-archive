Seeing max speed of 8 slots/sec on my m1 macbook pro. \r\nWe do expect sync speed to reduce since we only process after receiving both blocks and blobs, however this is atleast an order magnitude decrease in sync speeds which probably needs more investigation.\r\n\r\nMy initial guess after glancing at the logs, it seems like it is taking almost 30 secs for a single batch to get downloaded which isn't ideal.\r\n\r\nThis also might be a false alarm with my local setup, need more data points.",
