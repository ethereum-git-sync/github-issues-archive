  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nPasswordless imported keystores is a rare validator client feature implemented by Lighthouse. My main issues with it is that it's too easy to trigger and that is provides a poor user experience especially to new Lighthouse users.\r\n\r\n## Version\r\n\r\nLighthouse v4.2.0-c547a11 (stable)\r\n\r\n## Present Behaviour\r\n\r\nWhen using the `account validator import` command, it is easy and possible to omit entering a password leading to a passwordless imported keystore.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\nIt should be hard for a new Lighthouse user to import a keystore without a password.\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\nThere are many ways to solve this issue but here are 3 differents proposals:\r\n\r\n1. Keep the passwordless imported keystore feature, but always require a password with the `account validator import` command. For advanced users, simply document how it's possible to manually add a passwordless keystore in the `validator_definitions.yml` file.\r\n2. Keep the passwordless imported keystore feature, but always require a password with the `account validator import` command unless the `--enable-omitting-password` option is added to that command.\r\n3. Keep the passwordless imported keystore feature, but require a password with the `account validator import` command when the `--disable-omitting-password` option is added to that command.\r\n\r\nEach one of these proposals would be good to improve this use case. They are ordered in terms of preference to me.",
