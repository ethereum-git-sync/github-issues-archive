    "body": "What do you have the `--slots-per-restore-point` value set to? Any query that requires loading historic state is going to be slow with the default of 8192. More info here: https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/advanced_database.html\r\n\r\nThe best way to make these queries faster is to set `--slots-per-restore-point=32` but that currently uses heaps of space (4TB+). We have an experimental branch that reduces the size of a SPRP=32 node to ~250GB which we've started using for our own internal analytics, see: https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/3206, https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/3626. It makes extensive changes to the database schema so we want to make sure we get it right before releasing it (we also need to re-write the schema migration for it, as that's broken currently). I've been working on this for more than a year, but hoping to finally get it across the line soon. If you'd like to run the `tree-states` branch let me know and I can help you build it. The gist of it is that you need to clone [this repo](https://github.com/sigp/milhouse) alongside Lighthouse.",

    "body": "hey @djbakerman I think there's something else going on with your node. Delays on the order of 10ms close to the head have a different cause to the multi-second delays that @wmitsuda was getting for historic queries.\r\n\r\nThe main reason your validators attested to different blocks is because they were attesting at different slots. The validator that voted correctly on block 0xb39e80fa54124195ae110fbc34015f48388a81ba2805d7e62869c3129c278725 must have been attesting at slot [5465646](https://beaconcha.in/slot/0xb39e80fa54124195ae110fbc34015f48388a81ba2805d7e62869c3129c278725). The validator that attested incorrectly voted on the block from slot [5465656](https://beaconcha.in/slot/5465656), which probably means it was attesting at slot 5465657 and voted for the parent block. This will happen if it's slow to receive the block at 57, or slow to process it. You can grep your debug logs for `Delayed head block.*5465657` to see if that block was delayed. Or DM me your logs from around this time and I can take a look (I'm `@sproul#3907` on Discord). The reason for the 10ms delay might be that the attestation routine was trying to obtain a lock that was held by block processing. These can be held and released on the order of 1-30ms.\r\n",

Why would there be delay, from a slow/non-responding peer?\r\n\r\nEach of the validators get assigned to attest at a different slot, and different things can happen in each slot. So it's not so much that your validators are performing differently _despite_ the same machine, but that they are randomly performing about the same with a bit of variance due to how your machine performs at each slot/block.\r\n\r\nAs for why blocks in some slots are delayed, the two main components are _observation delay_ and _import delay_. The observation delay is determined by the proposer of the block, they can publish late if they are faulty or malicious. There's not much _your node_ can do about this once it happens, the only hope is that the next proposer chooses to re-org the late block. We are rolling out more aggressive re-orgs in our next release which should further disincentivise late blocks (see https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/2860).\r\n\r\nAs for the import delay, that's determined by your node software & hardware. Even if your node doesn't show signs of being maxed out, the hardware still limits how fast blocks can be processed. In particular, Lighthouse and Geth have several single-threaded and I/O bound functions that won't appear to max out your machine but _will_ consume time during block import. We are constantly optimising the clients to reduce these times, but it's delicate work and it takes time to ship meaningful gains.\r\n\r\nI've cross-checked some of the delayed head block messages you posted against my own nodes and they match. This rules out clock sync being an issue for your node. I also think the `imported_delay`s that you're seeing are within the expected range. You might see them spike to 1s+ when the execution node has a particularly large amount of work to do verifying the block.",
