I suspect it's the chain_db that's bloated.\n\nIf it is, you can try running `lighthouse db inspect --column ste --data /your/datadir` to see if the beacon state storage is the culprit (I suspect it is).\n\nWe haven't identified the bug that causes this, but have had a few reports of it. The database schema is getting completely overhauled in a few versions time, with a new system that prunes states more aggressively and so far has not shown any signs of blowing up in the same way (see the tree states releases if you're curious).\n\nStill, if we find the bug in the current DB it would be nice to fix it. Debug logs from an affected node would be helpful (DM me on Discord `@sproul`, or email me: michael at sigmaprime dot io)",

However, it would be good to understand _why_ the database is erroring, as I haven't seen this error before. Strangely the block that's missing from your DB isn't one that I can find: it's not part of the canonical chain and it wasn't seen by the couple of nodes I spot-checked (I'll check more thoroughly tomorrow).\r\n\r\nIt would be great if you could provide logs from around the time the database starting growing, as this might lead us to the mystery block and the root cause. For the best chance of success it would be great to have _debug_ level logs, which should have been written by default to your datadir at `/beacondata/beacon/logs/`. If you could find the file that has Sept 15 (or whenever the issue started on this node) and DM that to me compressed, that would be great.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
