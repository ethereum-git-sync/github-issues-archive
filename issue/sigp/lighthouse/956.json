  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nFor the naive attestation aggregation strategy, we need to search for peers for particular subnets to ensure we are connected to a number of peers on a subnet for a given future slot. \r\n\r\nCurrently the peer management is not sophisticated enough to keep track of current peers, their subnet id's and a timeout from which we should try to connect to them. \r\n\r\nAdding a timeout to the `NetworkGlobals` and giving this to the attester service, will allow the attester service to determine if we have sufficient peers on a subnet (that will be live) during the required attestation time. \r\n\r\nThe attester service may then make a more informed decision as to whether request more peers or simply extend the connection timeout. \r\n\r\nA connection timeout will prevent us dropping a peer in favour of another desired peer before the timeout expires.\r\n\r\nThis will involve updating the attester service to send a timeout along with the subnet id when searching for new peers.
