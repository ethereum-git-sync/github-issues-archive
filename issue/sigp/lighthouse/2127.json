The validator crashes immediately stating genesis has not been observed yet (logs added below). \r\n\r\n## Version\r\n\r\nThe docker image of lighthouse, `sigp/lighthouse:v1.0.4`\r\n\r\n## Present Behaviour\r\n\r\nThe validator docker image was started with the custom config found [here](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/parithosh/72b32ae41b0e016a6b546764754fc0be/raw/3836a3a08531fdcfb99addc6ea581f8a6c26dac8/custom_testnet_config.yaml)\r\n\r\nThe validator crashes with the log:\r\n```\r\n INFO Initialized validators                  enabled: 100, disabled: 0\r\n INFO Connected to beacon node                version: Lighthouse/v1.0.4-1abc70e/x86_64-linux\r\n CRIT Failed to start validator client        reason: Unable to read spec from beacon node: ServerMessage(ErrorMessage { code: 404, message: \"NOT_FOUND: Beacon chain genesis has not yet been observed.\", stacktraces: [] })\r\n INFO Internal shutdown received              reason: Failed to start validator client\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\nThe validator should wait and continue to poll the beacon node till genesis has been observed. \r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n- Copy the custom testnet config file, edit the genesis time to a time in the future\r\n- Start the validator and beacon containers with `--testnet-dir=custom_testnet_config.yaml` and required flags\r\n- Check logs of the validator container\r\n",
