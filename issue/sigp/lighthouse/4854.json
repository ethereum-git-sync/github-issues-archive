  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nThe Lighthouse validator manager `import` command takes a [`Vec<ValidatorSpecification>`](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/441fc1691b69f9edc4bbdc6665f3efab16265c9b/validator_manager/src/common.rs#L42) as input, which makes it unsuitable for use with keystores from non-Lighthouse sources.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to have a command that can import standard keystore files, with options for passwords, etc. Basically an analogue of the old _account-manager_ import command that works with the keymanager API.\r\n\r\nFor completeness it would also be good to have basic commands for the other key-manager APIs like list, delete, etc, which don't use any Lighthouse-specific extensions. This would allow interop with non-Lighthouse VCs, and provide a nicer front-end to the KM APIs that doesn't involve crafting JSON by hand.\r\n\r\n## Version\r\n\r\nLighthouse v4.5.0\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\nAdd new commands to `lighthouse validator-manager` which _just_ use the standard APIs.\r\n",
