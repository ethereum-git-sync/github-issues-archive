    "body": "Hi @zack-scott \r\n\r\nThat would be great! I haven't really look into the Altair calculation in depth, but happy to look into it and try to answer any questions.\r\n\r\n> which would mean everything post Phase0 needs inactivity penalty implemented I believe\r\n\r\nYes that's right, the inactivity penalty calculation is missing  on all post-Altair versions. \r\n\r\nWe already have a way to calculate the inactivity penalty in a generic way, so you probably won't need to worry about adding this match arm, instead you could use `spec.inactivity_penalty_quotient_for_state(state)`, which is currently used here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/f2223feb21bb10dbdebce097c5cda384b1ff44a3/consensus/state_processing/src/per_epoch_processing/altair/rewards_and_penalties.rs#L119-L128\r\n\r\nIf there's a way you could re-use the some of the functionalities in `state_processing` without modifying it, that would be ideal.  e.g. `spec.inactivity_penalty_quotient_for_state(state)` seems like something you can reuse without having to modify.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to verify the calculation results your calculation with a similar test like this one (but for post-altair):\r\nhttps://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/fc7f1ba6b94ac3300338aad4d5168aaac5df3fac/beacon_node/beacon_chain/tests/rewards.rs#L171\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any questions!",
