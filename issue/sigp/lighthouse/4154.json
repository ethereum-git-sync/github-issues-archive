  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nI inadvertently uploaded a keystore for a validator that had not been deposited and was not active. I had 31 other validators that were active. (This was on the Prater testnet)  \r\n\r\nThe Lighthouse logs kept saying:\r\nINFO Listening for doppelgangers                             doppelganger_detecting_validators: 1, service: notifier\r\n\r\nI couldn't figure out why one of my validators was still doing doppelganger detection. Moreover, there was no indication which validator was the one in question.\r\n\r\nI had to restart Lighthouse then pull out the information from the logs about which validators got activated, then compare this to my master list of validators in order to identify the inoperable one by process of elimination.\r\n\r\nOnly then could I see that I had uploaded a non-deposited keystore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Version\r\n\r\nLighthouse version 3.5.1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\nFor starters, when telling me it's listening for doppelgangers, it should indicate what Validator Index Number (or pubkey) it is listening for.  Don't make me guess.\r\n\r\nIn this case, where the validator didn't exist because it hadn't been deposited, instead of telling me that it was listening for doppelgangers, it should have said 1 Validator is Not Activated on Beacon Chain (Pubkey 0xabce....wxyz)\r\n\r\n\r\n",
