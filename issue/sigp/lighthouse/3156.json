  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nIt's possible that an EE will return a different fee recipient to the one provided (the `suggested_fee_recipient`) in [`get_payload`](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/bac7c3fa544495a257722aaad9cd8f72fee2f2b4/beacon_node/execution_layer/src/lib.rs#L563-L702). Whilst this is legal behaviour, I think it would make sense to raise some sort of log whenever the EE returns a different value. It might help users detect when their fees are being hijacked.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure the log level, I'm tempted to go with an `ERRO` but I'm open to suggestion.\r\n",
