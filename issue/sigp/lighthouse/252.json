  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nThe [ChainSpec](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/master/eth2/types/src/chain_spec.rs) for the validator client is presently fixed to `foundation`.\r\n\r\n`foundation` is the specification from the EF that is expected to be used in the production beacon chain.\r\n\r\nThis is not ideal as it doesn't allow for testnets.\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\nIn the long-term, I think it would be best to load the ChainSpec from a local JSON file. However, I don't think this is immediately necessary as it will add overhead (e.g., generating the JSON, shipping it with the repo, updating it as the ChainSpec structure changes, etc).\r\n\r\nI think the best approach for now would be to add a CLI flag that permits selection between the presently available `ChainSpec`s: `foundation` and `few_validators`. For example:\r\n\r\n`$ lighthouse-validator -s few_validators` or\r\n`$ lighthouse-validator -s foundation`\r\n\r\nAs we add new definitions to `ChainSpec` we can just manually update the list.\r\n\r\nIMO, loading from JSON is a testnet requirement.\r\n",
