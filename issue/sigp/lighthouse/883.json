This will add heuristics about peers as to which peers to prioritise for block downloads, which peers to kick/ban based on their past performance/behaviour.\r\n\r\nThis system should be built as general as possible for future upgrade-ability. We therefore want to have the ability to kick/ban peers at a per-protocol level.\r\n\r\nThis will involve not only a peer reputation system, but a new general `NetworkBehaviour` which references a global `ProtocolsHandler` which allows for banning/disconnects on individual libp2p protocols. This may extend to discv5, otherwise a separate rate-limit may be required to be added to our discv5 implementation.\r\n",

    "body": "Came across another interesting case. If a node loses connectivity during sync, it's syncing chain will fail and try to re-STATUS peers to restart sync. \r\nThe re-STATUS will timeout and the peers will not register as disconnected. \r\n\r\nThe peer manager may want to store number of status messages sent and if the peer doesn't respond after a specific number we should consider them disconnected and/or disconnect from them. \r\n\r\nIn fact we don't have a ping-like protocol to ensure active connections. We can use STATUS messages as ping-like packets and have timeouts determine peer liveness",
