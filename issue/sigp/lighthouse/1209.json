    "body": "Hi @tkstanczak, nice to meet you too!\r\n\r\n> would you be able to hint at the problem with headers?\r\n\r\nI haven't been following these issues, so I'm a bit behind sorry. I thought there was an issue with Nevermind headers, but perhaps I'm mistaken. I know there's an issue here that we were dealing with: https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind/issues/1958.\r\n\r\nI might leave this up to @pawanjay176 since he has more knowledge here :)\r\n\r\n> Also when you say the deposits are not coming in order, what do you mean there?\r\n\r\nThe [eth2 deposit contract](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/deposit_contract/contracts/validator_registration.vy) should be creating logs which have an always-increasing-by-one `deposit_count`. The error we're getting (`FailedToInsertDeposit(NonConsecutive { log_index: 52, expected: 51 })`) is indicating that is not the case. I've never seen this on Geth/OpenEthereum before, perhaps it's some sort of subtle difference between the implementations? Ofc, it could be a problem on our end too. Is there anything that jumps to mind @tkstanczak? :)",
