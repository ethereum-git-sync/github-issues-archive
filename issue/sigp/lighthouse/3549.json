Your options currently are:\r\n\r\n- Store all blocks and some occasional states since the point at which you [checkpoint synced](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/checkpoint-sync.html). This is the default and the closest we have to a \"pruned\" mode until changes like https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/issues/3211 and https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/issues/3209 are implemented.\r\n- \"Archive\" mode, where all blocks and all historic states are available. Depending on how you set the `--slots-per-restore-point` flag, this will use anywhere from 50GB-3TB more disk space. More info here: https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/advanced_database.html.",
