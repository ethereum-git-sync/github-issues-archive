  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nThere is a non-fatal issue, which may occur under high CPU loads where the PeerDB gets out of sync with actual connections. The symptom prints this CRIT: https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/master/beacon_node/eth2_libp2p/src/peer_manager/mod.rs#L469 which indicates we are still connected to a peer whilst the PeerDB has for some reason removed the peer. \r\n\r\nThis feels like a timing issue for handling disconnects. Further investigation is required.\r\n",
