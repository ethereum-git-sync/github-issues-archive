  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nThe [clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-clippy) linter has a lot to say about our [ssz](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/tree/master/beacon_chain/utils/ssz) implementation. We'd like to remove these warnings so we can eventually start failing builds if they trigger clippy.\r\n\r\n## Present Behaviour\r\n\r\nClippy outputs warnings when run against the ssz crate.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\nClippy should not have any warnings.\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\n1. Run clippy\r\n2. Fix lints\r\n\r\n## Bonus points\r\n\r\n- Tidy up the code (there's definitely some cases where things could be neater)\r\n- Optimise the code\r\n\r\nThe crate was written during an experimental phase of SSZ and is not as elegant as we would like. We're not attached to it and would be open to suggestions on a restructure. Please make a new issue if you'd like to restructure :)",
