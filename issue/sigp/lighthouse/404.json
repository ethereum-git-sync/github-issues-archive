  "body": "## Present Behaviour\r\n\r\nThere appears to be two main issues:\r\n1. The `hashing` crate depends on `ring`, which does not compile to WebAssembly due to its reliance on custom assembly: https://github.com/briansmith/ring/issues/657#issuecomment-396416821\r\n2. There are a couple places where a 64-bit architecture is assumed, but wasm only supports 32-bit [at this time](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup.rs/issues/1661#issuecomment-475829289). Here are the specific lines I see having issues:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/20b7bdda4a4bda304321b356b1f4d48f9bf8aa58/eth2/utils/ssz/src/decode/impls.rs#L37\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/20b7bdda4a4bda304321b356b1f4d48f9bf8aa58/eth2/utils/ssz/src/lib.rs#L49\r\n\r\n## Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\nIt would be great if this compiled to the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target as that will allow us to use the crate for developing execution environments.\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\n### Issue 1\r\nI ran some benchmarks to determine the performance tradeoff on the `hashing` library when using the WebAssembly compatible `sha2` crate vs. `ring`. Here are the results when `ring` is used (the change is against the `sha2` variant):\r\n\r\n```console\r\n> cargo bench\r\nRunning /Users/matt/Development/lighthouse/target/release/deps/benches-6dd3a9cf66f2ffae\r\nGnuplot not found, disabling plotting\r\nvec_of_8196_u64/as_ssz_bytes\r\n                        time:   [39.132 us 39.336 us 39.535 us]\r\n                        change: [-10.630% -10.046% -9.4561%] (p = 0.00 < 0.05)\r\n                        Performance has improved.\r\nFound 5 outliers among 100 measurements (5.00%)\r\n  4 (4.00%) high mild\r\n  1 (1.00%) high severe\r\n\r\nvec_of_8196_u64/from_ssz_bytes\r\n                        time:   [23.314 us 23.379 us 23.445 us]\r\n                        change: [-13.106% -12.329% -11.518%] (p = 0.00 < 0.05)\r\n                        Performance has improved.\r\nFound 4 outliers among 100 measurements (4.00%)\r\n  2 (2.00%) high mild\r\n  2 (2.00%) high severe\r\n\r\nvec_of_8196_struct/as_ssz_bytes\r\n                        time:   [325.42 us 327.53 us 329.65 us]\r\n                        change: [-8.0788% -4.2313% -1.7609%] (p = 0.01 < 0.05)\r\n                        Performance has improved.\r\nFound 8 outliers among 100 measurements (8.00%)\r\n  6 (6.00%) high mild\r\n  2 (2.00%) high severe\r\n\r\nvec_of_8196_struct/from_ssz_bytes\r\n                        time:   [184.88 us 186.16 us 187.75 us]\r\n                        change: [-5.8797% -4.2776% -2.8292%] (p = 0.00 < 0.05)\r\n                        Performance has improved.\r\nFound 5 outliers among 100 measurements (5.00%)\r\n  4 (4.00%) high mild\r\n  1 (1.00%) high severe\r\n```\r\n\r\n`ring` is clearly more performant, so I believe the best route here is to add a compiler flag to only use the `sha2` crate when compiling to a `wasm32` target.\r\n\r\n### Issue 2\r\nI'm open to suggestions here. For the `impl`, I think a compiler flag for [pointer widths](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/conditional-compilation.html#target_pointer_width) of 32 and 64 would be adequate. I'm not sure of a good solution for fixing `MAX_LENGTH_VALUE` besides using the same compiler flag or just hardcoding the value in.",
