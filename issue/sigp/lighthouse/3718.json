  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nMy validator points to 5 different beacon nodes and today the \"first\" beacon node in the list (`172.21.4.1`) went into an \"unsynced\" state (issue with Besu database, EL not syncing). I then started receiving constant notifications that my validator was missing attestations.\r\n\r\nLooking at the logs all I see is logs like this repeated:\r\n```\r\nNov 13 16:10:05.001 INFO Connected to beacon node(s)             synced: 4, available: 5, total: 5, service: notifier\r\nNov 13 16:10:05.001 INFO All validators active                   slot: 5127648, epoch: 160239, total_validators: 3, active_validators: 3, current_epoch_proposers: 0, service: notifier\r\nNov 13 16:10:10.142 INFO Connected to beacon node                endpoint: http://172.21.4.1:5052/, version: Lighthouse/v3.2.1-6d5a2b5/x86_64-linux\r\nNov 13 16:10:10.431 WARN Beacon node is not synced               endpoint: http://172.21.4.1:5052/, head_slot: 5127470, sync_distance: 178\r\nNov 13 16:10:11.417 INFO Connected to beacon node                endpoint: http://172.21.4.1:5052/, version: Lighthouse/v3.2.1-6d5a2b5/x86_64-linux\r\nNov 13 16:10:11.574 INFO Connected to beacon node                endpoint: http://172.21.4.1:5052/, version: Lighthouse/v3.2.1-6d5a2b5/x86_64-linux\r\nNov 13 16:10:11.706 WARN Beacon node is not synced               endpoint: http://172.21.4.1:5052/, head_slot: 5127470, sync_distance: 179\r\nNov 13 16:10:11.706 ERRO Unable to publish proposer preparation to all beacon nodes, error: Some endpoints failed, num_failed: 1 http://172.21.4.1:5052/ => Unavailable(NotSynced), service: preparation\r\nNov 13 16:10:11.864 WARN Beacon node is not synced               endpoint: http://172.21.4.1:5052/, head_slot: 5127470, sync_distance: 179\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll of the other beacon nodes in the list are configured with:\r\n```\r\n--subscribe-all-subnet\r\n--validator-monitor-auto\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd they're all healthy and fine, EL is fine, and Lighthouse is fine on these other beacon nodes.\r\n\r\nJust looking at the logs, and by the fact that I'm missing attestations here, would suggest to me that the fallbacks may not be working correctly?\r\n\r\nInterestingly, after I stopped the broken Besu container I did start attesting again, but there's no change in the log output. It seems strange that Lighthouse continues to connect to the non-synced node here.\r\n\r\n## Version\r\n\r\nAll Lighthouse beacon nodes and the validator are running `v3.2.1` - the Beacon Nodes are docker containers using `-modern` and the validator is a docker container as well (not `-modern`)\r\n\r\n## Present Behaviour\r\n\r\nMissing some attestations when first listed beacon node is unhealthy.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\nI would not expect to miss any attestations in this scenario with 5 beacon nodes all configured the way they are configured.\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\nidk\r\n",
