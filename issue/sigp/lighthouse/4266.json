  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\n`Connected to external block builder` doesn't mean actual connection, but means HTTP client creation, which is confusing.\r\n\r\n## Version\r\n\r\n`v4.1.0-693886b`\r\n\r\n## Present Behaviour\r\n\r\nI accidentally set the wrong external builder port and yet saw the `Connected to external block builder` log, however, no actual connection happened. I saw failures later when Lighthouse tried to send requests to the external block builder.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\nEither the log text doesn't say it's connected or it's logged after a successful connection.\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\nI see the following options:\r\n\r\n1) Change log to something like `Using an external block builder`\r\n2) Make sure a call to the external builder's `​/eth​/v1​/builder​/status` returns `200` before printing the successful connection log.\r\n3) Log usage, check `​/eth​/v1​/builder​/status`, log successful connection\r\n\r\n",
