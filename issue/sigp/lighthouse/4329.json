Looks like the endpoint \"v1/validator/blinded_blocks\" is quite slow compares to others, it always takes > 2.3 second to respond.\r\n\r\nThis is the query I used for checking:\r\n```\r\nhistogram_quantile(0.95, sum by (instance, path, le) (rate(http_api_paths_times_bucket[1h])))\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Version\r\nLighthouse v4.1.0\r\n\r\n## Present Behaviour\r\n`v1/validator/blinded_blocks` is slow. It takes more than 2.3 seconds to respond request.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behaviour\r\nv1/validator/blinded_blocks` takes less than 300ms to respond.\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\nWe are using vouch as validator client and MEV relays are enabled on vouch.\r\n\r\n",
