Looks like the endpoint \"v1/validator/blinded_blocks\" is quite slow compares to others, it always takes > 2.3 second to respond.\r\n\r\nThis is the query I used for checking:\r\n```\r\nhistogram_quantile(0.95, sum by (instance, path, le) (rate(http_api_paths_times_bucket[1h])))\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Version\r\nLighthouse v4.1.0\r\n\r\n## Present Behaviour\r\n`v1/validator/blinded_blocks` is slow. It takes more than 2.3 seconds to respond request.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behaviour\r\nv1/validator/blinded_blocks` takes less than 300ms to respond.\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\nWe are using vouch as validator client and MEV relays are enabled on vouch.\r\n\r\n",

All beacon nodes in different region received requests at the same time from vouch and for some reason the new beacon node is always the first to write `Requesting blinded header from connected builder` in the log (500ms to 800ms earlier than other nodes).\r\n\r\nI can provide you with the full logs also. Perhaps it's something wrong with my configurations.",

Does your new BN have less validators connected than your old one?",
