    "body": "According to the spec 202 means the block is invalid, so the Lighthouse VC is perhaps right in logging a CRIT\r\n\r\n> The block failed validation, but was successfully broadcast anyway. It was not integrated into the beacon node's database.\r\n\r\nI suspect the block wasn't actually invalid and this is a quirk of the Teku BN. The most likely explanation would be that the block was valid but was rejected as a duplicate because Teku saw it and processed it from gossip. I'm asking the Teku team for input on this\r\n\r\nThe spec is a bit ambiguous about the case where the block is valid but is a duplicate, which is much more likely these days with blinded blocks where the flow is:\r\n\r\n1. Send block to relay for unblinding\r\n2. Publish block\r\n3. Import block\r\n\r\nIf the relay publishes the block at step 1, then it's likely to arrive on gossip during step (2), causing step (3) to fail",
