It looks like we are reporting all of them as error with no fault from the peer, which is most likely not true.\r\n\r\nI suggest we use deny the [wildcard_enum_match_arm](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#wildcard_enum_match_arm) on this statement to ensure new errors added in the future are currectly handled. Annoying? probably, necessary? I think so\r\n",
