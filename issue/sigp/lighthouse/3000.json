Alternatively (or additionally) we could have flags for each of the different pools: `--num-threads-beacon-processor`, `--num-threads-rayon`, `--num-threads-tokio`.\r\n\r\n## Workarounds\r\n\r\nIt's possible to workaround this by manually setting the CPU count at the hypervisor level (e.g. in VirtualBox, K8s, Docker), which will then reduce the limit used by Lighthouse.\r\n\r\nThe Rayon threadpool size can also be overridden with the `RAYON_NUM_THREADS` environment variable: https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon/blob/master/FAQ.md#how-many-threads-will-rayon-spawn\r\n",
