Providing updates through the debian/ubuntu personal package archive (PPA) system can vastly improve the installation experience and increase the security of the network by expediting client upgrades.\r\n\r\n## Version\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n## Present Behaviour\r\n\r\nUsers download the release from github and install it manually, or build from source. This manual method increases downtime and is error-prone.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\nUsers should be able to add the lighthouse ppa and install lighthouse with the following command: `sudo apt install -y lighthouse` and use the standard apt update/upgrade system to maintain this package.\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\nSet up a PPA for sigmp lighthouse and maintain it for the forseeable future.\r\n",
