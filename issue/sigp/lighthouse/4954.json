  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nWe currently do not have default (or good) way of viewing some important logs from our dependencies. \r\n\r\nSpecifically discovery (discv5) and libp2p. Recently, libp2p has upgraded to use the `tracing` crate. Discv5 already uses `tracing`. \r\n\r\nWe currently can intertwine the dependency logs with our current `slog` output using the `-l` parameter switch and setting the rust environment variable `RUST_LOG`. This has worked in the past for debugging but its sub-optimal as the displayed logs are out of order and it needs to be set manually (meaning we don't have logs for past issues or from users). \r\n\r\nThe ideal situation would be that lighthouse logs both libp2p and discv5 logs to a file by default. We could then retro-actively view past logs to diagnose issues. \r\n\r\nBonus points if we can limit the size of each file and have the log file automatically remove old logs. ",
