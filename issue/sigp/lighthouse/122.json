The switch is **backwards-incompatible, but at dependency level everything is 100% compatible**, i.e. if you have older edition deps they'll work and vice versa (provided your `rustc` knows how to use Rust 2018)\r\n\r\n## Present Behaviour\r\nEverything is still in 2015 (i.e. there's no `edition = 2018`\r\n\r\n## Expected Behaviour\r\nApart from tech debt reasons, Rust 2018 makes trait objects use more explicit and makes the module system less ambiguous.\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\nHere's a page from the Edition Guide that walks through the process of moving on to 2018\r\nhttps://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/edition-guide/editions/transitioning-an-existing-project-to-a-new-edition.html\r\n",
