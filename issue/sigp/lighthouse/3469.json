  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nI was experiencing https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/issues/2858 with the issue persisting after restarting the node, and I suspect it was because I've been running with `--subscribe-all-subnets` and my peer count has been set at the default value. I suspect my peer count per subnet has been too low.\r\n\r\nPrysm has the following setting/behavior which could be good for lighthouse too:\r\n\r\n> `--minimum-peers-per-subnet <value>`\r\n> Sets the minimum number of peers that a node will attempt to peer with that are subscribed to a subnet. (default: 6)\r\n\r\nThis would bring some dynamism to max peer count, allowing extra peers if connected to many subnets (whether due to having very many validators or running with `--subscribe-all-subnets`) or if current peers are connected to only a few subnets.\r\n\r\n## Version\r\n\r\nhttps://hub.docker.com/layers/lighthouse/sigp/lighthouse/v2.5.1-modern/images/sha256-8c97c2f06e934d6da511185f86087cc61587eb85218c8adcf23564001a216f0b?context=explore",
