What's happening here is that an attestation on the network is referencing a `target.root` that is inside the freezer DB. Therefore, we trigger the `Ok(None)` here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/3a24ca5f14c6e6d6612fd43eca82aa0c1e6aba16/beacon_node/store/src/hot_cold_store.rs#L341-L353\r\n\r\nUltimately, we're failing to reject attestations to finalized objects early enough. Instead, we're logging them as an error. This issue serves as a reminder to tidy this up.",
