  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nBeing banned is not truly a connection state, it's a score state. We can ban a peer while it is connected, request that it is disconnected and then be notified of the disconnection. This intermediate state and others are invalid under our current model and make us have a lot of \"special handling\" around. To better manage this we should use as a ban state exclusively what we decide from the score. I did a quick check on doing this change and it's not exactly trivial, but at least is an isolated change and should make the code much much simpler",
