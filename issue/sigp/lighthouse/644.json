  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nPreviously we implemented the ability for the application layer to update its own ENR. We enabled Lighthouse to update its own ENR once libp2p socket addresses were established. This was primarily to allows us to get the OS to select the next free open port and then have lighthouse update its ENR based on the OS's choice of port. This allowed for spinning up multiple nodes without having to specify a port. \r\n\r\nHowever, the ENR will now update itself to the local libp2p tcp address, when in fact we may want to maintain the ip/port specified in the CLI as it could be related to an external IP address. Although a bootnode should in principle re-update the ENR to the external socket addr, the tcp port will not be updated. \r\n\r\nWe need to either, \r\n- Remove the logic allowing lighthouse to update it's own ENR\r\n- Conditionally update the local ENR based on CLI flags\r\n\r\nAlongside this, we need to ensure the ENR maintains an external IP/port given via CLI, which is likely the source of truth (besides having other nodes tell us our external IP). We also need to make a decision on how to update the external TCP port to be used for libp2p connections.\r\n\r\nThis fundamentally leads to a larger issue of handling NAT more thoroughly.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
