  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nEnhancement request: Add the `--beacon-nodes` flag as an accepted parameter for `lighthouse account validator exit`\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\n\r\nThis is a QoL change for my eth-docker tool. I have a user request to support splitting the consensus client and validator client to separate machines. Eth-docker gets the beacon node location from a user-specified variable. If the user sets `https://mymachine,https://infurabeacon` because they want fallback, then this will work great for the validator client, and not at all for exits. I'd need to ask the user for a separate variable that only contains one of the two for exits. With this enhancement in, one variable will work both for day-to-day attesting as well as exits.\r\n",

    "body": "@yorickdowne, we had a look at implementing this in Lighthouse and our feeling is that introducing fall backs here introduces too much complexity in Lighthouse to warrant the convenience to the CLI.\r\n\r\nTo work around your problem, you could use [shell parameter expansion](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Parameter-Expansion.html) to extract only the first endpoint. Here's an example:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nENDPOINTS=https://mymachine,https://infurabeacon\r\necho lighthouse account validator exit --beacon-node ${ENDPOINTS%,*}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlighthouse account validator exit --beacon-node https://mymachine\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you wanted to exit on *all* endpoints (not just the first) you could use a bash script that iterates through each of the `ENDPOINTS` and runs the same command for each ([example on stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27702452/loop-through-a-comma-separated-shell-variable)).\r\n\r\nIn the interest of keeping the open-issue-count low, I'll close this for now. Please feel free to reopen if my suggested work-around doesn't work for you @yorickdowne :slightly_smiling_face: ",
