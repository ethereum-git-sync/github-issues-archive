    "body": "You need to reconstruct historic states for access to old state data. The flag to do this is `--reconstruct-historic-states`. However, on `stable` Lighthouse, this will either be very slow or use a tonne of space (like multiple terrabytes). You can read about the tradeoffs here: https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/advanced_database.html\r\n\r\nWe have developed a better archive node on the `tree-states` branch, but it currently requires a re-sync. Seeing as you don't have an archive node yet and would need to wait a week to build one on stable Lighthouse, you may consider re-syncing with tree-states. There's a release here which explains in more detail: https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/releases/tag/v4.5.444-exp. Although I would recommend building the current `tree-states` branch due to a recently fixed bug (we are planning a new release very soon, just waiting on some other bug fixes).",
