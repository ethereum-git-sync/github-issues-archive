    "body": "When you say low peer count. Do you mean 0 peers, what number does it fluctuate around?\r\n\r\nThe configuration you have looks correct provided the `EXTERNAL_IP` and `EXTERNAL_PORT` are correct. The `nat` endpoint will only get set to true, once a single external node connects to you. \r\n\r\nIt seems on the gnosis chain that there is no external nodes connecting to you, this can be really only one of a few problems:\r\n- You are not contactable at `EXTERNAL_IP` `EXTERNAL_PORT`. You've said this is not the case, but i'd double check that both TCP AND UDP are reachable on this socket\r\n- Discovery is broken somehow in that you are not advertising your ENR for others to find and connect to you. I believe gnosis is a lighthouse-dominated chain. In Lighthouse's discovery, we prevent storing your ENR if you are connecting to us on a different socket than what your ENR says you are contactable on. i.e if your network setup is such that you send UDP messages outbound on socket 9050 (some routers do this) and you have port forwarded 9000, you will struggle to find peers and your ENR will not get advertised on the DHT. \r\n\r\nIt would be instructive to get maybe 30 seconds of discovery logs, to figure out exactly why you can't find peers. \r\n\r\nTo do this, run lighthouse with the `-l` flag, but also enable discovery logs via the env variable `RUST_LOG=discv5=debug`. \r\n\r\ni.e from the CLI you could run:\r\n```\r\nRUST_LOG=discv5=debug lighthouse -l ...\r\n```\r\n",
