  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\n5 weeks ago I started noticing my validator node missing attestations. I then realized these missed attestations matched moments where CPU usage in my node was high. I then added a probe to see what process in my node was spiking the CPU usage and realized it was mostly due to higher CPU usage from my beacon node. I also realized these periods matched periods of higher than usual disk reading and writing.\r\n\r\nThis is new behavior that started roughly 5 weeks ago.\r\n\r\n## Version\r\n\r\nI'm downloading the release binaries from Github and currently running:\r\n```\r\nLighthouse v4.5.0-441fc16\r\nBLS library: blst-portable\r\nSHA256 hardware acceleration: false\r\nAllocator: jemalloc\r\nProfile: maxperf\r\nSpecs: mainnet (true), minimal (false), gnosis (true)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Present Behaviour\r\n\r\nI have missed attestations on each of these periods of high CPU usage:\r\n<img width=\"797\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/assets/1325863/bec55a62-bd4d-4597-9460-552b9e56ebb7\">\r\n\r\n## Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\nI shouldn't be missing attestations.\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\nI'm unaware of what steps I can take to resolve this, but happy to work with the devs on resolving them :)",
