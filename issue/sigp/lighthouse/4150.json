  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nAs discussed on discord with @AgeManning I'm trying to find a way to have a similar behavior of geth static/trusted nodes, so nodes that lighthouse always connects to. One limitation I've found is that after staring the beacon node with a set of trusted nodes they are eventually:\r\n - disconnected when there are too many peers\r\n - removed from the disconnected peers after reaching `MAX_DC_PEERS` and no longer trusted if they're discovered again\r\n\r\n## Version\r\n\r\nrust 1.68.2 - lh 4.0.1\r\n\r\n## Present Behaviour\r\n\r\nTrusted peers are disconnected with the same priority as other non trusted ones and are also removed from the peerdb, losing their trusted status\r\n\r\n## Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\nIt would be nice that a node is always trusted even after disconnecting/reconnecting and it's not pruned from the connected peers when there are too many peers\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\nI had a look at the code and I think to not remove them from the peerdb we could change [this](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/3d99ce25f83224da2cea20936fc03ff21635460a/beacon_node/lighthouse_network/src/peer_manager/peerdb.rs#L1054-L1072) section to:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n        while self.disconnected_peers > MAX_DC_PEERS {\r\n            if let Some(to_drop) = self\r\n                .peers\r\n                .iter()\r\n                .filter(|(_, info)| info.is_disconnected())\r\n                .filter(|(_, info)| !info.is_trusted())\r\n                .filter_map(|(id, info)| match info.connection_status() {\r\n                    PeerConnectionStatus::Disconnected { since } => Some((id, since)),\r\n                    _ => None,\r\n                })\r\n                .min_by_key(|(_, age)| *age)\r\n                .map(|(id, _)| *id)\r\n            {\r\n                debug!(self.log, \"Removing old disconnected peer\"; \"peer_id\" => %to_drop, \"disconnected_size\" => self.disconnected_peers.saturating_sub(1));\r\n                self.peers.remove(&to_drop);\r\n            }\r\n```\r\n\r\nand change [this](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/3d99ce25f83224da2cea20936fc03ff21635460a/beacon_node/lighthouse_network/src/peer_manager/mod.rs#L964) line to:\r\n```rust\r\n!info.has_future_duty() && !info.is_trusted() && $filter(*info)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever I'm not sure how the second part should be tested because I'm not familiar with the arbitrary test section of that function",
