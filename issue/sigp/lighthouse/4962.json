  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nWe are currently involved in some substantial network upgrades and in the process of making decisions about default values for lighthouse and the general limits we can push the software. \r\n\r\nOne aspect of this is to collect a few metrics as a function of peer count. \r\n\r\nIn particular we would like to measure the bandwidth, over both tcp and quic, and the total, average number of mesh peers and average number of nodes subscribed on subnets all as a function of peer-count. \r\n\r\nThe metrics (at least the non-aggregated versions of them) already exist on the network dashboard, which can be found (and installed here: https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse-metrics/blob/master/dashboards/Network.json (this repo explains how to run the metrics also). \r\n\r\nWhat is left to do in this issue, is to run lighthouse with a specific --target-peers value for a few minutes (10-20, until we reach the target peer count (+- 10%)). Record the metrics or an average version of them and then repeat with a different --target--peers value. \r\nWe probably want to do this for values [80,90,100,110,120,150,180,200,250,300] to get a relationship between these metrics and the peer count. \r\n\r\nWe can run lighthouse with syncing and without an execution client to obtain these values. I write up of how to do this is here: https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/4961\r\n\r\nWe want to test these values on mainnet. There are a few upgrades coming this week (or next) which we probably want to get in first which should give improved numbers for these and improved metrics. \r\n\r\nHappy to help answer questions and provide guidance for anyone wishing to take this on. \r\n",
