I'm pretty sure some of these are untested and I'm not certain they all match the spec now.\r\n\r\nTo resolve this issue, check out a [diff between v2.0.1 and v2.1.0](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/compare/v2.0.1...v2.1.0) and see which CLI arguments have changed. For each:\r\n\r\n- Ensure it matches any existing standards,\r\n- Ensure it is tested in [`lighthouse/tests`](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/tree/stable/lighthouse/tests) tests, to some degree.\r\n",
