Host this or something similar and publicize it: https://github.com/adiasg/eth2-ws-provider\r\n2. Include checkpoints in releases and require that we sync through them on any re-sync\r\n3. Check for freshness of the weak subjectivity checkpoint. This isn't _required_ in the spec but is described. I think we could at least log it out.  We're currently relying on any weak subjectivity checkpoint providers to provide us with fresh ones, which doesn't seem too unreasonable, since we are already trusting them to a degree.\r\n4. Optionally check a provided `--wss-checkpoint` during checkpoint sync (I don't think we do presently but I didn't looks super closely today). This would provide additional assurance that your trusted node is actually on what's deemed the canonical chain by subjective sources (etherscan? sigmaprime.io? twitter?).\r\n\r\nWould love to hear more feedback about any of these.
