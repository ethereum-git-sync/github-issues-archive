  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nOur platform [Bison Trails] would like to be able to import externally-generated keys dynamically without restarting the client and without being prompted for passwords.  Every validator key has its own password which we can write to disk alongside the key before import.\r\n\r\n## Version\r\n\r\nCurrently building tag v1.0.3 with rust:1.48-buster\r\n\r\n## Present Behaviour\r\n\r\nCurrently it is required to restart the validator client to have new validators discovered.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\nWe would like to not have to restart the validator client.  The desired solution will allow us to import one or many keys efficiently, synchronously, and non-interactively.  The synchronous requirement is needed to allow us to delete the source key/password files after being imported.\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\nThe implementation could be a command-line tool or a new API method.  It had been discussed that there would be an API endpoint for this, and we're still happy with that as an option.\r\n",
