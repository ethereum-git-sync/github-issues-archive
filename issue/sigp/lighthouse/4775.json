  "body": "I'm half sure you have no way to meaningfully debug this at all, but still gonna report it if you see this elsewhere at some point. I was running a lighthouse beacon node for the last 2-3 months without issue. Very occasionally I restarted it, but otherwise it just worked.\r\n\r\nToday... it just stopped. No error logs, no system failure logs, no nothing. Docker just reported that the process exited with error code 135. Boom.\r\n\r\nAny clue what might have happened? I see no errors nor any logs on the docker host that it might have done something to kill the container. And teh machine is pretty much running an Ethereum setup and idling otherwise with insane resources, so it cannot be a memory or any other exhaustion thing.",
