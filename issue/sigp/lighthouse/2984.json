We need to check that Lighthouse adheres to these conditions and add regression tests for all conditions.\r\n\r\nThis should be a simple task since I doubt there's much variance and there are [already tests](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/stable/beacon_node/beacon_chain/tests/block_verification.rs) that check other gossip propagation conditions.\r\n",
