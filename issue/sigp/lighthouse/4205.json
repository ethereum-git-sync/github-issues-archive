  "body": "Now that withdrawals are enabled, I would like to generate pre-signed voluntary exit messages as insurance against a nuclear meltdown on my staking box, i.e. something that would cause a long offline period (e.g. natural disaster, hardware failure, etc). This could generate a JSON file with the signed data, which could be backed up on another device and later broadcast to any available beacon node (e.g. there are [public nodes](https://beaconcha.in/tools/broadcast) which could be used to broadcast without an active staking box). Obviously this would be for emergencies only, as I would be signing up for ~4 days of penalties prior to exiting, but it would bound the risk of running a staker.\r\n\r\nCurrently, [voluntary exits on Lighthouse](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/voluntary-exit.html) assume you are exiting immediately - it would be much appreciated if you could add a flag to decouple this from the actual signing process (e.g. `--prepare-offline`).",
