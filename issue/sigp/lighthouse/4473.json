In Lighthouse v4.3.0 we changed the block publishing API to properly check gossip validity before publishing (#4264). This includes ruling out _duplicate blocks_. When publishing a builder block, the relay publishes it to the network _before_ returning it back to the proposer, so many blocks are detected as duplicates and rejected.\r\n2. Due to another bug in our HTTP route handlers (#3404) the true error message is lost when conveying it to the validator client. We know how to fix this class of error now, and just need to roll out the fix over the whole HTTP API (this might interact with #4462).\r\n\r\n## Version\r\n\r\nLighthouse v4.3.0\r\n\r\n## Present Behaviour\r\n\r\nThe aforementioned error will be logged by the VC. The block _should still be integrated into the chain_ (assuming the builder does their job and there's no re-org).\r\n\r\nThe beacon node will log this warning, which can be used to quickly check that a block proposal didn't fail for another reason:\r\n\r\n> WARN Not publishing block, not gossip verified     slot => xxx, error => BlockIsAlreadyKnown\r\n\r\n## Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\nWe are still discussing the best way to handle this, but our hope is that we'll be able to distinguish valid duplicate blocks, blocks that are still in the process of being imported, and invalid duplicate blocks. The HTTP return codes in each case might end up being 200, 202 and 400 respectively. The `DuplicateCache` will be helpful in identifying the \"in progress\" blocks.",

    "body": "@mcdee Indeed. The troublesome case to handle is the one where we know the block is a duplicate (because it hit the duplicate filter), but it hasn't finished being processed yet, so we don't know whether it's valid or invalid. I think our options are:\r\n\r\n- Just return a 200: the block has already been broadcast and is probably valid. If it's not valid, there's not much the caller can do anyway, as the block has already been broadcast from elsewhere.\r\n- Just return a 206: by similar logic to above, but erring on the side of caution by declaring the block to be probably invalid. The caller will know the block has been broadcast, and then can check out of band whether it was invalid.\r\n- Wait for the other block to finish processing. This is probably the \"most correct\" option but the most fiddly to implement. We need to suspend validation of the API block and have a mechanism by which it can wait. This would require extra queues/channels, which although not impossible to implement, definitely adds to the complexity.\r\n- Add a new status code for duplicate blocks, which doesn't imply anything about their validity. An HTTP 409 might be suitable for this, and could be added to the new v3 block endpoint.\r\n\r\nI think I'm leaning towards the 2nd option for now (return 206), with a bit of extra handling to try to return a 200 if: the block is in the `observed_block_producers` cache, is _not_ in the `DuplicateCache` and _is_ in fork choice.",

    "body": "Yeah option 3 would be the best from a client's point of view, but I understand the complexity.\r\n\r\nOption 2 is workable, although I think the reality is that a validator client isn't going to do anything with a 206 above what it would do with a 200, so unsure if differentiating the situations makes sense.  Given it's a duplicate of a block received over P2P, and the validator client is assumedly happy enough with it to send via the REST API (plus it can't change its mind anyway having signed the block), I think that a 200 is reasonable.\r\n\r\nSo I'd say option 3, then option 1 as my preferred results.",
