  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nOur tests on the Deneb branch are noticeably slower, and it appears that this is caused by the blob commitment/proof generation in tests that uses the block generator to [generate random blobs](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/deneb-free-blobs/consensus/types/src/blob_sidecar.rs#L151-L158).\r\n\r\nBelow is a flamegraph capture by @michaelsproul on one of the slow tests, which shows that a significant amount of time is spent on computing kzg commitments / proofs: \r\n![flamegraph](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/assets/742762/673f884c-04f7-45d8-8df0-ed86de55c45d)\r\n\r\nWe could potentially speed up these tests by pre-generating a bunch of  `(blobs,commitment,proof)` tuples to usein the beacon chain tests (idea suggested by @pawanjay176).",
