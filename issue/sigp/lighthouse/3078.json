  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nIt seems like restarting my beacon node service on a network that has not started the beacon chain genesis yet makes the beacon node process spew a bunch of these `WARN Error processing HTTP API request       method: GET, path: /eth/v1/node/syncing, status: 500 Internal Server Error` messages.\r\n\r\n## Version\r\n\r\nUnstable v2.1.3-e4fa7d9 - https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/commit/e4fa7d906f999b82510ad0eab791bd092947107b\r\n\r\n## Present Behaviour\r\n\r\n1. I followed [my guide to setup a machine](https://github.com/remyroy/ethstaker/blob/main/merge-devnet.md) for Kiln.\r\n2. I started the Geth service, the Lighthouse beacon node service and the Lighthouse validator client.\r\n3. I watched the logs and everything seemed fine.\r\n4. I restarted my Lighthouse beacon node service around *Mar 10 21:40:04 UTC*, before the beacon chain started on Kiln.\r\n5. I noticed these logs: https://gist.github.com/remyroy/641f0ceabb05d9f977174c6550a1fb3f#file-lhbn-log-L1950\r\n\r\n## Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\nUnder normal circumstances, I expect the Lighthouse beacon node process to behave normally after a restart.\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\nRestarting the validator client service solved this issue for some weird reason. I restarted my validator client around *Mar 10 22:11:27 UTC* and you can see in the logs that the WARN messages disappeared. Full validator client logs can be found on https://gist.github.com/remyroy/4334e9b0722155ae94917c2fc2aba744 .\r\n\r\nNow it might be harder to reproduce as it seems you need a network that has not reached beacon chain genesis yet.\r\n",

    "body": "So this is mainly an issue because the syncing status before genesis is undefined and the `eth/v1/node/syncing` endpoint therefore returns a 500 server error.\r\n\r\nThis won't cause any actual issues other than the error logs. The BN starts responding to  the api request after genesis and the VC will immediately connect to it and perform any required duties. Fixing this would complicate the logic that handles fallback beacon nodes which doesn't seem worth it imo.",
