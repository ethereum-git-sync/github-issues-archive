    "body": "If you are using the `boot_node` CLI param. No. \r\n\r\nThe idea of the boot-node is to simply run a discv5 server and not a full-blown lighthouse node. This way, all new peers will not try and sync from this one single boot node, rather they will discover more peers randomly from the boot node and start their sync in a more uniform distribution from the peer list. This prevents boot nodes from being overloaded with RPC requests. \r\n\r\nIf you want to run a \"boot node\" that is also a lighthouse node (i.e has tcp and responds to RPC requests and gossip etc). You can run a regular lighthouse node with the `--enr-address` and `--enr-port` beacon node flags. Then use the resulting ENR as your \"boot node\" (this will contain a TCP port) and newly connected nodes will connect to it. \r\n\r\n",
