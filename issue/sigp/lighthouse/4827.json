  "body": "## Description\r\nThis is a fun one. While I know `cross` is supposed to be used for cross-compiling (which invokes its own Docker process), I am trying to build the `arm64` image directly via `buildx`. If you attempt to cross-compile Lighthouse on an x64 box via the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndocker buildx build --platform=linux/arm64 -t jclapis/lighthouse:test-arm64 -f Dockerfile --load .\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt will get stuck pulling the submodules for a few minutes while QEMU eats all of the system's RAM:\r\n\r\n```\r\n1.247   Installing lighthouse v4.5.0 (/lighthouse/lighthouse)\r\n1.429     Updating git repository `https://github.com/sigp/milagro_bls`\r\n2.399     Updating git submodule `https://github.com/sigp/incubator-milagro-crypto-rust`\r\n3.570     Updating crates.io index\r\n136.3 Killed\r\n136.3 make: *** [Makefile:48: install] Error 137\r\n```\r\n![image](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/assets/627896/a74ec0ac-1cf7-456c-9c66-944c6a6e5d52)\r\n\r\nThe problem ends up being a possible bug in `libgit2` itself, which `cargo` uses as part of updating the submodules. [This is well-documented by the Rust community already](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/10583) and there's a simple workaround for it which they describe in that issue: tell `cargo` to use the git CLI for pulling submodules instead of the git library itself.\r\n\r\nI have a PR coming that will resolve it with a simple (optional) build-arg in the Dockerfile to remedy this, though one could probably argue that making this the default behavior would fix the issue and wouldn't adversely affect the standard Lighthouse build process.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Version\r\n\r\n`v4.5.0` and likely many versions prior; the bug was first reported in 2022.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Present Behaviour\r\n\r\nBuilding the image results in an out-of-memory error and the build process gets killed.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\nBuilding the image should complete successfully.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\nPR pending, it'll reference this issue once it's in.\r\n",
