However, it seems like doing parallel verification with a rayon threadpool for `verify_blob_kzg_proof` is faster. We should test the parallel `verify_blob_kzg_proof` against `verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch` in lighthouse to check if it gives us similar speedups when running lighthouse.",

Thanks for that.\r\n\r\nFrom your comment on the PR, I understood that calling `verify_kzg_for_blob_list` for all blobs in a batch instead of calling it in a loop for each block in a batch is 32x faster.\r\n\r\nWondering if you have also tried changing `verify_kzg_for_blob_list` implementation to call `verify_kzg_for_blob` in a rayon thread pool. From the linked PR https://github.com/ethereum/c-kzg-4844/pull/192 , it seems like the rayon implementation was giving ~2x improvement for 64 batch size in isolation. ",
