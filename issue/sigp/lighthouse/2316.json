  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nWhen the `lighthouse` binary is shut down, it [waits](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/3a24ca5f14c6e6d6612fd43eca82aa0c1e6aba16/lighthouse/src/main.rs#L346) for any existing tokio tasks to complete. We could exploit this to make sure that the VC won't shutdown until it's completed any current-epoch duties.\r\n\r\nFor example, if we learn that a block proposer has a proposal slot this epoch then we could spawn a tokio task that lives until  the block proposal is complete. Then, when the users hits ctrl+c, the VC won't shutdown and potentially miss the proposal. We could add some logging to that keep-alive task to ensure the user knows why their VC isn't shutting down.\r\n\r\nWe could also use the same strategy for attestation production.\r\n\r\nThe downside of this would be that it's not really possible to override this behaviour if you want (e.g., I *must* restart the VC before this proposal happens). A potential work around is to adopt Geth's behaviour of \"press ctrl+c *n* more times to force shutdown\". \r\n",
