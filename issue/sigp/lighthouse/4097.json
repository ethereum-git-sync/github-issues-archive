We are using warp, which makes the types kind of tricky. \r\n\r\nI think the idea of this issue is to add an average attestation inclusion distance as an extension (or extra field) to this: https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/3760\r\n\r\nYou could look at that PR to figure out how to extend it. I've not yet looked into whether we store the inclusion distance in the metrics, but we could add it. \r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any questions. I think @macladson will also be able to help out and have thoughts on how this could be implemented.",

Also it has `delay` field which is quite close to the metric we want to expose, although I think it only work under `Base` fork version.\r\n\r\n@AgeManning WDYT?",
