This is despite the validators seemingly being active with effective_balance=32ETH and balance=32ETH when state queries are made at the same slot (I don't know why the inactivity leak hasn't reduced their balances at least a little). More investigation is required to determine whether this is expected behaviour or a bug.\r\n\r\nCC @samlaf\r\n\r\n## Version\r\n\r\nv3.5.0\r\n",

    "body": "I need to mull over the best way to actually fix this, as the behaviour of `state_root_at_slot` is arguably very wrong and it is used widely for lots of different purposes. I think changing the return value to differentiate these three cases is probably the right call:\r\n\r\n1. State root lies in the past and is known (current `Some` case).\r\n2. State root is unknown due to incomplete DB (current `None` case).\r\n3. State root lies in the future and _could_ be computed by `state_at_slot` (current buggy case).\r\n\r\nUsing a three-valued enum would be one approach.\r\n\r\nWe also need to work out how to handle the timeouts we usually apply to these long state advances. I think the current blanket timeout is too strict and we should either give a runtime flag to disable it entirely or allow the caller to choose between timeouts/no timeouts.\r\n\r\nA partial hacky fix which allows the state to be fetched (and deletes the timeout) is here: https://github.com/michaelsproul/lighthouse/tree/state-at-slot-hacks",
