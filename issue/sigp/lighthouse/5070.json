  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, there are two ways to add validator keys to Lighthouse. First is to use validator definitions YML file. Second one is to use Keymanager API. To improve second method, it would be very useful if there were a way to automatically add all keys specified in remote signer using `/eth/v1/remotekeys` endpoint on startup. This is nothing new as (at least) Lodestar and Prysm have these flags, which are `--externalSigner.fetch` and `--validators-external-signer-public-keys` respectively.\r\n\r\nThis is useful in setups where validator clients are run completely stateless. In those cases node runners can just provide two endpoints (consensus API, keymanager API) and validator is ready to perform duties. ðŸš€ \r\n\r\n@dapplion ðŸ‘€ ",
