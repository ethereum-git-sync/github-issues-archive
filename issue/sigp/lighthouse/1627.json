  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nI want to import keystores from the launchpad. I'm using the `docker-compose` infra via `sigp/lighthouse-docker`.\r\n\r\nVolumes are used for persistent data across runs so it takes a little wrangling to do effectful things (like import a bunch of keystores) and have the writes not be discarded.\r\n\r\nIt seems that changing the `datadir` doesn't influence downstream decisions around where writes should take place. \r\n\r\n## Version\r\n\r\nUsing this docker image: https://hub.docker.com/layers/sigp/lighthouse/latest/images/sha256-da0c75a385e7309b8e9a87956e19ff9a4c15f46ed5948e688c88a383bbec8fa5?context=explore\r\n\r\nAnd `lighthouse-docker` at this commit: 8ae637fccf5802763e8151a043c8aaf53ff3b99c\r\n\r\n## Present Behaviour\r\n\r\nI run:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ndocker-compose run -v ~/validator-keys:/validator-keys validator_client lighthouse account validator import --datadir /home/lighthouse/.lighthouse --directory /validator-keys --reuse-password\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere the launchpad output is in `~/validator-keys`.\r\n\r\nIf this command is run without the `--datadir` flag, then seemingly nothing happens and some poking around reveals that `docker-compose run` executes as `root` so that `$HOME/lighthouse` is not where the external mount is set up (e.g. `./lighthouse-data:/home/lighthouse/.lighthouse`.\r\n\r\nSo then we explicitly set `--datadir` and it still fails as it seems we need to set `--validator-dir` as well:\r\n\r\ne.g.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ndocker-compose run -v ~/validator-keys:/validator-keys validator_client lighthouse account validator import --datadir /home/lighthouse/.lighthouse --validator-dir /home/lighthouse/.lighthouse/validators --directory /validator-keys --reuse-password\r\n```\r\n\r\nand this works!\r\n\r\n## Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\nI expect setting `--datadir` to be contextual in the sense that if it is set, anything \"beneath\" it should respect the decision. I believe what was happening was that `--validator-dir` resolved to `$HOME/.lighthouse/validators` as `root` so that it was in `/root/.lighthouse` (which was not persisted).\r\n\r\nI did not try running w/ _just_ `--validator-dir` but assume  that would work without `--datadir`. But my intuition on this is still that `--datadir` should override the top-level scope and everything else should fall underneath that.\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\nReview directory hierarchy construction to ensure that configuration at higher scopes influences configuration at enclosed scopes.\r\n",
