  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nMaking the [validator monitor](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/stable/beacon_node/beacon_chain/src/validator_monitor.rs) track block proposals would help us raise alerts if there has been a missed proposal by a local/monitored validator. This has been requested several times and makes a lot of sense, especially now we have builders as an additional failure point.\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\nConsidering this briefly, I think we could track missed proposals in two ways:\r\n\r\n1. Use [ValidatorMonitor::process_valid_state](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/01e84b71f524968f5b940fbd2fa31d29408b6581/beacon_node/beacon_chain/src/validator_monitor.rs#L294-L296) to reading the proposers for the current epoch and then look at `latest_block_roots` for skip slots.\r\n2. Add a new `ValidatorMonitor::process_head_state` method which works similar to the previous method, but only takes states which were elected as the head (rather than *all* states).\r\n\r\nThe issue with (1) would be that relatively weight-less, obscure heads may trigger a rather alarming \"missed block\" alert.\r\n\r\nA downside both approaches is that it would only register a missed block once a subsequent block has been imported. I'm not hugely concerned with this since we should already be raising CRIT logs whenever a block production fails. The edge-case here would be a failure in block *propagation*, which presently raises no logs. All this considered, we'd likely be registering the proposal failure within 12-24s and given the relatively infrequent nature of block proposal I'm comfortable with this slight delay. \r\n",
