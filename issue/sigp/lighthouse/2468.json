    "body": "What @zedt3ster wrote also applies to some degree to the beacon node API, although you're right that it isn't as well documented. \r\n\r\nSeveral of the beacon node API endpoints require the node to do a lot of work in the background, and it's an intrinsically difficult problem to make them run faster (we're trying, e.g. #2422, #2431). Given that, the API should only be exposed to `localhost` or a restricted set of IPs on an internal network.\r\n\r\nFor users wishing to run Lighthouse as part of a internet-facing beacon node service (like Infura's), we'd strongly recommend putting Lighthouse behind a rate-limiter, and/or a custom filtering system designed to prevent abuse. In this setting you'd likely also configure the Lighthouse node to cache more historical data on disk, which makes a _huge_ difference for queries. For example, the query you posted completes in <50ms for the current epoch, but takes 50s (or more) for historic epochs. The problem isn't the number of validator indices, but the time to load the historic `BeaconState`. With the database configured for historic queries the time to load a historic state drops dramatically (<500ms on Prater by my current estimates). There's some more info about this in the Lighthouse book: https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/advanced_database.html. This also implies that any API endpoint that loads a state is a potential DoS vector: all the ones prefixed with `/eth/v1/beacon/states/*`, plus the `​/eth​/v1​/validator​/duties​/*` endpoints, and likely some others.\r\n\r\nDoS aside there are other reasons not to allow access to the beacon node API, including the ability for clients to trash your node's  peer-to-peer reputation by using your node to publish bad messages. This should mostly be mitigated by the beacon node applying validation conditions to messages received from the API, but I suspect there's still a bit of wiggle room for abuse. This could be an interesting angle for further investigation, maybe even involving other clients too (Infura use Teku, and I wonder how they've dealt with this).\r\n\r\nTL;DR: I think we should document that Lighthouse's BN API shouldn't be exposed to untrusted input, and I think that rate-limiting should be left to the webserver shielding Lighthouse from the internet (e.g. nginx).",
