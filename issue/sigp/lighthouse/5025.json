However, using ckzg's verification functions in lighthouse's blob verification functions might be slower than raw benchmarks due to us having to clone the blob before passing it to ckzg.\r\n\r\nWe need to look into how well different kzg backends perform with lighthouse by gathering metrics on test networks.\r\nNote: Even if the other libs are significantly more performant (which I'm not convinced they would be), we need to consider the fact that other libraries haven't gone through security audits.",
