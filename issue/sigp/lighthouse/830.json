  "body": "## Description\r\n`beacon validator -d {non-standard directory location}` yells about not being able to find the keypair file:\r\n```bash\r\nERRO Failed to load a validator directory    path: /media/Ethereum/lighthouse/beacon, error: Unable to get voting keypair: Keypair file does not exist: \"/media/Ethereum/lighthouse/beacon/voting_keypair\"                                       \r\nERRO Failed to load a validator directory    path: /media/Ethereum/lighthouse/validators, error: Unable to get voting keypair: Keypair file does not exist: \"/media/Ethereum/lighthouse/validators/voting_keypair\"   \r\n```\r\n\r\n## Present Behaviour\r\nI moved my directory to a non-standard directory, and deleted my `beacon/` folder (as a result of the issue I mentioned in #829), and this error pops up. I solved it by copying the `voting_keypair` file from `lighthouse/validator/{raw-public-key}/voting_keypair` to the locations mentioned in errors.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behaviour\r\nDeleting the `beacon/` folder should not have any affect in how the 'validator/` works. Also, should not have to copy any files.\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\nHave lighthouse only recognize keys from `lighthouse/validator/{raw-public-key}/`\r\n",
