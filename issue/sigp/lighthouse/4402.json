    "body": "Hey @ameya-deshmukh \r\n\r\nThanks for the interest. It is on my radar and is a fairly trivial update. I was just waiting for us to update to the latest libp2p, making sure that is stable then adding in quic support. \r\n\r\nSupporting QUIC is a fairly trivial change (we just add an extra transport) and we need to specify a new ENR field. The rest is mainly documentation and testing. \r\n\r\nIf this is something you'd like to do, feel free make a PR (probably best for just the transport) then we can discuss how we want the ENR to look and also whether it is on by default. I was thinking a default port of 9090. \r\n\r\n",
