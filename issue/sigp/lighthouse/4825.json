We still filter attestations by the last 32 slots here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/8660043024f95a31db9b0027a2e9eacc28d7e727/beacon_node/operation_pool/src/lib.rs#L232-L235\r\n\r\nPost-Deneb, we _should_ be keeping any attestation from the current or previous epoch.\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\nI propose we resolve this _after_ merging Deneb to unstable, so as not to block it further. It's really just an optimisation to block packing to take advantage of the new Deneb rules. At the same time, block packing is being overhauled in #4507, so it might make sense to get that PR in before making this change.\r\n",
