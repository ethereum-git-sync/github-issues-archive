  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nWhile testing Deneb + tree-states, I found a bug in our current progressive balances cache implementation: we update the unslashed participating balances incorrectly for slashed validators. First we remove the balance with `on_slashing`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/441fc1691b69f9edc4bbdc6665f3efab16265c9b/consensus/types/src/beacon_state/progressive_balances_cache.rs#L67-L74\r\n\r\nLater, when processing effective balance changes, we update the total by the difference in the slashed validator's effective balance, which is incorrect, because the validator's balance has already been removed:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/441fc1691b69f9edc4bbdc6665f3efab16265c9b/consensus/state_processing/src/per_epoch_processing/effective_balance_updates.rs#L58-L66\r\n\r\nThe result is that the total unslashed participating balance can be off by `O(num_slashed_validators)`. This is unlikely to cause issues in practice, because:\r\n\r\n- The progressive balances optimisation is disabled by default currently. If this bug were triggered, we'd get an error log and nothing more.\r\n- If the user has opted into `--progressive-balances fast`, the worst-case is a temporary view split, which would require _a lot_ of validators to be slashed. If the slashing is small, it's unlikely to cause a view split, because the attesting balances will only be off by a small amount.\r\n\r\n## Version\r\n\r\nLighthouse v4.5.0\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\nGuard the `on_effective_balance_change` call by `!validator.slashed()`. On tree-states, I've forced the caller to pass the validator's `is_slashed` status to `on_effective_balance_change`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/b77de6958adbc216dcaf95ce40a604a28b6720ab/consensus/state_processing/src/per_epoch_processing/single_pass.rs#L623-L630\r\n\r\nWe should make a similar change on `unstable`, with an accompanying regression test. The conditions necessary to trigger this are:\r\n\r\n- Validator's balance gets lowered substantially as a result of the amount they are slashed (e.g. validator gets slashed 1 ETH and goes from balance 32 ETH to 31 ETH).\r\n- Epoch transition occurs after the slashing which applies the balance reduction to their effective balance (e.g. eff. balance 32 -> 31).\r\n",
