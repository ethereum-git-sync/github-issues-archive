    "body": "There's a few things here. \r\n\r\nFirstly the log \"Address Updated\" is mostly irrelevant to the current peers connected and reactive time of being able to submit attestations. That log refers only to discovery and its slow to update because it keeps a longer history. I've made an issue to make it more reactive: https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/issues/2131 however it will have little impact to what you are seeing in this issue. \r\n\r\nIt is strange that it took 10 minutes for your node to re-establish connections. If you suddenly lose connection, you should kick all your peers fairly quickly (I can't see why you didn't without debug-level logs). The way that it works, is that if peers are non-responsive (i.e they can't communicate back because you changed your ip and the connections are no longer valid) we record this against the peer. We then have to make a decision about whether we should kick the peer and try and find new ones or give it another chance to respond. \r\n\r\nWe can be very harsh and kick peers as soon as they don't respond correctly on a single message, however the stability in your peer list will be lost as you'll likely kick many slow peers and/or missed packets / poor connectivity. However it would be very responsive when you lose your internet connection, you'd immediately drop all your peers. \r\n\r\nI think the solution here is to decrease our tcp ping interval to check for liveness. That should make your node more responsive to these events without strongly affecting peer count stability. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
