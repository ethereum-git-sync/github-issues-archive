  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nPresently we will accept a block with any slot number, however in many places throughout the code we do addition to slots/epochs without necessarily considering the implications of the saturation. We're generally quite considerate of the effects of saturation on _subtraction_, but not _addition_.\r\n\r\n## Suggestion\r\n\r\nI propose that we set a \"maximum slot number\" that is very far in the future (100s of years?) and then never import a block with a slot higher from this.\r\n\r\nI think this will be a nice safeguard against reaching some edge cases in our code. _Technically,_ we won't match the spec anymore, but we will in practice.\r\n",
