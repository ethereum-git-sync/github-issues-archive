I'm guessing it's quite old and you're hitting a historic state load, which can 60 seconds or more depending on your database configuration (see: https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/advanced_database.html).\r\n\r\nWe have a project to overhaul the database so that historic state queries are super fast with minimal disk usage (<150GB). Currently making them fast requires several TB of storage. You can read a bit about the database overhaul project here: https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/releases/tag/v3.4.0-tree.1. There's currently no Capella-compatible release of this project, but we'll be releasing one in the next ~week.",
