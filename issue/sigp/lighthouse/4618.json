  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nWe've been seeing some stack overflow reports on v4.3.0 (Linux). So far the constant factor has been that those users are running Reth. The logs from those users have not been helpful. This might suggest that we have an infinite loop between EL requests/responses somewhere. (e.g., there's a fcU response that causes us to issue another fcU that returns the same response).\r\n\r\nI think it would be a good idea to ensure that all requests/responses to/from the EL create a `DEBG` (or higher) log. That would help us detect any loops.",
