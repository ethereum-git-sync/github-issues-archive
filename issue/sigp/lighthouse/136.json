  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nLighthouse is focusing on modularity, but if someone wants to include a Lighthouse module in their codebase, they are required to share the entire codebase. While this seems to work in favor of open source, enterprises and other commercial entities _will tend to not use Lighthouse_ because they won't see it worth the risk of sharing all of their code. This is a significant trade-off and should not be undertaken lightly. \r\n\r\nCPP Ethereum died because of this, because they couldn't get one of the authors to sign off on the re-license (away from GPL). The EEA would effectively not need to exist today if CPP-Ethereum had been successfully re-licensed in early 2017, as was attempted.",
