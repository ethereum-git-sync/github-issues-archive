  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\n[Vouch](https://github.com/attestantio/vouch) is currently not compatible with Lighthouse's [late block re-org feature](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/late-block-re-orgs.html) when proposing a _blinded block_. The only workaround is to either disable blinded block proposals, or disable the re-org feature with `--disable-proposer-reorgs`.\r\n\r\n## Detail\r\n\r\nWe've seen this issue occur in the wild, where it results in the re-orging block being rejected by Vouch, and a block with 0 transactions being signed instead:\r\n\r\n- Lighthouse suppressed the payload-attributes message to Geth because it wanted to re-org.\r\n- Vouch requested a blinded block.\r\n- Lighthouse requested a header from Vouch building on the parent of the current head (an attempted re-org). Vouch didn't return a header.\r\n- Lighthouse built a (re-orging) blinded block using a local payload.\r\n- Vouch rejected the blinded payload due to the execution payload not being as expected.\r\n- Vouch requested a full block and Lighthouse abandoned the re-org strategy because it was after the 1s cutoff. Lighthouse sent a (late) payload-build message to Geth, followed by a near-immediate request for that payload.\r\n- Geth didn't have any time to build a payload so it built one with 0 transactions.\r\n\r\n## Version\r\n\r\nv4.5.0\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\nThis issue will disappear once we support the v3 block endpoint, and Vouch makes use of it: https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/4629\r\n\r\nThe reason being that (I think) Vouch will no longer expect Lighthouse to use a specific payload that it has selected, so Lighthouse will be free to fetch one from mev-boost directly, or can build a local payload and return that immediately to Vouch (which can be accepted or rejected depending on its policy and other available blocks).\r\n",
