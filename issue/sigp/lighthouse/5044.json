  "body": "Hey guys, I have a Lighthouse validator configured with two beacon node endpoints. One of these pairs is Teku - Besu, and the other pair is Lighthouse - Nethermind. The Teku is the primary, while the Lighthouse is the secondary, and the Lighthouse vc reports these accordingly as 2 synced and 2 available.\r\n\r\nDue to the recent Besu client bug, my primary node became unavailable and my lighthouse vc (As expected) then tried to reach out to my secondary Lighthouse bn.\r\n\r\nExcept that too was unavailable due to another unrelated issue which I will document below.\r\n\r\nIn my validator client, I have configured `--builder-proposals` but only on my primary Teku BN is MEV enabled. My secondary Lighthouse BN does not use MEV. So when the vc failed over from primary to secondary, duties were not able to be performed.\r\n\r\nThe related log messages can be seen below.\r\n\r\n```\r\nJan 06 12:32:23.002 DEBG Request to beacon node failed, error: ServerMessage(ErrorMessage { code: 500, message: \"UNHANDLED_ERROR: BuilderMissing\", stacktraces: [] }), node: http://<edited>:5052/, module: validator_client::beacon_node_fallback:523\r\nJan 06 12:32:23.002 WARN Unable to publish validator registrations to the builder network, error: Some endpoints failed, num_failed: 1 http://<edited>:5052/ => RequestFailed(ServerMessage(ErrorMessage { code: 500, message: \"UNHANDLED_ERROR: BuilderMissing\", stacktraces: [] })), service: preparation, module: validator_client::preparation_service:493\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe failure is due to the fact that my Lighthouse VC has builder proposals enabled while my Lighthouse BN does not. Which I understand why that would happen, but if the VC is unable to use the configured BN to perform its validating duties, then it also shouldn't show up in the logs as \"available\".\r\n\r\nI am using v4.5.0 > https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/releases/tag/v4.5.0\r\n\r\nSpecifically, lighthouse-v4.5.0-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz\r\n",

It shouldn't affect any of your validator's duties though, is your validator still attesting?",

    "body": "Hey @realbigsean\r\n\r\nI had a very thorough look through my logs and put together a bit of a timeline.\r\n\r\nAll times below are in GMT+11 (Sydney time).\r\n\r\n10:29PM - Besu client halted due to a bad block and I start missing attestations at this same epoch (254470).\r\n\r\n10:41PM - Validator client has 1x \"Attester duties re-org\".\r\n\r\n10:49PM - I now notice that I am missing attestations\r\n\r\n11:01PM - I restart Teku & Besu in an attempt to see if it fixes the Besu issue (It doesn't).\r\n\r\n11:02PM - Validator client has 2x \"Attester duties re-org\".\r\n\r\n11:03PM - New message start appearing in my validator client: \"CRIT Not signing slashable attestation, error: InvalidAttestation(DoubleVote(SignedAttestation { source_epoch: Epoch(254474), target_epoch: Epoch(254475)\"\r\n\r\n11:08PM - Validator client is still not signing, but now the message changes from \"DoubleVote\" to \"NewSurroundsPrev\"\r\n\r\n11:22PM - I restart Lighthouse VC with two changes made: The Teku-Besu endpoint is removed, and the `--builder-proposals` option is also removed. The critical messages stop and I start attesting again.\r\n\r\nIn the chaotic moment this was all going down I remember seeing my VC throwing out errors, one of them being an UNHANDLED_ERROR and how it was failing to connect to the builder network and it also said something about not publishing attestations. But without looking into it more I quickly moved to remove that endpoint and option as I was offline.\r\n\r\nAfter writing this all out and thinking it through more, maybe I only went offline for 1 or 2 epochs after the Besu issue occured and the Lighthouse VC actually did failover to the Lighthouse BN. Then me restarting Teku and Besu somehow created a situation where I would have double signed so it refused to sign from that point onwards.\r\n\r\nBut this is odd, because if my Teku-Besu node was offline (And thus unavailable), then me restarting those client pairs shouldn't have caused this situation in the first place as my Lighthouse-Nethermind node was still running and available.\r\n\r\nIf you need some logs I can send this over to you somewhere such as Discord",
