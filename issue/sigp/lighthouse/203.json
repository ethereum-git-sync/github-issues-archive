  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nWanted to have a discussion around the `TestRandom` trait added to the repo recently.\r\n\r\n## Present Behaviour\r\n\r\nWe implement `TestRandom` so that on each test run a different value is used. This helps ensure a more robust test suite as we cover more of the value space than the few values we would be able to code by hand.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\nI would suggest we look at moving to using generative testing like QuickCheck.\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\nQuickCheck style testing is not always appropriate so this would probably be using in along with the `TestRandom` trait. I supposed we could use both simultaneously but at a certain point the tests will be more non-deterministic than the code ;)\r\n\r\nThe outcome of this issue could just be a commitment to use the `quickcheck` crate where appropriate. I think the space for conversation comes in when we consider if we want to keep using `TestRandom` for those cases (or at all given it looks like we have to manually derive for most types).",
