    "body": "I took a take on this, see: #461. Not sure if this is the most elegant way to do it, but it does what we want. Although there are quit many logs which have a quite long message, so it looks not totally aligned. We can also change the width of the alignment, at the moment it is 30 characters for the message. I just saw your geth example uses 40 characters, I can increase that if you want.\r\n\r\nFurthermore the current pull request adds the functionality only to the beacon-node. I saw that logging functionality is duplicated int validator_client with pretty much exactly the same code so I could also duplicate my changes. Although I hesitated since I don't like code duplication. Is this intended for those two binaries? If not I can make a common logging package, but I was not sure where to put this (its not really eth2 related and also not protos, so it would need a new top level directory).",
