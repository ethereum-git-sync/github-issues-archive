If they can add validators to web3signer then I assume they're also privileged enough to call its HTTP API.\r\n\r\nAt the time it seemed like a bit of an over-reach for LH to start having an opinion on when new validators should be added or not. I still hold that opinion now, but I could certainly change my mind if there's some sort of flow/scenario that I haven't considered.",
