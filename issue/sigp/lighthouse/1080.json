  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nTo quote @JustinDrake in #1078\r\n\r\n> Readsâ€”When reading the PubkeyCache (specifically calling .get()) it is important in some situations that the pubkey cache be up to date. There's a bunch of code (e.g. 8 calls to update_pubkey_cache, the PubkeyCacheIncomplete error in get_validator_index) to deal with that. This feels a bit unnecessarily complicated and error prone. For example, what if you forgot to call update_pubkey_cache somewhere? Why not do something simpler, e.g. call update_pubkey_cache in the only two places where .get() is called?\r\n\r\nI replied with:\r\n\r\n> Yep this make sense. I can only put this down to an oversight on my behalf.\r\n\r\nI think we should implement Justin's suggestions and then close this issue.\r\n\r\n",
