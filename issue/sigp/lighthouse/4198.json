  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nLighthouse's mechanism for recovering from missed hard forks is currently broken. It is implemented in the `fork_revert` module, but hasn't worked since Altair.\r\n\r\nPart of the reason for this is that it is hard to test comprehensively. The ideal test depends on access to _prior versions of Lighthouse_ which aren't available on CI (yet). The test looks something like this:\r\n\r\n1. Run a testnet with two types of nodes:\r\n   - Canonical chain: latest Lighthouse version, and fork epoch set for the latest hard fork (e.g. Capella).\r\n   - Stale chain: previous Lighthouse version and _no fork epoch set_.\r\n2. Wait until the testnet has advanced past the configured fork epoch. The canonical chain should continue (and finalize) with new blocks, while the stale chain _also_ continues. The nodes will likely disconnect from each other on P2P.\r\n3. Shut down all the stale nodes and restart them with the latest version of Lighthouse & with the fork epoch configured. Ensure that they don't crash on startup and sync back up to the canonical chain.\r\n\r\nThere's a lot of local testnet infra described here which is currently not really up to scratch. We likely need changes like #3807 to land first so we can test these scenarios.\r\n\r\nThere's also a more minor guarantee that we _can_ test on CI without access to prior versions, which is that the current version of Lighthouse can revert a fork missed by the same version. We could likely test this as a beacon_chain test and it would get us ~50% of the way towards a more robust `fork_revert` module.\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\n- [ ] Fix fork_revert logic\r\n- [ ] Basic test (single version)\r\n- [ ] Comprehensive test (multiple versions)\r\n",
