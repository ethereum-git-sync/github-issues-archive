  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nI think it would be interesting if the BN would \"pretend\" to create an attestation every slot and then look at how that attestation would have performed.\r\n\r\nIn detail, I think we should call [`BeaconChain::produce_unaggregated_attestation`](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/dfcb3363c757671eb19d5f8e519b4b94ac74677a/beacon_node/beacon_chain/src/beacon_chain.rs#L1557-L1561) 4s into each slot and store the resulting `attestation.data`. Then, in `ValidatorMonitor::process_valid_state` we could see if the `attestation.data` matches the head/target/source.\r\n\r\nSome things to consider:\r\n\r\n- If we use the `ValidatorMonitor` then it'll only run when the user has the validator monitor enabled. That seems reasonable to me.\r\n- We probably want to only check the head/target/source once the `state.slot` is some slots beyond `attestation.data.slot` to defend against re-orgs. I'd suggest 16 slots as a trade-off between being safe enough and fast enough. I'm open to suggestion though!\r\n\r\n## Extra Info\r\n\r\n### Attestation reward details\r\n\r\nWhen I talk about \"matching the head/target/source\" I'm talking about whether the attestation meets the requirements to be given rewards. The [Altair specs](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/altair/beacon-chain.md#participation-flag-indices) define the \"Participation Flag Indices\". If a validator has one of those flags set, then they receive rewards. You can see them getting set in [`get_attestation_participation_flag_indices`](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/altair/beacon-chain.md#get_attestation_participation_flag_indices).\r\n\r\n### Timer example\r\n\r\nHere's an example of a task on the `BeaconChain` that runs periodically each slot:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/dfcb3363c757671eb19d5f8e519b4b94ac74677a/beacon_node/beacon_chain/src/proposer_prep_service.rs#L27-L72\r\n",
