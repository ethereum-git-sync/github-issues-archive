  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nI think it would be interesting if the BN would \"pretend\" to create an attestation every slot and then look at how that attestation would have performed.\r\n\r\nIn detail, I think we should call [`BeaconChain::produce_unaggregated_attestation`](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/dfcb3363c757671eb19d5f8e519b4b94ac74677a/beacon_node/beacon_chain/src/beacon_chain.rs#L1557-L1561) 4s into each slot and store the resulting `attestation.data`. Then, in `ValidatorMonitor::process_valid_state` we could see if the `attestation.data` matches the head/target/source.\r\n\r\nSome things to consider:\r\n\r\n- If we use the `ValidatorMonitor` then it'll only run when the user has the validator monitor enabled. That seems reasonable to me.\r\n- We probably want to only check the head/target/source once the `state.slot` is some slots beyond `attestation.data.slot` to defend against re-orgs. I'd suggest 16 slots as a trade-off between being safe enough and fast enough. I'm open to suggestion though!\r\n\r\n## Extra Info\r\n\r\n### Attestation reward details\r\n\r\nWhen I talk about \"matching the head/target/source\" I'm talking about whether the attestation meets the requirements to be given rewards. The [Altair specs](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/altair/beacon-chain.md#participation-flag-indices) define the \"Participation Flag Indices\". If a validator has one of those flags set, then they receive rewards. You can see them getting set in [`get_attestation_participation_flag_indices`](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/altair/beacon-chain.md#get_attestation_participation_flag_indices).\r\n\r\n### Timer example\r\n\r\nHere's an example of a task on the `BeaconChain` that runs periodically each slot:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/dfcb3363c757671eb19d5f8e519b4b94ac74677a/beacon_node/beacon_chain/src/proposer_prep_service.rs#L27-L72\r\n",

    "body": "Hi LH team!\r\n\r\nI am making progress with this issue but a few questions came to mind whilst coming up with a solution and I wanted to circle back with you and understand your view on the matter.\r\n\r\nI am understanding that by producing an unaggregated attestation (UA) in a service running at each slot on the BN, we'll mainly be able to assess the performance of `BeaconChain::produce_unaggregated_attestation` as the complete flow would also involve modifying the VC to sign the UA such as:\r\n1. VC calls the BN to get an UA\r\n2. BN produces an UA and returns it to the VC\r\n3. VC signes the UA\r\n4. VC sends the signed attestations to the BN\r\n5. BN validates and broadcasts the signed attestations\r\n\r\nFirst off, I wanted to check with you that what's expected here is that we are not introducing any code in the VC?\r\n\r\nSecondly, to my understanding, what I should do in order to check the head/target/source is pretty basic as shown in the PR as we are completely mocking the whole back and forth between the VC and the BN and that the attestation never gets included in the state (never included in a block). I decided to only throw an error message if the 3 flags are not set with a predefined inclusion_delay equals to min_inclusion_delay as specified in the [Altair specs](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/altair/beacon-chain.md#participation-flag-indices). I leave it as is as there's no inclusion delay as we are not simulating any delay when producing an ua and that it is never inserted in a block as never signed by the VC, send back to... etc. Could you please tell me if I am on the right path here?\r\n\r\nI was thinking of adding a prometheus metric counting each time when one of the 3 flags is not set. Let me know if that's something you'd find relevant or a log error is enough.\r\n\r\nI was also thinking that it would be nice for the tests relying on the. `ValidatorMonitor` to be able to compare the Prometheus values set when `process_valid_state`. Is it something that you'd like to see implemented (scrap + exposing on http server) if it's scoped in another ticket? Would love to get on with it :)\r\n\r\nAlso and last question, are you planning on going beyond theis scope to implement > 32 attestation per epoch? (eg. making the VC submits more attestations to the BN etc..)\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for your time!",

You might be able to scrape directly and bypass the HTTP server (see [`lighthouse_metrics::gather`](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/441fc1691b69f9edc4bbdc6665f3efab16265c9b/common/lighthouse_metrics/src/lib.rs#L68-L71).\r\n\r\n> Also and last question, are you planning on going beyond theis scope to implement > 32 attestation per epoch? \r\n\r\nI'm not sure what you mean here sorry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
