It's a small, isolated change which doesn't affect any persisted data (i.e., no database migration required).\r\n\r\nThere is some more complication in how we *activate* the changes (discussed in https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/issues/3466). There are two options:\r\n\r\n1. \"Loosely coordinated\": We simply replace the old logic with the new logic and then try and release around the same time as other clients. The network will be inconsistent for some weeks, however it's unlikely to be an issue.\r\n1. \"Tightly coordinated\": We keep the old and new logic around and switch from the old logic to the new logic at some epoch.\r\n\r\nAs of writing, there's no decision as to which route the clients will take.\r\n\r\nIf we take the (2) route we'll need to do some thinking to ensure that we don't end up with a mix of logic and an inconsistent state.\r\n\r\n## Update\r\n\r\nIt seems that the consensus is to go ahead with option (1): https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/issues/4566#issuecomment-1673329512\r\n",
