  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nDiscovery queries are computationally expensive and rather time consuming. The timeout for a query is currently set to 30 seconds. For large DHT's consisting of peer's that don't belong on our Eth2 chain/fork queries can take a couple of minutes to complete. \r\n\r\nWhen a validator client is attached to a beacon node, it requires the beacon node to search for peers for a subnet when required to perform specific duties. When many validators are connected to one node, the BN (beacon node) may need to perform many discovery queries. \r\n\r\nLighthouse can run con-current queries, however we limit these to conserve resources. The current implementation sets a constant: https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/master/beacon_node/eth2_libp2p/src/discovery/mod.rs#L43\r\nwhich indicates the number of concurrent queries. This will likely be set to 2 in the near future. \r\n\r\nThis means that many subnet queries will queue before being processed. They queue in here: \r\nhttps://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/master/beacon_node/eth2_libp2p/src/discovery/mod.rs#L140\r\nAnd get added when required here: https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/master/beacon_node/eth2_libp2p/src/discovery/mod.rs#L241\r\n\r\nThe queue gets processed here: \r\nhttps://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/master/beacon_node/eth2_libp2p/src/discovery/mod.rs#L402\r\n\r\nIdeally we should be smarter about processing subnet queries. If for example a query for subnet 1 and 3 were queued,  it doesn't make sense to search for peers for subnet 1 for 30 seconds then search for peers for subnet 3 (assuming a concurrency parameter of 1). Ideally we should group the queries, so that we do a single search for peers on either subnet 3 or subnet 1.\r\n\r\nCurrently, a query is re-inserted into the queue if sufficient peers are not found. Also queries search for a minimum number of peers. When grouping we need to increase the number of target peers to discover. But this can be ad-hoc because we cannot be certain which peers for which subnet will be returned. \r\n\r\nI think we should have a fixed constant of 6 peers as a target for a grouped query and we only group at most 3 queries. This should keep the query relatively fast (as it only needs to find 6 peers). Once the grouped query returns, if we find sufficient peers for one subnet but not another, we should re-queue the query's that are still required. \r\n\r\nThis involves maintaining the min_ttl for each subnet. I guess this can be done by expanding the QueryType enum to include a GroupedQuery which maintains the min_ttl for each subnet. \r\n\r\n",
