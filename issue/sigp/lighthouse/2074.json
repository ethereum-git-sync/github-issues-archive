I think we can satisfy practically any scenario by just reading the graffiti from a file.\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\n- Add a `--graffiti-file` flag to BN, VC.\r\n- Try to read from the file each time we produce/sign a block (not just at startup).\r\n- If the file read fails or the value is too long, default back to `--graffitti`.\r\n",
