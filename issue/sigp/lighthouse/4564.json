  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nWe presently include the *uncompressed* genesis state for supported networks in our binary. We have several of these files:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n[3.3M]  common/eth2_network_config/built_in_network_configs/chiado/genesis.ssz\r\n[3.1M]  common/eth2_network_config/built_in_network_configs/gnosis/genesis.ssz\r\n[5.2M]  common/eth2_network_config/built_in_network_configs/mainnet/genesis.ssz\r\n[ 28M]  common/eth2_network_config/built_in_network_configs/prater/genesis.ssz\r\n[ 15M]  common/eth2_network_config/built_in_network_configs/ropsten/genesis.ssz\r\n[2.8M]  common/eth2_network_config/built_in_network_configs/sepolia/genesis.ssz\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe total of these files is 57.4M, which goes straight to our ~~hips~~ binary size (presently ~110M). I suspect we could significantly reduce the size of the binaries by storing *compressed* `genesis.ssz` bytes in the binary and then decompressing on-demand (i.e. at startup).\r\n\r\nI propose that we use *snappy* compression, since it's used by the P2P layer and therefore available in the binary.\r\n\r\nBefore committing to this change, I would be keen to know the time it takes to decompress the state at startup. Perhaps getting numbers for mainnet and Prater would be good. We want to be careful not to slow-down BN/VC startup.\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nThe method for including the `genesis.ssz` can be a bit tricky to understand because it's written in macros. I think this should be fairly straight-forward once you get your head across it. I've included some links below to give a lay of the land.\r\n\r\nThe bytes are added to the binary here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/dfcb3363c757671eb19d5f8e519b4b94ac74677a/common/eth2_config/src/lib.rs#L129-L137\r\n\r\nThe `genesis.ssz` file used by the `include_bytes!` macro is generated here (this is where we'd want to do the snappy compression):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/dfcb3363c757671eb19d5f8e519b4b94ac74677a/common/eth2_network_config/build.rs#L30-L47\r\n\r\nThe application accesses the included bytes here (this is where we'd want to do the snappy *decompression*) (there might also be other places it is accessed):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/dfcb3363c757671eb19d5f8e519b4b94ac74677a/common/eth2_network_config/src/lib.rs#L98-L108",

    "body": "I have a repo here: https://github.com/eserilev/snappy-genesis-benchmark that compresses/decompresses `genesis.ssz` files for mainnet and prater. I left some notes in the README. To summarize:\r\n\r\nOn my machine the time it took to decompress `genesis.ssz`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmainnet: 1.5s\r\nprater: 9.8s\r\n```\r\n\r\nfile sizes for the compressed and decompressed `genesis.ssz`\r\n```\r\ndecompressed mainnet: 5.4M\r\ncompressed mainnet: 1.8M\r\n\r\ndecompressed prater: 29.8M\r\ncompressed prater: 18.1M\r\n``` \r\nSnappy compression seems to reduce file size by ~50%, ~~while increasing start-up time by potentially 10s of seconds~~.\r\n\r\nI measured elapsed time using `std::time::Instant::now()`, which I think should be sufficient. We could do more elaborate benchmarking, but I think thats probably overkill\r\n\r\n~I think adding 10s of seconds to BN/VC start up time is a fair trade off~ for reducing ~25M in binary size. What do you think?\r\n\r\nEDIT: using the release flag when running compression/decompression resulted in far faster times (in the millisecond range)",

Reducing VC startup delays is good because it reduces the downtime penalty for upgrades; I like users to feel uninhibited to update regularly.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I can see the value in a 10-20MB (~10-20%) reduction by compressing testnet binaries.

    "body": "After some more research, I've come to the following conclusions:\r\n\r\n- I think the BN only needs to decompress the genesis state at *first boot* (i.e., when the DB is empty). In other words, we don't pay the decompression cost on a reboot.\r\n- I don't think the VC ever needs to decompress the genesis state.\r\n- If possible, I think we should make [this](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/dfcb3363c757671eb19d5f8e519b4b94ac74677a/common/eth2_network_config/src/lib.rs#L44) `Vec<u8>` a `&'static [u8]`. Duplication of the state in memory is wasteful and could be up to 10% of VC memory usage.\r\n\r\nIf my first two points turn out to be correct (this is something that would be determined during implementation), then I am fine to just compress *all* states. Especially, if [Michael's timings](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/issues/4564#issuecomment-1667032284) turn out to be closer to reality for most users.\r\n\r\nOn another note, I've noticed that `Eth2NetworkConfig::beacon_state` isn't the single, canonical place where we access the `genesis_state_bytes`. Rather, those bytes tend to be access directly and passed around the application. I'd be tempted to create a new-type wrapper around those (now compressed) bytes which provides functions for compression/decompression. That's up to the implementer, though ☺️ ",

    "body": "FYI we're expecting to release v4.4.0 on/around the 31st of August. The primary goal of v4.4.0 is to add support for `--network holesky`. The Holesky genesis state doesn't exist yet, but I expect to see it at any time now.\r\n\r\nI think that this issue (state compression and downloading) is going to be critical for that release. @eserilev I'm happy for you to take this issue if you'd like to (you've done lots of great work for LH), but I'd like to give you the option to pass if you're not comfortable with the time pressure. Could you please let me know if you'd still like to tackle this issue? No pressure either way ☺️ ",
