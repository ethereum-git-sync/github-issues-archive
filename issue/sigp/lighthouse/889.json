  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nDiscovery is currently based on IP. The PING packets update the ENR's IP. \r\n\r\nA configuration should allow the Enr to have a fixed static IP, regardless of the PONG response from other peers. We should allow the static IP to be derived from a DNS name. \r\n\r\nWhen setting the `--discovery-address` flag, the Enr's IP should remain static and ignore reported IP's from PONG responses. \r\n\r\nWe should add a `--discovery-dns-address` flag which can specify the ENR's IP from a DNS name\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/ethereum/devp2p/issues/138",
