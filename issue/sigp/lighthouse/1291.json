  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nCurrently we periodically status peers. Although this is a great test of the sync logic, it's not efficient. \r\n\r\nThe periodic re-status of peers forms multiple finalised chains and constant switching between new chains during sync. This leads to re-downloading of already seen blocks. This is a good test to check the robustness of the chain switching logic which is quite complex and has many edge cases. For this reason it is left as is for the current testnets until we are content that most of the syncing logic is sound. \r\n\r\nThis issue is to prevent periodic statusing of connected peers whilst we are syncing. This will increase the stability and speed lighthouse syncing once we are content that all bugs in chain switching have been identified and resolved.\r\n",
