  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nThe `validator/blocks` v3 implementation is currently being worked on in #4629. Once that's ready we should switch the VC to use the v3 endpoint.\r\n\r\nA few other clients are also in the process of implementing the endpoint, so we'd need to come up with a sensible upgrade strategy. \r\n- we probably want to ship this together with #4629 and encourage user to update both Lighthouse BN and VC\r\n- if user uses a different CL client that does not support V3 yet, do we introduce a flag to allow user to override the behaviour?\r\n  - @michaelsproul suggested that we could use it by default once Deneb is enabled (all clients would have it ready by then), or have a flag to enable it prior to Deneb, so like:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nif deneb_already_happened || config.use_v3 {\r\n   beacon_node.get_v3(..)\r\n} else {\r\n   beacon_node.get_v2(..)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBeacon API spec:\r\n- https://github.com/ethereum/beacon-APIs/pull/339",
