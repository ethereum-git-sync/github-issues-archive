One concern is that the VPS I am running on doesn't have stellar stability reviews. I'm wondering if that is causing the runtime to go awry. However, I have managed to maintain 100% uptime on my go-ethereum nodes.\r\n\r\n## Version\r\nI've run into this issue on both 5828ff1, v1.0, and v1.0.1.\r\n\r\n## Present Behaviour\r\nThe tokio-runtime segfaults after a period of time:\r\n```\r\ntokio-runtime-w[3460]: segfault at 470ba01feea ip 00005641f1424f1b sp 00007f59e8ee21f8 error 6 in lighthouse[5641ef75e000+1d9e000]\r\n```",

    "body": "We haven't seen this issue on any other hardware, so it would be super interesting to know what's unique about your setup that's causing this.\n\nIt might be a bug in Tokio related to the specific (janky?) hypervisor your VPS provider uses. You could run something like `slabbed-or-not` to try and work out which hypervisor that might be https://github.com/kaniini/slabbed-or-not\n\nSome of the mysterious database errors we've seen have also been from people running under a hypervisor, which might just be a coincidence, but I'm not sure.\n\nThe bug may happen to be fixed by the Tokio 0.3 change (which is almost ready for release in v1.0.2)",
