  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nThe engine API spec mandates that we time out after 8 seconds on any call to `newPayload` or `forkchoiceUpdated`. The problem is that on slow hardware this can seemingly lead to a livelock/death spiral (as reported by @jclapis and other Raspberry Pi enthusiasts). If some messages take say 8.1 seconds to process then the node will be stuck forever as it times out trying to process them. The reason the spec includes these timeouts is because arguably such a node is not viable, however there are two reasons to prefer longer timeouts (or no timeouts at all):\r\n\r\n- The slow processing may be transient, due to a particularly heavy block, load on the machine, or some other factor.\r\n- Not all nodes are used to support validators, so having nodes follow the chain with occasional periods of slowness might be OK.\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\nAdd a flag to the beacon node like `--execution-timeout-multiplier N` which takes an integer value and extends timeouts by a factor of `N`.\r\n\r\nIn the code, it should have the effect of lengthening the timeouts used here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/aa022f46855df2a1420a6a80a788c73dc2779aa7/beacon_node/execution_layer/src/engine_api/http.rs#L22-L38\r\n",
