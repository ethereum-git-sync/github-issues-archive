For now I'm making it so that the account manager locks the keystore at the hardcoded path it expects (`voting-keystore.json.lock`), so that if another process has locked this keystore, it fails. But this isn't ideal, because keystores _aren't_ always named as the `ValidatorDir` code expects.\r\n",
