  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nIf a node operator moves their data directory (eg. `--data-dir`) the voting keystore path may need to be updated in the `validator_definitions.yml` file but this is not necessarily obvious to the operator.\r\n\r\n## Version\r\n\r\nThis affects `stable` but I made a PR to `unstable` with a possible fix.\r\n\r\n## Present Behaviour\r\n\r\nIn the situation described above (node operator moved the data directory, eg. `--datadir`) but did not change the path for `voting_keystore_path` in their `validator_definitions.yml` file. The following output will be seen when trying to start the validator client process:\r\n\r\n```\r\nDec 04 18:00:08 deskboy systemd[1]: Started Lighthouse Validator.\r\nDec 04 18:00:08 deskboy lighthouse[418374]: Dec 05 00:00:08.966 INFO Logging to file                         path: \"/storage_4TB/lighthouse/validators/logs/validator.log\"\r\nDec 04 18:00:08 deskboy lighthouse[418374]: Dec 05 00:00:08.966 INFO Lighthouse started                      version: Lighthouse/v3.2.1-6d5a2b5\r\nDec 04 18:00:08 deskboy lighthouse[418374]: Dec 05 00:00:08.966 INFO Configured for network                  name: mainnet\r\nDec 04 18:00:08 deskboy lighthouse[418374]: Dec 05 00:00:08.966 INFO Starting validator client               validator_dir: \"/storage_4TB/lighthouse/validators\", beacon_nodes: [\"http://localhost:5052/\"]\r\nDec 04 18:00:08 deskboy lighthouse[418374]: Dec 05 00:00:08.966 INFO HTTP metrics server is disabled\r\nDec 04 18:00:08 deskboy lighthouse[418374]: Dec 05 00:00:08.967 INFO Completed validator discovery           new_validators: 0\r\nDec 04 18:00:08 deskboy lighthouse[418374]: Dec 05 00:00:08.968 CRIT Failed to start validator client        reason: Unable to initialize validators: UnableToOpenVotingKeystore(Os { code: 2, kind: NotFound, message: \"No such file or directory\" })\r\nDec 04 18:00:08 deskboy lighthouse[418374]: Dec 05 00:00:08.968 INFO Internal shutdown received              reason: Failed to start validator client\r\nDec 04 18:00:08 deskboy lighthouse[418374]: Dec 05 00:00:08.968 INFO Shutting down..                         reason: Failure(\"Failed to start validator client\")\r\nDec 04 18:00:08 deskboy lighthouse[418374]: Failed to start validator client\r\nDec 04 18:00:08 deskboy systemd[1]: lighthousevalidator.service: Main process exited, code=exited, status=1/FAILURE\r\nDec 04 18:00:08 deskboy systemd[1]: lighthousevalidator.service: Failed with result 'exit-code'.\r\nDec 04 18:00:14 deskboy systemd[1]: lighthousevalidator.service: Scheduled restart job, restart counter is at 21402.\r\nDec 04 18:00:14 deskboy systemd[1]: Stopped Lighthouse Validator.\r\n```\r\n\r\nRelevant CLI flags: `./lighthouse validator_client --datadir /storage_4TB/lighthouse`\r\n\r\nThe actual error thrown is: `CRIT Failed to start validator client        reason: Unable to initialize validators: UnableToOpenVotingKeystore(Os { code: 2, kind: NotFound, message: \"No such file or directory\" })` but it is not obvious what the issue is.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\nIf we reach this code path and get the `UnableToOpenVotingKeystore` error then it means our --data-dir was sepcified correctly but the `voting_keystore_path` in the `validator_definitions.yml` file was not valid. It would be nice to have a small message to tip node operators of the issue in this case (I imagine it is not too uncommon to change the `--data-dir` location when upgrading drives, migrating hosts, etc.)\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\nI will submit a PR with a proposed fix and link it to this issue. I am happy to modify the PR as needed.\r\n",
