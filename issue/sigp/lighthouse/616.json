  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nPresently we do not handle gzip encoding when connecting to an eth1 peer. Gzip is commonly used by public Ethereum nodes because it significantly reduces the size of resoonses.\r\n\r\n## Detail\r\n\r\nI provide details in the comments in the code used to communicate with the eth1 node via HTTP:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/24e941d175a7455209c140157bf8d5d588c87ba1/beacon_node/eth1/src/http.rs#L344-L364\r\n\r\nSometime after my first attempt at this I noticed that `reqwest` (the http client library we use) has a [`gzip method`](https://docs.rs/reqwest/0.9.22/reqwest/struct.ClientBuilder.html#method.gzip). I suspect this will solve all our problems.\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\n- Fix gzip encoding.\r\n- Prove that it works, by either;\r\n   - Adding unit tests.\r\n   - If it's too hard to add a test (because you need to build a gzip http server), then provide some details on how one could prove it works (e.g., run some command and it see it communicate with some public server).\r\n",
