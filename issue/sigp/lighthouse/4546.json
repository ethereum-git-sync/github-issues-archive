The block proposer is faulty (sent inconsistent blocks and blobs over gossip)\r\n2. We received the blob over rpc and it is invalid (inconsistent w.r.t the block).\r\n3. It is an internal error (kzg setup not initialized/ db error etc)\r\n\r\nIn the second case, we need to penalize the right peers (those that sent us the incorrect blobs). This would involve storing the peer_id of the peer that sends us the rpc blobs until it has been verified against the blob.",
