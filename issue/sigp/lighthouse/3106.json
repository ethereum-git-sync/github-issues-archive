  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nPresently adding a web3signer validator to LH only really works if you use the HTTP API: adding one to the validator definitions file manually will cause errors related to slashing protection not being initialised, prompting use of `--init-slashing-protection` (which is a nasty hack).\r\n\r\nI propose we add a new subcommand to `lighthouse account` to add remote signer validators _by calling out to the HTTP API_. I've been thinking it would be nice to overhaul `lighthouse account` to rely mostly on the VC API, and this command could be a good first experiment. Routing requests via the HTTP API has the advantage that validators can be added while the VC is running. Arguably this could also be a disadvantage, because we'd _require_ the VC API to be running, which may not be desirable for users who want to configure their VC offline and check everything before starting it back up.\r\n",
