  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nPresently block processing on the `tree-states` branch is a little bit slower than on `unstable`. Last I benchmarked it was around 3-4x slower (20ms) than `unstable` (5ms) for core block processing.\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons for this is the `O(log n)` lookups of validators and validator participation bits during attestation processing. I started adding an `EpochCache` which stores the pre-computed base_rewards for attestation processing, but it isn't fully integrated yet.\r\n\r\nWe could integrate either by storing it as a cache field on the `BeaconState`, and/or by storing it separately in a map. I think my current preference is to attach it to the `BeaconState` behind an `Arc` (it is immutable after initialization, and we want to share it between states in the same epoch).\r\n",
