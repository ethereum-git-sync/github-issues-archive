  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nOther clients expose the time/slot of when a validator needs to make an attestation next. Prysms api provides this information for each validator, indexed by their pubkey. This issue is to add a similar metric to our VC client. \r\n\r\nWe could do one of the following:\r\n1. Expose for each validator the slot of their next attestation (and potentially the committee/subnet)\r\n2. A metric that indicates the slot (or wall time) of the earliest attestation of all known validators\r\n\r\nI'd be leaning towards doing 1 to make it general. A user has requested we do at least 2, but perhaps we stick with the more general 1. for other potential users. \r\n",
