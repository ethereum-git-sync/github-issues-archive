See: https://github.com/skade/leveldb\r\n\r\nIn contrast, the [RocksDB bindings](https://github.com/rust-rocksdb/rust-rocksdb) are much more actively maintained (updates within the last month), and support more features (including range queries). RocksDB is also meant to be a successor to LevelDB, and is used by Parity: https://github.com/paritytech/parity-ethereum/tree/master/parity/db\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we could switch to something other than RocksDB.
