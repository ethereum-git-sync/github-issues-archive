  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nIf I understand correctly, historical blocks is not crucial in order to attest/propose. I think it would be optimal if we give the EL full IO and network bandwidth to fully sync before downloading historical blocks. It would greatly increase the speed (x2?) to get back to attesting after a power outage, fresh sync etc..\r\n\r\n## Version\r\n\r\n3.4.0\r\n\r\n## Present Behaviour\r\n\r\nEL and CL syncs in parallel, can't sync EL without a BN. But running the BN will automatically download historical blocks and clog the IO while it's not crucial for staking operations\r\n\r\n## Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\nLet the BN sync all the required stuff, but wait to download historical blocks untill EL no longer responds with a HeadBlockNotFullyVerified",
