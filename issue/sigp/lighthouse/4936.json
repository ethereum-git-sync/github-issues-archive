This degradation not only hinders Lighthouse's efficiency in fulfilling its validator duties but also, in numerous instances, triggers interventions from the OOM killer.  \r\n\r\n## Version\r\n\r\n- Rust Version: `1.69.0`\r\n- Production Version: `v4.4.1`\r\n- Dev Version: Latest unstable (commit: `051c3e84`)\r\n\r\n## Present Behaviour\r\n\r\nLighthouse is hampered by significant performance degradation when executing a batch job to update multiple validators in the local development environment. The symptoms include:\r\n\r\n- A noticeable slowdown in performance during the batch job execution.\r\n- Frequent interventions from the OOM killer, leading to the termination of the Lighthouse process.\r\n- Modest but consistent memory consumption growth \r\n- Errors in the logs, suggesting potential issues with the logger buffer overflow:\r\n```\r\nNov 13 21:16:43.600 ERRO slog-async: logger dropped messages due to channel overflow, count: 7\r\nNov 13 21:16:43.600 ERRO slog-async: logger dropped messages due to channel overflow, count: 5\r\nNov 13 21:16:43.600 ERRO slog-async: logger dropped messages due to channel overflow, count: 7\r\n```\r\n\r\nAttempts to capture a CPU profile pointed towards `slog`, indicating potential performance bottlenecks related to logging.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\nLighthouse should seamlessly update multiple validators without succumbing to notable performance degradation. The application's performance should remain optimal, and interventions from the OOM killer should be eliminated.\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\nEfforts to address the issue involved:\r\n\r\n- CPU Profiling: Attempted CPU profiling which highlighted that a significant portion of time is allocated to `async-slog`, with logging consuming 1 second out of a 10-second profile. This observation suggested potential issues with `async-slog` and correlated with the errors in the logs, indicating a logger buffer overflow\r\n- Memory Profiling: Tried to capture heap profile with `heaptrack` with no luck.\r\n- Memory Monitoring: Lighthouse's memory consumption using the `top` command, noting modest but consistent growth.\r\n- Logger Optimisation: Increased logger buffer size and removed logger calls completely at the problematic endpoint, yet still encountered persistent OOM killer interventions.\r\n",
