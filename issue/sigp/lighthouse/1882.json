In the case of #1874, this was because a commit had been made through the GitHub UI, and for some reason, the CLA check was skipped.\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\nCheck the CLA assistant config at https://cla-assistant.io/ to see if there's an option to run the assistant in more cases/on more commits. This likely requires quite high-level perms for the Lighthouse org, which would need to be granted by @paulhauner (my current permissions are insufficient).\r\n",
