    "body": "Thank you, Michael. That is very helpful, as well as interesting.\r\n\r\nFor the `lighthouse beacon_node` instance I was using a Xeon CPU with a whopping 4 GHz clock speed, however it lacked lacked support for SHA256 native instructions. I have since switched to a 3.5 GHz Ice Lake CPU which does support SHA256 native instructions (and both supported ADX). I am tentatively pleased with the results, although I can't yet say the increase in revenue is statistically significant.\r\n\r\nTo take advantage of these CPU-specific performance enhancements do I need to build Lighthouse from source or can I use https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/releases/download/v3.0.0/lighthouse-v3.0.0-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz ?",
