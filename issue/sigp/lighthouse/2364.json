This lint was originally created by a Lighthouse contributor for https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/issues/1621, and has been improved by other Clippy contributors since!\r\n\r\nTo resolve this issue we should put some print statements in Clippy to work out what AST it sees for functions like `u64::pow`, and then work out how to incorporate detection of those AST nodes.\r\n\r\n## Version\r\n\r\nRust 1.52.1 (stable)",
