    "body": "I updated https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/88 to, hopefully, reflect @paulhauner's helpful review comments.  \r\n\r\nI also added TreeHash implementations for Vec<T> and HashMap<K, V>.  Testing those against officially known tests/results should verify basic functionality is correct and consistent with other clients. I'm pretty sure that tweaks will be needed (there are disparities/confusion between the spec and sample code) , but hopefully, the basic structure is currently in place.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of TODO's. I noticed an issue by @paulhauner this week which mentions an issue much be created to track every TODO.  I'm not sure if that should be done before or after a merge - and if it should be done my me in this case :)\r\n\r\nAlso, custom implementations for non-generic objects in the python sample code (ValidatorRecord and ShardAndCommittee) are not mentioned in the spec and no code comments discuss why they were added to the sample code. I added those to this PR, but I'm not clear what the plan is for these and other custom objects.",
