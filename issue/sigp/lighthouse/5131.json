  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nWhile a node is syncing (`SyncState::SyncingFinalized`), some endpoints are disabled. When trying to use an endpoint that expects a POST request and requires the node to be synced, the response is incorrect: `BAD_REQUEST: Unsupported endpoint version: v1`. As soon as the node is synced, the endpoints work properly again. Endoints expecting a GET request are seemingly unaffected.\r\n\r\n## Version\r\n\r\nI was able to trigger this with a recent unstable version and with @eserilev's branch #4575:\r\n\r\n- Lighthouse v4.6.0-0b6c898 (unstable)\r\n- Lighthouse v4.5.0-afd06b7 (#4575)\r\n\r\n## Present Behaviour\r\n\r\n1. A node is syncing a finalized chain (e.g. after some downtime)\r\n2. `curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" --data '[\"1552654\"]' \"http://localhost:5052/eth/v1/validator/duties/sync/123\"` results in `{\"code\":400,\"message\":\"BAD_REQUEST: Unsupported endpoint version: v1\",\"stacktraces\":[]}`, also if `-H \"Content-Type: application/json\"` is removed.\r\n3. As soon as the node is synced, a proper response is sent again.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\nRespond with `{\"code\":503,\"message\":\"SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE: beacon node is syncing: head slot is 825919, current slot is 864126\",\"stacktraces\":[]}` until it is synced.\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\nAdjust the warp filters (maybe `not_while_syncing_filter`)\r\n",
