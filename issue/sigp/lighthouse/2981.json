  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nSimplify the discovery logic for subnet peers. Similar to the sync_committee subnets it would be clearer to store a mapping of wanted subnets to min_ttl which reguarly gets maintined up to the min_ttl. \r\n\r\nThis will improve better tracking of deficient subnets and we can limit discovery queries when we have reached our peer limit. Currently we always perform the discovery even at our peer limit if we are dificient. Having a mapping will allow the peer manager to decide when to perform the lookups, understand which are necessary at any given time and orchestrate the discovery lookups.\r\n\r\nThis way the attestation service simply signals what is needed and we let the peer manager handle the logic for managing discovery requests and peer pruning to fit extra peers into the allocated slots.",
