  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, the book mentions `.lighthouse` as default for lots of things (validator dir etc...) but it turns out that if people are using the [lighthouse-docker](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse-docker) then their default directory will be `lighthouse-data`. This can be a little bit confusing, as new comers could think that they're doing something wrong etc.\r\n\r\nThis isn't mentioned in the [usage](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse-docker/#usage) section of the `README.md`.\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\nI think mentioning this in the README section and adding a note the md-book would be sufficient. I, personally, looked at those places until I opened the docker-compose and noticed that it was actually the `lighthouse-data` :)\r\n",

Maybe having a local `DATA_DIR` and making it obvious in the readme and associated docs might be the way to go, for maximal compatibility\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think @michaelsproul @paulhauner ?",

    "body": "I tend to agree. And have thought about this a little more.\r\n\r\nThe current docker set up runs as root. So setting the data directory to `~/.lighthouse` could cause a number of issues with users running docker and non-docker set ups. If the docker is ran first, it creates root-owned folders preventing non-docker lighthouse accessing the default data dir. \r\n\r\nIf non-docker users ran first, then the docker-setup could inadvertently be using the wrong db on the wrong testnet. \r\n\r\nI think the best way forward here, is to continue to use the `lighthouse-data` directory and update all associated documentation so that it is more clear. \r\n\r\n@pscott what do you think? Maybe we could also rename it to be something more obvious",
