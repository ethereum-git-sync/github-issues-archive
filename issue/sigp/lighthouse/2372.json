  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nMy validator has been running on `mainnet` for a few days now. I'm syncing a local Geth client in the background for the long haul, but for now my Beacon node has been hooked up to Infura. I successfully made deposits and my validators are active and attesting, so the ETH1 endpoint was working at some point. But in the past day I've been seeing the following...\r\n\r\n`May 27 16:22:00 ethereum lighthouse[165241]: May 27 16:22:00.198 ERRO Failed to update eth1 cache             error: Failed to update Eth1 service: \"All fallback errored: https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/xxx => BlockDownloadFailed(\\\"Request failed: reqwest::Error { kind: Request, url: Url { scheme: \\\\\\\"https\\\\\\\", username: \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\", password: None, host: Some(Domain(\\\\\\\"mainnet.infura.io\\\\\\\")), port: None, path: \\\\\\\"/v3/xxx\\\\\\\", query: None, fragment: None }, source: TimedOut }\\\")\", retry_millis: 7000, service: eth1_rpc`\r\n\r\nI thought that maybe Infura was rate-limiting me, but when I log into Infura I see in their dashboard that I'm both well below the limit and also that the node appears to be successfully making requests.\r\n\r\nI signed up for Alchemy to try another provider and I'm seeing the same behavior. Requests are made, Alchemy's dashboard shows the requests are happening and responding in the 10ms range.\r\n\r\nThen I hooked up Lighthouse to the local Geth (even though it's not done syncing), and saw the same `TimedOut` behavior even on localhost, which seems unlikely.\r\n\r\nI can `curl` Infura and Alchemy and Geth just fine. Infura responds to `POST` with JSON. Curl doesn't time out. This leads me to believe that there is some sort of issue with the Rust client itself.\r\n\r\n## Version\r\n\r\n```\r\nLighthouse v1.3.0-3a24ca5\r\nBLS Library: blst-modern\r\nSpecs: mainnet (true), minimal (false), v0.12.3 (false)\r\n```\r\n\r\nLocal Geth is\r\n\r\n```\r\n1.10.3-stable-991384a7\r\n```\r\n\r\nLocal Geth sync progress is currently:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  currentBlock: 12518158,\r\n  highestBlock: 12518277,\r\n  knownStates: 732082090,\r\n  pulledStates: 731954144,\r\n  startingBlock: 12514158\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have no idea what the remote nodes are for Infura or Alchemy.\r\n\r\n## Present Behaviour\r\n\r\nEth1 syncing is timing out with multiple providers, even when response times seem reasonable. Connections appear to be initiating but not resolving in the rust client.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\nEth1 endpoints should be queried. Replies should be parsed and cached.\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\nUnknown.",

Lighthouse seems to be returning `NotReachable` for different types of errors (500, 403(?) and legitimately not reachable). This is Bad Behaviour which makes debugging harder. Apologies for this, I wasn't aware. I'll look into it.\r\n2. We can use `tcpdump` to see if Lighthouse is at least *trying* to make outgoing calls and then use the amount of traffic to infer if it's actually hitting a server or some sort. \r\n\r\nSo, from here I'd be tempted to double check your Infura keys and perhaps try quoting them to ensure they're not getting mangled by the shell. Perhaps trying `tcpdump` will be interesting, up to you. In the meantime I will try and make Lighthouse return better errors!\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "I made some progress with returning more detailed errors :tada: https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/2383 includes much more detail with these errors (see the PR description for examples that relate to my previous comment in this thread).\r\n\r\nSo, for you @onyxrev there are two options:\r\n\r\n1. Wait for the next release which contains these fixes (we're preparing a new release scheduled for later this week, but we're still testing some extensive changes to the networking stack).\r\n1. Build https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/2383, use the detailed error messages to determine what the issue is and then swap back to `stable` (i.e., the [latest release](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/releases/tag/v1.3.0)) when your issues are straightened out.\r\n\r\nI do not recommend running https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/2383 (which builds upon our `unstable` branch) for anything beyond intial testing at the moment. We're still working on some known bugs in `unstable` which are not present on `stable`.\r\n\r\nThanks for the time you've spent so far troubleshooting with us :pray: \r\n",
