  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nSince we import the same dependency twice with different features enabled in `kzg`, we are no longer able to vendor lighthouse deps due to this issue: https://github.com/lapce/lapce/issues/2452\r\n\r\nIt looks like there was previously a `--no-merge-sources` flag, but when `vendor` was added as a subcommand to `cargo` this was removed. There still exists `cargo-vendor vendor --no-merge-sources` but I think this requires using rust edition `2018`.  I wonder if separately publishing the `kzg` crate or publishing a mainnet and minimal version of the `c-kzg` bindings might let us workaround this?\r\n\r\n",
