For example all the signatures sets use a generic \"getter\" closure to obtain the pubkey during signature verification which allows us to abstract away global caches and other messy things:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/36f213c092eb4802e603cff5901269168637c3f6/eth2/state_processing/src/per_block_processing/signature_sets.rs#L71\r\n\r\n*: The rayon parallelization code is perhaps a violation here, depends if you see it as a black box or for what it really is.
