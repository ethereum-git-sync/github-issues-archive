  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nWe keep a representation of the non-finalized section of the block DAG in memory. We use this cache to run the fork choice algorithm as it's significantly faster than reading the full blocks from the slow HDD.\r\n\r\nThis issue has been raised because we are not persisting this cache to disk so it is lost each time the process is shutdown. This cache is very useful and hard to come by; we should absolutely be keeping it.\r\n\r\n## Objective\r\n\r\nThe [`lmd_ghost`](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/tree/master/eth2/lmd_ghost) crate contains the vast majority of fork-choice data and the `ReducedTree` struct is the target of this issue:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/24e941d175a7455209c140157bf8d5d588c87ba1/eth2/lmd_ghost/src/reduced_tree.rs#L114-L123\r\n\r\nUltimately, the goal for this issue is to be able to go `ReducedTree -> Vec<u8> -> ReducedTree`. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Suggestions\r\n\r\nI think we should use `ssz` as the encoding format for bytes. It's simple, we know how it works and it's consistent with everything else in the DB.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is to define an intermediate struct of elements that already implement SSZ, then define `Into`/`From`. Something like this:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(Encode, Decode)]\r\nSszReducedTree {\r\n    node_hashes: Vec<Hash256>,\r\n    nodes: Vec<SszNode>,\r\n    latest_votes: Vec<Option<Vote>>,\r\n    root_hash: Hash256\r\n    root_slot: Slot,\r\n}\r\n```  \r\n\r\nSomething things to note:\r\n- There is no way to encode a `HashMap` in SSZ (it is not specified). I suggest using a `Vec`.\r\n- The `ssz_derive` macros (`Encode`, `Decode`) don't work for tuples.\r\n\r\n## How to resolve\r\n\r\n- Devise and implement a way to go `ReducedTree -> Vec<u8> -> ReducedTree`.\r\n- Expose it via a new method on the  [`LmdGhost`](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/24e941d175a7455209c140157bf8d5d588c87ba1/eth2/lmd_ghost/src/lib.rs#L11) trait.\r\n",
