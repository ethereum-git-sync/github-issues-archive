Only effective if there is no existing database.\r\n\r\nSUBCOMMANDS:\r\n    account_manager     Utilities for generating and managing Ethereum 2.0 accounts. [aliases: a, am,\r\n                        account, account_manager]\r\n    beacon_node         The primary component which connects to the Ethereum 2.0 P2P network and downloads, verifies\r\n                        and stores blocks. Provides a HTTP API for querying the beacon chain and publishing messages\r\n                        to the network. [aliases: b, bn, beacon]\r\n    boot_node           Start a special Lighthouse process that only serves as a discv5 boot-node. This process will\r\n                        *not* import blocks or perform most typical beacon node functions. Instead, it will simply\r\n                        run the discv5 service and assist nodes on the network to discover each other. This is the\r\n                        recommended way to provide a network boot-node since it has a reduced attack surface\r\n                        compared to a full beacon node.\r\n    help                Prints this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)\r\n    remote_signer       Simple HTTP BLS signer service. This service is designed to be consumed by Ethereum 2.0\r\n                        clients, looking for a more secure avenue to store their BLS12-381 secret keys, while\r\n                        running their validators in more permisive and/or scalable environments. [aliases:\r\n                        rs]\r\n    validator_client    When connected to a beacon node, performs the duties of a staked validator (e.g., proposing\r\n                        blocks and attestations). [aliases: v, vc, validator]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI assume we'd need to go into detail for each sub-command (e.g., `beacon_node`) for it to be useful. Maintaining this manually would be a recipe for outdated-ness (the current `--help` texts get outdated frequently), so this would require some sort of automated solution where we generate the help text via CI.",
