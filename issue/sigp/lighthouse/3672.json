  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nNow that the merge has occurred, our docs look a bit strange, because the instructions for running a node are split between several pages, including [Merge Migration](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/merge-migration.html). I think it would be nice to have a page that steps through setting up a full node at a high-level, including checkpoint sync and connecting to the EL.\r\n\r\nThis would also be useful for users who want to run nodes without validating, for whom the current [Become a validator](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/mainnet-validator.html) page is not relevant.\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\n* Write up a nice new page for the book on how to run a full node, including how to use checkpoint sync and connect to the execution layer. I think this should be written in a style that centres the `lighthouse` binaries and its flags, with no reference to e.g. `systemd` or Docker.\r\n* Link the new page high in the table of contents. I think a sensible order might be:\r\n  1. Introduction\r\n  2. Installation\r\n  3. How to run a node\r\n  4. How to become a validator\r\n  5. \\<everything else\\>\r\n* Establish redirects from old page names to relevant new ones. The deprecated pages could live in a separate section at the very end of the book (or be hidden from the ToC?).\r\n\r\n",
