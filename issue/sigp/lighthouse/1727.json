  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nCurrently lighthouse provides two CLI tools which perform deposits on the eth1 chain:\r\n\r\n- `lighthouse account validator deposit`\r\n- `lighthouse account validator topup` (currently in #1694).\r\n\r\nThese two tools are suitable for testnets, but they need revisiting before we go to mainnet.\r\n\r\n## Detail\r\n\r\nHere are some known issues:\r\n\r\n- Lockfiles are not cleaned up after a ctrl+c whilst waiting for a transaction to complete.\r\n- The deposit data file is not written to disk until *after* the transaction is completed, this can lead to duplicate deposits.\r\n- It relies upon the eth1 node to do the signing, which is generally avoided.\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\nI think we need to do a good re-think about how we currently handle submitting eth1 transactions. I am attracted to the idea of doing the eth1 tx signing *inside* lighthouse, but that means quite a bit of work on our end.\r\n\r\nAnother alternative is to never submit eth1 transactions with Lighthouse, instead only output transaction data which the user will need to sign and submit. A potential way to do this would be to define some standard eth1-transcation output (e.g., tx data, to address, amount in JSON) and then create a simple web interface for submitting these transactions via Metamask.",
