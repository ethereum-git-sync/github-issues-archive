  "body": "There is an implementation of a Boolean Bitfield here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/tree/master/boolean-bitfield\r\n\r\nIt (kinda) does the job for now, but it really needs some work done. If you spend some time looking at it I think you'll soon find out what I mean. As an example;\r\n\r\n- There is a possibility of overflows: we return the number of bits as a `usize`, however there can theoretically be `usize` number of bytes meaning we can have `8 * usize` bits.\r\n- It keeps track of the number of true bits as you flip bits on and off. I don't think this is ideal as most cases where we want to know the number of true bits, we'll be receiving some serialized bytes from somewhere else (e.g., p2p nodes) and will need to calculate it manually.\r\n\r\nOn top of these two points, there's likely many chances for optimization.\r\n\r\n# Required Functionality\r\n\r\n## Get\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nget(n: usize) -> Result<bool, Error>\r\n```\r\n\r\nGet value at index `n`.\r\n\r\nError if bit out-of-bounds (OOB) of underlying bytes.\r\n\r\n## Set\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nset(n: usize, val: bool) -> Result<(bool, Error>\r\n```\r\n\r\nSet bit at index `n`.

    "body": "Hey, thanks for jumping on this one :)\r\n\r\nFor background, this was one of the first things built in the repo before it had aspirations of becoming a client. A lot has changed since then so I'm totally to a re-design it. If you can come up with a cleaner/more-standard API I have no objections to changing it.\r\n\r\nUnbounded (I think) was me trying to express that it's dynamically extendable, not based on some fixed array.\r\n\r\nNow that I know more about the spec, I don't think dynamically growing it is so important. Here are the primary use-cases for it:\r\n\r\n1. An `AttestationRecord` comes in off the network and we scan the bitfield to determine which validators have voted on it (or, at least _should_ have voted on it).\r\n2. A validator takes some `AttestationRecord`, adds their signature to the aggregate signature and flips their corresponding bit to true.\r\n3. A validator creates a new `AttestationRecord` and initializes the bitfield to be some length and sets their bit to `true`. Note: the `AttestationRecord` _must_ always be big enough to represent the whole committee, you can't discard trailing `0` bytes.\r\n\r\nI've considered making the `BooleanBitfield` store a slice, instead of a Vec. This would reduce some copy operations when validating blocks off the network; you can just read directly from the serialized bytes. It would however make it a tiny bit harder to instantiate (you'd need the manage the lifetime of the underlying bytes). Food for thought.\r\n\r\nFor resources:\r\n\r\n- \"the spec\": https://notes.ethereum.org/SCIg8AH5SA-O4C1G1LYZHQ?view\r\n- The bitfield implementation in the PoC: https://github.com/ethereum/beacon_chain/blob/master/beacon_chain/utils/bitfield.py\r\n\r\nAFAIK there are no other resources. I've been trying to generate specification documents if they don't exist -- up to you if you're interested in that :)\r\n\r\nFYI I am about to merge some changes to the bitfield crate onto `master`. They're not very significant, the most significant being a change to the order of bytes during SSZ serialization.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps, let me know if I can help :)",

    "body": "Great -- So it seems like there are two cases to consider before we can specify the nature of this bitfield:\r\n\r\n1) this client gets an attestation record off the wire -- in this case, I'm assuming someone else has already determined the size and the most this client does is to read which bits are set (or not set) and possibly write its own bit (which it knows from some other protocol state orthogonal to this bitfield impl). this case is p straightforward bc we are just using the work someone else did.\r\n\r\n2) the client needs to generate an attestation record. in which case it needs to know the committee size to properly size the bitfield. am I correct to assume that the client knows the committee size before it needs to create the attestation record? in that case, it will just pass in the size as a param and we can loop to the concerns in (1).\r\n\r\nfrom looking at the spec, there is a minimum committee size and there seems to be a maximum (as the total number of validators is capped) but it's not immediately clear how that backs into a maximum committee size. I would suggest we use a BigInteger type like this https://github.com/rust-num/num-bigint so we don't have to think about overflows and stuff. It can always be replaced with a more optimized impl if its a bottleneck. Thoughts on this approach?",

    "body": "Hey,\r\n  Thanks for the input @rawfalafel! :)\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm not exactly sure what the limit for a committee is, but I believe it's larger than `409`. 10% of present ETH supply staking means a committee size of `305`, so I would hope that the `409` maximum isn't the case -- how did you determine that please? (For reference, here's where I got those numbers: https://github.com/ethereum/beacon_chain/issues/103)\r\n\r\n\r\n@ralexstokes I would also be tempted to use a `BigInteger` type in normal circumstances, however this bitfield is pretty much guaranteed to either be born from, or die as a byte-array. This makes me lean towards backing it up with a byte array.\r\n\r\nAnother reason that I think a byte-backed impl would be useful is that we need to do some checks on the  actual byte-array when processing a block. We need to know:\r\n\r\n- Are the bitfield bytes too long? I.e., are there more bitfield bytes than required to represent the number of attesters for this shard?\r\n- If `attester_count % 8 != 0`, are any of the \"spare\" bits set? If so, block is invalid.\r\n\r\nFYI, both of these conditions are required so that the hash of a `Block`/`AttestationRecord` continues to provide a unique identity of that object.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf it helps, here an example of a bitfield being using in the wild:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/49737fbc82228f4b227d51b59e22948997f94a72/beacon_chain/validation/src/attestation_validation.rs#L124-L143\r\n\r\nPresently I'm leaning towards the bitfield implementation containing two things:\r\n\r\n1. A struct that contains a slice (i.e., pointer to some bytes) that gives us a bitfield-like API.\r\n2. A wrapper struct that holds some bytes and an instance of (1) - the bitfield-like API.\r\n\r\n(1) would allow us to deal with existing byte arrays without performing a memory copy. (2) would allow us to re-use the code from (1) whilst neatly storing the actual bytes somewhere.\r\n\r\nThoughts? Happy to jump on a call if that is an easier method of comms?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n",

    "body": "@paulhauner  so I wasn't thinking far enough ahead and the `Bitfield` struct i was going to make that wraps a `BitfieldView` is not going to work out as we don't want a Rust struct to have a reference to an internal field. A way I usually see this worked around is that you just keep `usize` indexes into the backing storage instead of references. It isn't immediately clear to me that this is going to be that ergonomic so I'm inclined to consider other options.\r\n\r\nIt seems we have two cases:  1. we want to make a zeroed bitfield and allocate storage and 2. we want to use the bitfield logic but refer to an already allocated storage e.g. from bytes off the wire. You have any thoughts on what this looks like in legal Rust? It seems like the straightforward thing is that we have two different structs for each case (and perhaps pull the common logic out into common functions). This seems fine but if you can think of a way to avoid the duplication I'm all for it. Thoughts?",

    "body": "@paulhauner the idea w/ `bit_count` was that it would act as a mask for any \"spare bits\" but the more I think about it, you probably want to mix in some of the validation concerns to this struct, rather than have the validation happen upstream and just use an instance of `Bitfield` for some bit-twiddling over already validated data. Given that we are getting arbitrary inputs off the wire I think your view is more appropriate so in that case I would think we can remove `bit_count`.\r\n\r\nMy question now is -- how do you want to handle a panic on out of bounds access? If we don't check the index ahead of time like I have it, then the code will just panic on the invalid array access to `backing_bytes`. If we do check it and don't know the correct bit_count at construction time then the best we can do what I already have. Thoughts on this??",

    "body": "You raised an excellent point about read/write structs. I just went on a rather long and magical journey across the internet and found [std::borrow::Cow](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/borrow/enum.Cow.html). \r\n\r\nCoW is copy-on-write. In a nutshell, reference whilst reading and then copy once a write is required. A.K.A lazy-copy.\r\n\r\nCheck out my example:\r\n\r\nhttps://play.rust-lang.org/?gist=91146bacb1a76acc537667d5e9093f9b&version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2015\r\n\r\nGreat question about panics. I think we should make `get()` return `Option<usize>` and `set()` return `Result<(), BitfieldError>`.\r\n\r\nIf you `get()` an out-of-bounds bit, you get `None`. If you `set()` and out-of-bounds bit you get `Err(BitfieldError::OutofBounds)`.\r\n\r\nThe `get()` functionality I described mirrors `std::vec::Vec` whereas `set()` doesn't.. maybe it's not-so-Rusty but I'm hesitant to introduce any panics. If you can find a good reason _not_ to return `Result` from `set()` I'm up for it.\r\n\r\nThanks!!! ",
