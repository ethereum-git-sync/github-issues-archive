  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nPresently our BLS implementation is aligned with v0.12.3 of the Eth2 spec, and v3 of the BLS specification draft. The latest version of the BLS draft is v4, and the Eth2 spec intends to switch to it before mainnet.\r\n\r\nAlthough we don't yet want to switch to BLSv4, we _would_ like to move away from using a forked version of BLST. This was attempted in #1595, but reverted in #1649 due to a bug in BLST: https://github.com/supranational/blst/issues/31. Although a fix exists upstream, we can't yet bring it in, because it also forces us onto BLSv4 (a potentially consensus-breaking change).\r\n\r\nAn attempt to update to BLSv4 and upstream BLST is provided here (#1703), although it may need further adjustments depending on how we decide to handle the consensus breakage.\r\n",
