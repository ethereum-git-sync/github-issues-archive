  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nWith the transition to atomic database operations, and the removal of various caches, several of the metrics in [`beacon_node/store/src/metrics.rs`](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/master/beacon_node/store/src/metrics.rs) have become outdated. For example: `DISK_DB_WRITE_BYTES` is no longer complete, because it doesn't include writes from atomic transactions, and `BEACON_STATE_CACHE_HIT_COUNT` is unused since the LRU cache of beacon states was removed. There are a lot of store metrics in that file, and a bunch more are probably wrong/useless as well.\r\n\r\nCompleting this issue will probably happen naturally when someone next tries to optimise the store. A local grafana instance will be invaluable: https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse-metrics\r\n",
