    "body": "Hey @happysalada, I've never seen either of these messages `Corruption: bad block contents` or `Bus error` on healthy hardware. This is not a Lighthouse issue, but something specific to your hardware/software stack. Some hypervisors like Proxmox have broken implementations of hardware instruction pass-through (particularly AES) that can cause mysterious errors like this. Is your Nix setup using some kind of virtualisation?\r\n\r\n> I naively thought that lighthouse would consume 100% of CPU syncing, it seems to sit at 30%, is there a setting that I missed ? Or am I capped by network speed ?\r\n\r\nThere are some single threaded bottlenecks in block processing: although we can verify some things in parallel, we need to finish fully processing all prior blocks before processing a new block. So it's not as simple as being able to max out the CPU all the time (sync isn't embarrassingly parallel).",
