  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nWe have an internal rate limit scheme for RPC requests which is quite generous. Peers that exceed these limits are sent an `RPCErrorResponse` informing them they have been rate limited and providing a timeout until they can re-request. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/2690 introduces a max RPC request concurrency value which we can further restrict and penalise peers on if they go beyond this limit. \r\n\r\nAs our responses are not spec'd it makes sense that we withhold responses rather than sending `RPCErrorResponse`s with rate limits if we can reasonably process the request within the RPC response timeout interval and still satisfy our RPC rate limits. \r\ni.e if a peer hits our rate limit, and we would otherwise request them to re-request sometime within 10 seconds, we wait that time, process the request and then respond (imitating the action of peer waiting and re-requesting internally). \r\nIf the peer is required to wait more than the 10 seconds (RPC timeout) we return our usual `RPCErrorResponse` as we should do if the peer attempts to send more than the new currency limit requests at a time.
