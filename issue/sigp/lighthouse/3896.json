  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nPresently we do a state advance for every block produced with withdrawals, here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/51088725fbbe2d3cdb3f21eb968561ec5ffc1553/beacon_node/beacon_chain/src/beacon_chain.rs#L4703-L4718\r\n\r\nThis happens during `fcU` when constructing the payload attributes, so it's kind of already off the hot path. However, we _recalculate_ the withdrawals for every call.\r\n\r\nTo fix this I think there are a few options:\r\n\r\n1. Try to use the advanced state from the snapshot cache. Downsides: state advance happens at 9s which is usually _after_ the first payload preparation call at 8s, and the state advance only gives a single slot of advancement (doesn't work for multiple skips).\r\n2. Compute the withdrawals the same way we do currently the first time the function is called (at 8s) and cache them in the `execution_layer`. Re-wire the function to attempt to load them from the `execution_layer` on subsequent calls (e.g. for the fork choice runs at 11.5s and 0s). The withdrawals are already stored in the `proposers` map on the execution layer.\r\n\r\nI think I prefer the 2nd solution at the moment.\r\n\r\nWe may also be able to benefit from a cache for block processing, although with the sweep length capped at 16K the iteration shouldn't take very long (by my estimate <2ms, even for `tree-states`). For block processing we'd probably want the cache as a `(Hash256, Vec<Withdrawal>)` on the `BeaconState`.\r\n\r\nBlock processing:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/51088725fbbe2d3cdb3f21eb968561ec5ffc1553/consensus/state_processing/src/per_block_processing.rs#L527-L528\r\n",
