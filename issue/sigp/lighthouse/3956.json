  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nPresently Lighthouse uses a 2 second timeout for `getPayload`, both when requesting a blinded block and when requesting a full block.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/38514c07f222ff7783834c48cf5c0a6ee7f346d0/beacon_node/execution_layer/src/engine_api/http.rs#L35\r\n\r\nThis means that if the EL is slow we could slow down blinded block proposals to the point where they exceed the 4s attestation deadline. We wait for the _maximum_ of the builder/EL response times here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/38514c07f222ff7783834c48cf5c0a6ee7f346d0/beacon_node/execution_layer/src/lib.rs#L675-L692\r\n\r\nFor the builder's payload, we will then _also_ need to wait for the block to be un-blinded after signing, which adds yet more latency. With a 500ms offset from the start of the slot (due to e.g. attestation packing) plus 2 seconds of EL response time (worst-case) plus 1s for the VC to sign, unblind, and for the BN+relay to broadcast, we are cutting very close to the 4s deadline.\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\nThe engine API spec uses a 1s timeout for `getPayload` at all times, which would be more consistent. However I think it could be advantageous to retain the longer timeout for full blocks and just use the shorter 1s timeout for blinded blocks. I think this could be implemented in a straight-forward way by passing the timeout to `get_full_payload_caching`. This might be worth implementing after the `capella` branch is merged, as it also makes a lot of changes to these code paths.\r\n",
