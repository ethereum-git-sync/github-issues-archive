  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nThe [optimistic sync spec](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/sync/optimistic.md) declares:\r\n\r\n> An optimistic validator MUST NOT participate in sync committees (i.e., sign across the DOMAIN_SYNC_COMMITTEE, DOMAIN_SYNC_COMMITTEE_SELECTION_PROOF or DOMAIN_CONTRIBUTION_AND_PROOF domains).\r\n\r\nWe need to ensure that a Lighthouse BN/VC pair will not sign sync committee messages that reference an optimistic `beacon_block_root`.\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\nThe first change is to return an error in [`BeaconChain::get_aggregated_sync_committee_contribution`](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/bac7c3fa544495a257722aaad9cd8f72fee2f2b4/beacon_node/beacon_chain/src/beacon_chain.rs#L1451-L1459) whenever the `sync_contribution` being return references an optimistic `beacon_block_root` (see #3140 to see how this was done for attestations).\r\n\r\nThe second, more complicated change is to stop the VC from producing a `SyncCommitteeMessage` whenever that block references an optimistic head:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/bac7c3fa544495a257722aaad9cd8f72fee2f2b4/validator_client/src/sync_committee_service.rs#L233-L241\r\n\r\nWe can't just refuse to accept the already-signed `SyncCommitteeMessage` at the BN HTTP API for two reasons:\r\n\r\n- The message is dangerous and should never be signed, we need to prevent it being signed before it is submitted to the BN.\r\n- We don't want to restrict *already signed* messages, since we assume that the VC must have good advice from some other BN that the `beacon_block_root` is valid (e.g. when using multiple BNs).\r\n\r\nI can see two options, both are blocked on #3070:\r\n\r\n1. Pass the `execution_optimistic` values around with the [sync duties](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/bac7c3fa544495a257722aaad9cd8f72fee2f2b4/validator_client/src/duties_service.rs#L112) in the VC\r\n    - Pros: doesn't require extra calls to the BN.\r\n    - Cons: it's hard to ensure the `execution_optimistic` are up-to-date without frequent polling.\r\n2. Call [`/eth/v1/beacon/headers`](https://ethereum.github.io/beacon-APIs/?urls.primaryName=dev#/Beacon/getBlockHeaders) before producing the `SyncCommitteeMessage` and checking the `execution_optimistic` value before signing\r\n    - Pros: always gets the latest info.\r\n    - Cons: requires an extra call.\r\n    \r\nI'm leaning towards (2), since it's the easiest to implement and gives us the most up-to-date info. The call to `beacon/headers` should be nice and fast, so I don't think it's too much of a bottleneck.\r\n",
