  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nLighthouse has a global datadir cli param. The beacon node uses this and creates a DATA_DIR/network directory and stores the identity key as well as the local ENR. \r\n\r\nA new subcommand for lighthouse `boot-node` creates a discovery server but generates a new network identity and ENR each run. This is not conducive to spinning up testnets. We would like it also to read from the DATA_DIR/network directory and use the ENR and local identity key. \r\n\r\nIt may be an interesting exercise to see how the beacon_node does logic and duplicate it in the `boot_node` subcommand. I imagine we can borrow some of the functions used in the beacon_node for the boot node. \r\n",
