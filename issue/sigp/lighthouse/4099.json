  "body": "Blob decoupling is motivating the following changes to the p2p layer:\r\n\r\n[`BeaconBlockAndBlobsSidecarByRoot`](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/368e70d9bef4f29a16f1c2f7018fe68eaeeb7b06/specs/deneb/p2p-interface.md#beaconblockandblobssidecarbyroot-v1) -> [`BlobSidecarsByRoot`](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/v1.3.0-rc.4/specs/deneb/p2p-interface.md#blobsidecarsbyroot-v1)\r\n[`BlobsSidecarsByRange`](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/368e70d9bef4f29a16f1c2f7018fe68eaeeb7b06/specs/deneb/p2p-interface.md#blobssidecarsbyrange-v1) -> [`BlobSidecarsByRange`](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/v1.3.0-rc.4/specs/deneb/p2p-interface.md#blobsidecarsbyrange-v1)\r\n\r\nFor the [`BlobSidecarsByRoot`](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/v1.3.0-rc.4/specs/deneb/p2p-interface.md#blobsidecarsbyroot-v1), the request is changing from `List[Root, MAX_REQUEST_BLOCKS]` to `List[BlobIdentifier, MAX_REQUEST_BLOB_SIDECARS]` and for both methods the response is changing to `List[BlobSidecar, MAX_REQUEST_BLOB_SIDECARS]`.\r\n\r\nThis is requires changes to how blobs are stored in the database. The database and attester caches currently stores blobs as:\r\n\r\n`root` -> [`BlobsSidecar`](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/368e70d9bef4f29a16f1c2f7018fe68eaeeb7b06/specs/deneb/fork-choice.md#blobssidecar)\r\n\r\nwhen they need to be stored as:\r\n\r\n`root` -> [`Vec<BlobSidecar>`](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/v1.3.0-rc.4/specs/deneb/p2p-interface.md#blobsidecar)\r\n\r\nwill probably need  a new `BlobStreamer` object (similar to `BeaconBlockStreamer`) to pre-process the [`BlobSidecarsByRoot`](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/v1.3.0-rc.4/specs/deneb/p2p-interface.md#blobsidecarsbyroot-v1) requests and minimize database lookups.",
