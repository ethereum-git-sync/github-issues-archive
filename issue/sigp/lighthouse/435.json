    "body": "Hey, yep. I've had another think about this. Perhaps we don't need to actually combine the poll_fn's rather, revert them back to two separate loops (I had this before, I can't think of reason not to at the moment). \r\n\r\nCurrently, we ensure that the two Poll's are not ready, before returning NotReady: see here: https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/master/beacon_node/network/src/service.rs#L110\r\n\r\nI think perhaps it is sufficient to loop over the first poll and break on not ready, then loop over the second poll. \r\n\r\nIt is important to test to see there is no lag if we do this. Running two nodes with a single validator and watching blocks propagate instantly is a test that this should still work. \r\n\r\nI'm yet to have the time to build a proper test suite for all the networking, but it's on the to-do list. :). \r\n\r\nLet me know if you need more information.",
