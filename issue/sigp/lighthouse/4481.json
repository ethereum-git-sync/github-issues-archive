  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nIt would be useful for several purposes to be able to drop all of the states in the freezer DB. Some uses include:\r\n\r\n- Recover from database corruption (e.g. due to https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/issues/3011).\r\n- Enable historic block pruning (see https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/4158).\r\n- Save space by running without historic states (https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/issues/3211).\r\n- Migrate from stable Lighthouse to `tree-states`\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\nI think for forwards-compatibility with tree-states it would be best to implement the deletion as several iterators over the relevant columns, which just delete everything in the column without parsing it. Basically:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfor column in relevant {\r\n  for key in db.iter_column(column) {\r\n    to_delete.push(key);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere `relevant` consists of:\r\n\r\n* `DBColumn::BeaconStateSummary` (where the `ColdStateSummary` is stored)\r\n* `DBColumn::BeaconState` (where the `PartialBeaconState` is stored)\r\n* `DBColumn::BeaconRestorePoint` (where the restore point -> state root index is stored)\r\n* `DBColumn::BeaconStateRoots`\r\n* `DBColumn::BeaconHistoricalRoots`\r\n* `DBColumn::BeaconRandaoMixes`\r\n* `DBColumn::BeaconHistoricalSummaries`\r\n\r\nI think on `unstable` the beacon block roots should be left intact, as we expect them to exist whenever we've stored historic _blocks_ in the DB.\r\n\r\nAtomically with those deletions we should _update_ the `state_upper_limit` in the `Anchor` to reflect the fact that those states are gone. I think setting it to `u64::MAX` could be a good way to signal a new mode of operation where \"this node isn't storing any historic states\". Alternatively, we set it to the next restore point slot (or snapshot slot for tree-states) which is `>= split.slot`. Either way, we need this block of logic from the tree-states branch that prevents the finalization migration from trying to write bad states:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/079cd67df26bd66a97f9244f540f5108c8314d9e/beacon_node/store/src/hot_cold_store.rs#L2204-L2211\r\n\r\nI think we probably also want to solve the alignment issues for checkpoint sync first, otherwise we'll have to avoid deleting all the states when the split point is at a skipped slot.
