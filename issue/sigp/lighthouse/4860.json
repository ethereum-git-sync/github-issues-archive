  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nThe attestation rewards calculator has a bug where it doesn't update justification and finalization (`process_justification_and_finalization`) prior to calculating attestation rewards.\r\n\r\nThis causes faulty output for epoch `N - 1` when finality is restored at the end of epoch `N`. In this case, the `is_in_inactivity_leak` predicate should be `false` (because finality has just been restored), but our code will set it to `true` because it hasn't computed justification & finalization.\r\n\r\nOn mainnet this occurs at epoch `200759` (i.e. finality restored at the end of `200760`).\r\n\r\nRelevant code (see earlier in this function for the lack of justification/finalization processing):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/441fc1691b69f9edc4bbdc6665f3efab16265c9b/beacon_node/beacon_chain/src/attestation_rewards.rs#L169-L174\r\n\r\n## Version\r\n\r\nLighthouse v4.5.0\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\nWe should probably just run `process_justification_and_finalization` at the start of attestation rewards calculation. I don't think this should interfere with the block v3 API, as it only needs to calculate the _proposer's block reward_, which is independent of `is_in_inactivity_leak`, and shouldn't share code with the attestation rewards calculations.",
