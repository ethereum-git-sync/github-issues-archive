WAITING ON RELEASE CANDIDATE !!\r\n\r\nThis issue is presently on-hold until the specification is stable.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThis is a \"mega issue\" which contains multiple discreet tasks. Mega issues exist to avoid cluttering the issues page a multitude of small tasks.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to work on one of these tasks, comment below and a maintainer will break the task out into a separate issue.\r\n\r\n## Per-epoch processing\r\n\r\nEvery `EPOCH_LENGTH` a series of functions run that mutate the validator set, perform FFG finalization and justification, process rewards/penalites and a bunch of other tasks.\r\n\r\n## Mega issue tasks:\r\n\r\nThere is a huge amount of helpers for this component, I avoid going into detail on them here as this issue is ultimately awaiting the release candidate. Below I will outline the core functions.\r\n\r\n- Process PoW receipt roots.\r\n- Update justification.\r\n- Update finalization.\r\n- Process crosslinks.\r\n- Process justification and finalization rewards and penalties.\r\n- Process crosslink rewards and penalities.\r\n- Update the validation registry.\r\n- Reshuffle the shard proposer set.\r\n",
