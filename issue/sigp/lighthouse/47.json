Obtain and install cargo (linux, mac and windows)\r\n2. Use cargo to install `stable`\r\n3. Use stable to run the test suite (e.g., `cargo test --all`)\r\n\r\nI recommend giving high-level steps that an experienced developer could follow, then linking to more detailed articles that provide \"hand holding\".",
