  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/4995 revealed that the re-use of gossip caches for understanding \"slashability\" of a block no longer works post-deneb.  The gossip conditions might be changed in the future so that it does work again, but I don't think it's worth banking on.  Tracking \"slashability\" here is needed generally so support `broadcast_validation=consensus_and_equivocation`.\r\n\r\nMoving the slashing logic from the `observed_block_producers` and `observed_blob_sidecars` to a single new slashing cache can help simplify what we have currently. It will also allow us to more easily incorporate blocks seen via RPC: https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/issues/4725#issuecomment-1859338866 ",
