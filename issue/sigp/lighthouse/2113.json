  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nAs an incremental step towards supporting weak subjectivity sync in the database I think we should implement a mode of operation for the database where it doesn't store any states between genesis and the split state (~= finalization). This could be done by changing `slots-per-restore-point` to an `Option<u64>`, and using the `None` value to indicate this mode.\r\n\r\nSome changes that will be necessary along the way:\r\n\r\n* Check slots per restore point when doing freezer migrations. If it's none, don't store a state in the freezer at all.\r\n* Derive block roots and state roots for the linear arrays _from the blocks themselves_, rather than the states being frozen.\r\n* Adapt backwards iterators to use the linear arrays of block and state roots (or document the fact that they stop at the finalization point).\r\n\r\nI think this change is a good first step because it can be made independently, and sets us up for a world where the period between genesis and finality has some blocks (and all states) missing. Furthermore, one really nice property is that by allowing flexibility in the slots-per-restore-point parameter, we can implement \"filling in the restore point states\" in a _composable_ way, by implementing an independent mechanism for changing the slots-per-restore-point parameter :heart_eyes: This is something that would be nice to have anyway, and then weak subjectivity sync is broken into these manageable phases:\r\n\r\n1. Download blocks backwards from weak subjectivity state, filling in linear block and state root arrays in reverse\r\n2. Once genesis is reached, optionally begin a transition from `slots-per-restore-point: None => Some(n)` in a background thread.\r\n\r\nLater:\r\n\r\n* Ensure forwards iterator can begin from the lowest known slot (perhaps we need a marker for this).",
