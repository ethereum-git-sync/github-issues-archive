  "body": "## Description\r\nWhen running the deposit subcommand, essentially the only valid value the user can pass to the --validator flag is \"all\".  The argument is supposed to let you specify which validator directory you want to use, but it currently requires an exact match.  What's worse, the string it tries to match against is very counter-intuitive.\r\n\r\n## Version\r\nmaster\r\n\r\n## Present Behaviour\r\nHere's two examples of what you'd need to match exactly (everything inside the []):\r\n\r\n[\\\"/home/eth2/.lighthouse/validators/0xb4677e17fda50d24ce12941e4e44cbd6d7e346b52d83ff73ba396917f7c550ed090aa496ca9419edf3b362313beefd38\\\"]\r\n[\\\"/home/eth2/.lighthouse/validators/0xa0235daaf12e2fd7313db413417816af3141705c9de22419399a8be0b6fa4bbe3e7836954f97003fdf166830f3e8b735\\\"]\r\n\r\nSo you you'd have to specify the fully expanded path, wrapped in quote characters.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\nYou should really only need to specify a slice of the validator public key.",
