  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nLighthouse currently will allow proposing a block atop a head which it knows to be optimistic. Whilst this *seems* wrong, it is legitimate since an EL can only build a payload atop a parent payload when the parent is known and valid. Therefore, if the EL is able to produce a payload atop a payload which *Lighthouse* considers to be optimistic, then Lighthouse just had an outdated view of the EL payload tree.\r\n\r\nThis all holds true whilst we use a local EL, however it starts to become dubious when builders are involved. It might be the case that a malicious builder can produce a chain the honest ELs will never resolve, therefore forcing CLs into an optimistic state. To mitigate this, I propose that if the head is optimistic then we don't sign across any blinded payloads from builders.\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\nI think the implementation must be careful not to just check that the head is optimistic in one action the build a block in another without ensuring that the head hasn't changed between those two calls.\r\n\r\nIt may be desirable to try and produce a block using the EL when the head is optimistic, without checking the builder. This gives us a chance to still produce a block if the EL happens to sync in the nick of time. The risk here is that MEV can be disabled by forcing a node into optimistic sync at just the right time, however this is a very fiddly attack and we already operate under the assumption that an attacker cannot reliably force nodes into optimistic sync.",
