This means that until a new restore-point is stored in the database (on a slot with `slot % slots-per-restore-point == 0`), the linear block roots array will have a gap in it between `last_restore_point_slot` and `split.slot`.\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\nWe _could_ do nothing, and wait for the issue to resolve itself once everyone has upgraded and waited for 27h. However, this is not really ideal, and I suspect many users will be scared off upgrading by the error log.\r\n\r\nTo fix it properly, we could make a patch release to immediately establish the new invariant on updating. This could be implemented as so:\r\n\r\n- Add a DB schema migration from v17 to itself.\r\n- Load the split state, and use a `ChunkWriter` to fill-in the slots between `last_restore_point_slot` (if any) and `split.slot`.\r\n\r\nThe only downside to this is that it is potentially a bit wasteful to re-do this _every time_ the node starts up. Pragmatically, it probably wouldn't take very long (a few seconds max) and would stop recurring once we update the DB schema to v18 for Deneb (see #4693).\r\n\r\n\r\n",
