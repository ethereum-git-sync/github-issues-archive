This was originally done to perform the SSZ decoding as we receive packets. \r\n\r\nIt is cleaner and has better logic separation to perform the decoding and RPC logic in its own module which deals with the associated functions, separating it from the networking stack.\r\n\r\nThis needs a re-write and re-design.\r\n",

    "body": "Oh cool. This one is tricky because it refers to the libp2p RPC spec (RPC across the network for nodes to directly communicate) which is still being debated. \r\nI've written an initial version, and am not happy with it. The re-write will need to happen after I jig around with the rest of the networking. \r\n\r\nI'll let you know when its ready to re-implement. \r\n\r\nIn the meantime, we still need to write and define the standard RPC interface that links the node locally to the validator client. I'll have a look into that and make some clear issues surrounding it :)\r\n\r\n",
