The list of available runtime config options is here: https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/tree/dev/configs.\r\n\r\nIt's probably easiest to just stick to 32 ETH deposits so that you don't need to modify the code (that's what the Gnosis chain does too).",

If you change any of the other preset params that are also type-level constants you'll need to change them on the `EthSpec` too (e.g. `MAX_ATTESTATIONS`).\r\n\r\n_Just in case_ you haven't seen it already, it's also possible to run testnets against a local version of Ganache using the scripts here: https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/tree/stable/scripts/local_testnet. I understand you might have good reason to test against a real execution testnet though :+1: ",
