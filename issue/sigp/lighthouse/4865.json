  "body": "at some point we realized we were not properly versioning requests after Altair, this left me thinking whether rate limiting should use versioned protocols as well. \r\n\r\nIn one hand it would be the \"more correct\" approach, since multiple versions for the same protocol can coexist and be valid, and require different rate limits (blocks by range, and blocks by roots after deneb are part of those)\r\n\r\nThe downside (is it actually a downside?) is that to do this, those protocols that are rate limited and their quotas would need to be set in runtime and based on fork changes.\r\n\r\nAs a side note, trying this \"RFC\" approach to better communicate with the team, and see how it goes",
