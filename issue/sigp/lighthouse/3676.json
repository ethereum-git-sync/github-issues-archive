  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nFeature request to add a parameter to BN whereby the number of peers is reduced to fit the bandwidth constraints of the parameter.  With 4844 coming soon, the amount of data bandwidth being gossip'ed is going to significantly increase. For those on light bandwidth home connections, this can cause severe challenge if the beacon chain is not throttled back. \r\n\r\n## Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\n./lighthouse bn --maxbandwidth 10 {insert all other parameters}\r\n\r\nThus if the --maxbandwidth parameter is provided (as measured in mbps) then the number of peers is continuously measured and then reduced (if needed) to fit within this constraint. \r\n",
