    "body": "The problem with using \"description\" is that the EIP explicitly states it as non-unique, which makes it unsuitable for ethdo's purposes of having unique account names.\r\n\r\nI *thought* that the outcome of the call that was had regarding this was that both name and description fields were optional, with name being unique if present and description not, but apparently not.  IMO the best solution would be to bring the name field in to the EIP, but Carl didn't respond to this so I guess it's not going to happen.\r\n\r\nI'm caught between enforcing uniqueness on a field that is explicitly stated to be non-unique, or using a field that isn't in the EIP.  Neither are good options, but sticking with the name field gives it a chance of being included in the EIP at a later date whereas if I use the description field it contradicts what is already in the EIP.  So I'm pretty much forced to continue using the name field, even unofficially.",

    "body": "> I'm kinda confused about the security concerns around not accessing keys you're not interested in or are required\r\n\r\nAn issue can arise if the user supplies a key that they *expect* to work, but is silently ignored. For example, if application adds a new key/value `testnet: \"medalla\"` where, in its world, it will only use that key on the Medalla testnet. If you fed that to Lighthouse you might expect it to do the same. If Lighthouse is strict about unknown keys it will fail loudly and early, otherwise it will proceed silently.\r\n\r\n> would it be a security risk to have comments?\r\n\r\nIMO, no. I think it's reasonable for a user to assume that comments will be silently ignored by the application.\r\n\r\nMy preference is to add an optional `name` field so we can maintain support with ethdo *and* a strict JSON schema. If we keep seeing applications adding new keys to the JSON store, I would consider making **only the top level** of the JSON object allow arbitrary keys, since I really don't think it's a good idea at the crypto level.",
