  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nMigaLabs and now Gnosis have both reported Lighthouse using a lot of memory during genesis sync. We thought it might have been https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/issues/2944, but with that issue resolved the problem is still occurring.\r\n\r\nLooking at some metrics on the affected Gnosis servers it seems not to be a memory fragmentation issue, as the `non-mmap memory` is high (~10GB) and the `free block memory` is low (<800MB). I think to get to the bottom of this we would need to run `lighthouse` under heaptrack while syncing from genesis on mainnet or Gnosis chain.\r\n\r\n## Version\r\n\r\nv3.2.1\r\n\r\n## Workarounds\r\n\r\nUse checkpoint sync. It's a lot faster in multiple ways and unaffected by this issue.\r\n\r\nThere will be some checkpoint sync servers set up for Gnosis chain before the Gnosis merge.\r\n",
