This means that a full eth1 sync is required each time lighthouse is restarted.\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\nDefine a byte-level representation of the eth1 block and deposit caches using SSZ containers (see `SszForkChoice` for a guide).\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\n~~There's not much point doing this until #637 has been done, so I've blocked it on that for now.~~",
