  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nWe need to implement a database upgrade (and downgrade) procedure for turning a regular Lighthouse node into a `tree-states` node. I had a previous version of this working but abandoned it because the on-disk format was still changing. The on-disk format is still expecting a few changes (e.g. https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/issues/4475), but should be closer to stability now.\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\nI think the upgrade should proceed as follows:\r\n\r\n- Delete all freezer states (https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/issues/4481).\r\n- Rewrite hot states into new tree-states format (complete with pubkeys, see https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/issues/4413).\r\n- Update `OnDiskStoreConfig` with hierarchy exponents (see https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/issues/4475) and `linear_blocks=false`.\r\n- Rewrite `DBColumn::BeaconBlockRoots` to remove chunked keys.\r\n\r\nUsers can then recover historic states if they want them by running with `--reconstruct-historic-states`, which will reconstruct from genesis to the split slot.",
