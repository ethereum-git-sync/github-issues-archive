  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nWhen I fetch the slot data of a missed slot with `eth/v2/beacon/blocks` and `eth/v1/beacon/headers`, the response is `404 Not Found`, instead of a specific error indicating this is a missed block, which makes it difficult to differentiate the following 2 cases:\r\n1. Cannot fetch slot data because it's a missed slot.\r\n2. Cannot fetch slot data because nodes are out of sync, or the slot hasn't been proposed yet.\r\n\r\nWondering should client return a specific error for missed slot?\r\n\r\n## Version\r\n\r\n`Lighthouse/v4.5.0-441fc16/x86_64-linux`\r\n\r\n## Present Behaviour\r\n\r\nWhen fetching the slot data of a missed slot with `eth/v2/beacon/blocks` and `eth/v1/beacon/headers`, the response is `404 Not Found`.\r\n\r\nFor example, when fetch block header for https://holesky.beaconcha.in/slot/1, the response is\r\n\r\n`\r\n{\r\n  \"code\": 404,\r\n  \"message\": \"NOT_FOUND: beacon block at slot 1\",\r\n  \"stacktraces\": []\r\n}\r\n`\r\n\r\n## Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\nShould client return a specific error/error code for missed slots?\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\nPlease describe the steps required to resolve this issue, if known.\r\n",
