So you were modifying `signature-schemes` and getting the panic?\r\n\r\nMilagro expects 48 bytes (the curve is 381 bit) and it will cause an OOB panic if you give it any less. I [raised this](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/issues/22#issuecomment-428065943) on the spec at one point but it didn't really go anywhere.\r\n\r\nMy approach would be to leave it as it is for now, then revisit this once we're closer to a point where out signatures need to match other clients. AFAIK we don't even have test vectors yet, so it's likely that no-one is matching at this point. Unless of course it's blocking our progress.",
