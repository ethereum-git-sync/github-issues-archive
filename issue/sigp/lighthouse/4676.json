  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nI've been reviewing #4054 for a few days and I'm coming to the realisation that I can't review it alone. It's a 22k line diff across 250 files. I estimate it would take about 1.5 weeks full-time and I can't do any one task full-time anymore. Even if I were to get 50% of uninterrupted time (very optimistic), then it's going to take 3 weeks. Given that I'm away for 2+ weeks next week, we're looking at over a month of Deneb review. Furthermore, I think we need more that one person to review such a large change to give a decent quality assurance.\r\n\r\nSo, in the interests of getting #4054 merge into `unstable` expediently, I propose that we split up the review.\r\n\r\n## Splitting the Review\r\n\r\nIn the table below I've split the review into components with a lil' [script](https://github.com/paulhauner/lighthouse/blob/deneb-diff/deneb-diff.py).\r\n\r\nI'd like to ask the full-time Lighthouse developers to identify components which:\r\n\r\n1. You feel confident reviewing.\r\n1. Did not do an overwhelming amount of the changes.\r\n\r\nAnd then add their name to the \"Reviewer\" column (if you don't have perms to edit my post, just comment and someone with perms will update it). The \"Status\" column can be updated when the review is complete.\r\n\r\nSome additional thoughts:\r\n\r\n- It's reasonable to have two people on one component (e.g., `./consensus` could use a couple of eyes).\r\n- If you've already done detailed reviews on some components (e.g., when a PR was merged into `deneb-free-blobs`) then it would make sense to assign yourself to that component and only review the un-reviewed changes (i.e., don't double-review things).\r\n\r\n## Components and Assignments\r\n\r\n```\r\nComponent                           Files    Lines -  Lines +    Status           Reviewer(s)\r\n--------------------------------  -------  ---------  ---------  ---------------  -------------\r\n./lighthouse                            1         71             Awaiting Review  PS\r\n./crypto                                6          1  833        Done             MS\r\n./testing                              22         75  712        Done             PH\r\n./database_manager                      1         69             Done             MS\r\n./.github                               2         34  59         Done             JC\r\n./consensus/state_processing           16         53  227        Awaiting Review  MS\r\n./consensus/ssz_types                   1         77             Awaiting Review  MS\r\n./consensus/proto_array                 1          1  1          Awaiting Review  MS\r\n./consensus/fork_choice                 3         19  37         Awaiting Review  MS\r\n./consensus/cached_tree_hash            1          3  3          Awaiting Review  MS\r\n./consensus/types                      28        155  1613       Awaiting Review  MS\r\n./common/slot_clock                     1          1  10         Done             PH\r\n./common/eth2                           3         20  505        Done             JC\r\n./common/validator_dir                  1          1  1          Done             PH\r\n./common/eth2_network_config            7          5  80         Done             PH\r\n./common/deposit_contract               1          1  1          Done             PH\r\n./slasher                               1          2  2          Done             MS\r\n./scripts                               8          8  26         Awaiting Review  ML\r\n./validator_client                      6        102  240        Awaiting Review  ML\r\n./beacon_node/execution_layer          12        282  1437       Awaiting Review  JC\r\n./beacon_node/src                       3          2  110        Done             JC\r\n./beacon_node/beacon_chain             32        528  5531       Done             PH\r\n./beacon_node/operation_pool            3          4  18         Done             MS\r\n./beacon_node/store                    12         50  671        Done             MS\r\n./beacon_node/lighthouse_network       20         64  661        Awaiting Review  Age\r\n./beacon_node/client                    2         38             Awaiting Review  Age\r\n./beacon_node/eth1                      1          2  2          Done             PH\r\n./beacon_node/builder_client            1          7  7          Done             PH\r\n./beacon_node/genesis                   1          1  1          Done             PH\r\n./beacon_node/network                  25       1169  6708       Awaiting Review  Age\r\n./beacon_node/beacon_processor          2         11  92         Awaiting Review  Age\r\n./beacon_node/http_api                 12        334  702        Awaiting Review  ML\r\n./account_manager                       1         18  3          Done             PH\r\n./book                                  2          6  1          Awaiting Review  ML\r\n./lcli                                  5          7  58         Done             PH\r\n```\r\n",
