More information would also be welcomed.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to display the current time of when the voluntary exit was published for logs and archiving. It would be nice to display when the expected exit is planned to actually happen (epoch and time delta). It would be nice to display some information saying that you still have to run your validator until the exit actually happens if you don't want to be penalized.\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\n- Change the output of the `account validator exit` command to include those information.\r\n- An update to [the lighthouse-book page](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/voluntary-exit.html) on this updated process would also be nice.\r\n",
