  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nI've removed the threading for the request for duties. This is because at the start of an epoch, the duties will update in parallel, and `process_duties` may not see the updated duties when processing. \r\n\r\nThe current work-around is to make the duties request sequential, such that `process_duties` always runs after the duties have been updated. \r\n\r\nThis is not good, as the core timing thread is linked with the duties request thread. We want these separate, such that we can timeout and kill the duties thread, leaving the core timing and tokio driver thread unaffected. \r\n\r\nThe solution is to add a channel, to the tokio runtime, such that the duties thread tells the tokio runtime if duties have been modified (after an epoch or a re-org) and the tokio runtime can then re-process the new duties.
