  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, for attestation subnets, we find peers in the required subnet from discovery and give it to the peer manager to dial. If we connect to all the discovered peers in that subnet then they disconnect before the attestation duty for some reason, we might get in a situation where we don't have enough peers in that subnet to publish the message.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, we could modify the `maintain_sync_committee_peers` function in the peer manager to also maintain peers for attestation subnets.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/df51a73272489fe154bd10995c96199062b6c3f7/beacon_node/lighthouse_network/src/peer_manager/mod.rs#L801\r\n\r\nThis way, we won't be affected by random disconnects by subnet peers for attestations.",
