  "body": "## Description & Present Behaviour\r\n\r\nEven though the VC specifies `--proposer-nodes A` - which is confirmed to be available - block publishing is executed by a non-proposer-node (B). Route: VC signs off header (received via mev-boost) delivered from node B -> relay initially publishes the block -> after block release, B tries to publish but libp2p WARN message pops up due to duplication. Meanwhile, A displays no logs indicating any effort to publish the block.\r\n\r\n## Version\r\n\r\nNode A: teku/v23.5.0\r\nNode B: lighthouse/4.2.0 (non-proposer-only + connected builder mev_boost)\r\nVC: lighthouse/4.2.0 (`--proposer-nodes A`; `--beacon-nodes B,A`)\r\n\r\n## Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\nAssuming the unhappy case that the relay was DoSed (_and_ B potentially as well), I would have expected A to be the preferred publisher.",
