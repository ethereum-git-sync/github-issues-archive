  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nIt would be good to improve insight into how the builder API is working with lighthouse. \r\n\r\nSome metrics we could add:\r\n- builder API errors\r\n  -  It would be worth trying to separate connectivity errors from block validation errors\r\n  -  We should also try to add metrics for errors pre and post-signing because this has a big impact on whether it's a miss\r\n- no payload provided by the builder (204 response from the API)\r\n- `builder_profit_threshold` not reached \r\n- builder not used because circuit breaker conditions were met\r\n- builder header \"value\" - this will just be the claimed value but will make it easier to monitor what's claimed is actually what's revealed\r\n- eventually we can add a local payload \"value\" metric to get insight into the marginal value you're getting from the builder API\r\n\r\nI think there's also room to improve logging. The error logging is pretty good, but we should probably log out the \"value\" in builder bids, and I'm wondering if we should log a `WARN` if we see builder block requests taking too long or getting re-orged. We should also probably log out builder pubkeys in the builder bid message.\r\n\r\nThis exists for monitoring relays across the network:\r\nhttps://github.com/ralexstokes/relay-monitor#get-monitorv1faults\r\n",
