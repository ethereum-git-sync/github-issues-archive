    "body": "For some reason maybe the bootnodes are blocked from where you are. \r\n\r\nIn lighthouse we store past nodes and repopulate the local routing table. If you are running lighthouse for the first time, it needs access to the bootnodes to bootstrap the routing table. \r\n\r\nPerhaps you've run prysm before but this and are running lighthouse for the first time? \r\n\r\nHave you tried removing the data directory of lighthouse and prysm and start them both from scratch? \r\n\r\nI'm quite curious if Prysm are doing something here that we are not that enables greater connectivity. \r\n\r\nCould you also try running lighthouse on the 1300 port without prysm (just to check your firewall). \r\nThis can be done via the `--port 1300` flag. i.e\r\n```\r\nlighthouse bn --port 1300\r\n```\r\n",
