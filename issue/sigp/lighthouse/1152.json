This becomes an issue when running on a constrained device, if there's more attestations incoming than can be processed the machine will eventually fail somehow.\r\n\r\nWe should add some sort of queue with a max-capacity so we can choose to drop attestations from that queue if it's clear it's not going to be cleared. The simplest example might be some FIFO queue where new entries are dropped if the queue's maximum size has been reached.",
