  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\n@LefterisJP writes:\r\n\r\n> I imported a validator and made a mistake somehow and the password was wrong and it was ignored. When opening lighthouse vc it exited with a warning that password was missing for that validator. When I tried to reimport (from the directory) and successfully entered the password the validator was not imported. It says skipped 1 validator.\r\nThe only way to input the password was to manually edit the validator_definitions.yml\r\nSo I guess it would make sense to re-import the validator if the password is missing in validator_definitions.yml, right?\r\n\r\nWe could check in `lighthouse account import` whether the existing password (if any) is correct and replace it by the one from the import command if that one _is_ correct.\r\n\r\n## Version\r\n\r\nLighthouse v2.0.1\r\n",
