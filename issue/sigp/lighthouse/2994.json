  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nAfter Bellatrix, it will eventually be necessary for Lighthouse to know one more detail for each validator: the `suggested_fee_recipient` (SFR) for producing an execution payload (\"eth1 block\").\r\n\r\nFor new validators, it makes sense to add a SFR to the `lighthouse account validator` commands that create a validator.\r\n\r\nIn #2924, the `suggested_fee_recipient` can be loaded from CLI, from file and from the `validator_definitions.yml` file. To me, it seems like the clearest strategy would be to get users to edit the `validator_definitions.yml`. Perhaps it would be nice if we wrote a `lighthouse account` tool that can be pointed at a `validator_definitions.yml` file and it will request a SFR for each validator and update the file.",
