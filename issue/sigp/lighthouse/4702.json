  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nWhile reviewing Deneb I noticed that we do something slightly strange with the fork choice params when building a payload.\r\n\r\nWe get the parameters _for the head_, even if we are attempting a re-org, here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/2841f60686d642fcc0785c884d43e34e47a800dc/beacon_node/beacon_chain/src/execution_payload.rs#L523-L532\r\n\r\nThis makes little sense, as `get_execution_payload` is called with a `state` that it should be building a block for. It shouldn't be looking at what the canonical head is at all.\r\n\r\nWe pass these params to `ExecutionLayer::get_payload`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/2841f60686d642fcc0785c884d43e34e47a800dc/beacon_node/beacon_chain/src/execution_payload.rs#L545-L553\r\n\r\nThe only fields that are used are the `justified_hash` and `finalized_hash`, here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/2841f60686d642fcc0785c884d43e34e47a800dc/beacon_node/execution_layer/src/lib.rs#L1041-L1049\r\n\r\nThat `parent_hash` which is used in place of the `fork_choice_update_params.head_hash` is the hash of the block that we actually intend to build on (e.g. the parent of the canonical head in the case of a single-slot re-org). The strange part is that we use the justified and finalized hashes of the canonical head in a sort of hacked-up hybrid. This is _safe_ for the re-org strategy, because one of the conditions is that the re-org block must have the same justified and finalized checkpoints as the canonical head, but it is not correct in general (e.g. building on arbitrary parents). I'm not sure if I was aware of this and made this choice intentionally when implementing the re-org strategy.\r\n\r\n### Steps to resolve\r\n\r\nWork out a cleaner way to pass the fork choice update params. It would be better to derive them from the `state` (although I don't think this is possible). Or we could have a dedicated method on `CanonicalHead` which either returns parameters for the head or parameters for the head's parent, and is a bit clearer about what it is doing. For the case of building on an arbitrary parent (which is useful in tests) we could have a heavier-weight method that accomplishes that. It could be disabled in prod for safety.\r\n",
