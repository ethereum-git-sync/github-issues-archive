The nodes on the network had `--subscribe-all-subnets` enabled:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[     964] [    36.090282] [service_lighthouse-nethermind-0--lighthouse-bn] [I] [2023-08-04T10:05:46Z ERROR libp2p_gossipsub::behaviour] Subscription filter error: too many subscriptions per request; ignoring RPC from peer 16Uiu2HAmDL3NPvDTYk6d3U59HeJ66aTJNpWUhr8R5pDWj13tHTcf\r\n```\r\n\r\nStefan also referenced the limit set here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/4ca101e085e2a88805cc4788e6f875ff65998b6c/beacon_node/lighthouse_network/src/service/mod.rs#L242-L244\r\n\r\nThe comment above is interesting, because a node, when subscribe to all attestation subnets, could go over the limit during fork transition, i.e. 2 epochs before  & after a fork, where lighthouse is subscribed to both the current fork topics and next fork topics (total of 162 topics as calculated above). I think the `max_subscriptions_per_request` may need to be bumped over 162 to prevent this error, otherwise the peer's subscription request could be ignored.\r\n\r\n@pawanjay176 @realbigsean could you please confirm my understanding above?\r\n\r\nCredits to @qu0b for reporting this! üôè ",
