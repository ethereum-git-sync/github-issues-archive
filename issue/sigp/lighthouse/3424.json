  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nI found the [Merge Migration](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/merge-migration.html) instructions confusing. Mainly because I wasn't sure if new options were needed right now or should be added closer to when the merge is supposed to occur.\r\n\r\n## Version\r\n\r\nv2.5.1\r\n\r\n## Present Behaviour\r\n\r\nThe confusion started here:\r\n\r\n---\r\nAs of [v2.4.0](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/releases/tag/v2.4.0) Lighthouse can be considered to have two modes:\r\n\r\n  * **Pre-merge**: --execution-endpoint flag is not provided.\r\n  * **Post-merge**: --execution-endpoint flag is provided.\r\n\r\n A pre-merge node, by definition, will fail to transition through the merge. Such a node must be upgraded before the Bellatrix upgrade.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI think the instructions could be more explicit, I found these [CoinCashew instructions informative](https://www.coincashew.com/coins/overview-eth/ethereum-merge-upgrade-checklist-for-home-stakers-and-validators). Actually, there should be a `Lighthouse Flags & Options` section that would include \"required\" and \"typical\" options that are needed to run a bn and vc.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\nI think this is more correct and to the point:\r\n\r\n---\r\nAs of [v2.4.0](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/releases/tag/v2.4.0) Lighthouse bn and vc new options should be added ASAP but is required before the Bellatrix upgrade. And for testnets they Goerli/Prater this need to be done ASAP.\r\n\r\n* For beacon node add `--execution-endpoint` and `--execution-jwt` options\r\n* For validator clients add [`--suggested-fee-recipient`](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/suggested-fee-recipient.html)\r\n\r\nIf these flags are not present your system will fail to transition through the merge.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n",
