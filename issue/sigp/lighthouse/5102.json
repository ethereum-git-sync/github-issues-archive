This misalignment in mapping leads to inaccurate metrics reporting for produce_partial_beacon_block method.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\nThe correct behavior would be for the load_state_for_block_production method to be mapped to its own dedicated metric bucket. \r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\nDuring a single block production a metric \"produce_partial_beacon_block\" is invoked twice.\r\n",
