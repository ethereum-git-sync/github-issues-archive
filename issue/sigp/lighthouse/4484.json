  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nTree states introduces a new format for storing finalized blocks on disk, which we're planning to make _optional_ via the `linear_blocks` store config option:\r\n\r\n- `linear_blocks=false` (`unstable` today): blocks are all stored in the hot DB keyed by root\r\n- `linear_blocks=true` (`tree-states` today): finalized blocks are stored compressed in the freezer DB keyed by slot\r\n\r\nThis issue is about ensuring that Lighthouse can function correctly in `tree-states` mode with `linear_blocks=false`. At the moment the configuration option exists, but `tree-states` ignores it and just assumes blocks are in the freezer DB. We need to ensure that functions like `get_blinded_block` look-up the correct location.\r\n\r\nIt may be easier to implement and test this at the same time as the database migration (https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/issues/4482). Alternatively we could ensure that starting a `tree-states` node with `linear_blocks=false` behaves correctly.\r\n\r\nFor the initial version I don't think we need a way to switch the `linear_blocks` setting of an existing DB. Users can re-sync if they really want the benefit of that, or we can add such a method later.\r\n",
