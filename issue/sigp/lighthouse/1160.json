  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\n#1138 introduces a new key management system, focused around encrypted keystores. We have had to maintain support for our old, unencrypted SSZ-encoded predecessor for now, but we definitely shouldn't in the long term.\r\n\r\nOnce the current testnets (e.g., Schlesi) have finished and everyone has generated their keys under the new scheme we can just delete this code from Lighthouse. I've marked the issues as `blocked` until this is the case.\r\n\r\n## How to remove\r\n\r\nThis code is behind the `unencrypted_keys` feature of the `validator_dir`. To remove the code:\r\n\r\n- Delete all functionality behind the `unencrypted_keys` feature (and the feature itself)\r\n- Delete anything downstream that was relying upon that code.\r\n",
