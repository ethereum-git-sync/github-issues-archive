  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nRelated to the compromised address mitigations (see #3900), we should have Lighthouse broadcast BLS to execution changes at the Capella fork.\r\n\r\nToday we (LH, Nimbus, Prysm) decided to adopt a LIFO packing strategy to discourage most users from spamming at the fork. Still, for users whose keys have been compromised, spamming is the best strategy (they need to get their messages to all honest nodes ASAP, particularly the ones that didn't opt-in to the agreed list).\r\n\r\nThe broadcast _also_ benefits ordinary users who want to get their address change in early by submitting it to their own op pool prior to the fork.\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\nOne way to implement this might be a dedicated task that fires from `on_slot` as soon as Capella is hit. It could read from the pool to get a `Vec<Arc<SigVerifiedOp<..>>>`, and then broadcast them in batches. At the moment of broadcast it should verify that the message hasn't been seen on gossip yet, and is still valid (this may require fiddling with some of the other verification checks to get the order right).",
