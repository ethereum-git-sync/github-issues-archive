  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nHey guys, maybe a small bit of feedback on your docs. I struggled to figure out what port prometheus runs on for lighthouse.\r\n\r\nAt first, I couldn't find any reference to it in lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io, and assumed to monitor lighthouse I would use the REST API.\r\n\r\nThen I spotted it was mentioned in the readme as `Metrics via Prometheus.`. I also spotted it mentioned here: https://hub.docker.com/r/paulhauner/lighthouse and here https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/1197 So I knew it existed somewhere. I eventually figured out it runs on `:5052/metrics`  by looking at the docker-compose file in this repo. https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse-docker/blob/master/docker-compose.yml#L11\r\n\r\n## Version\r\n\r\nDocker `sigp/lighthouse:latest` with ID `7076af925f61`\r\n\r\n## Present Behaviour\r\n\r\nApp works fine\r\n\r\n## Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\nMaybe just a mention of the default metrics port here https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/docker.html would work. Other clients allow you to specify a metrics port via CLI flag, but I don't particularly need that feature. \r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\nJust a bit of documentation :) \r\n",
