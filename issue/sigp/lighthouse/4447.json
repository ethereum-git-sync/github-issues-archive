  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nIf we get a cache miss in the `beacon_proposer_cache`, we need a way to get the state which provides the shuffling for the blob. In block processing we fall back to the snapshot cache, and then remove the state from the snapshot cache (in the normal case), and attach it to the block for use during block processing. \r\n\r\nThis means if we're getting the block first and getting a proposer cache miss, when verifying blobs we'd be likely to load the state and parent block from the db when we shouldn't have to because they're in memory.  We do prime the`beacon_proposer_cache` after finding shuffling for the block, but there's some raciness there with blob arrival/verification.",
