So I'm guessing maybe you used `--datadir` to a location where there was an existing `beacon` folder but no `chain_db`?\r\nThe message was\r\n```\r\nFailed to start Lighthouse: Failed to start beacon node: No database found in datadir. Use 'testnet -f' to overwrite the existing datadir, or specify a different `--datadir`.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis seems like it is an acceptable behaviour, but maybe we should be a bit more verbose in the error message? Also `testnet -f` doesn't seem to be specific enough!",
