We could write own little script to update genesis time.\r\n\r\n> We removed lcli (and the minimal spec) from the default build because they both consume a significant amount of compilation time on CI/CD, while being unused by almost all our users (PR here: #1989). As far as I understand our intention with lcli is that it's an unstable, mostly-internal tool, which is another reason not to provide it in the default Docker image (and have it depended upon).\r\n\r\nHave you considered just creating another docker image with just lcli? That way, lighthouse build time would be independent of lcli. Also building image in github actions and pushing on dockerhub is significantly faster than building on dockerhub.\r\n\r\ntbh I cannot even build lcli on my ubuntu machine but that's problem for another issue 😄 ",

We've just added some new configuration for building Docker images on Github, which as you said is _so_ much better than relying on Docker Hub's builds. I'll see if I can add `lcli` to the mix for the next release (although if we miss the deadline it might need to live on `unstable` until the new year)",

    "body": "> Another option is to add a `Dockerfile` to the `lcli` directory which would allow users to build the image themselves (without setting up a Rust dev env).
