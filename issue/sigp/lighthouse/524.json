  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nThe current behaviour is to decode entire blocks and attestations. If decoded and processed semi-successfully (we consider a block with an unknown parent successful, which isn't great) we forward these objects to other peers. \r\n\r\nIdeally we would like to partially decode blocks, verify the proposer's signature before forwarding/processing. This currently may open up DOS vectors in processing carefully constructed blocks with past histories. \r\n\r\nSimilarly for attestations, we would like to verify the blocks validity before propagating. The network functionality and validation functions are in place in Lighthouse to make this update, the logic needs to be thought out more thoroughly.\r\n",
