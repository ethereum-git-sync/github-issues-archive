We could do similarly for sync committee messages.\r\n\r\nThis would provide some way of getting messages on chain when the sync aggregation system fails, which is expected occasionally due to the probabilistic nature of determining aggregator status (although it should be a lot better with the # of target aggregators bumped from 4 to 16).\r\n\r\nThis would also require us to attempt aggregation of any compatible sync contributions as they are added to the pool, as raised by @paulhauner here: https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/2321/files#r648051400\r\n",
