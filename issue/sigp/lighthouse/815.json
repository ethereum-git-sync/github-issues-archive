These docs were made before our public testnet, and now that has taken on the name of \"the testnet\".\r\n\r\nThis can be confusing for new users, who just want to connect to the public testnet but end up following docs to create a local testnet.\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\n- Rename the current \"Testnets\" section to \"Private Testnets\" or \"Local Testnets\"\r\n- In that renamed section, include a link that points people towards the docs for joining the public testnet.\r\n",
