    "body": "I guess the state diffs being applied are for historic states. It's possible this is a manifestation of the HTTP death spiral issue in combination with some slight slowdown in the new version of tree-states vs the previous alpha. I think the fact we recently pointed the checkpointz server at this node might be part of the reason we've seen a change.\n\nWe could try bumping up the hdiff buffer cache size to see if that helps take some of the time off the calls. Grepping the logs for \"diff\" should show long each diff is taking to be applied and whether the buffer cache is being hit. We probably also want to tweak the cache algorithm so that it prefers to keep \"deeper\" (more general) diffs, rather than ones for e.g. single epochs.\n\nIt will also be interesting to test the HTTP API fix once that's applied in unstable.",
