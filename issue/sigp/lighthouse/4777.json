[`stable` branch](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/actions/runs/6295625621): this builds and publishes the `latest` images\r\n2. [`unstable` branch](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/actions/runs/6295519328): this builds and publishes the `-unstable` images\r\n3. [`tag`](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/actions/runs/6295628487): this builds and publishes the version tagged images\r\n\r\nand each of these trigger 9 build jobs for different platform / archs, so:\r\n- the build queue could get quite long, and this prolongs the release process\r\n- the images would have different digests even though they're built from the exact same source, which could be a bit confusing\r\n- it is quite wasteful in terms of compute resources\r\n\r\nThese three workflows are built from the exact same commit, so we could probably consolidate them, so we only build each image once, and tag the same image with `latest`, `-unstable` and the version.\r\n",
