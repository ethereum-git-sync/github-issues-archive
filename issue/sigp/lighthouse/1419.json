  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nThe graffiti CLI option should be duplicated to the VC such that VC's decide what the graffiti will be on published blocks. \r\nThis aligns more with out other clients and users expectations. \r\n\r\nSee #1410 for example. \r\n\r\nThe VC graffiti should be prioritised over the BN. If the VC graffiti is set, it modifies the blocks graffiti, if its not set it leaves it as is from the BN. \r\n\r\n## Present Behaviour\r\n\r\nGraffiti tag is currently only on the BN. \r\n",
