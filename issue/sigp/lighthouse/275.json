Exits queues have not been implemented yet, they will come soon.\r\n\r\nPotential solution:\r\n\r\n- Keep all objects around until they are included in a finalized block.\r\n- For slashings, only include if the validator is not already penalized.\r\n- For exits, only include if the validator is not already exited.\r\n- For deposits, include based upon ",
