  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nI've seen multiple instances when first booting and connecting to a single peer the peer immediately tries to disconnect, but not before sending a status to us. Sync then tries to download blocks from the single peer, but the RPC is in a shutdown state and returns an RPC Error of `HandlerReject`. As this is an internal tracking mechanism, we don't penalize the peer, but the sync algorithm continually retries to download blocks from the peer. \r\n\r\nThe algorithm should stop after 5 failed attempts, however there seems to be a loop going on that I didn't track. Alternatively, we should handle the `HandleReject` error in the sync algo's and remove the peer as a candidate from syncing blocks.\r\n",
