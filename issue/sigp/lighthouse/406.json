  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nPresently, only attestations that are included in blocks are included in fork choice.\r\n\r\nThey were not implemented in the fork-choice refactor (#398), instead we deferred them for later implementation.\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\nAttestations provided to the [`process_attestation`](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/8afe8b3569085d05eba78a0cb11399485320405b/beacon_node/beacon_chain/src/beacon_chain.rs#L469-L502) function should be validated and provided to the [`ForkChoice`](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/8afe8b3569085d05eba78a0cb11399485320405b/beacon_node/beacon_chain/src/fork_choice.rs) struct.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\n- Only valid, signed attestations should be added to the fork choice.\r\n- It does not suffice to only add attestations to the fork choice if they are accepted into the operations pool. The op-pool is only interested in attestations that can be included in future blocks, whilst fork choice is potentially interested in any attestation.\r\n- Attestations should not be added to fork choice if they target unknown/unprocessed blocks.\r\n- It may be optimal to check if the attestation is a latest message for any validator prior to verifying the signature. If the attestation is not a latest message, we don't need it and verifying the signature would be a waste of time.\r\n- A naive implementation would read the `BeaconState` from disk for each attestation. A better implementation would attempt to use the present, canonical state prior to loading from disk. I imagine the majority of attestations would be current and could be validated against the present state, it would be good to optimize for this scenario.",
