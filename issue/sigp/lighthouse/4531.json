  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nRecently we've had a few users reporting that the `POST beacon/block` endpoints in Lighthouse don't support SSZ request bodies, and this is currently being worked on in issue #4457. It seems like some validator clients are now using SSZ for the block proposal flow.\r\n\r\nTo support the block proposal flow using SSZ end-to-end, we should also add SSZ support to the following block production endpoints:\r\n- GET `/eth/v2/validator/blocks/{slot}`\r\n- GET `/eth/v1/validator/blinded_blocks/{slot}`\r\n\r\nIt might be worth getting this implemented soon, looking at the benchmarks from this issue:\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/builder-specs/issues/53\r\n\r\n> SSZ seems 40-50x faster\r\nConsidering 20-40ms per coding on average, that's up to 200-300ms JSON latency (or more).\r\n> \r\n> Sending the data SSZ encoded could reliably shave 200-250ms off each getPayload roundtrip.\r\n\r\nThere is also a related issue to use SSZ in builder API queries: #3701 ",
