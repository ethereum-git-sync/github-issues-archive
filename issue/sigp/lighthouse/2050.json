If lighthouse can speak with the eth1 node, even being late of the synchronisation it doesn't use the fallback.\r\nIt would be great to force lighthouse to use endpoint N+1 until endpoint N is synced again?\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Lighthouse should use the fallback as soon as the eth1 endpoint is unsynced AND \"far behind\". By \"far behind\" we mean that `remote_head_block.timestamp + ETH1_FOLLOW_DISTANCE / 2 * SECONDS_PER_ETH1_BLOCK < now`. Since we are only interested in the eth1 blocks before the `ETH1_FOLLOW_DISTANCE` this should be enough to ensure that we always get all blocks we need.\r\n\r\nIf you have witnessed a different behavior please post some logs, because that would be a bug.",
