This would have simple functionality, such as creating validator keypairs, exiting validators, reporting the state of local validators (i.e balance, status, active/inactive) and show some metrics from the beacon node (state of the network, connected peers, total validators, etc).\r\n\r\nThe validator client and beacon node will expose HTTP methods to facilitate all the core functionality, the UI will simply interface with the exposed methods. \r\n\r\nIdeally, this will be written using React native. \r\n\r\nIf you are interested in this issue, please reach out to the team :).\r\n",
