  "body": " > @michaelsproul The team has been testing the v3.4.0 version of Lighthouse and encountered an issue with the PATCH lighthouse/validators/{pubkey} request, which is being performed every 2 minutes. Despite the fact that Lighthouse is not being killed every 2 minutes, it is still being restarted around every 2 hours by Kubernetes due to CPU throttling when updating 6 validators concurrently. \r\n\r\n> This could be a major problem in production, where there could be more than a thousand public keys in the same service, potentially leading to even more frequent restarts. \r\n\r\n> Any ideas on what may be causing this excessive CPU usage during the PATCH request?\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @ricardolyn in https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/issues/3795#issuecomment-1422257924_\r\n            ",

    "body": "Summarising the other comments from that issue:\r\n\r\n- @ricardolyn observed the slowdown with 500 validators of which 6 are active, and all 6 are patched every 2 minutes.\r\n- The PATCH body is `{ builder_proposals: <true|false> }`. Note that [many more patch bodies are possible](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/api-vc-endpoints.html#patch-lighthousevalidatorsvoting_pubkey), including disabling/enabling the validators, but that is not the issue here.\r\n- CPU usage is observed to spike when the requests are made.\r\n\r\nA few observations from me:\r\n\r\nThe main work happens in `set_validator_definition_fields` which is called here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/38514c07f222ff7783834c48cf5c0a6ee7f346d0/validator_client/src/http_api/mod.rs#L638-L643\r\n\r\nThe main culprits which could be slow are `update_validators`, called here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/38514c07f222ff7783834c48cf5c0a6ee7f346d0/validator_client/src/initialized_validators.rs#L713\r\n\r\nAnd writing the updated definitions to disk here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/38514c07f222ff7783834c48cf5c0a6ee7f346d0/validator_client/src/initialized_validators.rs#L728-L730\r\n\r\nDue to the increased _CPU_ (rather than I/O or memory) I suspect `update_validators` is the source of the slowness. It could be the repeated decryption of the key cache, although with web3signer validators this should be close to a no-op (I strongly suspect you're using all web3signer validators, @ricardolyn?). We would need to add some metrics and do some profiling/benchmarking under similar conditions to determine the exact operations that are taking the longest.\r\n\r\nDebug logs from your VC would also help @ricardolyn. They'd allow us to quickly check which branches are being taken, e.g. do we hit the efficient case here?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/38514c07f222ff7783834c48cf5c0a6ee7f346d0/validator_client/src/initialized_validators.rs#L1139\r\n\r\nIt's possible that @paulhauner has already done some optimisations of these routines for the validator manager (#3502) and we could merge that to improve performance.",

    "body": "As you may know, Teku have implemented a standard way of loading this information in bulk from a file or a remote URL, using the same JSON schema. The schema used is defined here: https://docs.teku.consensys.net/HowTo/Configure/Proposer-Configuration.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the MEV-Boost project is also planning to use this approach to load relays per validator from a file or remote URL, as outlined in this Pull Request: https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost/pull/456.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Lighthouse requires performing an HTTP request for each validator that needs updating, which may not scale well. Additionally, there is no GET endpoint to validate if the builder_proposals is enabled or not per validator. This setup complexity could be reduced by adopting the Teku and MEV Boost approach, which would allow Lighthouse to optimize the logic of handling bulk updates more efficiently and optimise the solution for the slow performance raised on this Github issue. \r\n\r\nTherefore, I recommend that Lighthouse consider adopting this standard approach for syncing fee recipient and builder proposal configuration. @michaelsproul could LH team consider this improvement?",
