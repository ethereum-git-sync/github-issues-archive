  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nThe specs states that Empty Signatures are represented as 96 bytes of 0.\r\nNeither `bls-aggregates` nor `apache milagro crypto library` has a representation for an empty Signature as these libraries represent a valid point (including infinity).\r\n\r\n## Present Behaviour\r\n\r\nCurrently we are using empty_signature `bls::Signature::empty_signature()` as the point at infinity but `ssz_decode(empty_signature)` and `infinity.as_bytes()` decode  to [192, 0, 0, ..., 0] due to the requirements of Ethereum specs C_FLAG and B_FLAG \r\n\r\n## Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\n`ssz_decode(empty_signature)` should decode to [0, 0, ..., 0]\r\n`ssz_encode([0, 0, ..., 0])` should decode to empty_signature \r\n\r\n\r\n`ssz_decode(infinity_signature)` correctly decodes to [192, 0, 0, ..., 0] \r\n`ssz_encode([192, 0, 0, ..., 0])` should decode to infinity_signature \r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\nI'm opening this for discussion.\r\n\r\nMy thoughts are changing the lighthouse `bls::Signature` object to have a boolean `is_empty` value. i.e.\r\n```\r\nSignature {\r\n signature: RawSignature,\r\n is_empty: boolean,\r\n}\r\n```\r\ni.e. empty_signature would be:\r\n`{Signature.is_empty = true, RawSignature = infinity}`\r\ninfinity would be:\r\n`{Signature.is_empty = false, RawSignature = infinity}`\r\n\r\nNote: you'll have to change verification methods too to return false if `signature.is_empty()`.\r\n\r\nNote 2: This will likely also need to be applied to `AggregateSiganture`",
