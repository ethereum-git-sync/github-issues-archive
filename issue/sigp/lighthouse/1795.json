  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nLighthouse hit a peak of 10.09 GiB of RAM usage during the recent non-finality period on Medalla\r\n\r\n## Version\r\n\r\nI was on v0.2.12 (via dappnode package) when I hit 10.09 GiB though I have since upgraded to v0.2.13-c0e76d2 (again via dappnode) and usage is again rising rapidly on a similar looking curve (originally it took ~5 days to reach the peak)\r\n\r\n## Present Behaviour\r\n\r\nRAM consumption rises significantly while the chain is failing to finalize, easily exceeding the amounts of RAM that are recommended in most guides for running beacon nodes.  Obviously could be related to #1782 \r\n\r\n## Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\nRAM consumption should remain within the recommended specs unless there is a significant performance advantage to using more RAM during non-finality, in which case the recommended specs should be changed\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\nUnknown\r\n",
