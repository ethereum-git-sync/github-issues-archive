  "body": "We've just introduced a nifty feature into Geth where you can specify configurations in env vars too, not only cli flags. Each flag is mapped to an env var automatically, so it's fairly obvious and easy to understand.\r\n\r\nE.g. `--state.scheme` would be `GETH_STATE_SCHEME`\r\n\r\nWondering if Lighthouse has a similar feature planned?\r\n\r\nThe benefit of this is that in many cloud or container provider settings, the usual way to configure stuff is via env vars. Most providers allow you to define env vars in templates, add defaults, docs, etc to them, making these templates easy to redistribute and even check for issues. Although they usually also support passing CLI flags, that's just one mega-mess of a single string containing everything, so it's very brittle.\r\n\r\nMy assumption is that whatever CLI library you're using already has support for env vars, you just need to tell them which var is mapped to which flag.",

    "body": "True, that mistyping could have adverse effects. Wondering how I'd solve it (for us too), perhaps one way would be to iterate over all the `GETH_` prefixed env vars on startup, and anything not mapped to a flag would be printed in a warning log saying that an env var is present, but not used. Of course, it's still not as strict as flat out refusing to start on a bad flag, but it's a step closer to finding issues.",
