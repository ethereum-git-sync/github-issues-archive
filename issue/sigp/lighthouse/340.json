  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nCurrently we are handling all BeaconNode errors are RPCStatus errors. Which are handled in the validator client as `BeaconNodeError(string)`. It would be more useful to have specific errors which allows the validator client to perform error-specific handling. \r\n\r\nFor example, if we request a slot that is in the future, the beacon node could return an error of, slot in the future. The validator client could then wait and re-submit. \r\n\r\nWe should modify the protobuf schema to include messages of the form \r\n```\r\nmessage Response\r\n    uint32 success = 1; \r\n    ...\r\n```\r\nwhere `success` has 0 as success and integers representing lighthouse-specific errors. \r\n\r\nThis could go hand in hand with #338 \r\n\r\n",
