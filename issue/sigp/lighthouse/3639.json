As discussed with Mac and Paul, I am creating this tracking issue to create a branch with the required fields to be added to the `ExecutionData`.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\nThe `ExecutionData` needs to have  two more, optional fields:\r\n\r\n * `VerkleProof`, a byte array of variable length\r\n * `VerkleKeyVals`, an array of (key, value) pairs, in which the `key` is a 32-byte vector, and `value` is a byte vector of length either 0 (missing value) or 32.\r\n\r\nIf present, these two fields should be propagated over the network with the rest of the `ExecutionData` so that other clients can inject these fields in their verkle-enabled EL.\r\n\r\nIt is currently sufficient if these fields are expected to be present since genesis, as this is for a testnet (i.e. no fork implementation is currently necessary).",
