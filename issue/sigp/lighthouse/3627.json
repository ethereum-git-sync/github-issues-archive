  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nPlease allow more than one execution client so that they can all receive PoS headers.\r\n\r\n## Present Behaviour\r\n\r\nNowadays, clients like Erigon will not do anything unless a beacon node is connected to them (because they are missing PoS headers). This prevents having a backup EL client because only one EL client will be synced at a given time. \r\n\r\nThis is important for client diversity. \r\n\r\nExample: I'm using Geth but would like to use Erigon, so I need to sync Erigon. But I don't want to miss attestations, so I would like to sync Erigon while Geth is running. Currently, if I wanted to do that, I would need to connect Lighthouse to Erigon and miss all attestations while Erigon is syncing. I also don't want to go to the trouble of setting up another instance of lighthouse and duplicating the lighthouse db in my system.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\nIdeally, there could be one main EL client but Lighthouse could have other EL clients so that they can receive PoS headers for syncing.\r\n\r\nThe other EL clients could be used as backup in case the main EL client fails.",
