  "body": "## Description\r\nAfter #2847 we still need to implement the changes required to search for peers that should be subscribed to their deterministic long lived subnets. This search is in the form of prefix searching, in contrast to our current predicate search. After this is implemented, and as a separate issue, we also need to think how to deal with peers that should be subscribed a long lived subnet but aren't.\r\n\r\n## Version\r\n[unstable](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/commit/dbb93cd0d268513017d75936d9097732cf2d5ee3)\r\n\r\n## Present Behaviour\r\nwe can switch to using deterministic long lived subnets but this only changes the subscription process. The search process is still predicate based\r\n\r\n## Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\nAdd (as in, include without removing the current code for backwards compatibility) the logic to search peers based on a prefix \r\n(see https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/issues/2749 )\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\nStill need to think it more",
