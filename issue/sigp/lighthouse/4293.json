  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nThe beacon-apis spec recently added a v2 block publishing endpoint which includes the ability to validate blocks before broadcasting them: https://github.com/ethereum/beacon-APIs/pull/317\r\n\r\nIt is expected that this will be used by MEV relays in order to mitigate unbundling attacks.\r\n\r\nCurrently the relays are running forks of Prysm and Lighthouse: https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/4168.\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\nDrawing on the existing implementation from @realbigsean's branch, implement the new `POST /eth/v2/beacon/blocks` and `POST /eth/v2/beacon/blinded_blocks` endpoints. We also need to add some tests of the basic scenarios: trying to broadcast a block that is gossip-valid but holistically invalid (e.g. has an invalid state root), trying to broadcast a block that is valid but equivocates.\r\n\r\nIn terms of parts of the codebase affected:\r\n\r\n- `beacon_node/http_api/src/publish_blocks.rs`: this is where the impl of the API should happen. We should try to share as much as possible between the v1 and v2 endpoints.\r\n- `beacon_node/http_api/src/lib.rs`: wiring for the v1/v2 endpoints\r\n- `common/eth2`: HTTP client implementation (for accessing the new API).\r\n- `beacon_node/http_api/tests/interactive_tests.rs`: probably the best place for the tests (or maybe `lib.rs`, or a new file).\r\n\r\nOne complication I foresee with the equivocation test is controlling the timing: we want the honest block to pass gossip validation _before_ the equivocating block is processed. But then we want the equivocating block to be processed _before_ the honest block attempts broadcast. We may need to manually inject some events/state in order to simulate this (aside from just supplying the blocks).\r\n",
