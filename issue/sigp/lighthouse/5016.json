I expected they would be equal in almost all cases (i.e. whenever there are no slashings).\r\n\r\nOpening this issue so we don't forget to investigate.\r\n\r\n```\r\nslot 8004800: block from lighthouse-subscribe-none with 75 attestations & purported reward 41559183 gwei\r\nslot 8004799: canonical <=> lighthouse-subscribe-none distance: 7056\r\nslot 8004799: canonical block is likely Lighthouse@7056 (two closest match)\r\nrewards from lighthouse-subscribe-none: 36544081 gwei (att: 35078467 gwei)\r\nmost profitable block from [\"lighthouse-subscribe-none\"]\r\nslot 8004801: block from lighthouse-subscribe-none with 70 attestations & purported reward 41852187 gwei\r\nslot 8004800: canonical <=> lighthouse-subscribe-none distance: 11138\r\nslot 8004800: canonical block is likely Lighthouse@11138 (two closest match)\r\nrewards from lighthouse-subscribe-none: 36796747 gwei (att: 35360563 gwei)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is a bit hard to hard but it says:\r\n\r\n- v3 API said the reward for slot 800 was 41559183\r\n- the POST block reward API said the reward for slot 800 was 36796747 (~88.5%)\r\n",
