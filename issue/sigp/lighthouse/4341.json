  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nMy lighthouse validator client is performing its duties one second early according to the logs. This appears to be causing it to attest to the wrong block when a block is received between 3 and 4 seconds into the slot.\r\n\r\n## Version\r\n\r\nLighthouse was manually built with `cargo build --profile maxperf`.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ lighthouse --version\r\nLighthouse v4.2.0-c547a11\r\nBLS library: blst\r\nSHA256 hardware acceleration: true\r\nAllocator: system\r\nProfile: maxperf\r\nSpecs: mainnet (true), minimal (false), gnosis (false)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ rustup show\r\nDefault host: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\r\nrustup home:  /home/ptd/.rustup\r\n\r\nstable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu (default)\r\nrustc 1.69.0 (84c898d65 2023-04-16)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ uname -a\r\nLinux atlas 5.10.0-23-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 5.10.179-1 (2023-05-12) x86_64 GNU/Linux\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Present Behaviour\r\n\r\nHere is a sample list of log messages (content stripped to avoid leaking information).\r\n\r\n```\r\nMay 26 14:59:35.399 INFO Published validator registrations to the builder network\r\nMay 26 14:59:41.001 INFO Connected to beacon node(s)\r\nMay 26 14:59:41.001 INFO Some validators active\r\nMay 26 14:59:53.000 INFO Connected to beacon node(s)\r\nMay 26 14:59:53.000 INFO Some validators active\r\nMay 26 15:00:05.000 INFO Connected to beacon node(s)\r\nMay 26 15:00:05.000 INFO Some validators active\r\nMay 26 15:00:17.001 INFO Connected to beacon node(s)\r\nMay 26 15:00:17.001 INFO Some validators active\r\nMay 26 15:00:29.000 INFO Connected to beacon node(s)\r\nMay 26 15:00:29.000 INFO Some validators active\r\nMay 26 15:00:39.140 INFO Successfully published attestations\r\nMay 26 15:00:41.001 INFO Connected to beacon node(s)\r\nMay 26 15:00:41.001 INFO Some validators active\r\nMay 26 15:00:51.125 INFO Successfully published attestations\r\nMay 26 15:00:53.000 INFO Connected to beacon node(s)\r\nMay 26 15:00:53.000 INFO Some validators active\r\nMay 26 15:01:05.000 INFO Connected to beacon node(s)\r\nMay 26 15:01:05.001 INFO Some validators active\r\nMay 26 15:01:17.000 INFO Connected to beacon node(s)\r\nMay 26 15:01:17.000 INFO Some validators active\r\nMay 26 15:01:29.000 INFO Connected to beacon node(s)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\nSince all validator activity is driven by the slot clock I would expect all messages to be timestamped shortly after a multiple of 4 seconds. In particular I would expect `Successfully published attestations` messages to be emitted shortly after 4 seconds into the slot, rather than shortly after 3 seconds into the slot.\r\n\r\n## Steps to resolve\r\n\r\nUpdated to latest Rust and Lighthouse. Updated system software and rebooted.\r\n",
