  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nDuring the latest spec update and code restructure we lost a lot of our block processing testing.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this issue is:\r\n\r\n**implement regression testing that ensures block processing fails when supplied an invalid parameter.**\r\n\r\n## Detail\r\n\r\nBlock processing lives in the [`state_processing`](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/tree/master/eth2/state_processing) crate, specifically in the [`per_block_processing.rs`](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/master/eth2/state_processing/src/per_block_processing.rs) file and [`per_block_processing/`](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/tree/master/eth2/state_processing/src/per_block_processing) dir.\r\n\r\nTests should be implemented in a new file: `... state_processing/src/per_block_processing/tests.rs`.\r\n\r\nThe task will primarily consist of:\r\n\r\n- Devise some valid block and accompanying state and ensure it passes block validation.\r\n- For each test, modify the valid block (or state?) to trigger some invalidity condition and assert that that condition was triggered by inspecting the error chain (i.e., ensure the returned `Result` is erroneous and the `Error` is correct).\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have a suite of \"builders\" in [`types/src/test_utils/`](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/tree/master/eth2/types/src/test_utils) that are perfect for this task. For example, `TestingBeaconBlockBuilder` and `TestingBeaconStateBuilder` will produce valid blocks and states \"from thin air\", without needing to build a whole chain.\r\n\r\nThe best resource for learning how to use these builders is in the \"old\" (circa last week, before a spec update) benching code, which is presently not compiling (sorry). Particularly the [BlockBenchingBuilder](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/master/eth2/state_processing/benches/block_benching_builder.rs). I would probably start by copying the `BlockBenchingBuilder` and modifying it into the `BlockProcessingTestBuilder` (or w/e, name not well thought out).\r\n\r\nI'm imagining this sort of flow:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet spec = ChainSpec::foundation();\r\nlet builder = BlockProcessingTestBuilder::new(...);\r\nlet (mut block, mut state) = builder.build();\r\n\r\nstate.slot = 133713\r\nblock.slot = 424242;\r\n\r\nlet result = per_block_processing(&mut state, &block, &spec);\r\n\r\nassert_eq!(result, Err(BlockProcessingError(Invalid(BlockInvalid::StateSlotMismatch))));\r\n```\r\n\r\n_Note: this is pseudo-code. Won't compile, may have errors._\r\n",
