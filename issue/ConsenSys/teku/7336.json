  "body": "When request are relayed via `relayRequest` method, we are going to respond back with the first successful response via `getFirstSuccessfulResponseFromFailovers`.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that an error can also be at application level, not only at networking level (ie: the `SafeFuture` can resolve successfully but it might have a value representing an error).\r\n\r\nIn particular, when submitting an attestation via `SafeFuture<List<SubmitDataError>> sendSignedAttestations`, we may consider a \"first successful response\" as a BN that actually returned a non-zero list of errors.\r\n\r\nIt happened in real scenario where a Teku VC was using 2 secondary BNs, one Teku and one LH.\r\n- LH BN responded with: `tech.pegasys.teku.validator.client.duties.RestApiReportedException: Verification: UnknownHeadBlock { beacon_block_root: <redacted> }`.\r\n- Teku BN seemed to returned no errors.\r\n\r\nSince LH probably returned earlier since the head was unknown for them, we took it as the \"first successful response\".\r\n\r\nSo VC printed `Validator   *** Failed to produce attestation  Slot: <redacted>` even if the attestations where published correctly via Teku BN.\r\n\r\n",
