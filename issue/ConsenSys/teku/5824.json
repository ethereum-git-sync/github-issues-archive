We have `ReexecutingExecutionPayloadBlockManager`, which will try re-execution for next 2 slots (and we don't want to increase this number, because it could be a bad payload forcing our EL to fail). After that we will drop this block and get following chain:\r\n    SUCCESS <- SUCCESS <-[nothing]<- UNKNOWN_PARENT <- UNKNOWN_PARENT\r\nWe are unable to pass this issue on gossip, we'll return to normal sync after `StatusMessage` exchange which is once in 5 minutes with every node. We have a lot of peers on mainnet and some `StatusMessage` always arrives in a few seconds, but in private networks or tests it could be a real problem stalling sync for up to 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nAs a solution we may need to adjust our gossip handling to ensure it retries execution when we get a new descendant of block with failed execution verification (`FAILED_EXECUTION_PAYLOAD_EXECUTION`).\r\n### Steps to Reproduce (Bug)\r\nShutdown execution layer after merge when on gossip sync. Start it after more than 2 slots.",
