  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nAs a client developer it would be very useful to have easy access to a tool that takes a state and replays a series of historical blocks over it so that I can more easily debug correctness and performance issues.\r\n\r\nWe have various ad hoc ways of doing this right now. I am suggesting that we add the capability to `teku debug-tools` or somewhere like that as a maintained part of the codebase. An advantage is that it would then be super easy to compare two different Teku versions for example.\r\n\r\n### Definition of done\r\n\r\n  - I have an easy way to obtain states and blocks in the desired format (e.g. in SSZ or JSON from an archive node/Infura)\r\n  - The tool ingests that state and replays those blocks exactly as that version of Teku would do\r\n  - All my usual relevant options are available, such as setting a debugging level\r\n  - I can do all this with a vanilla Teku installation and do not need to install a separate tool",

    "body": "We do have `teku transition` which can take a pre state and apply either blocks or empty slots to produce the resulting post state. That assumes the state and blocks are local files - it could be quite useful to update it to support being given the URL to an archive node (or Infura) and a start and end slot then have it download the pre state and blocks itself.  If we do that it probably should save those downloaded states/blocks locally as well to make rerunning faster and make it easier to then inspect their contents.",
