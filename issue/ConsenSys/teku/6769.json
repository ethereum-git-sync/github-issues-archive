    "body": "implemented an MVP where local BLS changes are sorted on top of remote BLS changes.\n\nBLS changes are not persisted to disk or periodically re-broadcast currently, it'd be possible but it's a lot of effort for what is likely to be a very short term problem.\n\nLikewise, allowing early submission is not currently implemented, it drives a negative behaviour and there's little to no benefit except for a small number of cases where keys are believed to be compromised.  Generally speaking there's no upside to being in early, other than getting your funds moved slightly earlier, and given the amount of time already waited, the complexity for the transition adds more risk than the value it is likely to gain (imo).\n\nHopefully this change strikes a balance between improving the queue UX, and keeping network liveness as top priority.",
