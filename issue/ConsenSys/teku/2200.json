The network outage duration was 17 minutes, beginning at around 00:39 UTC. These logs cover a period from just before that to when I stopped Teku some hours later. Basically the issue looks like it never connected with any peers after the outage, so it's probably a duplicate of #2102. Nonetheless, my metrics logs showed a very small number of libp2p peers during some of this time (2 or 3), so Teku was apparently in contact with some other nodes, even if they were not promoted to full peers.",

    "body": "@benjaminion Could you look at the history of the `network_peer_connection_attempt_count` metric if available?  If Prometheus isn't capturing the history `curl http://localhost:8008/metrics | grep network_peer_connection_attempt_count` will show it and then run it a couple of minutes later.\n\nNormally the value should be increasing but with the failure case fixed in #2369 Teku stops attempting to make new outbound connections. If you've already got plenty of peers that will go unnoticed - peer count may drop over time but incoming connections will likely replace them.  However once the internet connection is interrupted all peers are dropped (correctly) and aren't reconnected when the internet connection is restored because we aren't making outbound connections.  Some peers may be found via incoming connections but that can be hit and miss.",

Interestingly your node appears to be continuing to attempt to make connections and succeeding to make connections so it won't be helped by #2369 although if it has peers and is in sync with the chain it's doing ok. Possibly some further improvements to peer banning to be made but a different category of error to dropping out of sync entirely.",
