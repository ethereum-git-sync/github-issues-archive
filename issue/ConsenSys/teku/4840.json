    "body": "The two key classes here are `EventSubscriptionManager` and `EventSubscriber`.  Probably the best approach is to have `EventSubscriber` handle sending the keep alive comments itself.  It already has an `AsyncRunner` instance it can use to schedule regularly repeating events, it would need to ensure that the repeating events are stopped when the `SseClient` instance is closed (it's already using `sseClient.onClose` to register a close listener in the constructor so could add to that).",
