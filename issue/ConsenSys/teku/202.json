The adapter then serializes the event object and passes it through gRPC to intended service.  The recipient service adapter then deserializes the object, and posts a new event for its service to handle.\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n* use gRPC \r\n* generate proto files from Java event objects to ensure a single point of maintenance\r\n   * possibly use something like: https://protostuff.github.io/docs/protostuff-runtime/\r\n* make the service adapter as generic as possible so that a single implementation will work for these services:\r\n    * beaconchain, chainstorage, p2p(needs to be renamed to BeaconNode), and powchain\r\n\r\n![microservicecomms](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5555162/51284419-1abcd700-19b1-11e9-8931-1174632d466b.jpg)\r\n",
