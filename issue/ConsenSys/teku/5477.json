  "body": "### Description\n`ForkChoice.onAttestation` always retrieves the state to validate with using the target checkpoint from the attestation. While this will normally be shared between a lot of attestations, particularly for the first slot of the epoch this may require us to perform an additional epoch transition when we could have just used a state from the previous epoch.\n\nWe should review for safety but can likely use `AttestationStateSelector` to be more flexible in choosing the state to use, potentially allowing us to avoid regenerating states or performing additional epoch transitions.",
