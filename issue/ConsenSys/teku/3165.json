To support this functionality, we should provide an endpoint to export states in a format the can be imported (SSZ).  This is a non-standard API, so we should add it to a \"teku\" namespace for now. \r\n\r\nSuggested parameters:\r\n* A checkpoint argument (<BLOCK_ROOT>:<EPOCH_NUMBER>):  Return the state associated with the checkpoint's block root\r\n* No argument:  Return the latest finalized state",

Given you're going to this API to get the canonical starting point for sync to resolve security risks with the weak subjectiivty period, having the API labelled debug is not particularly confidence inspiring.\r\n\r\nBut otherwise I do really like the ability to just set an `Accept` header to specify the output format - we've been planning to do that for anything that returned a block or state for quite a while but never quite gotten to it.",
