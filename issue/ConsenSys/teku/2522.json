Teku nodes seem to have a rating indicating our attestations are not being propagated out and included in the chain as quickly as possible.  For example:\r\n- https://beaconcha.in/validator/5925\r\n- https://beaconcha.in/validator/6460\r\n\r\nWe should look into improving this score.  See explanation of metric here: https://www.attestant.io/posts/defining-attestation-effectiveness/",
