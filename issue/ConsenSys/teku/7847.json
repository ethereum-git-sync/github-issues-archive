Builder could be called on any slot so such systems needs new `payload_attributes` on every fcu (see [comment](https://github.com/ethereum/beacon-APIs/pull/305#issuecomment-1445011581)). Following line was added to the spec:\r\n```\r\nThe frequency at which this event is sent may depend on beacon node configuration.\r\n```\r\nOur current implementations sends `payload_attributes` event only when beacon node is called to produce block, so it cannot be used for similar job. We could enhance our imlementation to send `payload_attributes` event on every fcu, so it could be used for such cases. Calculating all fields is not free, so it makes sense to introduce command line options flag which will turn this feature on, so by default we will keep sending event only in our slots when we have proposal.\r\n\r\n",
