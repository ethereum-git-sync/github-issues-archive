  "body": "### Description\nAs a staking service operator, I want to be able to add validators to a running Teku instance without restarting so that I can add new deposits without downtime.\n\n#### How\n\n* Validator keys are specified as usual via config file, cli etc\n* Adding validators is done by updating the config file and then sending a SIGHUP to the teku instance.  Note that it's not possible to change CLI args or env vars while the process is running\n* Teku will reload the config, including redownloading any URLs provided (eg for external validator public keys).  Any new validators detected will be added and begin performing duties.\n* Always log a message when the config is being reloaded even if there are no changes.\n* Log public keys of any newly added validators.\n* Teku should not exit if a validator key is unable to be loaded when reloading the config, just log the error.\n* Teku should not reload keys it already has (the `pubkey` field of the keystore is assumed to be correct for this purpose)\n* Teku should never, under any circumstances wind up with the same validator key loaded twice. \n* Removing validators isn't supported in the initial version.  If we can, printing a warning that the validator is not being removed would be good.\n\n\nWeb3Signer changes are out of scope for this ticket (will be handled by Groot).\n\n#### Notes\n\n - Need to take strong measures to ensure that any changes are intentional. For example calling a \"refresh validators\" API after installing the new keys.\n - Similar functionality should be made available in Web3Signer, and the Teku side of remote signing should integrate with that.\n - I'm assuming that it is much simpler to only have funcionality to add validators. Removing and moving validators looks tricky in terms of managing slashing data etc.",
