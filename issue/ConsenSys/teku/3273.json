  "body": "### Description\r\nAs a staker, I want voluntary exit messages gossipped to the network so that I can exit my validators as soon as possible. Voluntary exit gossip was implemented in #2042, but seems to be broken.\r\n\r\nOn 21 November I submitted voluntary exits for 63 validators on the Medalla network, all of them being validators attached to my own node. I kept this node and validators running and monitored the handling of the exits.\r\n\r\nThe exits were included _only in blocks produced by my own validators_. Namely:\r\n - block 786077, 16 exits (there is a maximum limit of 16 VE messages per block)\r\n - block 788757, 16 exits\r\n - block 789032, 16 exits\r\n - block 789861, 15 exits\r\n\r\n As the blocks were published, the included VEs were correctly removed from the VE queue returned by `/eth/v1/beacon/pool/voluntary_exits`.\r\n\r\nSince my VE messages were never included in blocks produced by other proposers, it appears that they were _not gossipped to the network_ ahead of being included in blocks.\r\n\r\nNote also that my node does not appear to be including in blocks voluntary exits generated by other, non-attached, validators. This suggests that they are not being received and queued up. May be related.\r\n\r\n### Versions (Add all that apply)\r\n* Software version: [`teku --version`] `teku/v20.11.0-RC1+2-g66c5e47/linux-x86_64/-privatebuild-openjdk64bitservervm-java-13`\r\n",
