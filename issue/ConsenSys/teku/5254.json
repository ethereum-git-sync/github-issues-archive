    "body": "Deposits can be included in blocks even if they have invalid signatures and the processing of those deposits changes depending on whether the signature is valid or not (deposits with invalid signatures that add new validators are ignored).\r\n\r\nBut given that most deposits do have valid signatures it probably does make sense to do a single batch validation of them and then if that's invalid fall back to individually validating them.  It would cost at least 1ETH for every time you made us do that so not much of a DOS risk.  There's a few details around that since we don't currently check signatures for deposits to existing validators but since most deposits are for new validators it may still be a net win to just check them all up front.",
