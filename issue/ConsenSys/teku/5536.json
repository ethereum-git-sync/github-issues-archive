  "body": "We started implementing `ForkChoiceNotifier` as a monolith. Then we splitted up in different classes with their own responsibility. In particular we introduced `PayloadAttributesCalculator` that recently become `ProposersDataManager`.\r\n\r\nNow, `ProposersDataManager` has its own dignity and it is responsible for the critical job of calculating the payload attributes when we have to propose a block.\r\n\r\nI suspect we could offload\\simplify `ForkChoiceNotifier` by properly unit testing `ProposersDataManager` and then mock it when used in `ForkChoiceNotifierTest` as a standard dependency. This could then simplify unit testing `ForkChoiceNotifier`. I'm not 100% sure but could make sense.",
