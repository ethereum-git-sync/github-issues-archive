  "body": "### Description\nThe on_merge_block tests depend on some blocks being invalid and rejected by fork choice.  Currently our executor doesn't handle the `valid: false` entry for `block` steps and so is incorrectly passing some of those tests.  We need to update the executor.\n\nAdditionally we should ensure that each step has a specific list of known attributes we support and tests should fail if any unknown attributes are found. Currently we only seem to do that for `checks`.",
