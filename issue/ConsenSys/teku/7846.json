The issue however is that when I snapshot the volume at the moment I also get the `—p2p-private-key-file` which I'd prefer not to have and then then manage separately. Could the current behaviour be altered so that:\n- if a file exists at the path pointed to by `—p2p-private-key-file` then use it\n- if it doesn't, create the key at that path?\n\n\n",
