  "body": "### Description\nIt's possible for the validator client to calculate duties for epochs based on there being a series of empty slots in the previous epoch, but then to later receive blocks for those slots.  The new randao reveals changes the scheduling of duties but the validator client doesn't recalculate the epoch as it doesn't count as a fork.\n\nSuspect this often leads to a lot of invalid attestations and blocks being created when Teku first starts up.",
