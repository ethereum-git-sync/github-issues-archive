  "body": "Basically, when launching a new node from scratch, Teku wears out 1 TB of SSD for 6 GB of effective data stored. Maybe is there something to optimize in the software when it rewrites 166× everything ?\n\nAfter synchronisation, the problem stops.\n\nI noticed this problem with `smartctl` on my Samsung Evo 970 Plus last week (31 TB written for 1 GB of data stored after synchronisation with Mainnet) but I was not sure whether it was a bug of smartctl or Besu or the controller of the SSD. Since then, I separated Teku and Besu on two different SSDs. I'm synchronizing with Görli since yesterday and today I notice that the new SSD devoted to Teku (Samsung PM961) stores 6GB more data but the _Data units written_ field of `smartctl` gained almost 1 TB.\nBesu is therefore not guilty.\n\nNo swap. Teku runs with _-Xmx22G_. There is always between 10 and 17 GB of RAM free (so used by Linux to cache files).",
