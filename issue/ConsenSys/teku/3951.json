  "body": "### Description\r\nAs an user of the `voluntary-exit` command, I want to get more information regarding my exit status so that I don't have to query any API or any website to get that information.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce (Feature)\r\n1. Execute the `voluntary-exit` command\r\n2. Notice that you are not informed of when you are expected to actually exit or how long it will take\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\nThe `voluntary-exit` command should query the beacon node about the exit status of your validator(s) and give you more information regarding that exit. It should tell you how long you should expect to wait before your validator(s) are exited. It should tell you the exact exit epoch and withdrawable epoch.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:**\r\nIt seems like the only information you get is the epoch at which the voluntary exit was published.\r\n\r\n**Frequency:**\r\nEverytime someone uses the `voluntary-exit` command\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n* Software version: teku/v21.4.1/windows-x86_64/adoptopenjdk-java-11\r\n* Java version: openjdk 11.0.11 2021-04-20 - OpenJDK Runtime Environment AdoptOpenJDK-11.0.11+9 (build 11.0.11+9) - OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM AdoptOpenJDK-11.0.11+9 (build 11.0.11+9, mixed mode)\r\n* OS Name & Version: Windows 10",
