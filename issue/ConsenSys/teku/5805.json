  "body": "the build should still all be done (build/assemble/integrationTest/unitTest), but we want to fail the overall build so `FIXME` can be in the PR, just can't be merged until it's removed.\n\nThe basic intent is that we can put a `// FIXME` into code and put up a PR that will check test etc\n\nI think it's probably very similar to the 'spotless' check that happens now at build time, where there's no deps, and you can't merge if it fails...\n\nThis change is likely to be mostly in circleci configuration in `.circleci/config.yml`.",
