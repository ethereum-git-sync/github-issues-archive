  "body": "Teku's validation of validator pub keys in `/eth/v1/beacon/states/{state_id}/validators` is inconsistent with other clients.\r\n\r\nIf you make a call to the above endpoint with one or more invalid pub keys in the `id` parameter such as `0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001`, Teku responds with the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\"status\":400,\"message\":\"Invalid public key: 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOther major clients ignore pub keys that don't match an existing validator regardless of whether the pub key is valid or not. The [Eth Beacon Node API](https://ethereum.github.io/beacon-APIs/#/Beacon/getStateValidators) specifies `If an index or public key does not match any known validator, no information will be returned but this will not cause an error.`. While it doesn't explicitly state that invalid pub keys should be ignored it can be interpreted that way and indeed other client implementation (perhaps unintentionally) took that interpretation.\r\n\r\nOther clients tested: Nimbus, Prysm, Lighthouse.",
