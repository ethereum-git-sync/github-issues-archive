  "body": "### Description\r\nIf two requests for the same checkpoint state come in simultaneously it's possible that Teku will process the empty slots for them both at the same time, instead of doing it once and reusing the result for both. We should deduplicate those requests.\r\n\r\nPotentially could also consider being able to \"rebase\" requests on top of each other to start from a state that has already processed some of the required empty slots, similar to how `StateGenerationQueue` does it for processing blocks.\r\n\r\nMay be able to reuse the same queuing logic between checkpoint and normal state requests.",
