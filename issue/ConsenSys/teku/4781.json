  "body": "### Description\nBased on the current specs, optimistic sync is only safe to use once the merge block is finalised. Prior to that being finalized the EL and CL will need to validate and import blocks in lock step.\n\nIf we get a `SYNCING` response from the EL and the finalised checkpoint has not completed the merge, then we will need to delay processing the block. It can likely be deferred in the same way as if the EL had returned an error (as in #4782)",
