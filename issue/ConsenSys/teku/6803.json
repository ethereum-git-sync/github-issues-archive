    "body": "I am reasonably certain that this is unrelated to the top-up. There is no logic in the spec or in Teku to reset any timer on a top-up - the top-up amount just gets added to the beacon chain balance.\r\n\r\nI suspect something like this:\r\n  - Initial deposit of 32 ETH processed at epoch 434\r\n  - Validator becomes active at epoch 996\r\n  - Top-up deposit of 1 ETH processed at epoch 1128\r\n  - You try to exit the validator soonish after this, but you are not allowed to initiate a voluntary exit until [activation + 256 epochs](https://eth2book.info/bellatrix/part3/transition/block/#voluntary-exits) (I.e. 27 hours after activation).\r\n  - After epoch 1252 you are able to exit\r\n\r\nIs that a possibility?\r\n",

    "body": "@benjaminion I had 2 validators (61486 and 61487) that were deposited in the same epoch (434). One with with a top-up (61486) and one without (61487). So both had the same activation epoch too (561).\r\n\r\nThat is why I suspect that the top-up changes something. If this is not in the protocol rules, my hypothesis is that Teku uses the last deposit epoch instead of the activation epoch.\r\n\r\nIn any case Teku gives no error, and does not change the exit epoch.\r\n\r\nThis was the output from Teku API, when I tried to figure out what was going wrong:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"execution_optimistic\": false,\r\n  \"finalized\": false,\r\n  \"data\": {\r\n    \"index\": \"61486\",\r\n    \"balance\": \"32000038051\",\r\n    \"status\": \"active_ongoing\",\r\n    \"validator\": {\r\n      \"pubkey\": \"0x98e2bf94fe3db418b3d7aa47930a672e1ad35d971928c198d997b31276d654867fd91f1aa66a71ce0ee3ff2d39175a6a\",\r\n      \"withdrawal_credentials\": \"0x0100000000000000000000009b18e9e9aa3dd35100b385b7035c0b1e44afca14\",\r\n      \"effective_balance\": \"32000000000\",\r\n      \"slashed\": false,\r\n      \"activation_eligibility_epoch\": \"435\",\r\n      \"activation_epoch\": \"561\",\r\n      \"exit_epoch\": \"18446744073709551615\",\r\n      \"withdrawable_epoch\": \"18446744073709551615\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWhen I ran the voluntary exit a second time, I got:\r\n```\r\nLoading configuration...\r\nExits are going to be generated for validators:\r\n98e2bf9\r\nEpoch: 1582\r\n\r\nThese validators won't be able to be re-activated once this operation is complete.\r\nAre you sure you wish to continue (yes/no)?\r\nyes\r\nExit is not the first one for validator 61486.\r\n```\r\nSo Teku was aware that an exit was triggered, without actually exiting.\r\n\r\nI hope this isn't too confusing, just trying to help and experimenting with corner cases.",

    "body": "Noted, and I'll let one of my colleagues take a look. But I still think that the top-up is unrelated, there is no mechanism for it to affect voluntary exits at all.\r\n\r\nAll that Teku does when you talk to its API is forward your voluntary exit to the network. After that it's up to all the clients on the network to keep it in their message pools and eventually to include the voluntary exit in a block. Submitting the VE to Teku does not in itself action the exit - once it's sent to the network it's out of Teku's hands (unless you happen to publish a block shortly afterwards). There can be arbitrary delays and losses in this process - since voluntary exits are not consensus critical (and are uncompensated) clients tend not to prioritise them.",

    "body": "Ok so basically submitting an exit goes into a pool, and that is published to the network so that any potential block builder should be able to pick up and run with the exit.\nIt's not guaranteed and there's no incentive to include it so it's a bit less reliable than some of the other messages.\n\nAt that point it's submitted.\nIf a subsequent message is posted to the same BN, you get the `Exit is not the first one for validator xxx` message, this basically is saying it's already in the pool...\n\nIf the exit is already in the pool, we can probably improve the logic a little, as unless you're a block builder your pool isn't consumed, so it's a little difficult to reason about the logic.\nGiven the first one went through, it's likely we're publishing correctly, or you built the block that included it. The second one is similar to a corner case with BLS withdrawals I've been thinking about, where it's actually been submitted to the network, but it needs to hit a block builder or the message won't be processed, and it's hard to resubmit.\n\nThere's a number of improvements we could potentially make to improve the story in cases like this, I think now that we're getting to withdrawals being active, people are more likely to submit voluntary exits more often, so it's probably worth some improvements in this area.\n\nI guess the todo list is:\n - quick confirmation that we actually do broadcast voluntary exits for sanity, it's likely already included in acceptance tests.\n - contemplate allowing a re-broadcast at the very least for exits that are already in the queue after a period - this could be automated (preferably) or manual after sufficient time has passed that it won't be considered a duplicate message. This would apply to locally submitted exits, and be broadly applicable to bls change messages.\n\nHopefully this isn't in the 'way too much information' bucket, but at the very least it'll be useful for myself or the team when we can look at it more closely.\n\n@heeckhau if you're able to see if your BN created the block from the first exit that may be contextually relevant but I think we're equally able to move forward and progress this issue without that information, so I wouldn't spend too long on it if you can't find it straight away...",
