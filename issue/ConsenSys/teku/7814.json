Given that the attestation data should come directly from head state, this seems like a long time to have to wait for the data.\r\n\r\n**Frequency:** [How regularly does it occur?]\r\n\r\nEvery slot.\r\n\r\n### Versions (Add all that apply)\r\n\r\nteku/v23.10.0/linux-x86_64/-privatebuild-openjdk64bitservervm-java-17",
