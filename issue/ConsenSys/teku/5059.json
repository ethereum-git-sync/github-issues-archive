  "body": "ref. https://ethereum.github.io/keymanager-APIs/#/Remote%20Key%20Manager/DeleteRemoteKeys\n\nIn a very similar way to how local keys are removed, we will delete remote keys.  Because we're only dealing with the definition file and not a password also, the process should be a lot simpler, and we're just re-using the DeletableSigner interface for removal.\n\nAgain, because this is a batch process, we will not be failing the entire process unless the initial request fails to parse.\n\nThe request body is the same as the local keymanager request body, but the response is different, because we don't include any slashing protection data on delete (which also implies that doesn't need to be fetched when looking at the delete code)\n\nOrdering is important, so perform actions in the same order that the local delete is performed is probably the best guidance on that...",
