  "body": "As a manager of validator keys on a remote service,\nI want to be able to have keys that I have added to teku,\nso that they can be loaded on startup without further management.\n\nAs an adjunct to this,  if i change the URL in configuration that my signer is on, i don't want to re-add all my validators, I just want to restart and have it work.\n\nSo a request object looks like an array of:\n```\n{\n  \"pubkey\": \"0xa8d4c7c27795a725961317ef5953a7032ed6d83739db8b0e8a72353d1b8b4439427f7efa2c89caa03cc9f28f8cbab8ac\",\n  \"url\": \"http://localhost:19000\"\n}\n```\nwith optional URL.\nFor each of these objects passed in, in the same order as local mutables does it, we should store the file while we're importing the keys. (`LocalValidatorSource.addValidator`)\n\nIf the URL was not specified, use the value of the current configuration item. this will mean that a user can simply change that URL and restart, and the validators will come from a new url (if they weren't specified during add).\n\nAlso, potentially as a separate PR, when teku loads, any of these validators that have been stored need to be added, so that we can start up with running remote mutable validators.\n\nThe path to store the files will come from `ValidatorClientService.getManagedRemoteKeyPath`",
