It was fixed \"symptomatically\" in this commit [1b102b9](https://github.com/PegaSysEng/artemis/commit/1b102b97d258284d26c9b65ddb79eb23cbacab2c) by simply adding a default constructor to ValidatorRecord.java. \r\n\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n* An explanation or change that would fix the underlying problem\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce (Bug)\r\n1. Ensure that you have the latest master. Then run this command:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit reset --hard f453180354ee903a078758e5cf9bec1aabb2ad91\r\n```\r\n2. Then build by running: `./gradlew clean build test`. The build will stall out at 10% complete.\r\n3. To fix it, add a default constructor to ValidatorRecord.java and build again.\r\n\r\n**Frequency:** [What percentage of the time does it occur?]\r\n100% (assuming you have run `./gradlew clean`\r\n",
