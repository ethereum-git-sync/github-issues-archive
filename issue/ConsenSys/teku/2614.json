    "body": "There were two likely causes of this:\r\n* The sync algorithm may have picked the wrong fork to sync to initially. In this case it will go back and sync other chains and eventually winds up on the right chain.  During periods of non-finalisation this can take quite a while but #2600 should speed it up significantly.\r\n* There were some errors in ForkChoice #2562 though generally these caused the node to stop updating it's head entirely rather than following an incorrect chain.",
