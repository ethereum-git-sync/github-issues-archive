    "body": "This turns out to be a fair bit of work.  We can ensure the new field doesn't appear when bellatrix isn't enabled with:\n\n```\n  @JsonInclude(Include.NON_NULL)\n  @JsonProperty(\"execution_optimistic\")\n  public final Boolean execution_optimistic;\n```\n\nand then setting it to `null` when it shouldn't appear.\n\nHowever there's quite a few changes required to be able to return optimistic blocks/states and track if the chain head was optimistic at the time we gathered the data.\n\nFirstly, we currently based most requests on the fully validated chain head so while retrieving blocks by root would currently include optimistic blocks, retrieving by slot wouldn't return anything after the fully validated head.  We may want to change things so that we actually only track one chain head - the optimistic head, along with a record of whether the chain head is optimistic or not. With the REST API moving over to include optimistic blocks, I'm not sure there's a need to not update the chain head - we would need to adjust the `Syncing` log messages. We already explicitly check if the relevant block is optimistic and refuse to publish blocks and attestations.\n\nThen for returning if the data was affected by optimistic sync, we need to ensure we do it in a thread safe way. We may change between optimistic and normal sync while we're executing the query so need to get the chain head and whether it's optimistic in an atomic operation to ensure they're consistent.\n\nLikely we'd need to update `BlockSelector` and `StateSelector` to return both the block/state and a flag indicating if it's optimistic or not.",
