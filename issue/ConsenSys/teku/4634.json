  "body": "### Description\nInvestigate options to reduce the build times for PR merge checks. Aim is to have it below 10mins.\n\nSome possible options:\n\n1. Remove the restriction on number of threads used by gradle (-Dorg.gradle.workers.max=2 in `.circleci/config.yml`)\n2. Move assemble to a large executor type (it's a requirement for nearly every other step)\n3. Try increasing `parallelism` setting for reference tests (I think it's the last step to complete now)\n\n\nThere may be other things that can be done so its worth looking at what is actually on the critical path and seeing if we can speed it up.\n\nNote that the windows build is slow but isn't required before merging PRs so not a major priority to optimise at this point (but won't complain if there's something easy that can be done to improve it).",
