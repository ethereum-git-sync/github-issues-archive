    "body": "This is an interesting one and something to consider as part of planning for the validator subcommands. \r\n\r\nPossibly a simpler and more secure solution is to support specifying the withdrawal public key as a command line argument so the withdrawal private key is not required for the deposit generation at all. That would support the recommended process of generating the withdrawal key offline and keeping it in cold storage.\r\n\r\nCouple of other factors to consider with this issue:\r\n* Note that Teku does not use a mnemonic to generate key pairs - they are randomly generated.  Currently if the generated withdrawal key is not written to disk it will be completely irretrievable.\r\n* Teku can use any validator keys from a BLS12-381 keystore. They do not have to be generated by the Teku subcommands.",
