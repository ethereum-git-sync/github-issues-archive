In particular, it is believed to be causing substantial growth in native memory usage over time, which we have failed to get on top of.\n\nAre there other databases that would be an improvement, such as alternative kv stores like LevelDB, or ones that offer more structured storage?\n\n - Investigate LevelDB as an alternative to RocksDB - [3 days]\n    - is it embedded?\n    - is it likely to be a relatively small rewrite, or extensive to get a prototype to play with?\n - Are there fast alternatives to RocksDB other than LevelDB?
