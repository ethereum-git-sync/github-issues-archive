In the event of Execution Client failure, the Beacon Node continues to produce empty slots and the Validator keeps signing and producing attestations as well as sync signatures against those empty slots.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]\r\nThe Beacon Node should return code 503 (or any other error code) in the event of Execution Client failure. The Validator should stop producing attestations, aggregates and sync signatures until both CL and EL are fully operational.\r\n",
