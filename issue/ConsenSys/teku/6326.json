    "body": "After talking to some people about this, the idea of using a metric does not seem to be very helpful (even less helpful when running multiple validators).\r\n\r\nA recommended approach would be to poll the Duties API and use the information about proposers to decide a good time to upgrade. Missing attestations during an upgrade should be fine. Even sync committee duties are not a bit deal. The only duty that a validator definitely does not want to miss is a block proposal.\r\n\r\nSolutions like https://github.com/TobiWo/eth-duties could be helpful for those that don't want to implement their own script.",
