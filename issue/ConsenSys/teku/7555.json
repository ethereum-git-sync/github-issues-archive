    "body": "Actually, I may have slightly assessed this incorrectly... but I think the fix will be the same.\n\nBasically in consensus-specs, a bunch of 'constants' got moved to 'config'. `GOSSIP_MAX_SIZE` is one, and it pretty much does mean that all custom configs need to now define those values, because they're no longer constants (3375 you mentioned above).\n\nThere's a 'similar' problem with remote config where we now load some defaults in a bad order, but that's different to the root cause of this issue, which is just not having those moved values set in config thats loaded from a local resource.\n\nI think your initial assessment of it was correct in that its a flow on effect of the consensus-specs change, but this has also caused issues loading remote configs where 3375 hadn't been done on external BNs we're loading configuration from.",
