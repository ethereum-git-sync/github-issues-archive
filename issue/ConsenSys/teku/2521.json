  "body": "### Description\r\nAs a staker, I want my attestations included quickly so that I make maximum reward. \r\n\r\nbeaconcha.in has implemented an Attestation Effectiveness metric based on [this model](https://www.attestant.io/posts/defining-attestation-effectiveness/). This surfaces the detailed analysis of rewards and penalties I did on Altona.\r\n\r\nWhere identifiable, Prysm and Lighthouse validators seem to be consistently in the 80-90% effective range, whereas Teku validators are consistently around 40-50%. This appears to be solely due to delays in getting attestations included, not due to missing attestations.\r\n\r\n[Example](https://beaconcha.in/validator/a1f3100b57e1aea7acc7921afb25b32b6fb8894d254f866c73d7319a78b1054b555c1fc72a060a389377e7da2b356e6f). Click [Attestations](https://beaconcha.in/validator/a1f3100b57e1aea7acc7921afb25b32b6fb8894d254f866c73d7319a78b1054b555c1fc72a060a389377e7da2b356e6f#attestations) to see the inclusion distance (0 distance means in the slot immediately after the block).\r\n\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n* Attestation effectiveness at least as high as Prysm and Lighthouse",
