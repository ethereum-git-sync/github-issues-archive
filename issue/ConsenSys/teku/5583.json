    "body": "Thanks for raising this, I've had a look into it and there were definitely some missing.\n\nI'm not sure if something had already changed, but `states/{state_id}/validators`, `states/{state_id}/committees`, `states/{state_id}/sync_committees`, `beacon/headers` do list `execution_optimistic` in their responses.\n\nThe other endpoints it as missing, they've been recently migrated to a new framework and for whatever reason it was missed.\n\nAs we transition, the documentation and code are disconnected, so I did a pass of these endpoints and the published doc does appear to include execution_optimistic, so was just a code level issue.",
