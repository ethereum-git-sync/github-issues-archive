    "body": "Worth noting here that the most common causes of this are 1) having a -Xmx set too low which causes Java to spend most of it's time running GC (-Xmx5g is generally recommended but feel free to ask for advice on discord for your specific setup), or 2) having contention on disk IO - particularly common with the merge coming up and a lot of people syncing an EL on the same machine. \n\n\nSo one part of reducing this is moving to async storage updates (#1934) which work is in progress on. There are likely other areas that could be optimised as well. Would be good to get multiple parallel investigations going into the different aspects of this.",

BN has -Xmx6g, no old-gen gcs or cpu spikes showing in prometheus monitoring for any of the processes and it's running on a NVMe drive so there shouldn't be IO issues (in theory). There's various discussion with logs and screenshots in Discord at around 15th Sept 09:55 UTC.  Is there a way of gathering useful debug logs from leveldb2, if that is the likely contender for I/O spikes?\r\n\r\nThis appears in the leveldb LOG file just after the BN errors, don't know if it's useful or not.\r\n```\r\n2022/09/15-09:02:10.916789 140535372158720 Compacting 4@0 + 0@1 files\r\n```",

It will need to download the historic blocks in the background which increases disk IO (and load on other peers in the network which can add up if a lot of nodes do this resync at once).  It also means that initially you'll have a much smaller database but it will gradually grow to the same size again so it may be a temporary solution and then actually make things worse as the database gets close to full size but the historic blocks are still being downloaded.",

    "body": "@back-87 If you really want to live dangerously, and since you're already running HEAD, we have been working on an optimisation to take database updates off of the critical path and we're in the process of evaluating if that will help in this case.  You can enable it with `--Xdata-storage-async-enabled`.  Please make sure you have slashing protection enabled - by not waiting for database updates to be written to disk it's possible that after an unclean shutdown you'll start up with the beacon chain having effectively rolled back a few blocks and that may lead to surround votes. Slashing protection will keep you safe and is definitely always required but it's just that tiny bit more likely to be required with this flag enabled.\r\n\r\nAnd for anyone reading on, this is definitely not a recommended thing to do unless you're confident in your ability to rollback Teku and potentially do a fresh resync of the database (checkpoint sync is fine).  But if you do try it please do let us know how it works for you.",

I'll leave it active until this issue is resolved and I've updated to a commit containing the fix for it.\r\n\r\nThanks to the Teku team for all the hard work!\r\n\r\nAs this seems to be related to disk IO I tried to do some A-B (with Xdata-storage-async-enabled and without) using iostat... Polling every second and I didn't see any huge differences between the two. I certainly see a difference in the frequency of this issue (now zero). Disk bottleneck issues would make sense given I'm running an old, cheap Adata SX8200 2TB. This has me considering using first fees from proposals on an upgrade! Cheers",
