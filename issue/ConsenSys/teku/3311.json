That shouldn't be necessary.\r\n\r\nFrom Proto:\r\nOk, I've a theory: Teku is weird with status checks. If it finds a peer status with a finalized epoch that's too old w.r.t its own (very likely when checking just after an epoch transition that finalizes) it will request that block from the peer. So every epoch, there's a reasonable chance Teku nodes are requesting an old block (and maybe even so from multiple peers at once)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ConsenSys/teku/blob/256ec2450310b08bfb25dc2b3aacd2e3dd1594c8/networking/eth2/src/main/java/tech/pegasys/teku/networking/eth2/peers/PeerChainValidator.java#L165\r\n\r\nI've this theory that Teku nodes are sending a whole bunch of block requests every epoch boundary. Teku nodes receive more, while other nodes serve teku. And maybe lighthouse is smart enough to not serve its teku peer, when the peer status says it already has the block.",
