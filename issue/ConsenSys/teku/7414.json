    "body": "The `total_rewards` change does not appear to be a massive change. This will require changing how the response is aggregated. The inactivity seems to be included in the `RewardComponent`, meaning it should not be too hard to get. I expect this task should take 1 or 2 days assuming no surprises.\n\nThe `ideal_rewards` change appears to be a bit more complex. It will also require more investigation and will need changes in the ideal calculation. This may take a couple of days and potentially an extra day for texting.\n\nEstimate is a week for completing all. Could be broken up into two tickets for the two different tasks.",
