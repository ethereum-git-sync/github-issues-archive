  "body": "### Description\nUpdate reference tests to 1.1.6.  This release includes updates to fork_choice tests which expect proposer weight boosting to be enabled.  We have it implemented but the fork choice test executor doesn't trigger events in the same way that a real node does and that's now important.  We'll likely need to rework the test executor to call the `ForkChoiceTrigger` at appropriate times as part of the `tick` step in tests (and make sure we don't trigger changes to proposer weightings as part of running checks.",
