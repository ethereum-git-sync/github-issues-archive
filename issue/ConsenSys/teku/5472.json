  "body": "### Description\nSo that we can investigate problems more effectively, setup a system that subscribes to all gossip topics and logs every gossip message received.\n\nTo minimise storage requirements, store the messages in binary format, preserving the snappy compression used on the wire. Discard recorded messages after 24 hours.\n\nThis will likely be implemented as a new option in teku to record the data, coupled with a debug-tools subcommand or some other tool to read and evaluate the resulting data.\n\nIf possible, record the validation result for each message (including when they are already seen).",
