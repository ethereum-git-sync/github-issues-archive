  "body": "### Description\nAt the start of a sync or when we need to switch sync targets, we need to find a common ancestor between our chain and the target chain. Currently we search for that starting from the validated chain head, but this could be a long way behind the optimistic head, resulting in downloading a lot of blocks we have already process (but been unable to validated with the EL).\n\nThe search for common ancestor should start from the optimistic chain head instead to avoid this problem.\n\n`MultipeerCommonAncestorFinder` is probably the place to start for this.",
