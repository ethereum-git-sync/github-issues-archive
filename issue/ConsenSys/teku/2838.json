  "body": "Report from @mcdee via Discord\r\n> I'm receiving a 414 error from /eth/v1/validator/duties/attester.  I'm throwing a lot of validators at it (~3,500, I think) but I'd hope that we can handle suitably large URLs.  Could you give me some background on what limits are in place, and why?\r\n\r\nFrom @rolfyone \r\n> HTTP 414 is URL too long, we're not restricting it,  I can't find anything that's limiting it from the javalin side specifically (our web api). There's references to query length keeping within 2000 characters, which i recall vaguely as the reason why we were doing a post for the duties... but i've found nothing concrete as to an exact length. I'll do a little more digging, hopefully its something we can explicitly increase",

Having said that, apache does run at a considerably higher limit...\nI've asked on the javalin glitter if there's a way to increase the limit easily.",
