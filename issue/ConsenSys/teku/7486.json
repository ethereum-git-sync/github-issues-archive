  "body": "We are working on https://github.com/optimism-java/hildr which is OP rollup client written in Java. For support p2p feature, we introduce teku as dependency, we used discV5 service discovery and libp2p gossip. It works well when compile with jar, however it not works with graalvm native build. \r\n\r\nWe found the issue is from Log4j 2 which still not support native build. The issue is [here](https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/issues/1539) . Would we consider use logback as logging framework?",
