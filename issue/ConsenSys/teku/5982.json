    "body": "There is a slight catch here we need to think through.  Currently you can run teku without connecting to an eth1 endpoint at all which is fine pre-merge and quite useful if you're not running a validator.  But if we provide a default `--ee-endpoint` value it will wind up automatically being used for `--eth1-endpoint` as well leaving no way to not load deposits. Setups that used to work would now generate errors that the eth1 endpoint is offline.  So we'd either want to wait until Bellatrix is scheduled for MainNet or only provide the default value when Bellatrix is scheduled.\n\nEven then though, having this default to localhost may point it at the right port, but Teku would generate its own random JWT secret which is unlikely to be what the EL is using so it's unlikely for the actual connection to work. And providing the default value means teku would startup even if people hadn't prepared for the merge which may cause more configuration problems.\n\nSo I'm not sure this is such a great idea... It may be worth doing post merge but even then may be better to leave it as a required flag so users are aware they need to configure it properly.",
