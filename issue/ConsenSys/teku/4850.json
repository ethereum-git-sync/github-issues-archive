    "body": "Yep makes sense. We will likely always require a default fee recipient be specified as there are a bunch of ways to add validators and we can't always guarantee a fee recipient are specified as part of them but definitely makes sense to have a way to override that default per validator.\n\nI'm thinking we probably need to support reading the mapping of validator public key to fee recipient address from a YAML file and we'd periodically check that file for changes so you don't need to restart to change the configuration. Mostly I imagine that's useful for when validators are added without restarting so you can also add an override for them.",

    "body": "Hi guys, thanks for you input. Dropping some comments inline:\r\n\r\n> So, my first proposal could be a yaml file similar to `<file_content>`\r\n\r\nThe structure makes sense to us. But see last comment.\r\nWould be possible to have a flag to configure the pooling frequency and/or disable pooling?\r\n\r\n> public keys are long but allows you to prepare the file even before knowing the assigned index for a new validator.\r\n\r\nPerfect, it aligns with our backend too.\r\n\r\n> The corresponding CLI argument could be --validators-suggested-fee-recipient-address-file.\r\n\r\nWould it be too much asking to load configuration via URL too? It would simplify a lot more on our side; complementing your proposal, was wondering something like `--validators-suggested-fee-recipient-address-url=http://registry:8080/api/fee-recipient` which would output same structure you mentioned above but in json.\r\n\r\n> If instead we want to reduce potential confusion, the two CLI params could become mutual-exclusive and the file MUST include default_fee_recipient.\r\n\r\nAgree with this approach, doesn't leave room for any confusion.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we wanted to specify the block producer URL per validator. It's similar requirement to the recipient fee and maybe you guys may want to explore some 'per-validator' configuration structure and bundle the fee recipient + block producer url in the same config file/url. Example based of yours:\r\n```\r\n# file will be periodically read by teku, no restart will be required\r\n\r\n# validator public key -> fee recipient ethereum address + block proposer url + future params\r\n'0x12345...12345':\r\n  fee_recipient: '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001'\r\n  proposer_url: 'http://flashhumans.net/mev-blocks\r\n'0x12345...54321':\r\n  fee_recipient: '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001'\r\n  proposer_url: 'http://stay-poor-but-good-4-eth.net/non-mev-blocks\r\n'0x12345...00001':\r\n  fee_recipient: '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000003'\r\n\r\n# used for indices not present in fee_recipients\r\ndefault_fee_recipient: \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000003\"\r\ndefault_proposer_url: \"http://local-besu\"\r\n```\r\nI can create a different ticket if you wish.

    "body": "As per out of band discussions, the extensibility of the structure is a good suggestion.\r\n\r\nFor the moment i would leave `proposer_url` (which could be `block_producer_url`) once the proposer\\builder separation will be implemented.\r\n\r\nWrt URL support, we already have a transparent system for loading file locally or remotely via URL but ATM the file have to be a yaml file in both cases. I'm more lean to have the same param supporting local file or an URL.\r\nSo the current `--validators-suggested-fee-recipient-address` can become `--validators-suggested-default-fee-recipient-address` and `--validators-suggested-fee-recipient-address` can become a more general `--validators-proposer-information` that can hold a local file or an URL.\r\n\r\nso to summarise: \r\n- `--validators-proposer-information` will support local or remote (URL) data. initially only `yaml` format with a structure similar to:\r\n```yaml\r\n# file will be periodically read by teku, no restart will be required\r\n\r\n# validator public key -> fee recipient ethereum address + future params\r\n'0x12345...12345':\r\n  suggested_fee_recipient: '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001'\r\n'0x12345...00001':\r\n  suggested_fee_recipient: '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000003'\r\n\r\n# default values used for validators not present in previous list\r\nsuggested_fee_recipient: \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000004\"\r\n```\r\n- for each param in the file we have a corresponding CLI arg that will play the same role of yaml default values. In our case we will have `--validators-suggested-fee-recipient-address`.\r\n- `--validators-proposer-information` and `--validators-<param>` will be mutually exclusive.\r\n- `--validators-proposer-information-refresh-frequency` (optional) will allow specify the polling frequency (0 = disabled)\r\n\r\n@joaocenoura WDYT?\r\n\r\ncc: @ajsutton \r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Sounds good :+1: that would meet our requirements as well.\r\n\r\nMinor note on the yaml requirement: we already have a rest service that teku validators use to pull configuration from. As of now, we only use `--validators-external-signer-public-keys` which will consume a json list from our rest service. But the new endpoint will require yaml. It would be desirable from our perspective (teku user) to deal with a single format. Still, if you guys need to go for yaml its ok on our end - just set the `Accepts` HTTP header accordingly. Later if you guys see value in supporting json you can provide a flag like  `--validators-proposer-information-format=json/yaml` and flip the `Accepts` header accordingly.\r\n\r\n",
