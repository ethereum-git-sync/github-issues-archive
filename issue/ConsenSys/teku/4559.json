  "body": "### Description\nAdd support for removing keys from the validator client.  This is intended to be the internal API that will be exposed via the REST API.\n\nThe method must guarantee that all signing has been stopped for the specified keys before returning. This will require two parts, first remove the validator from the `OwnedValidators` instance so we stop scheduling new duties for it etc, then disable the `Signer` used for that validator to ensure that any already scheduled or in-flight duties do not sign anything further.\n\nI think disabling the signer will require using introducing a new `Signer` implementation, `DeletableSigner` which acts as a delegating wrapper similar to `SlashingProtectedSigner`. The `DeletableSigner` wrapper would always be the first check (ie when slashing protection is enabled it delegates to `SlashingProtectedSigner` so the deleted check happens before slashing protection checks).  `DeletableSigner` would use a read/write lock and `deleted` flag to disable signing in a thread safe way on deletion. A read lock must be held for the entire duration of any signing operation - acquire the read lock, check `!deleted`, perform signing and release read lock only when the signing `SafeFuture` completes.\n\nThe write lock must be held when disabling the key. Take the write lock, then set `deleted = true` and release the write lock.  Since read locks cannot be held concurrently with a write lock, this ensures that all signing activity stops before the `deleted` flag can be set and then any signing request after than will be rejected because `deleted` is already true.\n\n\nWe could consider only holding a read lock for slashable signing activity (blocks and attestations).\n\nWe should not use `DeletableSigner` when the key management api is not enabled (we want to ensure the feature is completely toggled off).",
