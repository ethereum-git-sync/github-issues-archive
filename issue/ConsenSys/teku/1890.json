  "body": "When our head block is more than `PendingPool.DEFAULT_HISTORICAL_SLOT_TOLERANCE` (10 epochs) behind the block we receive from gossip, the `FetchRecentBlocksService `continually requests the parent block for gossiped blocks only for the `PendingPool `to discard them as too old.\n\nNeed to think about this - potentially we should just request the stream of blocks required when the parent is discovered to be more than some distance from our head block. This might be covered by BC-374 ensuring sync starts up but need to ensure we additionally consider if we can stop `FetchRecentBlocksService `from wasting bandwidth.\n\n",
