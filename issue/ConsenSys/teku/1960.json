Since v1 and v2 are no longer supported, we should probably reset the remaining version (v3) to “1.0” or “1”.\n\nWhile we're at it, we should rework version persistence so that:\n\n[db.version](https://github.com/PegaSysEng/teku/blob/24030e8271281e3206af900f7cba64ed079dc607/storage/src/main/java/tech/pegasys/artemis/storage/server/VersionedDatabaseFactory.java#L33) becomes db.metadata\n\nwe store structured data in db.metadata to make this file more future-proof (at some point we may want to store db migration status info here, for example).\n\n",
