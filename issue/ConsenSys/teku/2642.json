Using various validators benefits the network more.\r\n\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n*N/A\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce (Bug)\r\n1. I booted teku with the the flags shown in the attached log file and no database or log files.\r\n2. I let it synchronise with the network up until headslot 83460.\r\n3. It won't synch past headslot 83460. Left it for over an hour but no luck.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** Teku to continue synchronising the headslot until the latest so it can start validating.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** Stops at headslot 83460.\r\n\r\n**Frequency:** 100% in my case.\r\n\r\n### Versions (Add all that apply)\r\n* Software version: [`teku --0.12.3`]\r\n* Java version: [`java -14`]\r\n* OS Name & Version: [`Windows 10 | Build 19041.450 | Version 2004`]\r\n\r\n\r\n[teku.log](https://github.com/PegaSysEng/teku/files/5114655/teku.log)\r\n",

    "body": "Doing some syncs to attempt to reproduce this now.  When we've seen similar behaviour in the past the sync was actually continuing but the head block wasn't being updated as we skip updating the fork choice data while syncing finalised slots since there should only be one chain to follow.  However, it is possible to get blocks from the wrong chain which would result in a fork being imported and then Teku switching back to the right chain to continue importing.  Because the fork choice data isn't being filled out though, we won't actually update the head block until we get to or close to chain head making it look like it's stuck.\n\nI'm also looking into whether we can efficiently update those fork choice structures during a sync to avoid the problem entirely.",

    "body": "I got a log privately from @mcdee. Copying comment from Discord so we have a more permanent record:\r\n\r\nSo the node appears to be making progress in a way but is in the long period of non-finalization on Medalla.  It looks like at some point it sync'd up to block 83460 and then for some reason got interrupted with its sync.  In the log you sent it's then started again back at the finalized checkpoint and is gradually following a new peer's chain back up but hasn't reached where it was up to yet.  The Teku version seems to be quite out of date (`teku/v0.12.4-dev-df300e3b`) so it doesn't include most of the fixes for dealing with the Medalla incident, in particular we now try to find a closer common ancestor to restart sync from which should get it making visible process much faster.\r\nThe key logs I'm looking at are from the `PeerSync` class:\r\n```\r\n2020-09-03 21:38:48.036+00:00 | beaconchain-async-5 | DEBUG | PeerSync | Request 200 blocks starting at 81363 from peer 16Uiu2HAmS3GGdznKQ6TYfnCW2q5LuKpmsHFq35BQu3fDM5fXXPNy\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich show what blocks it's actually requesting.",
