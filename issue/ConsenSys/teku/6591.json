With the new ability to re-generate historic states after a checkpoint sync, we should provide a backfill mode that is focussed on downloading blocks as fast as possible, so that the forward generation of states can begin.\n\nWorth considering approaches that use things like era files as part of this, depending on complexity of that vs how to download from peers more quickly.",
