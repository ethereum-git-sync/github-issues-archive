Without that change we weren't actually waiting for the database to shutdown cleanly, but we still shouldn't lose blocks even if there's a non-clean shutdown.\n\nThe transaction to record finalized blocks is committed prior to even starting the transaction to prune them from the hot database so not sure how this would happen other than RocksDB losing the finalized transaction entirely but managing to keep the later hot db prune transaction.",

    "body": "The only thing I can see that could happen here is that the archive database lost a transaction which had been committed and the hot database managed to keep its transaction even though it occurred entirely after the first commit.  That's pretty unexpected but not impossible.\n\nIt does strongly suggest that with the move we're likely to do to leveldb we should use the combined database so archive and hot data is in a single database and this problem is avoided.  Unfortunately RocksDB's memory usage explodes when we try to use a combined db with it so a fix will be dependent on moving to leveldb.\n\nGoing to close this out as I don't believe there's anything more we can do on it and leveldb migration has its own stream of tickets.",
