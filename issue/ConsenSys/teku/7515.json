At this rate it will take more than a year to reconstruct all states. While I said I'm in no hurry, this was not what I was expecting ðŸ˜„ I was thinking it would take maybe a few weeks to reconstruct?\n\nIf I remember correctly this machine was able to process 5-10 slots per second during syncing when I stopped it briefly - 25x as fast. It's an 8th i5 CPU with plenty of available RAM. Is there anything I can do to speed up the reconstruction? Would increasing heap space help? This rate is unexpectedly slow, right?\n```\n\nand they got:\n```\nSearching for finalized states in the finalized store\n0\n8192\n7288512\n7296704\n7304896\n7313088\n7321280\n```\n\nmy thoughts:\nin historic states... especially our older blocks would be fast to do so that should be further along i'd have thought.\n\nIt's also fairly difficult to measure progress, we had to stop and dump a column index...",
