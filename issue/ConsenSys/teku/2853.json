    "body": "Fetch by slot won't currently work for orphaned blocks, is that functionality that you need?\n\nHistorical block fetching is only canonical, I'm not sure it'd be easy to sync non canonical slots through that process currently.\n\nIf the block was gossiped to the node, the node would then see it's non canonical during finalization and store it as a non canonical block... I've seen it working on current blocks, but nothing currently pushes non canonical blocks around as far as I'm aware. I added a debug for this, because its fairly rare on mainnet to even see a non canonical block ( a few a day)\n\nSo basically while the orphaned block is in non finalized state, it comes from hot storage (used to do that) and would be fetchable by slot or by root, because it's heavily indexed. Without the dev flag, it will be deleted during the move of data to finalized storage.\n\nWith the new flag, It will get stored and indexed by root, so retrieval by block root is cheap. Retrieval by slot hasn't currently been added, theres options but neither are great, I might actually need a separate endpoint that does a full scan on the new column.",

Is there some other way in which these could be found?\r\n\r\nSo the details depend a fair bit on use case.  Every block, canonical or not will be sent to the event stream which has the block hash.  But I suspect if you can catch the block hash from there then you'd get it before the slot was finalised and you'd have always been able to get it.\r\n\r\nIf the node is offline when the block is published it will probably never get it and definitely won't ever get it if it hasn't heard about it by the time the slot is finalized.\r\n\r\nSo I'm guessing that you're thinking in terms of something like having a node that's been consistently online but then something like chaind has just restarted and is backfilling data for certain epochs.  In that case yeah you'd probably have to walk through each slot between the last block you have and the current chain head requesting canonical and non-canonical at each slot.\r\n\r\nThe other option would be to request based on the parent_root which oddly the standard API does support (though Teku's never implemented it because it seems weird). In that case you'd have to get each canonical block and then use it's hash as the parent_root to see if it has any non-canonical descendants and follow each chain you find.  Get by slot probably makes more sense.\r\n\r\nWe'll have to add a teku specific API to be able to get non-canonical blocks by slot and add another column to the db to index them appropriately.  The standard API can only return one block for each slot so can't be used for non-canonical blocks.  Most of the time non-canonical blocks are just orphans but they can be completely different forks and so you wind up with multiple blocks at the same slot.",
