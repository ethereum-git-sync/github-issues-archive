I can calculate active gwei just by checking active validators at an epoch, so that's fine. I can do that for any epoch, but the attesting values are close to not usable.\n\nTo do this properly calculations will have to be made and stored, so that they can be later retrieved.  The current epoch values can probably be done on the fly, but after the epoch is done these values 'disappear', so all previous epoch stats really need to be cached.\n\nI've committed where i'm up to on a local branch, but I'm not sure there's enough value in what's there now (active gwei, previous epoch attestations) to actually merge... I'll wait to see what @arash009 decides before proceeding.",
