In the next call, the same behaviour will be observed (even though we could already have concluded from the first attempt that there is a \"better\" alternative).\r\nIn this case there is not enough logs to investigate this behaviour too (See point 2). The errors are reported as metrics without printing any logs.\r\n\r\nThe following improvements could be implemented:\r\n\r\n1. Prefer non optimistic nodes: The readiness check could prioritise non optimistic nodes over optimistic ones. The order of preference would be: non optimistic and in sync -> non optimistic and in sync -> not in sync\r\n2.
