    "body": "While Geth is syncing, it returns 0 as the chain ID because the concept of chain ID was only added after the dao fork.  Teku is trying to check that you're Eth1 node is connected to the right chain (ie MainNet and not GÃ¶rli) so is asking for that chain ID and it doesn't match what we expect.\r\n\r\nOnce Geth has finished syncing the errors will stop.  Note that geth is still syncing as long as it's importing state entries, even if it reports that it has blocks up to near chain head.  Sadly it's not possible to know how much longer a fast sync will take because of the way the protocol works but 1-3 days is normal.\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this issue just to keep things tidy.  We're around in the ConsenSys Discord #teku channel as well which is usually a faster way to get answers to questions: https://discord.gg/7hPv2T6",
