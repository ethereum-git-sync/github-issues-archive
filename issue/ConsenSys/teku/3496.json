  "body": "### Description\r\nAs a staking service provider, I want Teku to be able to make late attestations when it finishes, or is close to finishing, syncing so that I can minimise revenue loss due to downtime. \"Late\" means any attestations that were due within the last 32 slots.\r\n\r\nThese attestations will receive a small penalty for being late, and will have lower chance of inclusion. But more chance than if they are not made at all.\r\n\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n* When starting Teku with validators, it makes historically due attestations up to 32 slots before the current head slot.\r\n* No incidence of slashing due to this functionality!\r\n",
