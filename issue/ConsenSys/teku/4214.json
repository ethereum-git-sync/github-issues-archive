I manually renamed the folders (beacon -> beacon.old and beacon.new -> beacon) and all is now well.\n\nWindows is a bit picky about what you can do with open files and folders. It was probably thinking that beacon was still in use by the process and thus refused to rename it. I don't know how to fix that - maybe the DB wasn't fully closed.",
