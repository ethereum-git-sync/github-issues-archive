    "body": "Unfortunately Dirk uses a different remote signing API to Teku and eth2signer so it doesn't currently work with Teku.  We would definitely be open to supporting Dirk but it isn't currently something we're able to work on.  We'd definitely be happy to accept contributions and help anyone who was interested in developing that support though.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the commands use to configure external signers, these will necessarily differ between clients because each client takes a different approach to how they manage keys and do configuration.  That said, if ETH2 in general can standardise on an API for external signers then the differences in how to configure clients shouldn't be a significant barrier for users to switch clients.  Just at the moment each signer seems to expose a different API which makes it very hard for clients to support them all.\r\n\r\nI've logged https://github.com/PegaSysEng/teku/issues/2681 to track the request to support Dirk. As I said, it's not something we'll be able to work on immediately but good to have a record that it's a desirable thing to have.\r\n\r\nI'll close this ticket for now, if you have any follow up questions our Discord is probably the best place to ask: https://discord.gg/7hPv2T6",
