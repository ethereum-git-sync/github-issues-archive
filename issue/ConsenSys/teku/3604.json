That's the last slot which affects scheduling for epoch 19903.\r\n\r\n\r\nSimilarly the last slot of epoch 19903 was originally empty\r\n```\r\nSlot Event  *** Slot: 636927, Block:    ... empty, Epoch: 19903, Finalized checkpoint: 19901, Finalized root: 559868..0f40, Peers: 74\r\n```\r\nbut then the block was included https://pyrmont.beaconcha.in/block/636927 and that's the last slot that would affect duties for epoch 19905.\r\n\r\n",
