It's a known issue that should be fixed both by https://github.com/ethereum/hive/pull/641 and https://github.com/ConsenSys/teku/pull/6139 which are merged already . Previously the reason of failure was that first block was gossiped before peers meet each other in network, so it was lost. Both PRs addressed connectivity issues, but looks like it's still a problem\r\n\r\n```\r\nbeacon 0: failed to retrieve block: Error(404): Not found\r\n```\r\nCheck https://hivetests2.ethdevops.io/ for logs and test results\r\nThis issue was detached from #5934 ",
