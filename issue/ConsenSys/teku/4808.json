    "body": "This isn't new but something seems to have changed the timings so it's much more likely now.  The issue is that to look up validator duties we need to convert the public keys we have to validator indices.  That's done by `ValidatorIndexProvider` which makes its first attempt to load indices when the validator client starts up and then triggers loading for any unknown validator indices at the start of each epoch.\n\nThe problem is, if the beacon node isn't ready to respond at startup, all validator indices remain unknown until the start of the next epoch when it tries to load again.  It needs to retry the request on failure after a short delay, rather than waiting for the next epoch.",
