Until we have agreed on a broadly trustless model across relevant stakeholders, there's not much to say. Tbh, it's going to be a while - weak subjectivity doesn't really become an issue until after withdrawals are enabled, and not all clients support the checkpoint start in any case yet.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, we would encourage people to use Infura to get the checkpoints for Teku. They are properly set up for this already and actually run Teku behind the scenes.\r\n\r\nSo I'd rather close this one here, if you don't mind.",
