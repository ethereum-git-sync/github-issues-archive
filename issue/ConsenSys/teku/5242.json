  "body": "### Description\r\nImprove performance of reapplying blocks by skipping the check that the resulting state root matches the root in the block. This would have been checked when initially importing the block so we know it is correct. Skipping this check should enable us to avoid calculating the root for the state which can be quite expensive. Since most uses of states wind up accessing the state root, the initial benefit here will be when multiple blocks need to be replayed to generate a state - we should not need to calculate the root for the intermediate states.\r\n\r\nA further optimisation would be to have the resulting `BeaconState` take it's state root from the value in the block so that it doesn't need to calculate it even if something later needs to access it.",
