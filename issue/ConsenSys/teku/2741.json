  "body": "### Description\nCurrently all the options to run an external validator are `--X`.  We need to decide what the right names for those options are and unhide them.  Should test it works reliably first too.\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n* Test external validator is reliable and effective. Probably need to deploy to one of our Medalla validator nodes for a while\n* Move slashing protection out of the data directory (probably needs to be its own config option).  Need to handle migration.\n* Decide on final naming for CLI args and rename them",
