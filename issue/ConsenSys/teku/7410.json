    "body": "Thanks for raising.\n\nI think that metric is specifically relating to when the process of creating a specific duty failed...\n\nAre you looking for something like the Attestation performance data to be available via metrics, where you'd be able to see included count etc?\n\n#7382 should be somewhat unrelated to that 'failed', but I haven't looked closely. It sounds very much like the process we go through to determine if a validator is due to aggregate, which we need to sign a message to be able to determine due to how the process was designed...\nThe gap in that ticket (heavy assumption) is likely that we're signing for all keys we've loaded, rather than just actual active keys, because we're less aware than we could be about the state of the key we've been given...",
