  "body": "### Description\nAs part of an earlier optimisation `LimitedMap` was changed to use `SynchronizedLimitedMap` instead of guava `Cache`. While this map is thread safe for atomic operations like get/put, it is not support thread safe iteration (including via `.stream()`.\n\nWe need to audit the code to check if there are cases where we are iterating and fix. Potentially should default to the fully thread safe Cache and provide an option to use the synchronised version only when it is safe and has performance benefits.",
