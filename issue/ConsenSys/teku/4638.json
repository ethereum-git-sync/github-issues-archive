    "body": "Some comments:\r\n  - When using log files, by default Teku rotates them daily, with the date in the filename, so adding a date to each line would be redundant.\r\n  - Many node operators run Teku under _systemctl_, in which case _journalctl_ can be used to view and select lines by date very flexibly. Others will send log lines to a logging server that will also do its own date stamps.\r\n  - Custom logging is available via [log4J2 configurations](https://docs.teku.consensys.net/en/latest/HowTo/Monitor/Logging/#advanced-custom-logging) - the example in the docs shows how to prepend the date to a log line.\r\n\r\nI am not a huge fan of adding dates to every log line by default. If we were to, maybe it should be toggled by a command line option.",
