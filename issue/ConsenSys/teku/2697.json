Propagating inbound attestations via 'flood publish' can unnecessarily result in excessive network load if enabled on all clients. \r\nThere is currently no way to publish a separate Gossip message with either 'flood publish' or without it",

    "body": "Seems like I messed things: \r\n\r\n\r\nNashatyrev:\r\n>Hey channel! \r\nGossip 1.1 has flood publish option which is handy to push own validator attestations and blocks for better propagation time. \r\nHowever inbound attestations are not propagated via regular Gossip mechanism but aggregated and also published as outbound. The flood publish option though can only be enabled globally and there is no ways to publish some messages with 'flood' option and some messages without 'flood' option\r\nCurious if anyone already hit this limitation and rise any issue/discussion for Libp2p?\r\n\r\ndjrtwo:\r\n>>    However inbound attestations are not propagated via regular Gossip mechanism but aggregated and also published as outbound.\r\n\r\n> I'm not sure I understand here\r\nnon-aggregated attestations are gossiped in their non-aggregated form through the attestation subnets\r\naggregated attestations are then published (and gossiped) on a separate aggregate channel\r\nI think the \"flood publish\" should be fine for both of these\r\n\r\nNashatyrev:\r\n> Oh, right. Seems like I've lost the track on this topic at some point\r\n\r\ndjrtwo:\r\n> all good! \r\nI was just looking at the flood publish option the other day. I think in general that we should use it across the board on our topics\r\n\r\nNashatyrev:\r\n> Yes, we were discussing this option in Teku team. For some reason I thought that non-aggregated attestations are not propagated immediately by peers (right after validation) and the 'flood publish' option needs to be adjusted. But it looks now like good thing to go.\r\n",
