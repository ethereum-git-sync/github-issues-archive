  "body": "The BLST library is currently compiled with the `portable` flag set which avoids using some CPU instructions which aren't available on older CPUs (see https://github.com/supranational/blst#build).  Ideally we'd include both the portable and optimised versions in Teku and then select the appropriate version to actually load based on the current CPU.\r\n\r\nWe'd need to work out how to identify which CPUs require the portable version and adjust the way the BLST library is loaded to select from multiple versions.  This may require changes to both the BLST java bindings and the jblst project we use to compile and package blst (https://github.com/ConsenSys/jblst)",
