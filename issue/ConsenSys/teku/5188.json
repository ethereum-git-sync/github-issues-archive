  "body": "### Description\nTo improve diagnostics and aim in performance improvements, we need to establish a way to report key timings for the block import process.  This includes:\n\n* How long after slot start the block is received\n* How long between then and ForkChoice.onBlock first being called\n* How long it takes to retrieve the parent state\n* How long it takes to create the block post state\n* How long it takes to actually import the block (ForkChoice.importBlockAndState)\n* How long it takes for the transaction to commit\n\nThe aim is to get a view of what takes time for block import (in a real node).  We need to ensure that capturing the timings is extremely lightweight so it doesn't affect performance.\n\nReporting this data is challenging - metrics are only sampled periodically so while a gauge showing timings for the last imported block may be useful, it can also miss information between samples being taken. A histogram shows the average well but tends to hide outliers and doesn't show time periods were performance is unusually slow. Logging the data for every block is too noisy.\n\nI'd suggest:\n\n 1. Add a gauge to show timings for the last imported block (a labelled gauge with a label for each step and the value being the number of millis into the slot when that step was completed).\n 2. If a block completes importing more than 4s into a slot (and the node is not in syncing mode), log a warning including the full timing details.",
