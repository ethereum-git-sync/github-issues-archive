  "body": "Teku won't add empty Eth1 blocks to `Eth1DataCache` unless a block with deposits has been processed.\r\n\r\nIt became common thing to seed genesis beacon state with validators. This approach doesn't require any deposits to launch the beacon chain and is pretty handy for dev and test networks.\r\n\r\nRecent work on the Merge transition process showed an inconvenience of Eth1 data voting not starting until the first deposit occurs in the system. As transition process is heavily depends on `Eth1Data` held by the beacon state it would only possible to work by making at least one deposit after the beacon chain launch.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if `Eth1DataCache` wouldn't expect deposits at all before start caching Eth1 blocks hence providing smooth Eth1 data voting.\r\n\r\n",
