  "body": "As a rest api consumer,\nI want to be able to retrieve /beacon/state by slot,\nSo that I can have al alternative to just fetching state by root.\n\nThis is provided by other implementations (eg. lighthouse)\n\nFrom Adrian after referencing `client.getStore().getBlockState(root32);`\n\n> Youâ€™d want to add  getStateAtSlot and getStateByRoot methods to both CombinedChainDataClient and HistoricalChainData.  The HistoricalChainData will have to follow the pattern of using AsyncEventTracker  since storage is separated and all communication goes via the event bus.\n\nIt sounds like I'll also want to provide a similar mechanism for fetching by root, so that it's possible to fetch finalized slots by root.",
