  "body": "### Description\r\nAs part of #3394, we should further integrate the new `SpecConstants` object into the codebase.  To inform us of patterns etc, we need to work `SpecConstants` into more places to see how it shakes out.\r\n\r\nA good place to start may be `CommitteeUtil`.  Initial thoughts are that we will likely end up with something like `spec.getCommitteeUtil()`, which would provide instance-based helper methods (as opposed to the static methods we currently have defined).  \r\n\r\nIn general we want to get an idea of:\r\n* How `SpecProvider`, `Spec`, `SpecConstants`, etc are passed through the codebase\r\n* How logic from the `core` package should be integrated into `Spec`\r\n* More details on the migration path as it relates to `core` logic:  how do we break up the work into reasonable chunks?\r\n",
