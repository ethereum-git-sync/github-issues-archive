  "body": "Public keys and signatures are points on elliptic curves that are supposed to belong to a certain subgroup of the curve. It is essential that a group membership test is performed on any public keys or signatures we use, before they are aggregated or verified. However, this group membership test is very expensive: we need to ensure that it is performed exactly once for each key/signature we process.\r\n\r\nOur two implementations take different approaches to this currently, neither of which is ideal:\r\n  - Mikuli performs the group membership test when a key/signature is deserialised. This may result in the check being done on keys or signatures that we never actually end up processing.\r\n  - Blst performs the group membership test when keys/signatures are aggregated or verified. This may result in group membership checks being performed multiple times for the same key.\r\n\r\nProposal: check group membership for public keys and signatures at the point at which they are used and cache the result of the operation to ensure that the check is performed exactly once for each key/signature that we actually use.\r\n\r\nTodo: check whether we cache the deserialisation of both public keys and signatures effectively.",
