I've noticed that this endpoint works less than 50% of the time, often timing out before returning any results. The more recent the stateroot I try, the worse the performance. Has anyone else encountered this? What would be some potential causes. My node is fully managed by an institutional grade service and sees no issues with other RPC endpoints. Are there any other implementations of the beacon chain client that have this endpoint? I know lighthouse has yet to integrate it yet.",
