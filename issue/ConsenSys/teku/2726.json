  "body": "### Description\nConsider limiting the maximum number of slots that can be skipped when importing a block.  Currently this is bounded by the number of non-finalised slots - the block parent can't be before the finalized block and the block slot can't be in the future or we'd delay processing.\n\nThe risk is that this can cause consensus failure as there is nothing in the spec that limits the number of slots that can be skipped.\n\nSince the aim is to avoid DOS attacks, the other possibility is to allow importing blocks with large gaps but generate and cache the state periodically through the empty slots if the gap is large.  Then if there are many blocks all building on the finalized slot, we won't reprocess large numbers of slots repeatedly but can start from a previously cached state closer to the target slot.",
