  "body": "### Description\nPrepare for the Medalla testnet launch.\n\n#### Pre-Genesis\n\n - [x] Update to spec version 0.12.2\n - [x] Add network definition to Teku (constants, deposit contract address)\n - [x] Agree on bootnodes for the network\n - [x] Add bootnodes to network definition\n - [x] Spin up any bootnodes to be run by Team-Teku\n - [x] Publish Team-Teku bootnodes in the network data repo (https://github.com/goerli/medalla/)\n - [x] Add documentation for users to connect to the network with Teku and register validators\n    - Ideally for Medalla this would utilise LaunchPad instead of Teku's deposit subcommands. Would need a LaunchPad instance to be available.\n - [x] Send Team-Teku validator deposits\n - [x] Spin up Team-Teku nodes\n - [ ] Switch default network to new testnet (Note: not going to do this until we have better checks in place that an existing database matches the selected network - otherwise nodes may start using Altona databases with Medalla)\n\n#### Post-Genesis\n\n - [x] Add genesis state to Teku\n - [x] Confirm bootnodes are working\n - [ ] Perform release prior to network starting\n",
