  "body": "### Description\n`AsyncRunnerEventThread` provides an event thread where each \"event\" (or task) is executed on a single thread.  It's vital that the single event thread is not blocked and we should limit what runs on it to just the actual events.\n\nCurrently though, when an event returns a value, it's done via a SafeFuture which is completed on the event thread. This means that any chained handlers (e.g via `.thenApply`) are also executed on the event thread even though they won't be designed to avoid blocking.\n\nWe should modify `AsyncRunnerEventThread` to ensure that any returned futures trigger handlers in a separate thread pool.  This would likely be something similar to how `AsyncEventDeliverer` ensures `EventChannel` responses are delivered in a specific thread pool (via the `AsyncRunner responseRunner` it's passed).",
