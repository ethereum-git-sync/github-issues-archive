  "body": "We want to discover what will happen in this scenario, as it has caused problems with some clients. \n\n - When in bellatrix, add a bls_to_execution change signed for bellatrix\n - transition to capella\n - build a block\n\nEXPECT: \n - bellatrix operation isn't in capella block, \n - block gets built, \n - bellatrix operation is not in the operation pool. (it's no longer a valid operation)\n\nOne possible solution if we do have issues would be to reject any POST's to bls_to_execution_change prior to capella.\n\nThis is good validation for checking signature validity as building a block potentially.\n\nNote this could happen any fork transition, a message in an old fork is still in the operation pool, so it's possible we're handling it in code now.",
