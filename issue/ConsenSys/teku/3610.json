    "body": "It's possible to add a count of specific statuses, at the moment less easy to do because of how gauges work, so still considering that.\r\nRegarding the status of specific sets of validators, there's also an api: `/eth/v1/beacon/states/{state_id}/validators` which allows an array of validator indexes or keys... I think that's how most people tend to check the status of specific keys...\r\nI'll keep adding the non 'labelled gauge' metrics initially, as they can be done without updating the library we're using, where as the labelled gauge concept is something that would require a bit of lower level work before they're going to be very practical.",
