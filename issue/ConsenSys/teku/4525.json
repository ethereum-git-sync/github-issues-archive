  "body": "### Description\nAdd support for the local key manager REST APIs. Will require introducing a new REST API endpoint for the validator client. That should be separate to the beacon node REST API endpoint even when running in a single process as they have different security requirements.  Should also have independent controls for enabling/disabling, ports, listen address, host whitelist etc.\n\nSee https://github.com/ethereum/beacon-APIs/pull/151 for current spec.  We should prioritise work so that we identify any parts of the API design which are problematic for Teku so we can provide that feedback ASAP.",
