We store the previous roots, because we _are_ allowed to re-sign/re-broadcast the same block/attestation if we wish.\r\n\r\nWe should also make these values (maybe excluding the hashes) exportable/importable so that we can safely move keys between validator processes potentially on different hardware.",

I could see some benefit in creating Cli options to specify  values and have it create the file automatically (though the syntax would be awkward) or have a subcommand to import slashing protection which copies over files and picks the higher value if there are some overlapping validators.\n\nI'm not sure either of those are actually worth it at the moment though.
