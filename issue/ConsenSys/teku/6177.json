We are requesting an update to your client on how you identify Lodestar nodes for better tracking and referencing of Lodestar peers on the network for debug purposes. We will not implement until it has been completed between all the various clients on the network.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce (Bug)\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Versions (Add all that apply)\r\nN/A",
