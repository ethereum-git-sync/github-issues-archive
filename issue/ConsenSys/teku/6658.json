    "body": "Some preliminary observations from the logs.\r\n\r\n - Your block for slot 5501765 should have been published at 15:13:23 (or within 1 or 2 seconds after that).\r\n - According to your Teku logs, builder bids were received at 15:13:30, and the execution payload at 15:13:36.\r\n - Assuming that Teku published the block immediately then it is already 13s late.\r\n - This is confirmed by my node, which received your block 14.2 seconds late.\r\n - As a result of its lateness, it was reorged out (orphaned). My node initially made your block its head, but received 5501766 only 1.3 seconds after it which built on 5501764 (since its proposer had not seen your block). Therefore your block was orphaned. This is the reorg you see in Teku's log: your block is `449b9d74...`, but it gets superseded by `093503e8...`\r\n\r\n> We suspect that the problem is due to the fact that the block was generated during a chain reorganization.\r\n\r\nAs above, I think its lateness actually caused the reorg.\r\n\r\nNote that the Lighthouse logs have `Jan 04 15:13:38.549 INFO Successfully published block            slot: 5501765`, which is  0.8s _after_ my node saw the block, so there looks to be some delay in LH's logging. But I'm pretty sure this is not the root cause, since the publishing window is long-gone by this point. LH's attestations are mostly being signed on time, though there looks to be a delay dealing with one of them (at 15:13:30.768) which might indicate performance trouble.\r\n\r\nAlso, I don't know what this LH message means, `Jan 04 15:13:19.481 ERRO Unable to publish proposer preparation to all beacon nodes`. And again at `Jan 04 15:13:35.311`, just ahead of the successful publishing. It's worth investigating as there's a chance it's related\r\n\r\nSo, the question is, why did your node publish the block so late? Looking at the MEV logs, they only start receiving bids at 15:13:30, which is already 7s after the start of the slot, and `getPayload` is not called until 6s later, together accounting for the 13s lateness in publishing of the block.\r\n\r\nIn short:\r\n\r\n - MEV boost should have been receiving quotes from the relays much sooner. Are there any lines before the ones in _mev-04012023.log_, specifically from 15:13:20 onwards?\r\n - And it should have received the payload much sooner too. Was there a short network outage or degradation at the time? How was the CPU load on the MEV boost machine?",

    "body": "My observation from the logs:\r\n\r\n- I don't see issues with mev-boost. CL asked for a bid and received it quick enough. Same goes for the execution payload.\r\n- There is 6s delay between receiving the bid and asking for the execution payload. In the middle of it, there is `Completed regeneration of block...` log message which could be related to the delay.\r\n- I am not sure whether the 7s delay between start of the slot and asking the builder for a bid is coming from Teku or the VC since there is no log of when VC requested Teku for a block. Will check Teku if `Completed regeneration of block...` could be related to this delay as well.\r\n- I am concerned about this timeout log against the Teku BN: `Jan 04 15:13:19.481 ERRO Unable to publish proposer preparation to all beacon nodes`. It is possible there were some network problems at the time, which could explain the initial delay maybe.",

In those cases the pubkey wolud be register in several CL.\r\nNote Web3signer avoid slashing situations. So in this particular case, we can see in VC logs a connection problem between VC and the primary CL and the backup CL, so the same pubkey was registered in almost two CLs, the primary and the second backup CL. \r\n\r\nRegarding this particular problem, with mev-boost working fine, machine resources at good state,  and with the evidence evidence of a one-time network problem (VC logs), it may not be possible to avoid the missed proposal, since it was initiated when the network problem occurred.\r\n\r\n@StefanBratanov  I will try to add to this thread to Lighthouse team, perhaps they can add more information about` Jan 04 15:13:19.481 ERRO Unable to publish proposer preparation to all beacon nodes`\r\n",

We only have the VC logs for when block production is *finished*. Historically we've used the BN HTTP server logs to determine when the VC first requested a block, so our VC logs are lacking in this area. Perhaps Teku has some logging of incoming HTTP requests? It's not useful for this scenario, but it may be prudent for Lighthouse to add more logging in this area (issue: https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/issues/3853).\r\n\r\nGiven the relatively small amount of info in the Lighthouse VC logs, I don't think there's a whole lot more I can add here sorry. I'll leave it to the capable Teku team.",

It is possible these delays happened due to a garbage collection taking place at that time or other resource issue. The timeout 3 seconds before the slot time could indicate such issue as well. \r\n\r\nCouple of questions:\r\n- What heap space do you assign to Teku (-Xmx)? 5gb works well for our validators.\r\n- Since metrics are enabled, are you using the Teku dashboard by any chance? There is a GC time graph, which is useful and should be under 5% at all times (ideally under 2%)",

I just noticed also you are subscribing to all subnets, which could also affect performance slightly. We are running with 5GB heap space on nodes which subscribe to all subnets as well and don't see issues so it's worth a try to increase the value as you suggested and see how that affects the GC values.",

Maybe the problem was a punctual issue due to a GC spike at a very specific time.\r\n\r\nHi @PacoBits it does look better and I suspect that this was the issue. It can explain the JVM being blocked. In the meantime, I raised an issue to log the start of block production for Teku to help for future debugging.",
