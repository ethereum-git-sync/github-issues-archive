  "body": "### Description\r\nIt appears that Teku is including completely redundant attestations. Report from jgm in Teku discord:\r\n\r\n> Looking at attestation inclusion again: I'm comparing attestation 127 of slot 460066 with attestation 47 of slot 460053.  It appears that the later attestation is a strict subset of the earlier attestation.  460066 is a descendant of 460053.\r\n>\r\n>460066 was proposed by a teku beacon node, so it appears that teku may not be pruning its \"not yet included\" attestation list perfectly.  I'm sure this is not the simplest thing to try to track down, but would be interested in any thoughts on why this may be.\r\n\r\nThose blocks will be on Medalla.  Need to recheck that we are removing eclipsed attestations and aren't readding them somehow incorrectly during a reorg.",
