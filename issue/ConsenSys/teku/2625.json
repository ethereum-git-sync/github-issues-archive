  "body": "When a new checkpoint is finalized, we need to ensure we record the block and state of that newly finalized checkpoint as a starting point.  However, during normal running that state is often not needed and after a long period of non-finalisation may have been dropped from memory and need to be regenerated.\r\n\r\nWhen committing the transaction that updates the finalized state, the in memory store would take a write lock to prevent concurrent changes, calculate the final changes to persist, including potentially regenerating the newly finalized checkpoint and then write to disk and release the lock.  The regeneration however is asynchronous and may need to access the in-memory store which would result in a different thread doing the regeneration attempting to take the read lock but being blocked because the write lock was already held.  The write lock can't be released until the regeneration completes and so a deadlock occurs.\r\n\r\nAlso due to the write lock being held for so long, gossip processing is blocked attempting to get the read lock causing the p2p queues to back up and a lot of RejectedExecutionExceptions reported.",
