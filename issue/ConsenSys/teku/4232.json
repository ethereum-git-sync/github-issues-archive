  "body": "There's currently fairly limited metrics that can be used to show how a validator-client is performing.\n\nI created a validator dashboard, and added:\n - local validator count\n - published attestations, blocks, aggregations \n - scheduled blocks, attestations (eg. if you're about to get to propose a block, you might not want to restart)\n - current epoch (will be time based epoch calculated by validator client)\n - invalid events received on the event stream\n - event stream disconnections\n - cpu / mem/GC stats\n\nThere may be other stats that could be useful that I missed...\n\nIt'd be helpful to get some context of the beacon node to allow things such as\n - attestation effectiveness for validators I'm running\n - head slot of the beacon node (could sign up for head events and put a metric on that easily)\n - sync status of the beacon node\n\nI also wonder if it's worth having a grafana dashboard as a sample for validator clients.\n\nraised as a follow on of #4090\n",
