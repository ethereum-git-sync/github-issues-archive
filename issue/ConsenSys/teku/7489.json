    "body": "Thanks for raising.\nWe will have a look at the lighthouse interop with some of the constant values moving around in the spec recently, which will be the reason that teku couldn't read the spec from the BN.\n\nIn regards to the command to execute the exit, it's definitely possible, and very similar to where you got.\nBecause of the library we use for command processing, its a bit confusing, but `--network` is an option on the teku command, so the voluntary-exit ends up looking like:\n```\nteku --network goerli voluntary-exit \\\n--beacon-node-api-endpoint=<LIGHTHOUSE_BEACON_API_ENDPOINT> \\\n        --confirmation-enabled=false \\\n        --validator-keys=\"/root/vc/teku/validator_keys/<EXIT_VALIDATOR_KEYSTORE>:/root/vc/teku/validator_keys/<KEYSTORE_PASSWORD>\" \n```\n\nThis will then read the network configuration from the built-in package. \n\nHopefully this gets you going! We'll look at the constants that made this required, it's much less clunky when it can be read from the BN.",

    "body": "a couple of random notes.\nI'm changing to add --network option to the voluntary-exit command, so that you can manually specify --network when using voluntary exit, rather than using the beacon-endpoint.\n\nbehaviours:\n - if --config-file is specified on the parent command, and that has network set, this would flow down into the voluntary-exit command - and so would the keys, so if you do use this option, be careful as it would attempt to exit all the keys found in the configuration file. ` teku --config-file teku.yml voluntary-exit .......`\n - if you need to specify network, it will work as part of the voluntary-exit command, not outside the voluntary-exit command. This is because outside of voluntary exit we actually default this field to 'mainnet' so its unique behaviour to not default this field. `teku voluntary-exit --network mainnet .......`\n - without config-file or network explicitly set, we will continue to attempt to load from the beacon-api, which continues to default to http://localhost:5051, and obviously if that fails as described in ticket, we can't continue without intervention.\n\nIdeally most of the time the remote config loads, because this is the same config you're going to attempt to submit the exit against, so ideally we can leverage that to reduce scope for errors.\n\nI believe there's still more cleanup to do on this command, but i've at least extended it to allow network to be set. The complexity would come in if for some reason the local configuration wasn't in line with the BN configuration, but this should be unusual unless you're a dev.",
