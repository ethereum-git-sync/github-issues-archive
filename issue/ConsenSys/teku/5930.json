  "body": "A weird anti-pattern is that a new Teku installation defaults to syncing from Genesis although we strongly recommend against doing this and encourage people to use checkpoint sync instead.\r\n\r\nThis is really a conversation starter about how we might go about changing this. Easiest may be to simply to \"bake in\" a recent checkpoint with releases. In a sense this is what we do with the Genesis file, though post-genesis checkpoints are more controversial.  Alternatively, find a set of \"trusted\" state providers and point `--initial-state` to one of them, perhaps after verifying that they all agree. For the naive user, this get them up and running quickly, and as safely as syncing from Genesis; the sophisticated user can override this to choose their own provider.\r\n\r\nThere is a wider conversation going on about how to verify checkpoint states and we should be sure to work in concert with that as it evolves.",
