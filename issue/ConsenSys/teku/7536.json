  "body": "Moving forward, it's going to be important for us to be able to determine when a block arrived, which we don't currently have.\n\nCurrently in late block import messages, we do 'say' arrival, but its when we start processing.\n\nWe need to be able to get the gossip message timestamp when processing the actual libp2p message, and start reporting that in 'late block import'.\n\nThis new time would be the 'arrival', and the current value would be when we start processing. We may also wish to report the time it was validated, but thats not a 'requirement' per say.\n\nOnce we have this data point it will unblock us from implementing the reorg late block logic in fork choice.",
