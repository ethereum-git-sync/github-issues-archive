  "body": "### Description\nCurrently Teku sends all attestations individually as soon as they are ready.  The REST API however allows us to send multiple attestations in a single call.  We should investigate the benefits and trade offs of using this to send all attestations for a slot in a single call.\n\nOne possible advantage would be reducing risk of rate limiting when running a lot of validators against Infura. Possible downside is causing additional delay to sending attestations.\n\nNote we already batch sync committee signatures in this way.",
