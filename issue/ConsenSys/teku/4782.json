  "body": "### Description\nCurrently when calls to `executePayload` result in an error (ie connection refused, timeout etc) Teku treats it as a `SYNCING` response from the EL and moves to optimistic sync.  This causes Teku to switch into optimistic sync mode too often.\n\nInstead Teku should not import the beacon block if the EL is unavailable/errors and add it to a pending queue of blocks that have unknown validation status.  Periodically we should retry processing these blocks to see if the EL is available again. Note that this shouldn't be done for blocks the EL rejects as `INVALID` - they can be immediately discarded.\n\nTeku should only use optimistic sync when a `SYNCING` response is received from the EL.
