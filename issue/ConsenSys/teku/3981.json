    "body": "The complexity here is that the PoWChainService doesn't actually know the current slot (and is active prior to genesis so can't know the current slot).  It also isn't getting the latest eth1 canonical head and so the calculation around the number of blocks to keep in cache is including an estimate of the follow distance and so we do actually want to take the worst on top of the worst case.\n\nThis could be improved but would require quite significant changes to the way eth1 tracking is done. Given that it's worked well this far and all the eth1 tracking is going away in a clean up fork after the merge (since deposits can be included immediately and the two chains are merged), I'm going to leave this as-is and close this as won't fix.",
