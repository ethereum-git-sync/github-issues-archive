  "body": "**Description**\r\n\r\nWe're using Teku (21.6.1) in a Docker Swarm (20.10.7). We run Teku in two different settings. On is in chain-only mode and one is in validator-only mode (since the chain can be replicated and the validator can only run once). To make sure that the validator is always talking to a fully functioning chain, we perform a healthcheck, which we currently define in the docker compose file.\r\n\r\n```\r\nhealthcheck:\r\n    test: [\"CMD\", \"curl\", \"-f\", \"http://localhost:5051/eth/v1/node/health\"]\r\n    start_period: 10m\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Problem**\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this ends in an infinite starting loop of the chain container. We figured out that `curl` is not installed in the Teku docker image. After adding it to the image, it seems to work as expected.\r\n\r\n**Proposed solutions**\r\n\r\n* Add `curl` to the Teku docker image\r\n* (optionally) Include directly a healthcheck to the image\r\n",
