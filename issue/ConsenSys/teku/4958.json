Adding auth header to EL APIs\r\n\r\n(1) is fairly straight forward. For (2) I'm looking at the following design:\r\n1. Implementing a `TokenProvider` which takes care of the generation of the JWT token as per specs\r\n2. Implementing a wrapper for `TokenProvider` to make it thread safe by introducing a reentrant lock\r\n3. Adding an OkHttp client interceptor consuming an instance of the `SafeTokenProvider` to add the auth header to intercepted requests",

Might just be more of a tag team development effort than usual. That usually works well as long as we ensure we push up any work as a draft pr and merge things in as small steps as much as possible. \n\nYou're plan for how to approach it sounds good and getting the cli args added would be a great first pr. We'd make them --X options and mark them hidden for now like the other merge options until we're ready for official merge support. ",
