We use height from `Eth1Data` cache, but in some cases, especially when finalization is delayed for many epochs, this data will not be available from the cache.\r\n\r\nSo, if this data is not found in the cache, we should call EL client to get it and finalize tree when the response is received. This will add an extra complexity to the deposit tree finalization for the side feature. Plus, in active network, we shouldn't ever fall into this, it could be more common for test networks. \r\nOverall it looks like we could miss several `DepositTreeSnapshot` in test networks relying only on cache, but shouldn't have any issues in mainnet, so we may not need any improvements on this side.",
