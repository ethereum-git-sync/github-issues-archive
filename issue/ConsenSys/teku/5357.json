These will need to be split out to other tickets and thought through a bit more.\n\nThings to make it easier to map CL and EL blocks:\n* Tool to take a timestamp from an EL block and calculate the slot it was for.\n   * Then look up all blocks in that slot to find which one it actually came from (it might be a non-canonical block)\n* API to get just the execution root for a block\n* API to get just the execution payload for a block",
