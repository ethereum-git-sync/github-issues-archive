    "body": "From my research, there is no way to remove auto-generated sources snapshot from release (moreover it will be updated if you push something to the release assigned tag in the future), we could only control its comprehensiveness and exclude, say, test folders from sources with `.gitattributes` file and something like `tests/ export-ignore` inside. What we can do is to add binaries to the assets of release. My experiment shows that user assets will appear above auto-generated sources. It sounds like a best solution.\r\n\r\nHelpful links:\r\nDiscussions:\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/45240336/how-to-use-github-release-api-to-make-a-release-without-source-code\r\nhttps://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/366771/how-do-we-avoid-development-files-in-the-release\r\nGithub Release API:\r\nhttps://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/releases#create-a-release",
