    "body": "Thanks for raising, this does sound feasible, a lot of the APIs don't interact well when not in sync. We'll have a look and see if we can improve things on this front...\n\nAs an aside, it's 'safe' to submit voluntary exits more than once. Much like bls changes, there's no guarantees they make it through to a block (depends on a block producer seeing the message and retaining it) and also no penalty if it's already been seen.\n\nYou can see if it's in your local pool by querying the endpoint:\n\n`curl http://localhost:5051/eth/v1/beacon/pool/voluntary_exits | jq`\n\nThis would list any voluntary exits that have been seen and not subsequently been listed in a block (it'll clear on a restart though).\n\nAnother 'caveat' is if you submit and then restart your node, you'll probably want to periodically resubmit the exit if it hasn't been included into a block in a reasonable (a couple of hours usually) timeframe.",
