There is a collision with the node_exporter and the network data.\nSo the Teku detailed dashboard tries to take the data from the $system instance, while it actually being stored by the node_exporter so it's a different instance.\n\nSo it's not really a fix as this is the network of the entire machine while it's supposed to be on just Teku... (right??)\nI guess Teku needs to see how to avoid conflicting with node_exporter as it's a very popular tool used by many. \n",
