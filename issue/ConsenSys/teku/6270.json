    "body": "There's a level of standard around the metrics, but definitely a minimal set of standard across all clients would be good. There's been varying degrees of attempts to do it, and a lot of things have been moved, but I wouldn't say there's currently a 'standard'.\n\nPartially metrics are to measure specific things, and these things change, but I do agree that certain things are consistent to all clients and could be consistently named.\n\nImplementation note for future reference, we might be able to use a metrics category for adding the detailed entries of each validator pubkey and current / next committee, so that you'd enable that category if you want that level of detail.. Potentially off by default so that larger validator sets don't get too much volume from this change.  A count would be potentially present as a default metric (validators in the current sync committee, validators in the next sync committee).\n\nThanks for the feedback @ybstaked - this should be in a good state to action once we get to it now.",
