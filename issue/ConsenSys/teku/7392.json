  "body": "This will be easiest in a couple of stages.\n\nFor this release we'll create a file in the database folder that stores the mode that the database was opened in. This will allow us to refer to that in future as 'current' mode the database is in.\n\nFuture release will change from 'prune' data-storage-mode as default, probably to be null.\n\nThen we'll need logic to reconcile if this is not set, use the one stored to file etc.\n\nOnce we've got that logic in place, we'll be able to change the 'default' to be minimal, and existing databases with prune as default will continue to load that from disk and retain there data.\n\nFirst PR for persisting the current storage mode is #7391.",
