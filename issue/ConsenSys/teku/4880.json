Using a self-signed certificate is a little clumsy because they're not really a valid certificate, so we need to tweak it so we can turn SSL off if we're only listening on localhost or something like that. Something like if our listen address was 127.* or localhost, we would accept a flag to explicitly turn off ssl... this seems like a @benjaminion  question...",
