    "body": "I had a closer look at your screenshots and it does look like you were on 5g heap at the time, and your peer count dropped to 0 (or close to) for a period during full Garbage collection...\nThis looks very similar to a historical sync issue we had during non finality a couple of releases back ,but shouldn't be present in the current (23.6.2)\nCan I confirm which teku image you're using? It really does look very similar to something fixed in 23.5.0, but its definitely possible that some other scenario looks similar on the dash...\n\nWould it be possible to see the beacon node logs prior to the spike in garbage collection just after 8pm on the metrics board? Specifically warnings / errors / exceptions are of interest, probably in the period from 8pm to maybe 5 past...\n\nRelated to this, though not strictly, we've started a release that would address some memory consumption etc which might alleviate things, though it'd be interesting to pursue and see if there's something else involved here.",
