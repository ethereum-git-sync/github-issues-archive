    "body": "Thanks for raising this but I would say that's a false positive. The only code running in the Teku process is Teku's code so there's no malicious code (or there's only malicious code if everything has been completely compromised already).  Additionally making the variable package private won't have any benefit as the Java reflection APIs could still be used to change it: **https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/reflect/AccessibleObject.html#setAccessible(boolean)**\r\n\r\nWe have multiple tests in place to ensure the value isn't accidentally changed.",
