This is because they do not have access to the entire signing key needed to generate the signature used for aggregator selection.\r\n\r\nTo support this, some changes to the validator client are needed. At high-level (see [the doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q9jOTPcYQa-3L8luRvQJ-M0eegtba4Nmon3dpO79TMk/edit?usp=sharing) for details),\r\n\r\n1. Configure the validator client to know that it is part of a DVT cluster. I have a slight preference for the manual method (`--distributed` flag on the VC) rather than automatic detection, but happy to discuss.\r\n2. If distributed mode is active, then modify the control flow after attesting in order to consult the beacon node about whether the validator is an aggregator or not, after supplying a partial signature. Also modify the control flow for sync committee aggregation duty.\r\n\r\nThese changes use new standard beacon APIs and should be generic across DVT solutions. (This is why I prefer manual configuration via a flag - automatic detection might be solution-specific or fragile.)",
