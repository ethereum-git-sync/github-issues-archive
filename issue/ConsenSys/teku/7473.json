We haven't really built this out, so while we might get to it at some stage, it's likely to be a bit of a job, and we would only really be using that field for the peers endpoint, so we'll have to weigh this up against other priorities.\nWe had a go at it and it got messy so we're having to shelve it for a while and will revisit at some point.",
