But finding that first block is hard because the request might have a skip value greater than 1 (ie asking for every 10th block). We can efficiently find the next entry in the database but could wind up having to scan huge sections of the db to find the first block.\r\n\r\nOther clients just reject requests outright if they span too many slots.  So my suggestion would be to track when we limit the number of blocks we'll search for and whether we found a block. If we hit the restricted limit without finding a block, return an error code rejecting the request.  We wouldn't return an error if we found a block, or if we searched every requested slot, even if they were all empty.\r\n\r\nSo:\r\n\r\n * Request slots 1-1000, and we find no blocks in the slots we check (1-201) - return an error response\r\n * Request slots 1-201 and we find no blocks after checking them all - no error (and no response to confirm all slots were empty)\r\n * Request slots 1-1000, and we do find a block - return the blocks we find with no error\r\n * Request slots 1-201 and we find some blocks after checking them all - return the bocks we found with no error",
