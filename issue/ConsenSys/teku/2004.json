    "body": "We trim line ending data because of lessons learnt with Besu and EthSigner which didn't trim passwords and we kept getting reports from users that their password wasn't working because the way they created the file just happened to append a line ending.\r\n\r\nThe big question is what the final recommended workflow will be for generating these files.  Currently Teku generates a keystore but deliberately doesn't write the password to disk because hopefully you're going to put it into something like k8s secrets.  But for a lot of users they wind up just creating a text file with the password right next to the keystore which works but rather defeats the point of encryption which leads to a high likelihood that there'll be a line ending added.  If keys are generated in a wallet and always exported with keystore and password files generated then we wouldn't normally get extra line endings and could just use the file as-is.",
