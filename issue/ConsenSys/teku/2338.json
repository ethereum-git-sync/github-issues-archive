  "body": "### Description\r\nWhen CPU is highly limited, the validator client may back up processing events from the beacon chain and wind up creating attestations multiple epochs after they were due. Instead, the validator should skip duties that are outdated in order to catch up with the beacon chain.\r\n\r\nThe basic premise being that it's better to skip some duties than to have all duties performed so late that they don't count anyway.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce (Bug)\r\nInitially seen when running Teku on Altona using a Raspberry Pi and restricting it to a single core.\r\n",
