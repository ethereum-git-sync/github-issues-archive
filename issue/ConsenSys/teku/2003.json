Lighthouse does something neat where you specify just a secrets dir, and each password file is named by pubkey, so the client can find them.\n>\n> Or maybe use a csv or json of account -> password mappings? If a directory is too complicated to implement on what's already there?\n>\n> I'll try generating the CLI argument, but it would be neat to just have Teku resolve where to find the passphrases for the key files",

    "body": "I would say we should also change the generate commands so that they put all generated keys in one directory rather than a separate directory per validator which will make this a bit easier.  I really don't think we should be writing the password to disk unless we add a specific option to do so (default to off).  Writing passwords unencrypted to disk is a very bad idea.\r\n\r\nWhat should happen in a production situation is that the keys would be generated somewhere secure and the passwords added to a credentials manager (eg kubernetes secrets) which are often then exposed to the running host as a directory of files.\r\n\r\nFor the just trying it out kind of stuff then yeah you'd have to write the password to a file and copy it to the right name for each validator.\r\n\r\nIdeally I'd love to be able to recommend an external tool like ethdo to create the keys and send the deposit contract, then just export them ready for Teku to load.  Launchpad is also being developed to be \"the way\" people deposit for main net but not sure of the details of that either (https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-deposit).",
