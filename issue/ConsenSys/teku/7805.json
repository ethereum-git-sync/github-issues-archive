    "body": "Before starting, I'm not saying that Teku is wrong. Teku is doing well under the consensus specification. \r\nIt's just that the current specification doesn't specify how to defer fork choice when handling with future attestations that vote on a known block (attestation for unknown block will ignored on assertion), which seems to have led to discrepancy between different clients in implementing it. \r\nTherefore, this question relates to a mechanism to defer attestations from the future that target already known blocks. As I remember, in consensus-spec, `validate_on_attestation` asks to delay consideration for future attestations until their slot is in the past, but not mentioning how.\r\n\r\nFor example, in the above scenario, validator X is making double-voting (yes, this is slashable) attestation and releasing it before the proper slot. Therefore, both double-voting attestations are considered attestations from the future. \r\nNow, the implementations that are using _queue_ (like Lighthouse or Nimbus) will store those future attestations on _queue_, and try to handle it when the proper slot has arrived with the arrival order. That is, if the arrival order of attestation is [_att_0, att_1_] then, the client will process _att_0_ properly and ignore _att_1_ because it is duplicated.\r\n\r\nHowever, _map_ -based implementations (like Teku or Prysm) will make different decisions (because, as you know, the _map_ is based on key-value unlike the _queue_, which doesn't guarantee the order). Therefore, it is not 100% deterministic whether the processing order will be [_att_0, att_1_] or [_att_1, att_0_] unlike _queue_-based implementations.\r\n\r\nThis is a minor and non-urgent discrepancy. Because, as you know, in the real world this may not be a big problem due to there being more than 900K validators and a lot of slashers are watching it. Also, the order of arrival of the attestations will be unpredictable (except when packet orders are manipulated by a larger-scale network attacker). \r\nBut, I want to suggest that the possibility exists that such a minor discrepancy like this may lead to real problems in the future.\r\n",

    "body": "@hcnam This is an interesting idea! I think your issue probably belongs on the `consensus-specs`, because as you said the queueing order isn't defined by the specification. \r\n\r\nMy intuition is that it's _kind of OK_ not to specify the queueing order because attestation arrival is unpredictable anyway. The [P2P gossip conditions](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/p2p-interface.md#attestation-subnets) don't mandate propagation of early attestations, so an attacker could quite easily queue their different attestations on different nodes even without the different queue structures (e.g. gossip just `att1` to some nodes, and gossip just `att2` to others). When the attestation slot(s) arrive and they are processed, some clients will have fork choice output based off `att1` and others will have output based off `att2`. This is called \"view splitting\", and in our case should eventually be reconciled by a block that includes one of the attestations, causing the other side to detect the slashing (and broadcast it).\r\n\r\nThere are some proposals floating around for making fork choice more resilient to these type of split views, e.g. https://ethresear.ch/t/view-merge-as-a-replacement-for-proposer-boost/13739. You might like to get involved and contribute to that effort? IMO it would be great to _prove_ some resilience properties about the combination of the P2P conditions & the fork choice spec.",

If we (Lighthouse) _were_ to requeue future attestations, as we do for attestations to unknown blocks, then we would likely delay marking them as `IGNORE`d on gossipsub until they were re-processed. If they were processed successfully we would `ACCEPT` them, which would result in them being gossiped to our peers. i.e. the network wouldn't need to wait for the attestation to be included in a block before reconciling the split view.",
