  "body": "Calling this \"ephemeral mode\" to avoid a clash with \"light client\" which is something totally different. Open to other naming. Basically it's Teku-lite.\n\nAs a dev I'd sometimes like to quickly spin up a minimal client just to check the chain state or test some new code. It would be very short lived (hours, not days). This would look like:\n\n1. Always checkpoint sync - possibly don't start if there is an existing db.\n2. Stub out the execution client completely. (implemented but need docs)\n3. Do not back fill historic blocks.\n4. Do not load validators.\n5. [Optional] Do not store finalised history.\n\nI know how to do 1 and 2. Number 3 is the big one - back fill uses a lot of CPU and bandwidth. I understand that not backfilling might result in a loss of peers, but that probably doesn't matter for this application. Number 5 is probably not worth the effort to implement.\n\nIf `--ephemeral` is specified without `--initial-state` then refuse to start.",
