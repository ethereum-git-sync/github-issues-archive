  "body": "As mentioned here #5914, #5868 solves a bug that worth to be fixed while clearing the re-execution logic.\r\n\r\nthe bug:\r\nThere is an unintended behaviour in which we are queuing for re-execution an already expired block (so it may be executed if the pruning happening `onSlot` doesn't kick-in before the 2s tick). This may happen if we hit a timeout on EL, when we may end up by re-executing it several time.\r\n\r\nthe fix is here: \r\nhttps://github.com/ConsenSys/teku/pull/5868/files#diff-23d1694769644ca3b78e21c2aa378b8371cec7091d1643fce3a2ba32f2168ca8R102-R119\r\n",
