  "body": "As a staker, I want to know as soon as possible if my sync committee contributions are failing so that I can try to fix things without delay. Sync committee participation makes up a non-negligible fraction of a staker's total reward.\r\n\r\n### The issue\r\n\r\nWe currently report sync committee statistics only at the ends of epochs, as for attestations:\r\n\r\n```\r\nJun 10 19:24:23 nuc teku[384696]: 2022-06-10 19:24:23.084 INFO  - Sync committee performance: epoch 125084, expected 32, produced 0, correct 0, included 0 (0%)\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor attestations, we need to delay the reporting since they are valid for 32 slots. However, sync committee contributions are valid for only one slot, so we can almost immediately tell whether they were successful or not.\r\n\r\n### Suggested approach\r\n\r\nIf one of our validators made a sync committee contribution in the previous slot and it does not show up in the current slot's block then print a `WARN` level message that it was not included. If the current slot is empty, do not print a warning.\r\n\r\nRationale for the `WARN` level choice: this may or may not be a client-side error, but it warrants investigation.\r\n\r\nI recommend leaving the end of epoch sync committee reporting in place. But make sure it is for the current epoch rather than the previous one as for attestations.",
