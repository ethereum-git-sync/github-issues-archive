  "body": "Currently, `--beacon-node-api-endpoint` is only allowed when running Teku in `validator-client` mode. Upcoming Teku release has an enhancement to `--beacon-node-api-endpoint` that will allow users to specify multiple end-points for fallback support. It will be helpful to enable `--beacon-node-api-endpoint` for users running Teku in single process mode ([beacon node and validator as a single process](https://docs.teku.consensys.net/en/latest/HowTo/Get-Started/Run-Teku/#start-the-clients-in-a-single-process)) too.\r\n\r\nThis will allow validators to setup fallback (if the EL is down or syncing and not current) without having to split their single process setup. \r\n\r\nHere is a [link](https://discord.com/channels/694822223575384095/782670046736285697/1009625570570686615) to the discord discussion about this topic/request",

    "body": "The key reason you'd use a fallback in this case btw, is to handle the case where the EL is syncing or offline. Obviously if the primary beacon node is down the VC running in the same process is going to be down as well, but it's likely to be more common that the EL isn't ready and the fallback would be useful in that case.",
