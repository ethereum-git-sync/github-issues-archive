  "body": "I don't believe we genuinely need high quality randomness for performing batch verification. Any potential attacker is severely constrained in what they can attempt here, even if they can gain some knowledge of the RNG output. Nonetheless, a couple of people have raised this recently, and for the sake of a quiet life it may be worth improving the randomness.\r\n\r\nWe should validate whether the comment about `SecureRandom` still applies. If the performance impact is negligible, we should move over to using `SecureRandom`.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ConsenSys/teku/blob/d0bd4d06848fe62fc1ae5088e37b4dd62d949e33/bls/src/main/java/tech/pegasys/teku/bls/impl/blst/BlstBLS12381.java#L40-L48\r\n\r\n",
