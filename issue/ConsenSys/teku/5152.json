In the future we could feature different strategies in interacting with them, but for initial feature just fallback in the order of endpoints provided could be enough. \r\nSo, the options flag should be able to accept several endpoint URIs, and when any endpoint query is happened, if first endpoint is failed, we use 2nd etc",
