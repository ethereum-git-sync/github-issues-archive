  "body": "### Description\nReview our startup process to see if the beacon rest API can be started earlier.  Will need to be done carefully as the rest API calls into quite a lot of other stuff.\n\nOne area we almost certainly can improve is to fully start the beacon node service before the VC loads Validator Keys. Currently we init the beacon node and VC (which loads keys) in parallel and then when both are completely we start the beacon node then start the VC. The BN doesn't have any dependency on the VC so could start even before it's ready (same as if it were in a separate process).",
