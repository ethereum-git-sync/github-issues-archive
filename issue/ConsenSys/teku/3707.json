    "body": "So it looks like `api_validator_required_api.go` is an export of the 'Validator Required Api' heading, and `api_validator_api.go` is the 'Validator Api' heading.\n\nThey do come down to 1 implementation, but its got 2 category headings, which is pretty normal in OpenApi.\n\nI would probably suggest only importing the `api_validator_api.go`, as its a superset of the required api. Some of the other parts of the required api live in the beacon group, so you might want to make use of those from that area also.\n\nThe standard api is written by hand into yaml, so you may be able to make use of that, which will probably come out cleaner because of the way it's been written. https://ethereum.github.io/eth2.0-APIs/\n\nIt does appear that there's projects mentioning similar to this issue, and they come down to requiring a swagger change. \n https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/issues/2701\n\nI've upgraded swagger, javalin on our end, but it didn't stop the reported problem, so I'll hold off from any merge for that change.\n\nHopefully there's bits of this that are of use, but currently there appears to be not a lot we can actually do to help rectify this issue on our end.",
