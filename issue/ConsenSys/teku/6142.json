  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nTeku Validator Client does not failover to a secondary beacon node (CL) when the primary execution layer is down or out of peers and fell behind on blocks\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce (Bug)\r\n\r\nHere is something I noticed when testing the failover option in Mainnet. I am running Teku CL and VC as separate processes. When I stop the Teku CL service, I see below logs on the Teku VC\r\n\r\n`Validator   *** Switching to failover beacon node for event streaming\r\nValidator   *** Successfully connected to beacon node event stream`\r\n\r\nThat is great. Works as expected. Then when I turn back the CL on, I see the below\r\n\r\n`Validator   *** Primary beacon node is back and ready for event streaming. Will attempt connecting.\r\nValidator   *** Successfully connected to beacon node event stream`\r\n\r\nThat is perfect too. \r\n\r\nBut, my primary EL (Besu) was behaving bad with peers. It was not able to get enough peers at all. Often it goes down to 3-4 peers and sometimes zero as well. So during that time, I see the below log in the VC which is expected\r\n\r\n`Execution Client is offline\r\njava.util.concurrent.TimeoutException: null`\r\n\r\nAnd it took 2-3 minutes (or sometimes quicker) for EL to find peers and come back online. During this time, I noticed that the VC never switches to the failover beacon node. Ideally, I would expect it to. I understand that pre-merge, EL going behind/offline for a bit is not that big of a deal. But with merge-ready Teku (22.8.1), I still think the above scenario should have triggered a failover\r\n\r\nTo test this further, I manually stopped the primary EL (Besu) to see what happens. CL clearly throws errors that it is not able to reach/talk to EL. But VC still did not failover to the secondary CL. This may be fine for pre-merge, but probably not fine post-merge. This is one of the main use case for having a secondary failover node I would think.\r\n\r\n### Versions (Add all that apply)\r\n\r\nThis is on Teku 22.8.1 running natively on Ubuntu 22.04.1",
