  "body": "keymanager PR ticket: https://github.com/ethereum/keymanager-APIs/pull/17\n\nAs a validator-client maintainer,\nI want to be able to add remote keys to teku validator-client without restarting,\nso that I can efficiently manage my resources.\n\nPOST `/eth/v1/remotekey`\nSpec calls the function `ImportRemoteKeys`\nand it takes in a body of an array similar to `SignerDefinition` which we defined in the list.\n```\n[\n  { \"pubkey\": \"0\" },\n  { \"pubkey\": \"1\", \"signer\": \"https://signer.io\" },\n]\n```\nFrom later comments, it sounds like it might be slightly different to `SignerDefinition`, as the URL may be optional...\n\nThe response object is `ImportRemoteKeysResponse`, which  is an array of import statuses (imported / duplicate / error) which we will reference as an enumeration in the same way as the local import response.\n```\n{\n  data: [ \n  { status: \"imported\"},\n  { status: \"error\", message: \"some error\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nBecause this is batch processing (the same as the local keys import) each response object lines up to part of the request, and needs to be in the same order. An individual error should never result in the entire import being an error, as this leaves the keys in an undetermined state.\n\nBecause we're working off of a PR, it is still possible that this definition will have changes, and we'll just make any required changes once it's in the spec.",
