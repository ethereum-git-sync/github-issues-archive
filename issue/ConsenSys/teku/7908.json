  "body": "Commonly, nethermind comes up 'in sync' and doesnt actually have deposits to return, and this is actually quite a significant issue.\n\nAt the very least though, we can reduce the level of logging about missing deposits, it's currently coming out many times a minute and makes the log impossible to read.  We shouldn't need this to be reported nearly as often, and we don't really need the stack trace in this circumstance.\n\nref. \nhttps://discord.com/channels/697535391594446898/697539289042649190/1199212110228488302\n\n```\n2024-01-23 04:39:47.001 INFO  - Syncing     *** Target slot: 8263397, Head slot: 8223412, Remaining slots: 39985, Connected peers: 66 \n2024-01-23 04:39:47.370 FATAL - PLEASE CHECK YOUR ETH1 NODE | Encountered a problem retrieving deposit events from eth1 endpoint: Expected next deposit at index 1171691, but got 1171692\n```",
