  "body": "### Description\r\nIn a few cases we've found it problematic to handle logging because the log4j configuration is done too late in the startup process (latest example being #4324).  We should enable logging as early as possible during startup so that the logging system is available for use to as much of the init code as possible.\r\n\r\nSuggested approach:\r\n1. Remove `LoggingConfiguration` from `TekuConfiguration` so that it is an independent config object.\r\n2. `LoggingOptions` would then have two methods, the existing `configure` which sets the `wireLogs` options that will remain in `TekuConfiguration` and a new `applyLoggingConfiguration` method which creates  the `LoggingConfiguration` instance and immediately calls `LoggingConfigurator.update(loggingConfig)`.\r\n3. Call `applyLoggingConfiguration` immediately after the call to `setLogLevels` in both `BeaconNodeCommand` and `ValidatorClientCommand`.  Then logging will be available for the rest of the config creation process.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would also be worth investigating if we can mark `logLevel` and `loggingOptions` in `BeaconNodeCommand` as `Scope.INHERIT` for PicoCLI so that they're automatically inherited by all subcommands, then call `applyLoggingConfiguration` in `setLogLevels`.  If we ensure all subcommands call `setLogLevels` they will now all benefit from logging being configured.  We could then revisit `SubCommandLogger` and get it to use logging, especially if we used a simpler default log format for subcommands that are meant to be interactive so it didn't prefix timestamp etc, essentially outputting the same as today but with the benefit of being able to override the log configuration if it is used in scripts etc.",
