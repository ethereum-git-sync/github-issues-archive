  "body": "### Description\nAt the moment we are loading deposit tree snapshots every single time we start Teku, to compare if it is a better version (more recent, etc) than what we have in our database.\n\nThe problem is that when using remote sources for the deposit tree snapshot (e.g. from checkpoint-sync-url) it becomes a failure point every time your node starts. We had users having issues with their checkpoint sync provider being unreliable and causing an issue when Teku starts.\n\nThe failure will be solved by #7715, using a fallback mechanism. However, we do not need to load the deposit snapshot tree on every startup.\n\n### Done Criteria\n- Upon a fresh start (clean DB), Teku will try to download the deposit tree snapshot from any configured source (custom, bundled or from checkpoint-sync).\n- After the first snapshot is loaded successfully and persisted to the node's DB, Teku should not try to load a deposit tree snapshot from any other source than its database.",
