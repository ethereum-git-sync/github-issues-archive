As such, the `block` event should come first and the `head` event later.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:**\r\n\r\nThe `head` event precedes the `block` event, for example:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl -H 'Accept: text/event-stream' -s 'http://localhost:5052/eth/v1/events?topics=head,block'\r\n: ready\r\nevent: head\r\ndata: {\"slot\":\"6071990\",\"block\":\"0xa88f49f19299d7b8408a0ede7eb99c6babd340a5cfcf49b69c2c87568237b7bb\",\"state\":\"0xa87ad7c4ea2adbc0bdec5791e195a0200e1edd9315a01125834f935887d9\r\n7234\",\"epoch_transition\":false,\"previous_duty_dependent_root\":\"0x94c252a2299d3896967a2fbe0ac0e3141d1355843107214be3c4c2c64137a51c\",\"current_duty_dependent_root\":\"0xb2b98204\r\n87473405fb45891321d674d5bcbbd8523afe1a090df66c0b7b82f1b2\",\"execution_optimistic\":false}\r\n\r\nevent: block\r\ndata: {\"slot\":\"6071990\",\"block\":\"0xa88f49f19299d7b8408a0ede7eb99c6babd340a5cfcf49b69c2c87568237b7bb\",\"execution_optimistic\":false}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Frequency:**\r\n\r\nHappens all the time (tested on goerli nodes).\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n```\r\nteku/v23.6.1/linux-x86_64/-privatebuild-openjdk64bitservervm-java-17\r\n```",
