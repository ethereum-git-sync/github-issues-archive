  "body": "Process slot gets called only when store.getTime() is greater than nextSlotStartTime. Since, at least with the current constants, onTick() gets called twice every second, in the worst-case scenario we're losing 500 ms processing time for each slot.\n\nOne idea is to have a SlotScheduler class that has its own timer which gets kicked off exactly at genesis. This class could post SlotEvents, BroadcastAttestationEvents and BroadcastAggregateEvents just like the processSlot method here, however, it would post those events way more precisely.",
