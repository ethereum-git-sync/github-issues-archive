  "body": "### Description\r\nWhen the P2P port is in use, Teku starts and continues running but the P2P network is unable to start. The P2P network can't be started until genesis is known which is after the usual startup, and thus when it fails to start Teku continues running.\r\n\r\nWe should find a way to provide a clear, helpful error message and not start Teku when the P2P port is in use.  Need to ensure we think through how it works if the network is pre-genesis and what happens if the port isn't in use at initial startup but is in use by the time the network actually starts.",
