    "body": "Which version to use depends on which testnet you're trying to connect to. There are two incompatible versions of the beacon chain spec currently in use (because not all clients are ready for the new version and some testnets are still running the older one).\r\n\r\nSo:\r\n- The Witti testnet uses beacon chain spec 0.11.3, which is supported by the 0.11.x series of Teku releases and our master branch.  The build I linked to above is fine to use to connect to Witti.\r\n- Prysm's new Onyx testnet uses beacon chain spec 0.12.1 which is supported by the 0.12.x series of Teku releases and our 0.12.1-integration branch.  Our v0.12.1 support is very new and still untested (not even sure if we agree on the Onyx genesis state yet).\r\n\r\nSo my recommendation would be to use the build I link above and connect to the Witti testnet (`bin\\teku.bat --network witti`) which we know works well.  The fix will find it's way into both master and 0.12.1-integration branch in time and both should get a release put out later this week.   Because things are changing so rapidly we recommend that most people use the very latest -SNAPSHOT builds of either the 0.11 or 0.12 streams and not wait for a release.  You may hit a few more unexpected bumps doing that but finding issues is the aim of these testnets so it would really help us with getting ready for the real beacon chain main net.",
