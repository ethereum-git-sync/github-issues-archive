We're using https://github.com/fusesource/leveldbjni which has a fairly outdated build system (the autoconf version it uses doesn't appear to be available on the Linux boxes I've tried) and it needs a few tweaks to work with the latest version of LevelDB.  I have managed to get it compiling for Mac with the latest LevelDB so could share that work but I wasn't able to get it compiling on Linux, though someone more familiar with auto tools may find it easy to sort out.  I don't recall if I managed to get it cross compiling on Mac but generally once you get things building the cross compilation to create a FAT binary is fairly straight forward with the Mac toolchain.\r\n\r\nWorth noting that Teku running on an x86 JVM does run fine on an M1 Mac via Rosetta translation.",

    "body": "@KaloyanTanev \r\n\r\n> @ajsutton can you share the steps on how you managed to get leveldbjni running on Apple Silicon?\r\n\r\nSorry for the delay in getting back to you on this.  I'm pretty hazy on what I'd actually done as I'm not at all familiar with cmake.  I did manage to get leveldbjni compiling on Mac again and with the latest leveldb - I removed support for enabling and disabling compaction to reduce the changes required in leveldb source code.  That's at https://github.com/ajsutton/leveldbjni/pull/1 - the `build.sh` script has the steps to compile.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't look like I got it cross compiling but configure args in the pom include `<arg>--with-universal=x86_64</arg>` which looks like a good place to be able to add arm64.  Generally cross compiling on Mac is relatively straight forward like that.\r\n\r\nThe bigger issue was that I couldn't get it to compile on Linux at all as the autoconf tools appear to require an old version that I wasn't able to install.  They're probably available on older Linux versions and hopefully updating to more recent versions isn't too hard but it was getting well outside my area of knowledge by then and I ran out of time to look into it.",

    "body": "Hi Guys, Ive been looking at getting the apache spark code building on an m1 mac and saw it also depends on leveldbjni (as does a few other projects). So I took your pr and tried to progress. I did a few small changes to get it to work on osx12 and changed the with-universal -> with-universal-archs and got the tests successfully running. When I used this library in the kvstore in spark it compiled and tested ok but then tests in higher modules are failing so not really sure if ultimately this component is actually good or not. I agree with the comments above about the state of the leveldbjni project. Its a bit hacky with generated code checked in and coppies of native libraries in multiple locations it really needs a good sorting out. Great work to reomove the patch on leveldb tho",
