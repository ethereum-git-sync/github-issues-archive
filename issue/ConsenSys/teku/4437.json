Yet, I'm having issues in regards to the utilities needed to be imported in order for the packages (and classes/interfaces within the build) to be error free...\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce (Bug)\r\n1. Git Pull Teku folder into OS\r\n2. Open Spring Tool Suite 4\r\n3. Go to [File] -> [Open Projects From File System] and choose Teku folder from files\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** \r\nNo Errors packages, classes and interfaces\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:**\r\nErrors on all packages, classes and interfaces.\r\n\r\n**Image Reference**\r\n![Teku Build Import Utility Issues](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51394348/135779259-f423f789-0c9d-43c2-a271-4488b4f1e7ca.jpg)\r\n\r\n**Frequency:**\r\nAll the time\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n* Software version: [`Unsure...
