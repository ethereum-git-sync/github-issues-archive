    "body": "Thanks @arash009. We’re aware of this issue and currently working on a fix. The main problem is that currently Teku uses archival function calls on its Eth1 node to retrieve deposit contract merkle tree root and deposit count. What you’re seeing is what happens when Teku makes an archival function call at a block height that the Eth1 node doesn’t have in its recent archival memory. \r\n\r\nTeku does work when the Eth1 node is set to store archival information for about 9 hours instead of the default 4 hours, but we’re hoping to get rid of this requirement asap.",
