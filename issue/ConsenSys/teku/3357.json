Troubleshooting problems with eth1 nodes will be simpler if we can rule out problems related to being out-of-sync.  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, if we know the eth1 node is in sync, we can avoid making unnecessary eth1 requests.  For example,  [`Eth1DepositManager` starts up](https://github.com/ConsenSys/teku/blob/0e3cc8bfff559fe5b92ce21da39b6518d7b67f9b/pow/src/main/java/tech/pegasys/teku/pow/Eth1DepositManager.java#L73-L76) and tries to locate the minimum possible eth1 block that could trigger genesis.  If the eth1 node's latest block is before the minimum possible genesis time, we start requesting blocks 1 by 1 until we find the min genesis block.  If the eth1 node is very far behind the actual eth1 block that triggers genesis, we could end up requesting an excessive number of blocks.  \r\n\r\nRelates to #3337 \r\n",
