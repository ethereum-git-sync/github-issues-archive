  "body": "When a VC is configured with primary and secondary BNs, we currently apply a strict failover logic with regard to duty production.\r\nIt means that if VC have to produce a block, it asks for unsignedBlock production to primary first, and if fails, it tries the secondaries.\r\n\r\nWe can improve the logic by asking duty prodation to all available BNs and apply the preference to the primary when dealing with the responses we receive.\r\n\r\nFor instance we can apply a configurable time interval to wait for the primary response, this time will be independent by the networking timeout.\r\n\r\nso the flow could be:\r\n- start timer with configured `time interval`\r\n- call duty production against all available BNs (primary and secondaries)\r\n- for each response: if comes from the primary (cancel timer), go for it immediately. If comes from secondary: wait\r\n- on timer timeout: go for the first good response we have.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo `time interval` represents who much the primary is preferred against the secondary, despite being late in duty handling.\r\nis set to 0 we should effectively go for the first respond we get from BN, nullifying the difference between primary and secondary BNs.",
