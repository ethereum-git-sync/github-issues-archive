    "body": "Remaining issue: when sync switches to a new chain it optimistically assumes the new chain extends the old one until it finds the blocks don't match.  That means it will keep downloading the currently queued batches from the old chain.  When the old chain has no remaining peers, those batches can never be downloaded and the sync gets stuck.   Need to change it so that when a batch from an old chain has no available peers, it is replaced with a batch from the new chain (for the same range).",
