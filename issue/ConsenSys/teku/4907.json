  "body": "### Description\nBy default the beacon node logs a number of errors to alert users to the validator client doing something invalid (submitting an invalid attestation/block, requesting attestations in the future etc).  These are very useful when the same user owns the validator client and beacon node as often the validator client can't provide the same level of information that the beacon node can.\n\nHowever, when the beacon node is operated by a separate user (e.g. Infura) the error messages in the beacon node logs are just noise which makes alerting more difficult.  We need to provide a way to disable them in that case.\n\nOne option would be to include these messages with `--log-include-validator-duties-enabled` ",
