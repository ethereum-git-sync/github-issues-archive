  "body": "### Description\r\nParent issue to track the work required to handle the non-finalisation on Medalla.\r\nQuick notes may be made inline but should be moved to their own issue once we start to flesh them out so we have a clear record of what was wrong and what we did to fix that specific issue.\r\n\r\n## CPU and Memory Consumption\r\n* ~~https://github.com/PegaSysEng/teku/pull/2589~~ An excessive number of state regenerations were in progress concurrently resulting in excessive CPU and memory usage \r\n* ~~https://github.com/PegaSysEng/teku/pull/2583~~ Netty threads were blocked processing gossip messages. Moved to thread pool.\r\n* ~~#2598~~ P2P executor queue is filling up \r\n* ~~#2610~~ Same state is being regenerated multiple times\r\n* ~~#2610~~ Significant number of state regenerations that replay 1 block. Why are these not hitting cache?\r\n* ~~#2608~~  Persist hot states periodically to reduce the number of blocks that need to be replayed when regenerating states that have dropped out of the in-memory cache\r\n* ~~#2615~~ Skip processing blocks at startup if possible\r\n* ~~#2609~~ Optimize checkpoint state generation \r\n* ~~#2612~~ State cache exceeding maximum size\r\n\r\n## Fork choice\r\n* ~~#2562~~ Error in fork choice. Was happening prior to Medalla hitting issues but seems much more common now.\r\n* ~~#2610~~ Many fork choice updates are being skipped with message \"Skipping update of chain head\" because of interim updates.\r\n* ~~#2614~~ Reports that the Teku instances that are in sync are following a different chain to what should be canonical head\r\n\r\n## Sync Issues\r\n* ~~https://github.com/PegaSysEng/teku/pull/2590~~ Excessive throttling checks were kicking in too often because of all the empty slots on Medalla\r\n* ~~https://github.com/PegaSysEng/teku/pull/2586~~ Check latest peer status while syncing\r\n* ~~https://github.com/PegaSysEng/teku/pull/2600~~ Each time we select a new peer to sync from we start from the finalised checkpoint. We should find a more recent common ancestor if the finalised checkpoint is significantly in the past\r\n\r\n## Other\r\n* ~~https://github.com/PegaSysEng/teku/pull/2584~~ Metrics were creating high contention on the Store locks\r\n* #2601 Support import/export of slashing protection databases to make changing clients easier.\r\n* #2616 Archive mode nodes will pause for a long period when finalisation is reached while they regenerate the finalised states to store.\r\n* ~~#2625~~ deadlock when updating finalized checkpoint",
