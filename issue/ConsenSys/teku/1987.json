  "body": "Following up on BC-413, which fixed queries for forkInfo, we should go through and make sure that all queries for latest chainhead data are atomic.  For example, in some cases, we query for the latest root, then use the root to query for the corresponding state.  This opens us up to race conditions where the underlying state is pruned between the time that we pull the latest root and query for the corresponding state.  Similarly, queries for block data should be atomic.\nThis should address the errors documented in issue #1713",
