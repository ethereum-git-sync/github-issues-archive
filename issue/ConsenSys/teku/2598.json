  "body": "### Description\r\nTeku appears unable to keep up with the rate of gossip messages and the P2P thread pool is almost constantly filling its queue resulting in rejected execution exceptions.\r\n\r\nCurrent theory is that this is caused by the `AttestationValidator` replaying empty slots.  This doesn't appear to be checking if the state is already in cache and doesn't do any deduplication.\r\n\r\nWe may also want to consider Lighthouse's `--max-skip-slots` setting to discard blocks and attestations which have too many empty slots to process.  Definitely need to make it configurable as we've seen unexpectedly large gaps on Medalla.",
