  "body": "### Description\r\nAs a future user of the Artemis client, I would like the CI to be enhanced so that changes that result in errors in the test suite are not considered passing builds. This enhancement would increase the safety of pulling the current HEAD of the Artemis client, and it will also make development easier for the Artemis team. \r\n\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n* Fails builds that have stack traces logged during testing\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\nIt's possible that the general form for stack traces will match strings that should be logged during testing and builds. If this is the case, a less general enhancement should be pursued that will still catch several types of Exception and Error logs. With things like this, a solution that works 90% of the time can be really nice üëç ",
