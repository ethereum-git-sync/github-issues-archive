  "body": "### Description\r\nThe current implementation of the p2p-static-peers feature requires manually providing a list of peers as input. However, to enhance usability and flexibility, it would be beneficial to extend this functionality by allowing users to provide a file as input for configuring the peer list. This feature request aims to streamline the process of managing peers by enabling the use of a file-based approach for defining and updating the peer configuration.\r\n\r\n### Current Behavior:\r\nThe p2p-static-peers feature currently accepts a list of peers as input. Users need to manually enter each peer's details in the configuration, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors, especially when managing a large number of peers. Specifically causing issues when creating custom/devnets. \r\n\r\n### Desired Behavior:\r\nThe suggested enhancement proposes the addition of file input support for configuring the peer list in the p2p-static-peers feature. Instead of manually entering the peer details, users would be able to specify a file that contains the necessary information about the peers. This file could be in a user-friendly format such as JSON, YAML,TXT or CSV, allowing for easy creation, editing, and sharing of peer configurations.",
