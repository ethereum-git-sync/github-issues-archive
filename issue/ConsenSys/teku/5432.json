We should investigate ways to store the merkle tree to disk instead to avoid the need to replay these deposits.\n\nI believe you can just store the right hand edge of the tree since deposits always append but we'd likely have to update our merkle tree implementation to handle that.\n\nAlso need to ensure we can still create blocks that may need to get the merkle tree root omitting some of the more recent deposits (ie we may have received up to deposit 1000, but the Eth1Data in the current state is only at deposit 900, so we need to act as if we had a merkle tree only containing the 900 deposits).",

Teku flag to make snapshot part of `OnDiskStoreData`, saving and loading to be able to restart without file option\r\n4. Optimization PR to not validate deposits which are already in finalized tree\r\n5. Remove block deposit events from DB\r\n\r\nAfter 2nd we could be confident on performance of the approach and adjust a plan ",
