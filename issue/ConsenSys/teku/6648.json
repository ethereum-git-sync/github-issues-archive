  "body": "We should check if we can clean this up... basically when we're running ethdo to prepare for offline withdrawal credential changes, currently teku users need to provide `--fork-version`, but ideally it would be found in api calls...\n\nsteps to reproduce:\n - capella enabled (doesnt have to be active) network\n - run the command: `./ethdo validator credentials set --prepare-offline`\n\noutput:\n```\nError: failed to process: beacon node not providing capella fork schedule; provide manually with --fork-version\n```\n\nexpected: should be able to generate the offline-preparation.json file without supplying the fork-version, as it should be detected. This likely means an api call (possibly `/eth/v1/config/fork_schedule` isn't providing it, but have asked on ethrnd discord in apis https://discord.com/channels/595666850260713488/710831784991916072/1055231161397415986)\n\nYou'll probably need to build ethdo to run the actual command, but any network (minimal with interop eth1 and capella enabled for instance) should suffice to generate the offline file ...",
