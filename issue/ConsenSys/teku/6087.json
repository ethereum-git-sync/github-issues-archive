  "body": "More generally, voluntary exits are valid only when signed with the current fork version or the previous fork version. See [`get_domain()`](https://eth2book.info/altair/part3/helper/accessors#get_domain).\r\n\r\nThere are reports that Teku will include VEs signed with a Phase0 fork version in Bellatrix blocks. This would make the blocks invalid.\r\n\r\n**Update:** reports are unclear as to whether Teku is putting stale VEs in blocks or just propagating them via gossip. In any case, we should check and fix if necessary.\r\n\r\n**Update2:** seems like the issue might be that the beacon API is accepting and propagating stale VEs. This is non-critical, but is undesirable.",
