  "body": "The basic architecture is now in place, but there's a few things to do to make this ready for real world deployment:\n\n* [x] Switch to standard REST API\n  * [x] Implement head update event (published whenever beacon chain advances it's head - either on a new head block importing or after running fork choice 1/3rd through a slot, effectively selecting the skipped slot)\n  * [x] Handle clients that are slow to read from events stream to ensure we continue to publish to faster clients quickly and don't build up a huge number of pending events in memory\n  * [x] Allow attestation and production duties, plus block creation and publishing to be performed one slot in advance (ie when the block for the last slot of epoch 1 is selected, we can calculate block production for epoch 2 and attestation duties for epoch 2 & 3 even if the start time of the first slot for epoch 2 hasn't been reached)\n  * [x] Implement the remaining REST APIs from the validator required set (separate tickets for those - they map pretty closely to our existing APIs)\n * [x] Create/find java client to read event streams\n * [x] Switch validator client to be driven off of it's own clock and the head events\n * [x] Reset scheduled duties when the event stream is disconnected (we might have missed a reorg event while reconnecting)\n * [x] Review CLI options and prepare them to be fully supported APIs (particularly adapting to not needing to explicitly enable remote validator APIs)\n    * [x] Support loading options from a config file\n * [ ] Don't run in-process validator service if there are no validators specified\n * [x] Complete separation of validator duties to attestation and block production duties.\n * [x] Default to different log file for validator client\n * [x] Move slashing protection directory out of data path",
