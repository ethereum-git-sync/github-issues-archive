    "body": "Hey @seroze,\r\nTurns out I should have said `SAVE_FOR_FUTURE` sorry - it's `tech.pegasys.teku.statetransition.validation.ValidationResultCode.SAVE_FOR_FUTURE`\r\n\r\nThe `tech.pegasys.teku.statetransition.OperationPool` class will likely be the place that needs to record these metrics. Metrics are tracked through the `MetricsSystem` class (a library that comes from besu).  You can see some examples of this in the `BeaconChainMetrics` class in Teku.  For these metrics I suspect a simple `metricsSystem.createIntegerGauge` for the number of items in the pool and `metricsSystem.createLabelledCounter` for tracking validation reasons.  I'd say use a labelled counter there so we can keep track of counts for all the validation results, which will then cover SAVE_FOR_FUTURE but also allow tracking the number of rejected items which would be useful as well (and even accepted would show the rate items are added to the pool well).",
