    "body": "@stingray55 This is still relevant, though many of the places it's an issue are being fixed as they move into the `spec` module. I'd ignore anything that's already marked as `@Deprecated` as it will have a new version that should be named correctly already and the old version will be removed as we migrate the code anyway.\r\n\r\nBut there are a bunch of methods in places like `BeaconState` which are still an issue and would be great to fix.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion would be to put up a number of small PRs to minimise the number of conflicts - so a PR that renamed the methods in `BeaconState` would be a great start, then look for another class to fix up and so on.  The smaller the PRs the quicker we can review and merge them and the less likely we'll have a difficult merge to deal with.",

The `BeaconState` class you're looking at there is actually part of the REST API definition. We can probably leave those as-is - if we renamed them we'd have to use an annotation to tell the JSON serialiser to use the snake-case version so we don't break the API.  There's a separate `BeaconState` interface in the spec module which is the internal representation and its the internal names we're most keen to fix up.",
