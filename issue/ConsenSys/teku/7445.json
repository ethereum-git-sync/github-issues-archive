  "body": "Following up on the debug tool we added here: https://github.com/Consensys/teku/pull/7441 we should be cleaning up the errors offered during actual key loading, so that users get something they can understand and action in their logs when keys fail to load.\n\nThe errors should be able to be specific and actionable, and they should include the file pair that caused the error, or at least the public key... Basically we want to make it something the user can read, and understand what they need to do, or what went wrong at least. The stack traces are excessive if we can give good information to the users to help themselves fix the problem that occurred.\n\nIf there's other issues that can happen that the debug tool missed that aren't defined, potentially we could leave the stack trace in, but we want to try to help the users as much as possible, as every stacktrace is likely to be a question on discord if they hit it.\n\nAlso the flow in the debug tool is slightly different as it attempts to load all keys, doesn't just fail on the first, but that's not really what we're trying to address here so much as the reporting to the user of what happened when a key didn't load.\n\nPotentially not just failing on the first key issue may be worthwhile, since we do seem to run even if we load no keys... This would be a bigger change, but might be advantageous, as if the first key fails to load but the rest are fine, then the user might be able to fix up the issue with the first key and send a HUP....",
