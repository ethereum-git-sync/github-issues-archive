  "body": "### Description\r\nOur docker images are currently set to use ubuntu 20.04 (focal) because there were some issues with building in CI immediately after the 22.04 release came out. This is most likely just caching issues in CI which will resolve.  We should ensure we upgrade in the relatively near future.\r\n\r\nWe may only know that everything is working fine once we merge the PR and the images are built by CircleCI. If something goes wrong after the upgrade, we must revert the change asap back to 20.04.\r\n\r\nWorst case we must upgrade by 2025 when 20.04 normal support ends.\r\n\r\n**Tasks**\r\n- Update all Dockerfiles that we use to build our images to use ubuntu 22.04\r\n- After PR is merged, check that our CircleCI job that builds/publishes docker image have run successfully\r\n- If anything goes wrong, revert the change.",
