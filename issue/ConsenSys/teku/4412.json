  "body": "### Description\r\nThe rewards structure for attestations changed in Altair so no reward for the source checkpoint being correct if the inclusion distance is greater than `integer_squareroot(SLOTS_PER_EPOCH)` (5 I think but check that). Since attestations that have the target wrong will also have the head wrong, they will earn no rewards unless they are included within 5 slots.\r\n\r\nCurrently Teku still includes this attestations that pay no rewards in blocks, but it should not.\r\n\r\nNote that these attestations are still valuable in Phase0 and should be included.",
