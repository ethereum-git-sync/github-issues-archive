    "body": "Labels are a little messy.\n\nPrometheus allows basically `[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*`, and reserves starting with `_` for internal use.\n\nOur dev version string (complicated example) is `v21.2.0+42-gb443919`, and that would need translation to be consistent with what's allowed in labels. If I replace '.' and '+' with '_', and drop any other invalid characters (the '-') then it would translate to: `v21_2_0_42gb443919`\n\nThe far simpler, and probably more 'normal' example is a release version. so `v21.2.0` would become the label `v21_2_0`\n\nIf there's any feedback, I'd be very interested to hear.",
