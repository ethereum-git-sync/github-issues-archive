We should review existing reference tests and consider adding additional tests around these edge cases.  As part of this work, we should document the process of generating new reference tests internally. \r\n\r\nExample edge case:\r\n* Import block proposed at slot 15\r\n* Import block proposed at slot 20 which descends from block 15\r\n* Finalize epoch 1 (slot 32) with block at slot 15\r\n* Import block proposed at slot 33, descending from block at slot 20\r\n* Block 33 should fail to import because it does not descend from the finalized checkpoint (epoch1, blockAt15) even though it is a descendant of block 15 when analyzed in terms of the hash chain\r\n\r\nReference Tests: https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-spec-tests\r\n",
