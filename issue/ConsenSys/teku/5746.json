  "body": "### Description\nTeku currently defaults to `leveldb-tree` format which uses a lot of disk space (though queries are fast) by default. This turns out to not be what most users want even when they are doing an archive sync. We should switch the default format back to `leveldb2` which uses the snapshot based storage.\n\nWhen `--data-storage-archive-frequency` is set to 1 we should automatically use `leveldb-tree` since it will then be the more space efficient storage format.",
