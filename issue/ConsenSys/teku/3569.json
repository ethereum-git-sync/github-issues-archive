We should investigate what's causing this and see if it can be fixed.\n\nSo far only looked at % of attestation rewards earned (as per https://www.symphonious.net/2021/01/10/exploring-eth2-attestation-rewards-and-validator-performance/) next step would be to look at each individual component of that reward - % head correct, % target correct and inclusion distance.\n\nWould also be worth looking at the number of times duties are recalculated with each approach (may need to add metrics to capture this).",
