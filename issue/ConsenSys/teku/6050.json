    "body": "I updated `validators-proposer-default-fee-recipient` in my configuration, and was not receiving 404 for keys that I knew about...\n\nWithout this option set, I was receiving 404, but that's expected and different to what's reported above. I was able to add/remove recipients, and it got updated with 'accepted', and the file was written...\n\nI was using read-only keys for setting/removing my fee-recipient in testing which is admittedly different to the reported setup, I'll have to setup non read-only keys to see if the behaviour differs, but code wise it looks like it should be consistent in that area for fee recipient.\n\n@yorickdowne are you able to share the config settings you were using so that I can closely replicate what you had setup? Also the teku version in use? Obviously just the parameters you had set is fine, just curious that your behaviour is different to what I'm observing... Also if you were running a VC or BN where you saw the behaviour may influence how this all behaves. I'm testing with a BN currently, but can use a VC and see if that changes things. So if your keys are in VC, and you're querying VC, or if your keys are in VC and you're querying BN (I'd expect latter to fail in the way described).\n\nIt's possible another code change has fixed the reported issue, I'll try my testing with 22.7.0 and see if it differs. \n\n",

I'm planning on linking this more closely so that a better decision can be made about which keys we own.",
