    "body": "**Requirements from design:**\r\n- The hidden lists can contain 2 different type of elements being them **INDIVIDUAL** tokens OR **GROUPS** (by group --> _collection_ or _community_ depending on the case).\r\n- Whenever a user hides a complete group, this action **prevails above individual items**, meaning that, in case there's already an individual token from community A hidden, if user hides the group corresponding with the community A, all previously individual tokens hidden from A will be \"removed\" from the hidden view and they will be treated as a hidden group insted.\r\n- Following with the same use case where the user hides a group, any new token received in the list will be automatically hidden.\r\n- In the case of individual token hides, if the user manually hides all tokens in a community, one by one, this WILL NOT be considered a hidden group, so all tokens in this community will be hidden but displayed in the corresponding hidden list as INDIVIDUAL elements.\r\n- Following with the same use case where the user hides all tokens from a group (community or collection), but one by one, if a new token is added in the list, this token will not be hidden. It will be added in the visible tokens list.\r\n- For MVP, there's no posibility to expand groups to display the elements inside. The groups delegate will just contain a count of the elements in the group.\r\n\r\nPlease, @benjthayer confirm that all these use cases are correct and if there's something missing, please share it!",

Also to note, that for the context menu for hidden items:\r\nIf a user has hidden more than one token from a collection or community in an iterative fashion, the context menu for each of those hidden individual items should feature the option to `Show all collectibles from this community/collection`. This allows the user to quickly batch unhide items from a collection/community should they wish to do so.",

    "body": "Here some agreements the `UI team` has decided to approach the implementation of this task:\r\n- Since both hidden lists need to display 2 different types of delegates, and also the sources will be 2 different models, the `Concat Model` utility can be used to mix model with INDIVIDUAL elements and model with GROUP elements. Then the list delegate needs to distinguish between the element type to display the different delegate design.\r\n- Since after last discussion with backend, the UI will work with the complete individual elements data, the UI is able to build the hidden groups model by its own.\r\n- In case of hidden group action is made, the UI is the responsable of checking if in the existing hidden lists, there are some individual items from this group and updates the list accordingly.\r\n\r\n**Here a point to discuss:**\r\n- Whenever the hide group action is triggered all new elements added in the user lists must be considered as hidden so, there are 2 options here:\r\n1. The UI communicates to the backend that this specific group needs to be hidden so, the backend internally modifies ALL individual items from this group to `visible = false` and whenever a new element is added in the list, the backend knows this token needs to be directly hidden.\r\n 2. Whenever the UI receives a model update from the backend, it needs to check if there's a new element belonging to some of the hidden groups to directly change it's visible property.\r\n@caybro @micieslak @alexjba which option do you think is more appropriate?",

    "body": "> Here some agreements the `UI team` has decided to approach the implementation of this task:\r\n> \r\n> * Since both hidden lists need to display 2 different types of delegates, and also the sources will be 2 different models, the `Concat Model` utility can be used to mix model with INDIVIDUAL elements and model with GROUP elements. Then the list delegate needs to distinguish between the element type to display the different delegate design.\r\n> * Since after last discussion with backend, the UI will work with the complete individual elements data, the UI is able to build the hidden groups model by its own.\r\n> * In case of hidden group action is made, the UI is the responsable of checking if in the existing hidden lists, there are some individual items from this group and updates the list accordingly.\r\n> \r\n\r\nThis will be the first try but if we see it will take more time than the one we have now available, a first step can be considered by only adding individual items in all lists and postpone the group elements to a next iteration.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
