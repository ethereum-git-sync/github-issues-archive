  "body": "Currently, when logging into Status, the Status logo animation loops a couple of times before freezing with no further indication to the user that any loading/readying of the app is taking place. The app looks like it has become unresponsive which may prompt users to force quit and relaunch the app to try again.\r\n\r\n**Current behaviour:**\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110033914/217079789-89405af6-4736-4420-bede-680b6a2f4a22.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo clarify to the user that the app is still 'loading'/being prepared during this time, the recommendation is to present a 'dummy'/fake loading bar. The loading bar will gradually fill during the c.30secs it takes between the user inputting their credentials and the content of the app loading. \r\n\r\nWhile the loading bar is filling, there is an opportunity to present the user with some messaging that will make the loading state a little more interesting and help us market the core features of the app / what we are currently working on. \r\n\r\nAbove the loading bar, we have a constant header; 'Did you know?' (as shown in the below recording) followed by messaging randomly selected from the below notion doc. The loading bar should show a random message from category one ('Features'), then a random message from category 2 ('Principles'), then a random message from category 3 ('Organisation') and so on until the message from the last category is presented. We should aim for the 'Did you know?' items to be fairly different with each log in.So a user sees different messaging from each category each time they log in (there will obviously be some unavoidable repetition between sessions). \r\n\r\nhttps://www.notion.so/Loading-screen-messaging-be82db41dac746f9b203ac82eb6be0b3\r\n\r\n\r\n**Proposed behaviour:**\r\n(Please refer to the Notion doc above for the final text to be used above the notification bar)\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110033914/217079670-963ea439-2392-400b-a2b1-754564b6c7f0.mov\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://www.figma.com/file/17fc13UBFvInrLgNUKJJg5/Kuba%E2%8E%9CDesktop?node-id=25878%3A518438&t=C7xTpNib38t7s7XU-4\r\n\r\ncc @John-44 @iurimatias ",

Then when the user is landed in the app, the app has already been running for 30 seconds post-user login.  This means things won't be jumping around and loading in for the first 20 or so seconds after the user initially lands in the app",

(Once this is done, please check all possible onboarding flows before merging this.)\r\n\r\nBut personally I don't like at all that kind of faking/masking the things. We set it up to 30secs, but what would happen to those who has weak pc configuration or a slow internet connection and need more time? They will still see loading animation freeze. \r\n",

I imagine desktop team devs will wish to switch this off, and adding a toggle to Settings/Advanced would let any users who wish to switch it off switch it off easily as well. ",
