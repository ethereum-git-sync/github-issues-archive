We need to keep tech. debt at a roughly fixed level as we grow out functionality, can't let it accumulate! ;-)\r\n\r\n**2. Tokenisation of community ownership**\r\n- Work needed already evaluated in spike.  Community and 'Channel in a Community' URLs don't need to be signed if this will present problems. Patryk to work on this as a continuation of the spike already done.\r\n- See priority 4 below, as this also has some implications for the tokenisation of community work.\r\n\r\n**3. Profile showcase backend**\r\n- The long-delayed profile showcase backend!  We have the UI on the desktop ready to go for this feature, and Mobile is going to need the backend for this feature as well, so let's try to get it done in 0.14 [#11081](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11081)\r\n\r\n**4. Community tokens visible in wallet when received by user who is not a member of that community**\r\n- Solution obvs. needs to be fully decenteralised and permissionless\r\n- Perhaps whenever a community token is A) sent from a Status Wallet to another user or B) airdropped by a community or C) retailed by a community, a M2M (invisible to the user) Waku message should be sent to the recipient's *ethereum address*?\r\n- This message could either: A) contain the metadata for the token B) tell the user that they have received token, and to check the metadata in either another Waku channel where Control Nodes periodically post Metadata OR check the metadata embedded in the token contract (embedding metadata in the token contract might be a better idea?).  \r\n- The token metadata stored in the token contract is signed by the Community's private key to ensure authenticity.  When the community's private key changes due to ownership of a community being transferred or due to the control node being moved, a transaction must be made to update this metadata so it is signed by the community's new private key.\r\n- See here for how a Waku message can be sent to and Ethereum address https://rfc.vac.dev/spec/20/\r\n\r\n**5. Refactor synchronisation of contacts**\r\n- To fix various contact request issues, is a large work item\r\n- Mishka and Igor to work on this?\r\n- https://github.com/status-im/status-go/issues/3720\r\n- https://github.com/status-im/status-go/issues/3803#issuecomment-1654588500\r\n\r\n**6. Discord history import into a single channel in an existing community**\r\n- Pay off any Discord history import service tech. debt first\r\n- Then build the import into a single channel functionality, designs for this are already complete\r\n\r\n**7. Community chat functionality enhancements**\r\n- Ability to mark a token gated channel as 'hidden', only visible to community members with the requisite tokens\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**--- Wallet Team ---**\r\n\r\n1.

Other combinations of markdown styling is not correctly previewed in the message input field and is not correctly rendered when the message is posted.   \r\n\r\n**Related issue**\r\nAlthough this issue is different, editing messages that contain markdown characters effects the rendering of said markdown characters. So the same issue seen here - #7804 - applies to the markdown mentioned below.     \r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n<ins>Steps to reproduce:</ins>\r\n\r\n1. Navigate to any messaging or communities screen that contains an active message input field.\r\n\r\n2. In the message input field write a message that uses all of the markdown styling that should be supported in the message body area. \r\n\r\n*Note:* Status should aim to support the markdown syntax that Discord supports today.\r\n\r\nAs a first step in this direction, Status should support:\r\n\r\n- Strikethrough \\~~Strikethrough~~ **Status currently supports this** \r\n- Italics \\*italics* or \\_italics_ **Status currently supports this** \r\n- Underline italics \\_\\_\\*underline italics*__\r\n- Bold \\*\\*bold**\r\n- Underline bold \\_\\_\\**underline bold**__\r\n- Bold Italics \\*\\*\\*bold italics***\r\n- Underline bold italics \\_\\_\\*\\*\\*underline bold italics***__\r\n- Underline \\_\\_underline__\r\n\r\n\r\n<ins>What currently incorrectly happens:</ins>\r\n \r\n3. The markdown syntax are:\r\n\r\na) not previewed correctly in the message input field (except for‘\\_italics_’, ‘\\*italics*’ and ‘\\~~Strikethrough~~’). \r\n\r\nb) not rendered correctly when the message is posted (except for ‘\\_italics_’, ‘\\*italics*’ and ‘\\~~Strikethrough~~’). Where the markdown syntax has not been rendered they are visible in the message posted in the message body area. \r\n \r\n\r\n<ins>What is supposed to happen:</ins>\r\n\r\n3. All markdown styling should be previewed in the message input field. All previewed markdown styling should be rendered and visible in the message body area after the message is posted. \r\nNone of the rendered markdown syntax should be visible in the message body area after the message is posted. \r\n\r\n\r\n<ins>Other information</ins>\r\n\r\n![33 Basci markdown stext styling functionality broken in messaging](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/124154641/222183463-ea6ae504-acb9-48ad-9b3c-d69f39c37311.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
