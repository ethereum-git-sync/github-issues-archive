Complete initial airdrop functionality**\r\n- Airdrop history screens\r\n- Ability to airdrop based on in-Community activity (No. of msg, No. msg in time range, joining a community, length of community membership)  Ability to combine multiple attributes into an airdrop\r\n- Ability to token gate airdrops\r\n- Live airdrop gas estimation when setting up airdrop\r\n\r\n**2. Token import functionality**\r\n- Ability for a community Owner to import ERC-20 and NFT tokens, to later be airdropped or retailed\r\n\r\n**3. Admin functionality enhancements**\r\n- Ability to mark a token gated channel as 'hidden', only visible to community members with the requisite tokens\r\n- optional service to once a month auto-kick all members who haven't been online for between 30 and 60 days (e.g. auto-kick members whose profile information like Name, Avatar, etc... can no longer be fetched)\r\n\r\n**4. Chat functionality enhancements**\r\n- Introduce @channel as a new type of global @ mention.  This @ mention only @ mention's everyone who has posted a message in a channel in the last 30 days \r\n\r\n**5. Binaries over Waku**\r\n- Improve transfer of binaries over waku via splitting into chunks https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/9923\r\n- Posting of small files (max size somewhere in the region of 1 to 2mb).  Requires above item before going live\r\n\r\n**6. Stress testing and perf**\r\n- Create a test user account with 5,000 mutual contacts.  See what breaks, or if this causes poor performance.  Then fix whatever found.  Realistically the requirement is 'only' for the experience of having up to 2,000 mutual contacts to work well.  But if we test with 5,000 mutual contacts, it will make it easier to see issues.\r\n- Create a test community that contains 20,000 members.  Test, see what breaks and what perf. issues are encountered.  Then fix whatever needs fixing.  Member bar is probably one area that will have issues\r\n\r\n**7. Larger items to start work on (but not deliver) during the 0.15 release cycle**\r\n- tokenisation of community ownership\r\n- opt-in auto-update functionality\r\n\r\n**8. Other (dumping space for later prioritization)**\r\n- Ensure accounts stored on Keycard are taken into consideration for community permissions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Other combinations of markdown styling is not correctly previewed in the message input field and is not correctly rendered when the message is posted.   \r\n\r\n**Related issue**\r\nAlthough this issue is different, editing messages that contain markdown characters effects the rendering of said markdown characters. So the same issue seen here - #7804 - applies to the markdown mentioned below.     \r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n<ins>Steps to reproduce:</ins>\r\n\r\n1. Navigate to any messaging or communities screen that contains an active message input field.\r\n\r\n2. In the message input field write a message that uses all of the markdown styling that should be supported in the message body area. \r\n\r\n*Note:* Status should aim to support the markdown syntax that Discord supports today.\r\n\r\nAs a first step in this direction, Status should support:\r\n\r\n- Strikethrough \\~~Strikethrough~~ **Status currently supports this** \r\n- Italics \\*italics* or \\_italics_ **Status currently supports this** \r\n- Underline italics \\_\\_\\*underline italics*__\r\n- Bold \\*\\*bold**\r\n- Underline bold \\_\\_\\**underline bold**__\r\n- Bold Italics \\*\\*\\*bold italics***\r\n- Underline bold italics \\_\\_\\*\\*\\*underline bold italics***__\r\n- Underline \\_\\_underline__\r\n\r\n\r\n<ins>What currently incorrectly happens:</ins>\r\n \r\n3.

Where the markdown syntax has not been rendered they are visible in the message posted in the message body area. \r\n \r\n\r\n<ins>What is supposed to happen:</ins>\r\n\r\n3. All markdown styling should be previewed in the message input field.
