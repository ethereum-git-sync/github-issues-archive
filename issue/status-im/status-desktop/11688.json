One question here would be: Is it worth the effort to move the state outside of settings view?\r\n\r\nThe other options I see here are:\r\n1. to preserve the view once it's been loaded.\r\n2. A hybrid approach - Save the general state and unload the view **if** it's not dirty. Otherwise preserve the entire view.\r\n\r\nIMO would be nice to have the entire UI state saved when switching views because I personally find it a bad UX to discard the work in progress without notification.\r\n\r\n",
