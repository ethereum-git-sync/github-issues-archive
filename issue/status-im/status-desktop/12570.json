Get the data from the DB if it is there or show a loading state\r\n2. Sub to topics\r\n3. Fetch from store nodes\r\n4. Update with any new description received\r\n\r\nThis above should all already be present in the app, so just the backend part is needed to be changed.\r\n\r\n#### Notes\r\n\r\n- Make sure mobile supports the links so we don,t break anything for them\r\n- Don,' use the data in the received URL, just the ID and shard info to fetch from store nodes\r\n",
