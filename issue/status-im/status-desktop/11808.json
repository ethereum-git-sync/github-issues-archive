  "body": "# Bug Report\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nIf as an owner, you update the community, or even if an admin updates the community, even just the name, it makes the control node freeze for a few seconds.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't feel good and also in most cases, it's probably useless. \r\n\r\nI think it's because it redoes the channel permission checks, but if you don't touch the permissions, it doesn't need to do that.\r\n\r\nAnyway, if it does have to do the permission checks, it would be better to do them async afterwards.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n0. Have a community with community permissions (mine has 3 minted collectibles, a permission to join and one to admin)\r\n1. Edit the community name as the owner\r\n-> control node freezes\r\n2. Edit the community as an admin\r\n-> control node also freezes\r\n\r\n[slow.webm](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/11926403/05827740-464f-4eb8-93d4-8c3a874c962a)\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nApp stays responsive after an edit.\r\n\r\nIf the edit doesn't touch the permissions, no permission check is done.\r\n\r\nIf there are permission edits, the permission checks are done async\r\n\r\n#### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe app freezes on the control node when any edit is made, by the owner or by an admin\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n- Status desktop version: master `20790a4c2a22a07c1c43e19e80b6f8873f3c8408`\r\n- Operating System: Ubuntu 20\r\n\r\n\r\n",
