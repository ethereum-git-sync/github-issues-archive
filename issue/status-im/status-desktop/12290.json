  "body": "Been enjoying the latest desktop updates and I love the progress you've been making! Just wanted to share some issues I encountered with my keycap/emoji ENS name to make the whole thing even more amazing for my fellow ENS peeps.\r\n\r\n1. My keycap ENS name doesn't render properly yet on desktop in my profile card as well is in any chats. It has always rendered properly in the old mobile app. I think the relevant feature/function in the ens library to fix this is 'beautify()', I hope it's easy to do in the desktop codebase. Otherwise raffy.eth, the main author of these libraries, has been very easy to approach and willing to help with these kinds of things.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2023-09-28 at 18 25 41](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/111353556/dcec3c42-4168-4fd9-9f7f-112e3ad6435e)\r\n\r\n2. There is no name showing in the login screen, I'd expect either at least the unbeautified version of my ens as in the picture above or preferrably the beautified version.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2023-09-28 at 19 11 02](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/111353556/57deed06-32be-4ae1-8e60-ec7d20fa0056)\r\n\r\nHope y'all can fix this, I know a lot of ens people with emoji names would appreciate having this kind of stuff displayed properly. Keep up the great work!",
