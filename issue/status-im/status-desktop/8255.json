  "body": "# Introduction\r\n\r\nCurrently, some QML components are loaded after the user logs in and in some cases not for a good reason. This causes the following issues:\r\n- Slow compilation of QML components at high loading time after login\r\n  - Given that the QML is not currently compiled into binary this operation is done when the component is instantiated\r\n- Unnecessary global binding evaluation due to missing a proper dependency model\r\n  - Currently, we are serving the \"controller\" and \"data models\" as global context properties. Then we bind those properties to all the loaded views. That means when a value changes some of the bindings of the properties of hidden views are triggered even if the end result is not shown to the user. This is even more accentuated by the fact that we have considerable QML JS code that is evaluated on binding triggering.\r\n\r\n## Actions to improve this\r\n\r\nUntil the C++ refactoring is available, which is planned to address this issue from the design, the current Nim codebase can already be refactored to lazy load views and dialogues that are not main user flows.\r\n\r\nKnow candidates:\r\n- [ ] `ReceiveModal` - Light to load, binds to networks model. More info in the discussion thread https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/pull/8202#issuecomment-1315379172\r\n  - A follow-up on instantiating the Networks Proxy declaratively in QML instead of a `transaction.View` property will help also help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
