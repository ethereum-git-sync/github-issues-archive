    "body": "> Current sequence: change password dialog appeared, and after saving the new password appeared biometrics and sign out & quit. Should I change this sequence?\r\n\r\nThe design doesn't seem up to date and I don't have a Mac to test it out.\r\n\r\nMaybe it's worth to go on Status and ping the designers about this. I'm not exactly sure what is the wanted behaviour when a user has biometrics and we want to change passwords. It seems from looking at the designs here https://www.figma.com/file/17fc13UBFvInrLgNUKJJg5/Kuba%E2%8E%9CDesktop?node-id=1023%3A298171&t=B3OUN2Z3OxBLYdiN-0 that if you set biometrics, you don't actually use a password.\r\n\r\nSo I'm guessing the goal here is to make it so that if you were using biometrics, but want to change it to using password, we go back to the password creation screen?\r\nAnyway, ask a designer to clarify. Mario is in charge of onboarding, but Ben and Julia and in charge of profile, so might as well ping all 3 lol",

What I did in the mobile for changing password flow when a user has biometrics activated: https://www.figma.com/file/vivAF5JmeyFBz1791nwD7r/Privacy-%26-Security?node-id=3764%3A201369&t=dTs02Gx1RPPrqXas-1\r\n\r\n\r\n(Don't be surprised about 2 fields on this screen instead of 3 I thought if biometrics is activated, and we know the current user password, there is no need to ask them to enter the current password) \r\n\r\nSo if a user wants to change their password, \r\nthey go to Settings --> create a new one -->, restart the app -->, log in again",

That further means on next app run, when user logs in using new password we offer him to store that new password to a keychain (that's something which is already in place).\r\n  - `keycard user`\r\nchange password should be disabled in this case\r\n- `enabled/disable biometrics` (so far a feature available only to mac users)\r\n  - `regular user`\r\nwhen user disables biometrics we just need to set `storeToKeychain` prop locally to `never`, when user enables it, we need to let user enter a current password, check it and if it's valid we need to store it to keychain and update `storeToKeychain` prop to store\r\n  - `keycard user`\r\nthis feature needs to be enabled only if user has migrated his profile keypair to a keycard, in that case when user disables biometrics we just need to set `storeToKeychain` prop locally to `never`, when user enables it we need to run appropriate flow and ask him for a keycard where his profile keypair is migrated to and once he enters a correct pin we need to store it to keychain and update `storeToKeychain` prop to `store`.",
