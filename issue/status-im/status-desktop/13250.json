First community collectible received\r\n3. Any other community asset received\r\n4. Any other community collectible received.\r\n\r\nIn #13116 was introduced backend support for the 3rd use case.\r\n\r\nThis task pretends to cover backend support for the rest of use cases and also to provide more information to the UI according to the new / last design changes. \r\n\r\nThat means `communityTokenReceived` API from `src/app/modules/main/communities/tokens/view.nim` needs to include: `tokenType`, `isFirst` and `walletAccountName` new parameters:\r\n- `isFirst` property will be true if it's the first time the user receives a community asset and  a community collectible\r\n-  `tokenType` property will determine if the received minted token is an ERC20 or an ERC720\r\n-  `walletAccountName` property will provide the wallet account name where the token was received\r\n\r\nOnce backend is ready, update `CommunityTokensStore.qml/onCommunityTokenReceived` accordingly.",
