Finish items started in 0.12**\r\n- Complete any outstanding issues related to pairing (for syncing) - Igor\r\n- Implement the 'Admin' role (issue #10114) - Mykhailo\r\n- Any remaining work to pay off tech. debt related to mutual contacts - Mishka\r\n- When creating/editing token based permission, ability to search for and selecting Collectables from OpenSea - MichaelC\r\n\r\n**2. Channel token permissions**\r\n- Create, edit and delete channel token permissions in the permissions admin screens\r\n- This includes the \"no tokens required to view this channel\" permission\r\n- All user facing channel token permissions functionality e.g. what happens when a user tries to access a token gated channel they don't have the required tokens to access, what happens when a user only has permissions to view a channel, etc...\r\n- If a community is an open (not token gated at the community level) community, if a channel is token gated AND if **no** \"no tokens required to view this channel\" permission for that channel exists, then the channel should be automatically encrypted.  If token gating is removed from a channel, the channel should become unencrypted.\r\n\r\n**3. DB perf improvements**\r\n- https://www.notion.so/Database-related-performance-1dbaa7ea894c461d885e55676683be07\r\n- Alex and Patryk to work on this, with help from Lukáš\r\n\r\n**4. Update app to use new 'Share URL' formats**\r\n- add functionality to status-go to generate the new 'Share URL' formats for sharing links to: User Profiles, Communities, Channel inside a Community (issue https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/10851)\r\n- Update everywhere a user can share a URL from to use the new URL format (issue https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/10852)\r\n- New/updated URL unroll designs for inside chat, including specific unrolls for the new User Profile, Community and Channel inside a Community URLs (issue https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/10585)\r\n- Ability to share a URL that points to a specific channel in a community (issue #10160)\r\n- Update all address inputs to accept a user pasting a 'share URL' into the input (in addition to being able to input the raw address).  This includes: Start new chat input, send contact request input in Settings, the import community key input, etc...\r\n- Update Status Desktops URL handler so that if Status is installed on a computer, when a user clicks on a Status 'Share URL' the app is launched (if not already running) and after signing in the user is automatically taken to the entity the Share URL represented inside the app.  e.g. if a user clicks on a URL for a Status Community, the user should be taken to the home screen for that community inside the Status App\r\n\r\n**5. Mint Assets functionality**\r\n- Also includes some small improvements to the mint Collectables functionality\r\n- Noelia, GravityBlast\r\n\r\n**6. Profile showcase backend**\r\n\r\n\r\n**--- For the Wallet team ---**\r\ntldr; continue building out Ben's wallet designs\r\n\r\n1. Complete any outstanding development related to the activity screens\r\n2. All accounts overview screens\r\n3. New settings screens\r\n4. Implement 'imported key and account' syncing and transfer between devices\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "@borismelnik the issue here is not to reduce the logs for the sake of showing less logs, but rather to figure out why Jonathan sees a lot of logs that look like\r\n\r\n```\r\n2023-05-03T13:39:51.270-0400\tINFO\tcommunities/manager.go:193\timporting message archive, 1 left\r\n2023-05-03T13:39:51.270-0400\tINFO\tcommunities/manager.go:193\textracting messages from history archive\t{\"archive id\": \"0xe069f871b66ffdd1414fcf7157c26824340b43850d0e1014ab2390ab930ff700\"}\r\n2023-05-03T13:39:51.270-0400\tINFO\tcommunities/manager.go:193\tfailed to unmarshal protocol message\t{\"error\": \"string field contains invalid UTF-8\"}\r\n2023-05-03T13:39:51.270-0400\tINFO\tcommunities/manager.go:193\tfailed to extract history archive messages\t{\"error\": \"string field contains invalid UTF-8\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, the first step is to figure out, what does \"a lot of logs like this\" mean? Is the pattern above repeating? Is it  the unmarshal + extraction error that is repeating?\r\n\r\nNeed to look into his Status folder and check the logs for that.\r\nIf we see that it keeps failing to unmarshal then this means data is corrupted.\r\n\r\nThen the next step would be to look into which data is corrupted and ideally why and whether it's reproducible..",

It has imported all other ones (at least it thinks it does).\r\n\r\nAs you both pointed out, it's however failing to extract archive messages because it can't find the archive index file.\r\nThe archive index file is a file that keeps track of all archives that exist in the torrent and tells the node, where to find specific archive data in the `data` file (which lives next right tot he `index` file.\r\n\r\nIf you've removed the `index` file from your archivedata folder, then it will never be able to figure out what archives to import.\r\n\r\n> Ah you're right, I think it's files I deleted when I created the archive for the first time (to reduce its size). It makes sense that it doesn't find it.\r\n\r\nThis is something you should not do if you aren't sure the data hasn't been complete imported.\r\nAlso, removing the files in that archivedata folder also means that, when you seed the torrent yourself (which your node will try to do), the data to seed will not be available (torrent client might even error out, not sure)",

However unmarshaling failed.\r\n\r\nUnmarshaling into a certain struct fails when the data to unmarshal doesn't match the shape of the struct.\r\nIn our case, there are two places where this can happen:\r\n\r\n1. The archive data to be extracted is encrypted. So unmarshaling this into an archive protobuf will fail as the encrypted data doesn't have the correct shape. We need to decrypt it first.\r\n2. When unmarshaling fails the first time, we assume it's due to encryption, so we'll first decrypt the extracted bytes, **then** try unmarshaling again (which should then work). If it still fails (which it does in your case), then the data is broken.\r\n\r\nAny chances you've somehow cancelled the data download? I assume most likely some bytes where missing for the archive in question.",
