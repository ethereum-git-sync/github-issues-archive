    "description": "Priorities **in priority order** for the 0.12 milestone:  \r\n\r\n**1. Improve performance**\r\n- Focus on eliminating any UI freezes when the user clicks on something and the app does not display an immediate response.  Target: the app should ideally respond to all user input within 50ms, but let's start with identifying the longest UI freezes and trying to fix the worst UI freezes first.\r\n- Speed and responsiveness of switching between community channels, and 1on1 and ad-hoc group chats is particularly important, especially for channels and chats that contains a lot of history.  We should aim for about 250ms delay in the *worst* case if possible.  Having a lot of history in a channel should not slow channel switching down.\r\n- DB perf optimisations.  \r\n- Move things to async and off main thread\r\n- See Alex's great profiling work for possible tasks (Alex to continue focusing on perf. for this release cycle)\r\n- \"user facing performance in everyday app usage\" is the top priority, but any task that improves performance is worthwhile\r\n\r\n**2. Finish development of token based functionality from 0.11**\r\n- Optimise No. queries made by owner node when checking member tokens (Pascal)\r\n- Community encryption should automatically switch on/off depending on community permissions (issue #9942)\r\n- Implement the 'Admin' role (issue #10114)\r\n- Airdrop to community members (in addition to addresses)\r\n- Optimise gas required by collectable minting smart contracts (issue #9943, GravityBlast)\r\n--- After collectable minting gas optimisation is complete, start work on Asset minting contracts (GravityBlast)\r\n- Complete token remote destruct UI\r\n- Remove 'Community Permissions Settings', 'Community Tokens' and 'Discord Import Tool' feature flags (issue #10115)\r\n- Thoroughly test, and fix all bugs found. \r\n- Anything else related to Community level token permissions, collectable minting, airdropping, and remote destructing that didn't make it into 0.11\r\n\r\n**3. Finish implementing the ability for Community Owners and Admins to drag and drop channels and categories into different orders**\r\n\r\n**4. Finish anything related to the initial pairing process for syncing that wasn't completed in 0.11** (Igor)\r\n\r\n**5. Improve Mutual Contacts functionality to improve reliability and pay off tech debt** (Mishka)\r\n\r\n**6. Complete Community Directory Curation dApp integration inc. Featured functionality** (Patryk)\r\n \r\n**7. Backend for the Profile Showcase**\r\n\r\n**8. Identity Verification** (required for 'Profile Showcase')\r\n\r\n**9. Fix bugs, bugs and more bugs!**\r\n- Esp. find the cause of and fix the longstanding bug of some 'requests to join' not arriving for hours/days after they were sent!\r\n- Many 'fit and finish' bugs for the UI team\r\n\r\n**--- For the Wallet team ---**\r\n\r\n1. Continue feature development inc. kicking off development of the activity screens\r\n2. 'All accounts' section.  The ability to return all tokens owned by the user in all accounts (excluding watch only accounts) is also required for the Showcase functionality\r\n3. Widen scope of 'backup to waku' and 'syncing' so that all relevant Wallet user state is backed up and synced between devices\r\n4. Continue to ensure Wallet functionality is performant.\r\n5. Fix wallet bugs",

  "body": "Version: 0.9\r\nOS: Windows 10\r\n\r\nThe Channel Colour selector is currently in a new dialog on top of the previous dialog, when it should instead be a screen *inside* the previous dialog. \r\n\r\nIssues include: \r\n- the dialogue header title and the back button are missing\r\n- the copy under ‘Preview’ needs to be updated to say “White text should be legible on top of this colour”\r\n- the “Select Colour” button needs to be updated to “Select Channel Colour” and the modal \r\ndialog itself is the wrong size (it should be the same size as the previous dialog). \r\n\r\n**Desired outcome:** The Channel Colour selector dialog should match the Community Colour selector dialog.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n<ins>Steps to reproduce:</ins>\r\n\r\n1. Click on a Community you are the Owner of in the primary nav bar\r\n\r\n2. In the secondary nav right click on a Channel to ‘Edit Channel’\r\n\r\n3. In the Edit Channel dialog under ‘Channel colour’, click on the button that opens the Channel Colour selector\r\n\r\n<ins>What currently incorrectly happens:</ins>\r\n\r\n4. In the Channel Colour selector, the following is either missing or needs to be updated;\r\n\r\n- Header “Channel Colour” is missing\r\n\r\n- The back button which should be positioned bottom left of the dialog is missing.\r\n\r\n- The bottom right primary actions button copy that currently says “Select Colour” should say “Select Channel Colour” instead.\r\n\r\n- The copy under Preview should read “White text should be legible on top of this colour” instead of the colour code.\r\n\r\n- The channel colour selector is opened in its own dialog on top of the previous dialog. This is incorrect, it is supposed to be a screen *inside* the previous modal dialogue. \r\n\r\nIn order to fit the colour selector into the previous ‘Edit Channel’ modal dialogue (which is the correct size, but smaller) , the ‘Standard colour’ selector circles will need to be split into two lines (four on each line) instead of having eight on a single line.\r\n\r\n\r\n<ins>What is supposed to happen:</ins>\r\n\r\n4. The Channel Colour selector dialog should be very similar to the colour selector accessed from the ‘Create New Community’ dialog (accessed via the ‘Create New Community’ button in the Communities Portal).\r\n\r\nThe only differences should be the header (which should read “Channel Colour”), the button in the button right (which should read “Select Channel Colour”) and the Standard colours selector that will need to be split onto two rows each containing four colour buttons.   \r\n\r\nSee screenshot below\r\n\r\n<ins>Other information</ins>\r\n\r\n![30 Channel Colour selector dialog](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/124154641/222177642-3699f5e3-2e25-4149-b8c0-d70cbb9d6885.png)\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/124154641/222177193-42b0b4ec-ec0d-4675-b471-8c6c1e4ea3f2.mp4\r\n",
