    "description": "Priorities **in priority order** for the 0.13 milestone:\r\n\r\n**1. Finish items started in 0.12**\r\n- Complete any outstanding issues related to pairing (for syncing) - Igor\r\n- Implement the 'Admin' role (issue #10114) - Mykhailo\r\n- 'Featured' category curation via curation dApp - Patryk\r\n- Any remaining work to pay off tech. debt related to mutual contacts - Mishka\r\n- When creating/editing token based permission, ability to search for and selecting Collectables from OpenSea - MichaelC\r\n\r\n**2. Channel token permissions**\r\n- Create, edit and delete channel token permissions in the permissions admin screens\r\n- This includes the \"no tokens required to view this channel\" permission\r\n- All user facing channel token permissions functionality e.g. what happens when a user tries to access a token gated channel they don't have the required tokens to access, what happens when a user only has permissions to view a channel, etc...\r\n- If a community is an open (not token gated at the community level) community, if a channel is token gated AND if **no** \"no tokens required to view this channel\" permission for that channel exists, then the channel should be automatically encrypted.  If token gating is removed from a channel, the channel should become unencrypted.\r\n- Asset (ERC-20) minting and airdropping functionality - GravityBlast\r\n\r\n**3. Add some type of cache in front of sqlite to ensure that writes don't block reads (Patryk?)**\r\n- It has been discovered that one of the causes of sometimes slow channel switching is that writes to sqlite block reads, and this is the cause of slow channel switching in many cases\r\n- Investigate the feasibility of (and if feasible implement) a general purpose cache for sqlite writes, which caches sqlite writes and then only writes them to sqlite in small chunks when no read operations are taking place (so that read operations are always prioritized, and not interrupted by writes).  Such a cache should cache all or almost all write requests from all areas of status-go\r\n\r\n**_OR_**\r\n\r\n- Perhaps it's time to bite the bullet and start the work needed to migrate both Status Desktop and Status Mobile from using sqlite to using PostgreSQL?\r\n\r\n**_OR_**\r\n\r\n- Perhaps there are some other possible solutions to this issue that should be explored before embarking on either of these large items?\r\n\r\n**4. Update app to use new 'Share URL' formats**\r\n- add functionality to status-go to generate the new 'Share URL' formats for sharing links to: User Profiles, Communities, Channel inside a Community\r\n- Update everywhere a user can share a URL from to use the new URL format\r\n- Ability to share a URL that points to a specific channel in a community (issue #10160)\r\n- Update all address inputs to accept a user pasting a 'share URL' into the input (in addition to being able to input the raw address).  This includes: Start new chat input, send contact request input in Settings, the import community key input, etc...\r\n- Update Status Desktops URL handler so that if Status is installed on a computer, when a user clicks on a Status 'Share URL' the app is launched (if not already running) and after signing in the user is automatically taken to the entity the Share URL represented inside the app.  e.g. if a user clicks on a URL for a Status Community, the user should be taken to the home screen for that community inside the Status App\r\n\r\n**5. Profile showcase backend***\r\n\r\n**6. Fix bugs, bugs and more bugs!**\r\n- The 0.13 release is targeted to be Status Desktop's first \"beta\" release, and the first release of Status Desktop that will be used by people outside of the Status Org.  So we want this release to be the best possible quality so it makes a good first impression  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**--- For the Wallet team ---**\r\n\r\n1. Complete any outstanding development related to the activity screens\r\n2. New settings screens\r\n3. Fix 'backup from waku' bugs\r\n4. Fix keycard bugs\r\n5. Implement 'imported key and account' syncing and transfer between devices\r\n6. Transaction signing dialogue (if designs are ready)\r\n\r\n",

  "body": "Version: 0.9\r\nOS: Windows 10\r\n\r\nThe Channel Colour selector is currently in a new dialog on top of the previous dialog, when it should instead be a screen *inside* the previous dialog. \r\n\r\nIssues include: \r\n- the dialogue header title and the back button are missing\r\n- the copy under ‘Preview’ needs to be updated to say “White text should be legible on top of this colour”\r\n- the “Select Colour” button needs to be updated to “Select Channel Colour” and the modal \r\ndialog itself is the wrong size (it should be the same size as the previous dialog). \r\n\r\n**Desired outcome:** The Channel Colour selector dialog should match the Community Colour selector dialog.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n<ins>Steps to reproduce:</ins>\r\n\r\n1. Click on a Community you are the Owner of in the primary nav bar\r\n\r\n2. In the secondary nav right click on a Channel to ‘Edit Channel’\r\n\r\n3. In the Edit Channel dialog under ‘Channel colour’, click on the button that opens the Channel Colour selector\r\n\r\n<ins>What currently incorrectly happens:</ins>\r\n\r\n4. In the Channel Colour selector, the following is either missing or needs to be updated;\r\n\r\n- Header “Channel Colour” is missing\r\n\r\n- The back button which should be positioned bottom left of the dialog is missing.\r\n\r\n- The bottom right primary actions button copy that currently says “Select Colour” should say “Select Channel Colour” instead.\r\n\r\n- The copy under Preview should read “White text should be legible on top of this colour” instead of the colour code.\r\n\r\n- The channel colour selector is opened in its own dialog on top of the previous dialog. This is incorrect, it is supposed to be a screen *inside* the previous modal dialogue. \r\n\r\nIn order to fit the colour selector into the previous ‘Edit Channel’ modal dialogue (which is the correct size, but smaller) , the ‘Standard colour’ selector circles will need to be split into two lines (four on each line) instead of having eight on a single line.\r\n\r\n\r\n<ins>What is supposed to happen:</ins>\r\n\r\n4. The Channel Colour selector dialog should be very similar to the colour selector accessed from the ‘Create New Community’ dialog (accessed via the ‘Create New Community’ button in the Communities Portal).\r\n\r\nThe only differences should be the header (which should read “Channel Colour”), the button in the button right (which should read “Select Channel Colour”) and the Standard colours selector that will need to be split onto two rows each containing four colour buttons.   \r\n\r\nSee screenshot below\r\n\r\n<ins>Other information</ins>\r\n\r\n![30 Channel Colour selector dialog](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/124154641/222177642-3699f5e3-2e25-4149-b8c0-d70cbb9d6885.png)\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/124154641/222177193-42b0b4ec-ec0d-4675-b471-8c6c1e4ea3f2.mp4\r\n",
