We need to keep tech. debt at a roughly fixed level as we grow out functionality, can't let it accumulate! ;-)\r\n\r\n**2. Tokenisation of community ownership**\r\n\r\n- Work needed already evaluated in spike.  Community and 'Channel in a Community' URLs don't need to be signed if this will present problems. Patryk to work on this as a continuation of the spike already done.\r\n- See priority 4 below, as this also has some implications for the tokenisation of community work.\r\n\r\n**3. Profile showcase backend**\r\n- The long-delayed profile showcase backend!  We have the UI on the desktop ready to go for this feature, and Mobile is going to need the backend for this feature as well, so let's try to get it done in 0.14 [#11081](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11081)\r\n\r\n**4. Community tokens visible in wallet when received by user who is not a member of that community**\r\n- Solution obvs. needs to be fully decenteralised and permissionless\r\n- Perhaps whenever a community token is A) sent from a Status Wallet to another user or B) airdropped by a community or C) retailed by a community, a M2M (invisible to the user) Waku message should be sent to the recipient's *ethereum address*?\r\n- This message could either: A) contain the metadata for the token B) tell the user that they have received token, and to check the metadata in either another Waku channel where Control Nodes periodically post Metadata OR check the metadata embedded in the token contract (embedding metadata in the token contract might be a better idea?).  \r\n- The token metadata stored in the token contract is signed by the Community's private key to ensure authenticity.  When the community's private key changes due to ownership of a community being transferred or due to the control node being moved, a transaction must be made to update this metadata so it is signed by the community's new private key.\r\n- See here for how a Waku message can be sent to and Ethereum address https://rfc.vac.dev/spec/20/\r\n\r\n**5. Discord history import into a single channel in an existing community**\r\n- Pay off any Discord history import service tech. debt first\r\n- Then build the import into a single channel functionality, designs for this are already complete\r\n\r\n**6. Complete initial airdrop functionality**\r\n- Airdrop history screens\r\n- Ability to airdrop based on in-Community activity (No. of msg, No. msg in time range, joining a community, length of community membership)  Ability to combine multiple attributes into an airdrop\r\n- Ability to token gate airdrops\r\n- Live airdrop gas estimation when setting up airdrop\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**--- Wallet Team ---**\r\n\r\n1. Sending Community created tokens to Status users who are not members of that community\r\n- See priority 4) in the messaging priorities list above.\r\n\r\n2. Send NFT functionality\r\n\r\n3.

  "body": "Version: 0.9\r\nOS: Windows 10\r\n\r\nThe Channel Colour selector is currently in a new dialog on top of the previous dialog, when it should instead be a screen *inside* the previous dialog. \r\n\r\nIssues include: \r\n- the dialogue header title and the back button are missing\r\n- the copy under ‘Preview’ needs to be updated to say “White text should be legible on top of this colour”\r\n- the “Select Colour” button needs to be updated to “Select Channel Colour” and the modal \r\ndialog itself is the wrong size (it should be the same size as the previous dialog). \r\n\r\n**Desired outcome:** The Channel Colour selector dialog should match the Community Colour selector dialog.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n<ins>Steps to reproduce:</ins>\r\n\r\n1. Click on a Community you are the Owner of in the primary nav bar\r\n\r\n2. In the secondary nav right click on a Channel to ‘Edit Channel’\r\n\r\n3. In the Edit Channel dialog under ‘Channel colour’, click on the button that opens the Channel Colour selector\r\n\r\n<ins>What currently incorrectly happens:</ins>\r\n\r\n4. In the Channel Colour selector, the following is either missing or needs to be updated;\r\n\r\n- Header “Channel Colour” is missing\r\n\r\n- The back button which should be positioned bottom left of the dialog is missing.\r\n\r\n- The bottom right primary actions button copy that currently says “Select Colour” should say “Select Channel Colour” instead.\r\n\r\n- The copy under Preview should read “White text should be legible on top of this colour” instead of the colour code.\r\n\r\n- The channel colour selector is opened in its own dialog on top of the previous dialog. This is incorrect, it is supposed to be a screen *inside* the previous modal dialogue. \r\n\r\nIn order to fit the colour selector into the previous ‘Edit Channel’ modal dialogue (which is the correct size, but smaller) , the ‘Standard colour’ selector circles will need to be split into two lines (four on each line) instead of having eight on a single line.\r\n\r\n\r\n<ins>What is supposed to happen:</ins>\r\n\r\n4. The Channel Colour selector dialog should be very similar to the colour selector accessed from the ‘Create New Community’ dialog (accessed via the ‘Create New Community’ button in the Communities Portal).\r\n\r\nThe only differences should be the header (which should read “Channel Colour”), the button in the button right (which should read “Select Channel Colour”) and the Standard colours selector that will need to be split onto two rows each containing four colour buttons.   \r\n\r\nSee screenshot below\r\n\r\n<ins>Other information</ins>\r\n\r\n![30 Channel Colour selector dialog](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/124154641/222177642-3699f5e3-2e25-4149-b8c0-d70cbb9d6885.png)\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/124154641/222177193-42b0b4ec-ec0d-4675-b471-8c6c1e4ea3f2.mp4\r\n",
