  "body": "Version: 0.9\r\nOS: Windows 10\r\n\r\nThe Channel Colour selector is currently in a new dialog on top of the previous dialog, when it should instead be a screen *inside* the previous dialog. \r\n\r\nIssues include: \r\n- the dialogue header title and the back button are missing\r\n- the copy under ‘Preview’ needs to be updated to say “White text should be legible on top of this colour”\r\n- the “Select Colour” button needs to be updated to “Select Channel Colour” and the modal \r\ndialog itself is the wrong size (it should be the same size as the previous dialog). \r\n\r\n**Desired outcome:** The Channel Colour selector dialog should match the Community Colour selector dialog.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n<ins>Steps to reproduce:</ins>\r\n\r\n1. Click on a Community you are the Owner of in the primary nav bar\r\n\r\n2. In the secondary nav right click on a Channel to ‘Edit Channel’\r\n\r\n3. In the Edit Channel dialog under ‘Channel colour’, click on the button that opens the Channel Colour selector\r\n\r\n<ins>What currently incorrectly happens:</ins>\r\n\r\n4. In the Channel Colour selector, the following is either missing or needs to be updated;\r\n\r\n- Header “Channel Colour” is missing\r\n\r\n- The back button which should be positioned bottom left of the dialog is missing.\r\n\r\n- The bottom right primary actions button copy that currently says “Select Colour” should say “Select Channel Colour” instead.\r\n\r\n- The copy under Preview should read “White text should be legible on top of this colour” instead of the colour code.\r\n\r\n- The channel colour selector is opened in its own dialog on top of the previous dialog. This is incorrect, it is supposed to be a screen *inside* the previous modal dialogue. \r\n\r\nIn order to fit the colour selector into the previous ‘Edit Channel’ modal dialogue (which is the correct size, but smaller) , the ‘Standard colour’ selector circles will need to be split into two lines (four on each line) instead of having eight on a single line.\r\n\r\n\r\n<ins>What is supposed to happen:</ins>\r\n\r\n4. The Channel Colour selector dialog should be very similar to the colour selector accessed from the ‘Create New Community’ dialog (accessed via the ‘Create New Community’ button in the Communities Portal).\r\n\r\nThe only differences should be the header (which should read “Channel Colour”), the button in the button right (which should read “Select Channel Colour”) and the Standard colours selector that will need to be split onto two rows each containing four colour buttons.   \r\n\r\nSee screenshot below\r\n\r\n<ins>Other information</ins>\r\n\r\n![30 Channel Colour selector dialog](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/124154641/222177642-3699f5e3-2e25-4149-b8c0-d70cbb9d6885.png)\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/124154641/222177193-42b0b4ec-ec0d-4675-b471-8c6c1e4ea3f2.mp4\r\n",
