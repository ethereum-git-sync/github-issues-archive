Token permissions to enable control of community smart contracts**\r\n- Before a community founder can use any of the community token admin functionality, they first have to deploy Owner and Token Master contracts.\r\n- This work involves: new empty state screen for Mint and Airdrop tokens (before current empty state screen is revealed), new flow for deploying the community's Owner and Token Master contracts in a single step, a fixed uneditable permission giving anybody who holds the Token Master token admin rights for the community should be automatically created.\r\n- Only the holder of the single Owner token can access the Token Master airdrop, remote destruct, and view holders functions. Anybody who holds the Token Master token can access all token admin options, excluding those related to the Token Master token itself, as well as being and Admin of the community.\r\n- This will all be explained in more detail in the designs.\r\n\r\nBackend Epic: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11249\r\n\r\n**2. Update Community Admin home screen inc control node transfer and associated dialogues**\r\n- Remove ability for a Owner to leave a community on the computer that's running as that community's control node\r\n- Community Admin home screen cleanup (inc. adding at least one of the three graphs, whichever is easiest to implement).\r\n  - Graph issue: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11152  \r\n  - Community overview: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11278\r\n\r\n**3. Ability for user to select & manage accounts shared with each community control node**\r\n- This item is quite a bit of work\r\n- Touches Community settings, as well as all of the community join flows\r\n- Backend issues: \r\n  - Join API: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11154\r\n  - Edit API: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11153\r\n\r\n**4. Encryption for token gated channels that are inside Open (not token gated) communities**\r\n[#10998](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/10998)\r\n\r\n**5. Final screens and bits and bobs needed prior to public beta**\r\n- Modal that's shown every time after login, reminding user's that Status Desktop is in Beta [#11044](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11044)\r\n- The bug with 'requests to join' a community not constantly arriving, or sometimes arriving after a delay, must be fixed. [#8264](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/8264)\r\n- Anything that didn't get completed in 0.13 related to new share URL format\r\n- All the outstanding bugs and small items that got pushed into the 0.14 milestone.\r\n\r\n\r\n**--- Things that we SHOULD NOT work on during the 0.14 cycle ---**\r\n- Messaging and UI teams shouldn't work on perf. in 0.14 (but Wallet team should!)\r\n- Anything big mutual contacts related, other than fixing small bugs we find like #10497 #10498 #11120 #11121  (hopefully this functionality working good enough now!)\r\n\r\n**--- Wallet Team ---**\r\n\r\n1. Finish any outstanding work related to Activity screens (top priority - aim to have complete by July 14th)\r\n\r\n2. Updated Wallet Settings screens UI inc. account syncing functionality  *Synced information should immediately be reflected in the UI after it is received (sometimes synced info is currently only displayed after the next app restart, this needs to be fixed)*\r\n\r\n3. Wallet performance and memory consumption optimisations\r\n\r\n4. Fix bugs, clean up loose ends (to get things in a good state before the work on the Mobile wallet starts)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "I have completed the spike with a [POC](https://github.com/status-im/status-go/pull/3727) that verifies the control node can be altered without affecting deeper layers, such as message_sender/transport.\r\n\r\nEven though the deeper layers don't need to be modified, the task is not as straightforward as merely updating the community's private key. Several issues need to be addressed:\r\n\r\n- The community id is inferred from the message's signer in many places, which will be incorrect if the control node is changed.\r\n    - Solution: Extend protobufs with a community id, as shown in the example below:\r\n```diff\r\nmessage CommunityDescription {\r\n   map<string, CommunityTokenPermission> token_permissions = 15;\r\n   repeated CommunityTokenMetadata community_tokens_metadata = 16;\r\n   uint64 active_members_count = 17;\r\n+  string ID = 18;\r\n }\r\n```    \r\n```diff\r\n     func (m *Manager) HandleCommunityDescriptionMessage(signer *ecdsa.PublicKey, description *protobuf.CommunityDescription, payload []byte) (*CommunityResponse, error) {\r\n \tif signer == nil {\r\n \t\treturn nil, errors.New(\"signer can't be nil\")\r\n \t}\r\n \r\n-\tid := crypto.CompressPubkey(signer)\r\n+\tid, err := types.DecodeHex(description.ID)\r\n+\tif err != nil {\r\n+\t\treturn nil, err\r\n+\t}\r\n```\r\n- The CommunityDescription's Clock might conflict with other control node clocks. Consider the following scenario:\r\nUserA is the control node.\r\nUserA broadcasts communityDescrX (clock==0).\r\nUserA broadcasts communityDescrY (clock==1).\r\nThe control node changes in the contract, and now the control node is UserB.\r\nNow, when UserB comes online (assuming UserB did not receive communityDescrY), UserB will broadcast communityDescrZ (clock==1), which will be ignored by other members who received communityDescrY earlier.\r\n    - Solution: Utilize timestamped hinted lamport clocks (as suggested by @cammellos). This would require a substantial refactor because we need to propagate the timesource to `Communty.nextClock()` through the communities manager.\r\n\r\n\r\nOpen questions:\r\n- If the control node changes and, as a result, the private key changes too, how will clients verify the URL signature, given that the new URL format signs the data with the private key?\r\n- How will the archive protocol behave with a new owner? What happens now when a community is imported by another messenger instance? If this is covered, we should be good, I believe.\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe task, although not trivial, is feasible. A large part of it has already been completed as part of the POC. The open questions need to be answered as they may significantly impact the estimate. There's also a risk that the new implementation of admin permissions may increase the task's complexity. As far as I understand, the community sync and community import tool do not require any changes.",
