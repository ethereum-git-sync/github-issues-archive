We cannot ensure that the contact info of someone will be propagated in the last 9 days.It's the same for https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/8022.\r\n\r\nWe could use new designs to just show something else than the 3 word name, but it still wouldn't be the display name.\r\nOtherwise, we could increase the mailsever fetch range, but the issue still happens for accounts older than the new cut off date.",
