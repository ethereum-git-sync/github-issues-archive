    "body": "If moving js code to something more performant will improve performance, we probably should go this direction.\r\nBut I see several issues here.\r\n\r\nMoving some ui-related logic to backend may hinder testability. Ideally we should be able to run UI components (separated components, more complex views and event the whole app). Therefore the backend should be limited to do only network-related operations and expose data to frontend in a possibly simple form. Then it's easy to mock that backend. If backend contains UI logic, mocking backend requires duplicating that logic to have UI components working without real backend.\r\n\r\nSo if some operations should be rewritten to something faster than js, imo we should consider moving it to C++ and keep it as a part of UI, independent from the backend (which could be limited mainly to networking then). If for any reason it's more beneficial to keep that logic in GO (e.g. for sharing with mobile client), maybe we should consider creating separate library for that. That library could be used also in UI's testing environment, with no need of mocking of this part.\r\n\r\n@alexjba please let me know what you think about that. I'm not too much in the topic so I could easily miss something.",

    "body": "@micieslak there is also this issue #9084 and @mprakhov suggested the status-go validation approach taking this into consideration. \r\nFrom my understanding (@mprakhov please correct me if I got it wrong) on status-go there will be two changes:\r\n1. Download the preview data for all whitelisted links (now we download the preview data only for some links. For other links we send the url in the UI)\r\n2. Validate the preview before sending it to the UI\r\n\r\nIn the UI we will use the raw data/filename provided by status-go. And we could easily mock this.\r\n\r\nIMO this change is good and it will help us better design the component.",

    "body": "@micieslak another point, I don't think this is UI logic we move to the backend. It's the opposite. This is all logic that **should have** been in the backend from the start, because it's data fetching. It wasn't done like that because we were noob (aka me, I did that code lol) and because the setting to show the links was only QML side before.\r\n\r\n@alexjba when/if you work on this, remember to check the setting to show links first before fetching data.\r\nThis is very important. Some people do specifically do not want to show the links so they don't show their IP address to sites.\r\n\r\nAlso, make sure to the use the thread tasks that already exist. Querying from some sites was already slow, so if we wait on the backend fetch before showing anything, it's gonna create a very bad UX. So if possible, when creating the message, we just show the link with no data, then we populate the link data when we finish fetching it with events and signals.",
