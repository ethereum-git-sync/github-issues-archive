  "body": "At the moment if there are paired devices and if a change is made on any of them that change is synced with other devices via synced message, which is sent only for an account which undergone the change. Since there is no guarantee in the decentralized system that message will arrive on other device we can run into some inconsistent state if we're sending a message about the change only, but if we're sending for example entire keypair with all its details for each change we're playing on all or nothing which is a big improvement in reliability.\r\n\r\nAspect 1 - send a synced message for a keypair with all its details (accounts, keypair name...) on each change regardless how big the change was, means if user just change a color for an account belonging to a certain keypair, we're syncing entire keypair.\r\n\r\nAspect 2 - in case of watch only accounts we can leave it as it is, sync a single account on each change or sync all watch only account on any change made to any of watch only accounts.\r\n\r\nPotentially - not sure if we have some limitations in terms of number of keypairs/accounts per sinle keypair/watch only accounts a user may add, but maybe we can go even further and instead syncing a single keypair (Aspect1) to sync all keypairs on each change.\r\n\r\n",
