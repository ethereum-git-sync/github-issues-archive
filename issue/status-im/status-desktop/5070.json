Finish anything that wasn't completed in the previous 0.17 cycle**\r\n\r\n**3. Complete work on profile showcase **\r\n\r\n**4. Status Communities / Discord bridge**\r\n- Community admin screens to make it easier for a Community Owner to deploy a bridge (design required)\r\n\r\n**5.  IPFS service for community minted NFTs and other binary community assets**\r\n\r\n- In order for NFT tokens minted in our UI to be correctly displayed with all metadata on OpenSea, their assets need to be stored in IPFS (because IPFS is supported by OpenSea)\r\n\r\n- Will work something like this: IPFS pinning server is integrated into Status Desktop. When a community mints a NFT, the associated assets are IPFS pinned by the community control node.  The community control node then sends a 'user invisible message' to all other community members via Waku, and the Status Desktop installs of all community members then fetch the NFT assets and pin them as well.  This means that every member of a community that is running Status Desktop will always be 'IPFS pinning' all assets related to the community, so that as long as one community member that uses Status Desktop is online, the assets are guaranteed to be available via IPFS.\r\n\r\n- Use a similar scheme to the above could be used for other community assets (that are not related to token minting) in the future like: Community banner image, community icon, community description, etc...\r\n\r\n- Use a similar scheme to the above could be used for status user data in the future.  Status users pin assets related to their profile (banner image, avatar, showcase contents) using IPFS, and all of the user's mutual contacts also pin that user's profile data.  Must incorporate a setting so that users can opt-out of pinning their mutual contact's profile data.\r\n\r\n**6. Communities improvements**\r\n- Ensure accounts stored on Keycard are taken into consideration for community permissions\r\n- optional service to once a month auto-kick all members who haven't been online for between 30 and 60 days (e.g. auto-kick members whose profile information like Name, Avatar, etc... can no longer be fetched).  Design still required\r\n\r\n**7. Binaries over Waku**\r\n- Improve transfer of binaries over waku via splitting into chunks https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/9923\r\n- Posting of small files (max size somewhere in the region of 1 to 2mb).  Requires above item before going live\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n## Wallet Team\r\n\r\n**1. Complete work on WalletConnect support**\r\n\r\n**2. Total balance graphs for 'All accounts' and each individual account and all graph functionality**\r\n\r\n**3. Advanced transaction signing**\r\n\r\n**4. QR scanner**\r\n- Needed for private key transfer\r\n- Ethereum key QRs (send modal triggered)\r\n- User Share URL in a QR (opens user profile dialogue) \r\n- Community and Channel inside Community URL in QRs (takes user to Community or Channel in Community)\r\n\r\n",
