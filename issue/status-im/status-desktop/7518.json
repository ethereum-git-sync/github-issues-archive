    "body": "I checked in with @John-44 on this - although the constant looping makes the channel/chat feel more active/alive, to help with CPU it might be best to limit the gifs to a few loops and then stop. The user could then replay the gif with the same number of loops by clicking the gif.\r\n\r\nIf we do go that route, the question becomes what interaction the user can leverage to restart the gif looping. On WhatsApp they obviously have a centred watermark GIF button which does this. A reason to include an explicit button like that is to give the affordance to the user that clicking it will re-loop the animation as opposed to opening the media in the expanded lightbox form.\r\n\r\nCurrently our Tenor gifs have a Tenor title and URL bar at the base. Is that something we plan to keep or is the aim to remove this per Discord/WhatsApp etc? If so, there would be even more reason to have an explicit CTA to identify the media as a GIF and reinitiate the loop.",

    "body": "No problem @alexandraB99. Is there a way to remove the Tenor bar at the base of the gifs per Discord, WhatsApp and the new mobile and desktop designs? \r\n\r\nThe reason I ask is, adding a GIF button while the Tenor banner is still presented at the base of the gif duplicates the cue/affordance to the user that the media is a gif and not an image. If, for technical reasons, we need to keep the Tenor banner at the base of the gif, we may want to do something more subtle - say a replay icon in the corner of the gif.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"384\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-01-19 at 17 42 07\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110033914/213520038-b9550747-aa0c-46d1-9a56-d797bd138bd2.png\">\r\n",
