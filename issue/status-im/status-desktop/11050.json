  "body": "# Bug Report\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThis ticket is a follow up to the refactor done in https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/pull/10974\r\n`TokenObject` has been introduced here to aggregate various properties related to a token. It makes the flow cleaner but also has some drawbacks:\r\n- qml objects are passed by reference, it makes copying problematic, special method is needed where every property is rewritten one-by-one\r\n- to avoid problems with objects lifetime (especially deletion), TokenObject is used only by static declaration, it makes it problematic to use inside e.g. StackView while passing those objects to different components in the meantime.\r\n- qml inheritance is limited and works poorly for data objects. For TokenObject it was necessary to have CollectibleObject and AssetObject without code duplication\r\n\r\nTo avoid those problems, the idea is to define those types in c++ and create dynamically by returning from C++ method. Than JS memory manager could control lifetime of those objects (https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qjsengine.html#ObjectOwnership-enum). Data type can by strictly typed but created dynamically when needed with no risk of memory leaks or premature deletion.\r\n\r\n",
