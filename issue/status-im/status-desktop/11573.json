Token permissions to enable control of community smart contracts**\r\n- Before a community founder can use any of the community token admin functionality, they first have to deploy Owner and Token Master contracts.\r\n- This work involves: new empty state screen for Mint and Airdrop tokens (before current empty state screen is revealed), new flow for deploying the community's Owner and Token Master contracts in a single step, a fixed uneditable permission giving anybody who holds the Token Master token admin rights for the community should be automatically created.\r\n- Only the holder of the single Owner token can access the Token Master airdrop, remote destruct, and view holders functions. Anybody who holds the Token Master token can access all token admin options, excluding those related to the Token Master token itself, as well as being and Admin of the community.\r\n- This will all be explained in more detail in the designs.\r\n\r\nBackend Epic: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11249\r\n\r\n**2. Update Community Admin home screen inc control node transfer and associated dialogues**\r\n- Remove ability for a Owner to leave a community on the computer that's running as that community's control node\r\n- Community Admin home screen cleanup (inc. adding at least one of the three graphs, whichever is easiest to implement).\r\n  - Graph issue: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11152  \r\n  - Community overview: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11278\r\n\r\n**3. Ability for user to select & manage accounts shared with each community control node**\r\n- This item is quite a bit of work\r\n- Touches Community settings, as well as all of the community join flows\r\n- Backend issues: \r\n  - Join API: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11154\r\n  - Edit API: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11153\r\n\r\n**4. Encryption for token gated channels that are inside Open (not token gated) communities**\r\n[#10998](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/10998)\r\n\r\n**5. Final screens and bits and bobs needed prior to public beta**\r\n- Modal that's shown every time after login, reminding user's that Status Desktop is in Beta [#11044](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11044)\r\n- The bug with 'requests to join' a community not constantly arriving, or sometimes arriving after a delay, must be fixed. [#8264](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/8264)\r\n- Anything that didn't get completed in 0.13 related to new share URL format\r\n- All the outstanding bugs and small items that got pushed into the 0.14 milestone.\r\n\r\n\r\n**--- Things that we SHOULD NOT work on during the 0.14 cycle ---**\r\n- Messaging and UI teams shouldn't work on perf. in 0.14 (but Wallet team should!)\r\n- Anything big mutual contacts related, other than fixing small bugs we find like #10497 #10498 #11120 #11121  (hopefully this functionality working good enough now!)\r\n\r\n**--- Wallet Team ---**\r\n\r\n1. Finish any outstanding work related to Activity screens (top priority - aim to have complete by July 14th)\r\n\r\n2. Updated Wallet Settings screens UI inc. account syncing functionality  *Synced information should immediately be reflected in the UI after it is received (sometimes synced info is currently only displayed after the next app restart, this needs to be fixed)*\r\n\r\n3. Wallet performance and memory consumption optimisations\r\n\r\n4. Fix bugs, clean up loose ends (to get things in a good state before the work on the Mobile wallet starts)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Only Owners, and later TokenMasters, should have access to that information.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Have a community\r\n2. Have one member join it\r\n3. Have another member join it\r\n\r\nSee that the new members have access to each other's revealed accounts even though they are not owners (just print the community object coming from status-go)\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nOnly owners and TokenMasters have access to revealed accounts\r\n\r\n#### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nAll members have access\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nI think we need to make sure that the requests to join are only sent to owners, TokenMasters and admins (admins need to ignore the addresses).\r\nThen, Owners and TokenMasters save those in the DB but do not propagate.\r\nThe only reasonable way is probably to have another table for that, so that we don't put that info in the description.\r\n\r\n- Status desktop version: Master `a30678f5ecfd73b8abe96bbf741d41bd29ec7608`\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Do they no longer participate in checking permissions?\r\n\r\n> Then, Owners and TokenMasters save those in the DB but do not propagate.\r\nThe only reasonable way is probably to have another table for that, so that we don't put that info in the description.\r\n\r\nThis is correct. only way to keep it private is to have accounts with privilege to store those addresses secretly share them among admins. That being said, all of this discussion here will have an impact on account recovery.\r\n\r\nIf an owner recovers their account and receives backup messages to reconstruct known (and owned) communities we no longer have the information of revealed member addresses. Need to take into account that members won't be kicked accidentally until we're sure the node has received all revealed addresses by any other means.",
