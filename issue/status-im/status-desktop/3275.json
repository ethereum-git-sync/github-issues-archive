Channels cannot be deleted - why is this not possible?\r\n3. Some channels I am unable to change the description for no apparent reason. Save button is greyed out (Linux). \r\n4. Unable to edit existing channels at all in Android - can only create new channels\r\n5. Where is the documentation for Communities? There needs to be a resource for users to test things out and understand the intended behavior. ",

I didn't try creating a channel from linux and then deleting from linux. Not sure if this matters. Another thing to note is that I shared the private key with another person, so there are 2 owners of the community - not sure how this can affect behavior. \r\n\r\nThanks for looking into to this and opening tickets, and for the documentation links.
