  "body": "Version 0.11, Window 10\r\n\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Perform a fresh install of Status Desktop, and restore an account that's been active in the last 30 days via Seed Phrase\r\n\r\n2. When the user lands inside Status after restoring, all of the user's contacts have been successfully restored from the backup to waku (Yay! :-) ).  This can be checked by navigating to Settings/Messaging/Contacts and viewing the restored contacts\r\n\r\n3. Navigate to the Messages section of the app.\r\n\r\n--- What currently incorrectly happens ---\r\n\r\n4. The Messages secondary nav will be empty, with no 1on1 and ad-hoc group chats listed\r\n\r\n--- Desired functionality ---\r\n\r\n4. All 1on1 and ad-hoc group chats that have had activity in them in the last 30 days should be restored.  By 'restored', I mean that they should be listed in the Messages section secondary nav, in recency order (e.g. the chat with the most recent message at the top, the chat with the second most recent message 2nd from the top, etc..).  I think that due to 'perfect forward secrecy' the messages themselves in the 1on1 and ad-hoc group chats cannot be restored via fetching the user's last 30 days of messages from a waku mailserver (but I would love to be proven wrong about this!), but at the minimum we should restore the list of 1on1 and ad-hoc group chats into the Messages section secondary nav.\r\n\r\nOne way to implement this would be to simply add a list of all 1on1 and ad-hoc group chats in the Messages section in recency to the list of user data that's: 1) backed up to Waku every 8 hours and 2) restored to a new device during initial pairing in the device syncing flow.\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nThis issue is a more detailed write up of **Issue 4.** in the following github issue https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/10276\r\n\r\nAssigning to Milestone 0.13, but feel free to pull into Milestone 0.12 if there is time.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
