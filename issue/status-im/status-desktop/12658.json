  "body": "There are a few debts left from https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11081:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Fetch profile showcase assets for a contact. This requires to add `getWalletToken` status-go call when a user opens the contact's profile (can be costly). Next, a signal should be dispatched to update assets in the loading state.\r\n\r\nQuestion: Should we show balances as a summary for each shared wallet address? (Current implementation shows empty balances for a contact's showcase)\r\n\r\nNote: if a user has tokens shared with their profile, they can not be displayed until he shares a wallet account(s) where they are presented \r\n\r\n- [ ] Share profile collectibles. That requires to add `chainID+contractAddress+TokenID` to the profile showcase collectible entry and use [this wallet api](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/12578) to fetch it.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Update wallet account metadata (name, colorId and emoji) in profile showcase. When a user updates a wallet account using [SaveOrUpdateAccount](https://github.com/status-im/status-go/blob/develop/protocol/messenger_wallet.go#L160-L175), the wallet address should be checked if it's being used in the profile. If there is a corresponding profile entry, it should be updated and the profile change should be dispatched.\r\n\r\n- [ ] If a user transfers ownership of a collectible which is being presented in the profile, the corresponding profile entry should be removed and the profile change should be dispatched.\r\n\r\n- [ ] If a user leaves the community which is being presented in the profile, the corresponding community entry should be removed and the profile change should be dispatched.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add profile showcase to backup & synchronisation\r\n\r\n- [ ] Dispatch profile showcase message when adding/removing/verifying a contact\r\n",
