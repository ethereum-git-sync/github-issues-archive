  "body": "# Bug Report\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nIt is possible to scroll StatusScrollView when you drag StatusListItem. Maybe issue is also happening for other controls.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Go to settings -> Profile\r\n2. Drag vertically on any control. Scroll view will move few pixels.\r\n\r\nOther really interesting case is \r\n1. Got o Wallet -> any account -> activity -> click delegate with NFT activity\r\n2. Try scroll view by pressing NFT preview.\r\n\r\nThis case is unique because scrollview is fully scrollable, not few pixels at the time.\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nScroll View is consistent everywhere and is not possible to scroll it by drag.\r\n\r\n#### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/11396062/c7a52878-76ed-40e3-a76c-e9a1837f79ba\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/11396062/688530d3-752b-43a3-b98a-262f6645807e\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n- Status desktop version:  master\r\n- Operating System: Windows and Mac\r\n\r\n",
