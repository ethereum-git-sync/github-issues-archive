Ability for user to select & manage accounts shared with each community control node**\r\n- This item is quite a bit of work\r\n- Touches Community settings, as well as all of the community join flows\r\n\r\n**2. Updates to control node transfer dialogues**\r\n- Remove ability for a Owner to leave a community on the computer that's running as that community's control node\r\n- Community Admin home screen cleanup (inc. adding at least one of the three graphs, whichever is easiest to implement).  \r\n\r\n**3. finish anything that wasn't completed in 0.13**\r\n- Profile showcase backend\r\n- Anything that didn't get completed in 0.13 related to new share URL format\r\n- Make sure all Community token functionality *is very well tested*, fix any issues found\r\n\r\n**4. Final screens and bits and bobs needed prior to public beta**\r\n- Modal that's shown every time after login, reminding user's that Status Desktop is in Beta\r\n- The bug with 'requests to join' a community not constantly arriving, or sometimes arriving after a delay, must be fixed.\r\n- All the outstanding bugs and small items that got pushed into the 0.14 milestone.\r\n\r\n**5. QR scanner**\r\n- Needed for private key transfer\r\n- Ethereum key QRs (send modal triggered)\r\n- User Share URL in a QR (opens user profile dialogue) \r\n- Community and Channel inside Community URL in QRs (takes user to Community or Channel in Community)\r\n\r\n**6. Token permissions to enable control of community smart contracts**\r\n- So that for example, a token based permission could give multiple people the ability to mint or airdrop a single community's tokens.\r\n\r\n**--- Things that we SHOULD NOT work on during the 0.14 cycle ---**\r\n- Messaging and UI teams shouldn't work on perf. in 0.14 (but Wallet team should!)\r\n- Anything mutual contacts related, other than #10497 #10498 (hopefully this functionality working good enough now!)\r\n- Community Channel drag and drop (assuming this is now working!)\r\n\r\n**--- Wallet Team ---**\r\n\r\n1. Finish any outstanding work related to Activity screens (top priority - aim to have complete by July 14th)\r\n\r\n2. Updated Wallet Settings screens inc. account syncing functionality  *Synced information should immediately be reflected in the UI after it is received (sometimes synced info is currently only displayed after the next app restart, this needs to be fixed)*\r\n\r\n3. Fix bugs, clean up loose ends (to get things in a good state before the work on the Mobile wallet starts)\r\n\r\n4. Total balance graphs for 'All accounts' and each individual account\r\n\r\n5. Advanced transaction signing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

  "body": "# Bug Report\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nIt is possible to scroll StatusScrollView when you drag StatusListItem. Maybe issue is also happening for other controls.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Go to settings -> Profile\r\n2. Drag vertically on any control. Scroll view will move few pixels.\r\n\r\nOther really interesting case is \r\n1. Got o Wallet -> any account -> activity -> click delegate with NFT activity\r\n2. Try scroll view by pressing NFT preview.\r\n\r\nThis case is unique because scrollview is fully scrollable, not few pixels at the time.\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nScroll View is consistent everywhere and is not possible to scroll it by drag.\r\n\r\n#### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/11396062/c7a52878-76ed-40e3-a76c-e9a1837f79ba\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/11396062/688530d3-752b-43a3-b98a-262f6645807e\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n- Status desktop version:  master\r\n- Operating System: Windows and Mac\r\n\r\n",
