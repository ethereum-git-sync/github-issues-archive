  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nIn order to reduce creation of models in different sections that manage same data from same service, model created inside community section called `communitiesModuleInst.tokenList` that uses `src/app_service/token/service.nim` will be replaced by a new generic model created under `wallet module` that will interact with a new `token_service` and will provide the same data. In the UI the model will be accessible via `WalletStore` and if there is the need of filtering by current `communityId`, this filtering action will be done in QML layer.\r\n\r\nIt extrictly depends on main refactor done in https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/12424 where new generic models will be exposed.\r\n\r\n**NOTE**: Here there will be only treated `assets` but `communitiesModuleInst.collectiblesModel` model will be reviewed in a second step too.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
