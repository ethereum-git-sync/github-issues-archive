    "body": "I was wondering though, if someone is invited to a community that needs \"Request Approval\", that invite is an approval already no? So as an invitee, I should get write access to the channel, or is every individual channel protected?\n\nI tried reading from the code when/how someone can actually request to join (which is `community.access = communityChatOnRequestAccess`) and that only seems to be possible from the communities detail popup, which I can't access when I'm already in the community.\n\nSo I guess that leaves me with two questions here:\n\n1. Are we sure that the invitee is now allowed to write in the channels, given that he has just been invited and accepted the invite?\n2. If \"yes\" to 1), then what do I need to do as someone who has just been invited to actually write in channels?",
