If user taps \"Accept\" then devices '1' and '3' should become paired, I'll post the designs for this below (and like all notifications, this notification should appear as both a bubble notification and an entry in the Notification Centre).\r\n\r\nMobile design:\r\nhttps://www.figma.com/file/eDfxTa9IoaCMUy5cLTp0ys/Shell-for-Mobile?type=design&node-id=4537-515917&t=Ictm44ypvb3xKiPZ-4\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1060\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/25482501/b58b3e2d-5fad-4212-8e41-d97f74bc944b\">\r\n\r\n",
