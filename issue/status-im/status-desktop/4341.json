  "body": "Dear Dev-Team\r\nOnce I've signed in to status desktop and then close the app, I cannot login again, it says something like 'this process is used by another app'... I close the process or service in TaskManager and then I can startup again.\r\nAlso sending money did not go through and did not tell me that something went wrong. It just doesnt do it. With the Android version it worked then fine, but the balance on the desktop version stayed the same.\r\nBelow attached error msg comes once in a while, I haven't read it and don't know if it's always the same, but I thought I send it to you, maybe it helps you to further develop this app. In case you want me to send you more error messages, just let me know...\r\n\r\n![Status Error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22144488/147488469-d877727a-590f-4d91-8685-df2f9c6b8e4a.png)\r\n![Status Process](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22144488/147488470-0420fc2d-13f8-4235-a739-cd4ffcd27dc0.png)\r\n\r\nI hope I could be of use to the team, br",

    "body": "@jpzuerich the `jenkins` name comes from the tool we use to create the builds. It is called Jenkins, so this is why you see that name. Don't worry, we are not creating new users on your machine 😄 \r\n \r\n Otherwise, as for the issue of not being able to reopen the app, it's possible that you have a \"zombie\" app like we call it. It means one instance didn't close properly.\r\nOr maybe it's just the default behavior of the app of not closing on pressing the X. If you go in the Settings, in Advanced, you can see if \"Minimize on close\" is enabled. If it is enabled, you might want to disable it, if you prefer the app to close itself when pressing the X.\r\n\r\nFinally, for error popup, I think it was fixed in later versions of the app. I don't see that lately. Anyway, if it doesn't make your app stop, you can ignore it.",

    "body": "Ok, thanks for the clarification.\n\nOn Mon, 10 Jan 2022 at 16:07, Jonathan Rainville ***@***.***>\nwrote:\n\n> @jpzuerich <https://github.com/jpzuerich> the jenkins name comes from the\n> tool we use to create the builds. It is called Jenkins, so this is why you\n> see that name. Don't worry, we are not creating new users on your machine\n> 😄\n>\n> Otherwise, as for the issue of not being able to reopen the app, it's\n> possible that you have a \"zombie\" app like we call it. It means one\n> instance didn't close properly.\n> Or maybe it's just the default behavior of the app of not closing on\n> pressing the X. If you go in the Settings, in Advanced, you can see if\n> \"Minimize on close\" is enabled. If it is enabled, you might want to disable\n> it, if you prefer the app to close itself when pressing the X.\n>\n> Finally, for error popup, I think it was fixed in later versions of the\n> app. I don't see that lately. Anyway, if it doesn't make your app stop, you\n> can ignore it.\n>\n> —\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n> <https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/4341#issuecomment-1008962367>,\n> or unsubscribe\n> <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AFI6L2HHMGIU2DW2VUQBPHTUVLYZRANCNFSM5K2S42FQ>\n> .\n> Triage notifications on the go with GitHub Mobile for iOS\n> <https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1477376905?ct=notification-email&mt=8&pt=524675>\n> or Android\n> <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.android&referrer=utm_campaign%3Dnotification-email%26utm_medium%3Demail%26utm_source%3Dgithub>.\n>\n> You are receiving this because you were mentioned.Message ID:\n> ***@***.***>\n>\n",
