  "body": "After landing things #248 and #250 Status now renders identicons or letter-identicons respectively, based on the channel item's type (one-to-one or group chat).\r\n\r\nIt turns out however, that this rendering break again after first render, usually when new messages are received.\r\n\r\nHere's what it looks like:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1344\" alt=\"Screenshot 2020-06-03 at 10 57 06\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/445106/83617403-4da54200-a589-11ea-864e-74152834d99a.png\">\r\n\r\nNotice that the identicon is rendered properly in the chat's topbar, while broken in the channel list. Both parts of the view use the same components and after doing some debugging, I also know that the underlying data that drives them is correct (i.e. even though the channel in question is a one-to-one chat, the app still renders a letter-identicon).\r\n\r\nI wonder if this is related to how we update the channel list and rerender it when new messages arrive. I noticed that the `Complete.onCompleted` callback is executed on the `ChannelIcon` itself every time for the entire list when there's new messages coming in. However, putting the callback on the `letterIdenticon` or `imageIdenticon` respectively causes it to only run ones.\r\n\r\nI **think** the issue might be that the channel list keeps the channel icons with their loaded sub components, and doesn't reload them when the data of the channel icon changes.\r\n\r\nSomething to investigate.
