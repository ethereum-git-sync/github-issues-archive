Create desktop instance, use account A to create community\r\n2. Run second desktop instance, use account B\r\n3. Invite account B to the community via account A\r\n4. Join/request access from account B\r\n5. Log out of account B and create account C on second desktop instance\r\n6. Repeat 3) with account C instead of B\r\n7. Repeat 4)\r\n\r\nThen at some point, a member might loose their display name. In the case of the screenshot, the first member no longer shows their display name",
