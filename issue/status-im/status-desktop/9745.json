We need to keep tech. debt at a roughly fixed level as we grow out functionality, can't let it accumulate! ;-)\r\n\r\n**2. Complete initial airdrop functionality**\r\n- Airdrop history screens\r\n- Ability to airdrop based on in-Community activity (No. of msg, No. msg in time range, joining a community, length of community membership)  Ability to combine multiple attributes into an airdrop\r\n- Ability to token gate airdrops\r\n- Live airdrop gas estimation when setting up airdrop\r\n\r\n**3.

Admin functionality enhancements**\r\n- Ability to mark a token gated channel as 'hidden', only visible to community members with the requisite tokens\r\n- optional service to once a month auto-kick all members who haven't been online for between 30 and 60 days (e.g. auto-kick members whose profile information like Name, Avatar, etc... can no longer be fetched)\r\n\r\n**5.
