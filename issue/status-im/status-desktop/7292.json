The thing with stucked loading animations originates most likely from the qml structure which loads everything on the app start and most of those calls communicate with status-go and it looks all that is happening in the main thread. So this issue is not that straightforward for fixing without some good plan and bigger change.",

    "body": "@caybro @saledjenic  I didn't say the timer has something to do with the animation being stuck haha :D I mean to switch back to timer because it wasn't stucking before! (even though it won't be realistic) and because exactly i can imagine that it behaves like this because the engine is busy loading other stuff, so we're not ready yet to rely on 'real time' start up loading if we don't make a BIG refactoring there. I hope it's clear now?",
