  "body": "Given the user has the option to copy either the legacy OR multichain address, the `Copy address` option in the account context menu should launch the share dialog so the user can view and copy the address variant they desire.\r\n\r\n**Current behaviour:**\r\nClicking `Copy address` copied the address to the clipboard and showed `Address copied` temporarily in place of the menu item.\r\n\r\n**Desired behaviour:** \r\nClicking on `Copy address` launches the share dialog - from there the user can leverage the segmented controls to view and copy the address format they want. The segmented control should default to multichain when the dialog is launched to help promote visibility and use of the multichain feature.\r\n\r\nRelevant Wallet v2 Figma file links:\r\nhttps://www.figma.com/file/FkFClTCYKf83RJWoifWgoX/Wallet-v2?type=design&node-id=14417-437564&t=phJiBTpvcsgpMZOG-4\r\n<img width=\"1261\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-05-15 at 10 45 06\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/110033914/952dea59-4d37-4bdb-b0ef-d6f6fbe90174\">\r\n\r\nhttps://www.figma.com/file/FkFClTCYKf83RJWoifWgoX/Wallet-v2?type=design&node-id=3311-177541&t=phJiBTpvcsgpMZOG-4\r\n<img width=\"479\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-05-15 at 10 48 10\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/110033914/b93f346d-7fb2-42d1-be2a-d8d47d21d3e3\">\r\n\r\ncc @saledjenic as discussed :)",
