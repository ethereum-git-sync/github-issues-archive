This is because underscore is a markdown character.  \r\n\r\n e.g. @Pepper_Talent renders the text succeeding the”_” in the message input field as italic, including the rest of the username, and this is incorrect.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n<ins>Steps to reproduce:</ins>\r\n\r\n1. Navigate to any messaging or community channel screen that contains a message input field.\r\n\r\n2. Type a message in the message input field @ mentioning a user with a username that contains an underscore’ e.g. ‘@Mary_’ or ‘@Pepper_Talent’. \r\n\r\n<ins>What currently incorrectly happens:</ins>\r\n\r\n3. In the message input field, the text following the username that contains an underscore will be rendered in italics.\r\n_Note:_ The markdown character is not rendered in the message body area once the message is posted, **this is correct**. \r\n\r\nExample screenshots:\r\n\r\n![32 Special charactors should not be rendered](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/124154641/222181197-06235313-9d08-408a-96bd-58b004d57e9f.png)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n![32 Special charactors should not be rendered 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/124154641/222181229-5e173e68-218b-421e-aa50-0c6c0fa332c0.png)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ins>What is supposed to happen:</ins>\r\n\r\n3.
