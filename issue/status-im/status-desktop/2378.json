    "body": "I came to open an issue to have this feature(?) removed after hulk smashing my whole office, and i found this issue when searching first. \r\n\r\nWhy should the user be asked to confirm what they just requested? What is the threat that the user is being protected against? Can't they just rejoin the chat if they didn't have temporary control over their own fingers? Maybe status should use their camera to make sure they are wearing approved Typing Mittens? :) \r\n\r\ni can understand if they were deleting some important records from their database, but unless i'm missing something (quite possible), i don't see anything important being lost if status just goes ahead and does what it was asked to do.\r\n\r\nthanks",
