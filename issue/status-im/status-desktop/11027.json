(see https://codebrowser.dev/qt5/qtbase/src/gui/kernel/qwindow.cpp.html#1361). The only way a window can become active is via user interaction. To work around it, I simply first hid the window, as such:\r\n```qml\r\n    function makeStatusAppActive() {\r\n        applicationWindow.hide()\r\n        applicationWindow.show()\r\n        applicationWindow.raise()\r\n        applicationWindow.requestActivate()\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nand this works fine, at least on Linux. You can give it a try on Windows too",

It will change the color of the taskbar entry to indicate that the window has changed in some way. This is because Microsoft does not allow an application to interrupt what the user is currently doing in another application.\r\n\r\nSo Windows does not let apps make themselves active. I guess it makes sense to make sure apps don't just pop up everywhere like viruses.\r\n\r\nIt's still annoying. I swear other apps were able to move to the foreground, but maybe they are not in QT or they use the ugly hack here: https://wiki.qt.io/Technical_FAQ#QWidget_::activateWindow.28.29_-_behavior_under_windows\r\nThough, I wouldn't even try, even if it  could work, as it changes the behaviour for the whole system, and not just the app.",
