  "body": "In addition to the changes made in https://github.com/status-im/status-go/pull/3843 which makes admins forward their accept/reject decisions for requests to join to the control node, we need a similar handling for kicking and banning members.\r\n\r\nBasically the idea is that:\r\n\r\n1. Some admin (admin/tokenmaster/owner without key) decides to kick a member\r\n2. This marks the member as \"kicked pending\" and doesn't actually kick the member\r\n3. This intent is then sent to the control node and other admins via `CommunityEventsMessage`\r\n4. If an admin receives the message, the member should be marked as \"kicked pending\" for her as well\r\n5. If a control node receives the message, the member will be kicked using the already existing RemoveUserFromOrg API\r\n6. Once that happened, the control node needs to signal to other admins that kicking the member was now confirmed (this should be done using the new message type introduced in https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11715)\r\n\r\nAll of the above should also be done for banning users. All UI related changes needed are documented in this issue: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11649\r\n\r\nThe reason this was not done as part of https://github.com/status-im/status-go/pull/3843 is because we don't yet have a place where we store pending states for kicking and banning. This means, part of this task is also to add a new database table that keeps track of the \"member state\" of each community member (or at least the ones that have been marked as * pending).\r\n\r\nSince the PR to adjust the request-to-join flow is already quite big, which should be done in this separate task.",
