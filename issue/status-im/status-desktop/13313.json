  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nCurrently the UI stores the settings created by the user in the `local settings` file.\r\n\r\nThis task pretends to cover the link between the UI and the existing NIM backend in order to store the settings data into the DDBB.\r\n\r\nMaybe there are some missing parameters to take into account in the backend side about settings. Here a reminder:\r\n\r\n- [Sorting order](https://www.figma.com/file/eM26pyHZUeAwMLviaS1KJn/%E2%9A%99%EF%B8%8F-Wallet-Settings%3A-Manage-Tokens?type=design&node-id=32%3A138356&mode=design&t=GTJPXvZ6JuQc6YkN-1): The DDBB needs to store the sorting type applied in order to provide the initial value to the UI. Whenever the user changes the ordering type, it must be saved in the DDBB.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"248\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-01-26 at 11 54 27\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/97019400/00a725dc-33e9-495f-845b-f8dda37077c8\">\r\n\r\n- Custom order must include:\r\n  - Individual collectible item position.\r\n  - Group item position.\r\n  - Hiden state of individual collectible item.\r\n  - Hiden state of the group item.\r\n- Backend shall provide 2 different models to the UI, the `flat collectibles list model` AND the `groups list model` (being this last one, the community groups or the collections groups with the relevant information about the community and how many elements this group contains).\r\n- There shall be available a backend call to hide elements one by one, or a specific group.\r\n- There shall be available a backend call to get and set the new elements position (being elements an individual item or a group item).",
