  "body": "As a result of fixing #7909 and #7910 , I've noticed that some tests that rely on `hover_obj` or `move_mouse_to_obj` fail because the mouse isn't moving at all.\r\n\r\nThis can sometimes be reproduced with the discussed tests linked above. \r\nTo give a concrete example:\r\n\r\nWhen replying to a message or editing a message, the message in question needs to be hovered first. This then makes a popup show up which has buttons to perform replies or editing.\r\n\r\nIf that popup doesn't show up, the buttons to reply or edit are non-accessible, causing the test to fail.\r\nFrom what I've seen and debugged, it usually fails at the spot where it has to hover over the message that should be replied to or edited.\r\n\r\nOne can observe how the cursor just stands still and doesn't do anything, until the test fails.\r\nOne can also manually perform the mouse-over while the test is stuck in that position, which will then cause the test to pass.\r\n\r\nWe gotta figure out why in some cases the mouse move using any of the two APIs mentioned above doesn't work.",
