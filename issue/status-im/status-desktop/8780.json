    "body": "It's hard to say if the fetch is not successful in decentralized network. In this case you run fetch more messages and you expect that missing messages will show up, let's say after X seconds, if your peers have them, but if they do not have them, they may arrive after any time Y (Y > X) or don't arrive at all. \r\n\r\nSo based on the description of this issue, what I want to say is that if fetch was successful user will see new messages in the list, if not, then if we want to notify user we should display appropriate message like \"we're searching your nodes for a certain messages, this may take a while\", otherwise if we display a message like \"we're unable to fetch more messages\" we will trick/confuse him since messages may arrive in any moment after that even while that notification is displayed.",
