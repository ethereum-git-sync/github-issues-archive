Performance**\r\n- Some folks should focus on trying to identify and DB perf. issues\r\n- Also try to identify and improve status-go perf. issues\r\n*improvements to DB and status-go perf. can benefit Status Mobile as well as Status Desktop*\r\n- UI layer perf. improvements.  Try to identify places where the app doesn't respond to user input immediately, and attempt to fix the worse offenders\r\n\r\n**3. fix bugs everywhere**\r\n\r\n**5. Graphs for Community Admin home screen**\r\n- this is a task for the UI team\r\n\r\n**6. QR scanner**\r\n\r\n**Other possible items (but that may be moved to a subsequent milestone)**\r\n- opt-in auto-update functionality\r\n- Integrate final transaction signing modal into community admin areas\r\n- Airdrop history screens\r\n- Live airdrop gas estimation when setting up airdrop\r\n- automatic bandwidth test on app startup, and use results to automatically configure the waku shard usage appropriately depending on the available bandwidth (at the 'user has tons of bandwidth' end of the spectrum all waku shards will use waku Relay mode, at the 'user has very little bandwidth' end of the spectrum all waku shards will use waku filter + light push mode, and in between these two ends of the spectrum the user will use a mix of waku relay mode and waku filter + light push mode for different shards).  Plus also use  the results of the bandwidth test to automatically set the bittorred throttling at an appropriate setting at the beginning of each new session.\r\n",
