Token permissions to enable control of community smart contracts**\r\n- Before a community founder can use any of the community token admin functionality, they first have to deploy Owner and Token Master contracts.\r\n- This work involves: new empty state screen for Mint and Airdrop tokens (before current empty state screen is revealed), new flow for deploying the community's Owner and Token Master contracts in a single step, a fixed uneditable permission giving anybody who holds the Token Master token admin rights for the community should be automatically created.\r\n- Only the holder of the single Owner token can access the Token Master airdrop, remote destruct, and view holders functions. Anybody who holds the Token Master token can access all token admin options, excluding those related to the Token Master token itself, as well as being and Admin of the community.\r\n- This will all be explained in more detail in the designs.\r\n\r\nBackend Epic: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11249\r\n\r\n**2. Updates to control node transfer and associated dialogues**\r\n- Remove ability for a Owner to leave a community on the computer that's running as that community's control node\r\n- Community Admin home screen cleanup (inc. adding at least one of the three graphs, whichever is easiest to implement).\r\n  - Graph issue: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11152  \r\n  - Community overview: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11278\r\n\r\n**3. Ability for user to select & manage accounts shared with each community control node**\r\n- This item is quite a bit of work\r\n- Touches Community settings, as well as all of the community join flows\r\n- Backend issues: \r\n  - Join API: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11154\r\n  - Edit API: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11153\r\n\r\n**4. Encryption for token gated channels that are inside Open (not token gated) communities**\r\n[#10998](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/10998)\r\n\r\n**5. Final screens and bits and bobs needed prior to public beta**\r\n- Modal that's shown every time after login, reminding user's that Status Desktop is in Beta [#11044](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11044)\r\n- The bug with 'requests to join' a community not constantly arriving, or sometimes arriving after a delay, must be fixed. [#8264](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/8264)\r\n- Anything that didn't get completed in 0.13 related to new share URL format\r\n- All the outstanding bugs and small items that got pushed into the 0.14 milestone.\r\n\r\n\r\n**--- Things that we SHOULD NOT work on during the 0.14 cycle ---**\r\n- Messaging and UI teams shouldn't work on perf. in 0.14 (but Wallet team should!)\r\n- Anything big mutual contacts related, other than fixing small bugs we find like #10497 #10498 #11120 #11121  (hopefully this functionality working good enough now!)\r\n\r\n**--- Wallet Team ---**\r\n\r\n1. Finish any outstanding work related to Activity screens (top priority - aim to have complete by July 14th)\r\n\r\n2. Updated Wallet Settings screens UI inc. account syncing functionality  *Synced information should immediately be reflected in the UI after it is received (sometimes synced info is currently only displayed after the next app restart, this needs to be fixed)*\r\n\r\n3. Wallet performance and memory consumption optimisations\r\n\r\n4. Fix bugs, clean up loose ends (to get things in a good state before the work on the Mobile wallet starts)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Does locally saved data (specific wallet address + filters) should be encrypted?\r\n\r\n1 - I don't think it is necessary to sync the current state of filtering for an account's activity across synced devices but perhaps @John-44 can confirm. The filters are relatively easy to apply, edit and remove and it's unlikely someone will wish applied filters to persist long term (at least I can't think of a widespread use case that would warrant syncing the filtering state across devices - it doesnt save the user a lot of time and might actually be jarring to log in using another device and find filtering pre-applied when I'd be expecting a clean slate).\r\n\r\n@John-44 will leave for you to confirm on 2 if ok",

    "body": "> 1 - I don't think it is necessary to sync the current state of filtering for an account's activity across synced devices but perhaps @John-44 can confirm. The filters are relatively easy to apply, edit and remove and it's unlikely someone will wish applied filters to persist long term (at least I can't think of a widespread use case that would warrant syncing the filtering state across devices - it doesnt save the user a lot of time and might actually be jarring to log in using another device and find filtering pre-applied when I'd be expecting a clean slate).\r\n\r\n@Cuteivist I haven't, because I haven't had time to read my github alerts for a while, but I've seen it now :-)  If there is an issue that needs my attention and I don't respond, please chase me on Status or Discord ;-)\r\n\r\nAnyhow, re. these questions:\r\n\r\n1) Filter state should **not** be synced across devices, and should not persist across sessions.   Should be stateful *inside* a session only.\r\n\r\n2) I *think* everything in the db is always encrypted (so this happens by default, but re. should 'specific wallet address + filters' be encrypted, I'll leave this question for @alaibe ",
