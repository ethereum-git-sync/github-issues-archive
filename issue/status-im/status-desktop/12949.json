  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nQt fails to load webp animations from network. It seems to be a known issue, fixed in Qt6 (https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-75044).\r\n\r\nWe have a fallback implemented in StatusAnimatedImage and a static image is presented instead. A workaround for this issue would be to download the image on disk before loading it in the StatusAnimatedImage.\r\n\r\nRepro steps:\r\n\r\nIt can be easily reproduced in storybook.\r\nGo to ManageCollectiblesModel.qml and add an address pointing to a webp asset as `mediaUrl` and 'image' as `mediaType`.\r\nE.g. \r\n\r\n```\r\n        {\r\n            uid: \"pp21\",\r\n            name: \"pepepunk#21\",\r\n            collectionUid: \"pepepunks\",\r\n            collectionName: \"\",\r\n            communityId: \"\",\r\n            communityName: \"\",\r\n            mediaUrl: \"https://i.seadn.io/gae/TX0qOy8g8ibx1p2gQzWIM3Kvsy4a447ti2ZtMlcJmRFM8PU_4YYw2WMpKvO_bnqJiDj2Y7njP6d0tf2YG_K-yYDN2gdbEA2dsOXJsA?w=500&auto=format\",\r\n            mediaType: \"image\",\r\n            isLoading: false,\r\n            backgroundColor: \"\"\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nOpen CollectiblesViewPage\r\n\r\nExpected: The asset is visible and animated\r\n\r\nActual: The asset is a static image\r\n\r\n\r\n              > > * I've added a few watch accounts and I see some popular NTFs use webp encoding.

It seems to be working fine if we're downloading the image before loading it in the StatusAnimatedImage. @caybro WDYT of this?\r\n> \r\n> Dunno, I don't think we support it\r\n> \r\n> > ```\r\n> > Warning: qrc:/StatusQ/Components/StatusAnimatedImage.qml:24:1: QML StatusAnimatedImage: Error Reading Animated Image File https://i.seadn.io/gae/TX0qOy8g8ibx1p2gQzWIM3Kvsy4a447ti2ZtMlcJmRFM8PU_4YYw2WMpKvO_bnqJiDj2Y7njP6d0tf2YG_K-yYDN2gdbEA2dsOXJsA?w=500&auto=format (qrc:/StatusQ/Components/StatusAnimatedImage.qml:24, )\r\n> > ```\r\n> \r\n> Hmm and here it looks like it doesn't like the `query` part of the URL (needs to be stripped maybe)?\r\n\r\nI've tried it with other urls and I've seen the same result. Not a big deal IMHO because we have a fallback that's loading a static image instead. But it's something we can fix (probably in 0.16 if it's important enough). It's reproducible in storybook as well by adding any webp url as `mediaUrl` and `mediaType: \"image\"` in the [ManageCollectiblesModel.qml](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/pull/12917#diff-8e8e6943f554621d674e54e78277cdd78ea128722719df1730e8f2012781f6b6).\r\n\r\nI'll create another issue for it.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @alexjba in https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/12917#issuecomment-1841200379_\r\n            ",
