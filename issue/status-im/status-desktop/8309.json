    "body": "> this was never a requirement plus see comment https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/10186#issuecomment-1497404320\r\n\r\nIt might have never been an explicit requirement (but common sense), but as there are now two people that have reported the same unexpected behavior, this just confirms that this should likely be tackled.\r\n\r\nI think the fact that we don't support rudimentary keyboard support, like submitting a form by hitting enter, is rather a bug than a design decision. The comment you've linked merely states that this is working for some component but not for all. Again, nothing that was deliberately decided, just lack of time/priority I'd say.\r\n\r\nSo instead of closing this issue as non-actionable, I'd rather have us keep this open and slowly start to tackle it.\r\nWe don't have to fix this for all forms all at ones, but at least take care of the ones that have been reported by users and clearly would improve UX for many others.\r\n\r\nPlease reconsider your action here.",
