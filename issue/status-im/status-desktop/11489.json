We need to keep tech. debt at a roughly fixed level as we grow out functionality, can't let it accumulate! ;-)\r\n\r\n**2. Tokenisation of community ownership**\r\n- Work needed already evaluated in spike.  Community and 'Channel in a Community' URLs don't need to be signed if this will present problems. Patryk to work on this as a continuation of the spike already done.\r\n- See priority 4 below, as this also has some implications for the tokenisation of community work.\r\n\r\n**3. Profile showcase backend**\r\n- The long-delayed profile showcase backend!  We have the UI on the desktop ready to go for this feature, and Mobile is going to need the backend for this feature as well, so let's try to get it done in 0.14 [#11081](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11081)\r\n\r\n**4. Community tokens visible in wallet when received by user who is not a member of that community**\r\n- Solution obvs. needs to be fully decenteralised and permissionless\r\n- Perhaps whenever a community token is A) sent from a Status Wallet to another user or B) airdropped by a community or C) retailed by a community, a M2M (invisible to the user) Waku message should be sent to the recipient's *ethereum address*?\r\n- This message could either: A) contain the metadata for the token B) tell the user that they have received token, and to check the metadata in either another Waku channel where Control Nodes periodically post Metadata OR check the metadata embedded in the token contract (embedding metadata in the token contract might be a better idea?).  \r\n- The token metadata stored in the token contract is signed by the Community's private key to ensure authenticity.  When the community's private key changes due to ownership of a community being transferred or due to the control node being moved, a transaction must be made to update this metadata so it is signed by the community's new private key.\r\n- See here for how a Waku message can be sent to and Ethereum address https://rfc.vac.dev/spec/20/\r\n\r\n**5. Refactor synchronisation of contacts**\r\n- To fix various contact request issues, is a large work item\r\n- Mishka and Igor to work on this?\r\n- https://github.com/status-im/status-go/issues/3720\r\n- https://github.com/status-im/status-go/issues/3803#issuecomment-1654588500\r\n\r\n**6.

  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nAs explained in https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11376, obtaining amounts from the backend via floats has some subtle issues. Amounts cannot be reliably compared and manipulated (e.g. multiplication for airdrops) on UI side, potentially leading to some confusing and hard to detect problems.\r\n\r\nWithout access to exact amount values on UI side, it is also impossible to order various operations to the backend in a precise way (defining permissions, airdrop, burn, sending funds).\r\n\r\nThe proposed solution to the problem is to change the meaning and type of the \"amount\" field. It could be string with a text value representing the exact amount in basic units (e.g. wei for ETH) and adding a field representing the multiplier used for a given currency (e.g. 10^18 for ETH). This entails further changes, e.g. in `LocaleUtils::currencyAmountToLocaleString` which can be done using methods provied in https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/pull/11487\r\n\r\n",
