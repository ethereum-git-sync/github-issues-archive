  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nAs explained in https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11376, obtaining amounts from the backend via floats has some subtle issues. Amounts cannot be reliably compared and manipulated (e.g. multiplication for airdrops) on UI side, potentially leading to some confusing and hard to detect problems.\r\n\r\nWithout access to exact amount values on UI side, it is also impossible to order various operations to the backend in a precise way (defining permissions, airdrop, burn, sending funds).\r\n\r\nThe proposed solution to the problem is to change the meaning and type of the \"amount\" field. It could be string with a text value representing the exact amount in basic units (e.g. wei for ETH) and adding a field representing the multiplier used for a given currency (e.g. 10^18 for ETH). This entails further changes, e.g. in `LocaleUtils::currencyAmountToLocaleString` which can be done using methods provied in https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/pull/11487\r\n\r\n",
