If he gets unbanned, he should see the normal blue button to request, but he can't until he restarts\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. A is owner of a community\r\n2. Request access with user B\r\n3. A accepts B\r\n4. A then bans B\r\n5. B is now banner and sees the gray button\r\n6. A unbans B\r\n7. B still sees the gray button\r\n8. B restarts\r\n9. B now sees the normal request button\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nB shouldn't have to restart. A signal should be sent to say they were unbanned.\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n- Status desktop version: master `8d955265dccaf3feec69ee675a3c3c48a05967d2`\r\n\r\n",
