That should not happen, given that we know we've entered a profile link of someone who isn't a contact yet.\r\n\r\n> Only if I'll decide to put a contact, which is already in my contact list - I'll get no action.\r\n\r\nThis seems correct. Although that should probably open the 1-on-1 chat right away. \r\n\r\n> On the screenshot, I see the contact key and it can already be in your contact list or it can not exist at all\r\n\r\nIt's a profile link of a user that is **not** a contact yet.",
