The name-text did not become clickable. I would think it would become clickable for my desktop client (though I'm not sure about other peoples' desktop and mobile clients) and when clicked would open the expected profile view, i.e. the profile to which I assigned that nickname.\r\n\r\nHowever, I then `@` mentioned an ENS name; the name-text becomes highlighted and is clickable. When clicked it opens the expected profile view.\r\n\r\ncc: @simonricoo ",
