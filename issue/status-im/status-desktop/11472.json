  "body": "A couple of new screens have been added to the Mint Owner token flows to show what an admin sees when navigating to the Tokens and Airdrops home screens prior to the Owner token being minted.\r\n\r\n**EXISTING: Community founder view of Tokens and Airdrops home screens:**\r\nThe Community founder sees a `Get started` panel which introduces them to the concept of the Owner token, explaining why minting is disabled until the Owner token is minted. It also contains a CTA to `Mint Owner token`\r\n\r\nFigma link:\r\nhttps://www.figma.com/file/17fc13UBFvInrLgNUKJJg5/Kuba%E2%8E%9CDesktop?type=design&node-id=34794-589770&mode=design&t=H9WXPVH15Vuk0mSS-4\r\n\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"Tokens\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/110033914/77b74ec0-7ea6-4e41-bcdd-43ca78a26b3d\">\r\n\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"Airdrop\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/110033914/549a68aa-c091-4847-85ee-60e1b9350ecb\">\r\n\r\n\r\n**NEW: Admin view of Tokens and Airdrops home screens:**\r\nThe admin view of these screens (before the Owner token is minted) contains a modified version of the `Get started` panel. The copy is adjusted to introduce the concept of the TokenMaster token to them and to encourage them to reach out to the Community founder if they would like TokenMaster permissions.\r\n\r\nFigma link:\r\nhttps://www.figma.com/file/17fc13UBFvInrLgNUKJJg5/Kuba%E2%8E%9CDesktop?type=design&node-id=34794-589843&mode=design&t=H9WXPVH15Vuk0mSS-4\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"Tokens\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/110033914/592606d4-e511-41d2-ac55-36f059d91410\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"Airdrop\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/110033914/98366349-229b-47a5-a5d4-74e6e284ffee\">\r\n\r\nOnce the Community Owner and TokenMaster tokens have been minted, the Owner `Get started` panel is removed from the UI. However, the admin view of the `Get started` panel should persist even after the Owner token is minted given it is still relevant.\r\n\r\ncc @noeliaSD ",
