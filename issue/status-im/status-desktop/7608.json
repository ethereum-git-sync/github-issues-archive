  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nIn many cases, especially in Popups it's not enough to set `clip: true` on `StatusScrollView` in order to achieve proper clipping behavior. Such solution causes that scrollable areas are cut off too early. Often we want to see list content on popup's margins. However usually it's not enough to just clip on boundaries of the entire popup, e.g in a situation where we have some static components in a popup and a scrollable area below and we want to cut of properly top edge (before static components) and in the bottom part (on the popup edge). Common approach is to use nested items, one with negative margins and one with positive, mutually cancelling out. It allows to set `clip: true` on the external item and therefore achieve desired effect. This patter could be wrapped into helper component to increase code reusability and limit indentation levels. \r\n\r\nRelated issues, where described component could be used:\r\nhttps://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/pull/7601\r\nhttps://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/pull/7540\r\n\r\nProper clipping:\r\n![Screenshot from 2022-09-26 17-32-24](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20650004/192503319-59775f6a-1cd9-49ba-93c7-818ed480addd.png)\r\n\r\n`clip: true` set directly on scrollable component:\r\n![191949897-bdc9fb26-0594-4384-9804-e0168ce1c19e](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20650004/192503548-3983fb63-0690-4226-a1da-4947976579f4.png)\r\n",
