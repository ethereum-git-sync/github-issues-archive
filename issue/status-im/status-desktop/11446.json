    "body": "@alexjba I've spent a few hrs to investigate what was wrong in migration in my case, it seems that the wrong config details were user based on data stored to my DB. In the `wakuv2_config` table I had some address set for `light_client` and some value for  `udp_port`, because of that my app was in a loading state while backend was waiting to connect to peers (using address and port from the config which was obviously bad), since any peer connection couldn't be made it remained in the loading state forever. I had to make a change directly into the db and after that I was finally able to migrate from `0.12.0-rc2` to `0.13.0-rc7` successfully.\r\n\r\nSo let's say that I fixed the migration issue I had, but the issue from the description, that encryption params are still very old ones is still here. Not sure what we can do about that, and also not sure how/why they didn't change?!",
