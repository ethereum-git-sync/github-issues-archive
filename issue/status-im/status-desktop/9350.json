  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nPrebuilt binaries of Qt5.15.8 are compiled using glibc 2.28 and migrating to this version will breaking compatibility with older linux versions. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this task is to setup the Linux CI to use latest Qt5.15.8 + KDAB fixes and keep the glibc dependency to a lower version (Ideally 2.23 or lower). Also, we will have this issue when moving to Qt6 and solving this will also help long term with newer qt versions.\r\n\r\nThere are multiple options that could be considered:\r\n1. Finding an out of the box setup - precompiled Qt binaries compatible with older linux versions\r\n1. Compiling Qt5.15.8 with KDAB patches + Status and link with glibc 2.23 (probably the easiest way to do it is on a linux distribution that uses this version)\r\n2. Try this hack https://github.com/wheybags/glibc_version_header and enable Nix environment on CI\r\n3. https://github.com/phusion/holy-build-box\r\n\r\nOn the CI side there are two approaches that were considered when migrating to Qt5.15: Docker and Nix. Nix is preferred, but it has the same limitation - will break compatibility with older linux dostros. We're using Docker for now.\r\n\r\nSee: #9222, #9232",
