    "body": "> Thanks @anastasiyaig I'd say it would make sense to have a blue notification dot for the settings icon in this instance. Despite the fact you can action the request from the AC, it feels odd to have notification badges inside the Settings area but not flag their presence at the parent nav item (the settings cog).\r\n> \r\n> What do you think @John-44 ?\r\n\r\n@benjthayer yes I agree, what you've said above is correct (there should be a small blue dot on the cog in this instance)",
