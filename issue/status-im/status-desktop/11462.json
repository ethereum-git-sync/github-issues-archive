Supports Ethereum Mainnet, Ethereum Testnet and Arbitrum Mainnet, see https://docs.infura.io/infura-expansion-apis/nft-api/rest-apis/supported-networks.\r\n- Alchemy does: https://docs.alchemy.com/reference/searchcontractmetadata-v3. Supports only Ethereum Mainnet. We'll possibly want to move to a higher-priced plan if we start using this, need to check the cost of this endpoint.\r\n- Moralis does (https://docs.moralis.io/web3-data-api/evm/reference/search-nfts?chain=eth&format=decimal&filter=name&addresses=[]), but the endpoint will be deprecated soon and it seems there will be no replacement.\r\n\r\nSo, we could get contract address/collection slug search support using\r\n- OpenSea: All chains\r\n- Infura: Eth Main/Test + Arb Main\r\n\r\nAnd text-based search support using\r\n- Infura: Eth Main/Test + Arb Main\r\n- Alchemy: Eth Main\r\n\r\nProbably a good idea to make some tests before making any decision.",

    "body": "Update: Infura's shutting down their NFT API\r\n\r\n```\r\nHey 👋\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe are writing to let you know that we will soon be sunsetting our NFT API + SDK. Infura’s mission is to provide web3 developers with reliable and cost-effective tools to make it easier to build web3 products and this strategic realignment will allow us to reprioritize our focus to develop products and services that we are uniquely positioned to create, and that we do better than anyone else.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe will be sunsetting these services in two phases:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPhase 1: September 1\r\n\r\nThe \"search NFT\" endpoint will no longer be valid\r\nWhen getting transfers within a block range using the fromBlock/toBlock query parameters, the total field will no longer be returned \r\n \r\n\r\nPhase 2: November 1\r\n\r\nAll other NFT endpoints will be sunset, along with the SDK\r\n \r\n\r\nTo ensure a seamless transition and uninterrupted NFT services, we recommend migrating to Moralis, a reliable and feature-rich platform for NFT operations. Moralis (https://moralis.io/) provides a comprehensive set of tools and services, and their team is dedicated to delivering an exceptional user experience that we trust at MetaMask.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and are here to support you during this transition. If you have any questions or need assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out to our support team at [support@infura.io.](mailto:support@infura.io)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo help with onboarding onto Moralis, Nicolai Melniciuc ([nicolai@moralis.io](mailto:nicolai@moralis.io)) from Moralis can help with all of your questions.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for your continued support. We are excited about the new opportunities this strategic shift will bring and look forward to serving you in new and innovative ways.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Infura Team\r\n````",
