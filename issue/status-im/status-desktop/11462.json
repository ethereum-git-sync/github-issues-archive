Token permissions to enable control of community smart contracts**\r\n- Before a community founder can use any of the community token admin functionality, they first have to deploy Owner and Token Master contracts.\r\n- This work involves: new empty state screen for Mint and Airdrop tokens (before current empty state screen is revealed), new flow for deploying the community's Owner and Token Master contracts in a single step, a fixed uneditable permission giving anybody who holds the Token Master token admin rights for the community should be automatically created.\r\n- Only the holder of the single Owner token can access the Token Master airdrop, remote destruct, and view holders functions. Anybody who holds the Token Master token can access all token admin options, excluding those related to the Token Master token itself, as well as being and Admin of the community.\r\n- This will all be explained in more detail in the designs.\r\n\r\nBackend Epic: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11249\r\n\r\n**2. Update Community Admin home screen inc control node transfer and associated dialogues**\r\n- Remove ability for a Owner to leave a community on the computer that's running as that community's control node\r\n- Community Admin home screen cleanup (inc. adding at least one of the three graphs, whichever is easiest to implement).\r\n  - Graph issue: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11152  \r\n  - Community overview: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11278\r\n\r\n**3. Ability for user to select & manage accounts shared with each community control node**\r\n- This item is quite a bit of work\r\n- Touches Community settings, as well as all of the community join flows\r\n- Backend issues: \r\n  - Join API: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11154\r\n  - Edit API: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11153\r\n\r\n**4. Encryption for token gated channels that are inside Open (not token gated) communities**\r\n[#10998](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/10998)\r\n\r\n**5. Final screens and bits and bobs needed prior to public beta**\r\n- Modal that's shown every time after login, reminding user's that Status Desktop is in Beta [#11044](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11044)\r\n- The bug with 'requests to join' a community not constantly arriving, or sometimes arriving after a delay, must be fixed. [#8264](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/8264)\r\n- Anything that didn't get completed in 0.13 related to new share URL format\r\n- All the outstanding bugs and small items that got pushed into the 0.14 milestone.\r\n\r\n\r\n**--- Things that we SHOULD NOT work on during the 0.14 cycle ---**\r\n- Messaging and UI teams shouldn't work on perf. in 0.14 (but Wallet team should!)\r\n- Anything big mutual contacts related, other than fixing small bugs we find like #10497 #10498 #11120 #11121  (hopefully this functionality working good enough now!)\r\n\r\n**--- Wallet Team ---**\r\n\r\n1. Finish any outstanding work related to Activity screens (top priority - aim to have complete by July 14th)\r\n\r\n2. Updated Wallet Settings screens UI inc. account syncing functionality  *Synced information should immediately be reflected in the UI after it is received (sometimes synced info is currently only displayed after the next app restart, this needs to be fixed)*\r\n\r\n3. Wallet performance and memory consumption optimisations\r\n\r\n4. Fix bugs, clean up loose ends (to get things in a good state before the work on the Mobile wallet starts)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Initial findings:\r\n\r\nIf we have some certainty that what the user entered is some specific piece of information (contract address, collection slug), we can make a search using specific endpoints in any of our providers. For example:\r\nhttps://docs.opensea.io/reference/retrieve-nfts-by-contract\r\nhttps://docs.opensea.io/reference/retrieve-nfts-by-collection\r\nhttps://docs.infura.io/infura-expansion-apis/nft-api/rest-apis/api-reference/collections#get-all-nfts-with-metadata-in-a-specific-collection\r\nhttps://docs.alchemy.com/reference/getnftsforcontract-v3\r\n\r\nIf we want to throw whatever the user enters to an API Endpoint and see if it matches any some field in the NFT metadata (For example enter \"bored\" and get the Bored Apes collection)\r\n- OpenSea does not seem to provide such an API Endpoint.\r\n- Infura does: https://docs.infura.io/infura-expansion-apis/nft-api/rest-apis/api-reference/metadata#search-for-nfts-given-a-string. Supports Ethereum Mainnet, Ethereum Testnet and Arbitrum Mainnet, see https://docs.infura.io/infura-expansion-apis/nft-api/rest-apis/supported-networks.\r\n- Alchemy does: https://docs.alchemy.com/reference/searchcontractmetadata-v3. Supports only Ethereum Mainnet. We'll possibly want to move to a higher-priced plan if we start using this, need to check the cost of this endpoint.\r\n- Moralis does (https://docs.moralis.io/web3-data-api/evm/reference/search-nfts?chain=eth&format=decimal&filter=name&addresses=[]), but the endpoint will be deprecated soon and it seems there will be no replacement.\r\n\r\nSo, we could get contract address/collection slug search support using\r\n- OpenSea: All chains\r\n- Infura: Eth Main/Test + Arb Main\r\n\r\nAnd text-based search support using\r\n- Infura: Eth Main/Test + Arb Main\r\n- Alchemy: Eth Main\r\n\r\nProbably a good idea to make some tests before making any decision.",

    "body": "Update: Infura's shutting down their NFT API\r\n\r\n```\r\nHey 👋\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe are writing to let you know that we will soon be sunsetting our NFT API + SDK. Infura’s mission is to provide web3 developers with reliable and cost-effective tools to make it easier to build web3 products and this strategic realignment will allow us to reprioritize our focus to develop products and services that we are uniquely positioned to create, and that we do better than anyone else.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe will be sunsetting these services in two phases:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPhase 1: September 1\r\n\r\nThe \"search NFT\" endpoint will no longer be valid\r\nWhen getting transfers within a block range using the fromBlock/toBlock query parameters, the total field will no longer be returned \r\n \r\n\r\nPhase 2: November 1\r\n\r\nAll other NFT endpoints will be sunset, along with the SDK\r\n \r\n\r\nTo ensure a seamless transition and uninterrupted NFT services, we recommend migrating to Moralis, a reliable and feature-rich platform for NFT operations. Moralis (https://moralis.io/) provides a comprehensive set of tools and services, and their team is dedicated to delivering an exceptional user experience that we trust at MetaMask.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and are here to support you during this transition. If you have any questions or need assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out to our support team at [support@infura.io.](mailto:support@infura.io)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo help with onboarding onto Moralis, Nicolai Melniciuc ([nicolai@moralis.io](mailto:nicolai@moralis.io)) from Moralis can help with all of your questions.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for your continued support. We are excited about the new opportunities this strategic shift will bring and look forward to serving you in new and innovative ways.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Infura Team\r\n````",
