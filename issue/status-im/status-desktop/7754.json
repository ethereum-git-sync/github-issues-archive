First of all, if we have a case where we render a reply-to-message component, but the actual information seems to be missing (like in the screenshot above), we should probably show at least a text or something that says something like \"Message couldn't be loaded\"\r\n2. Still need to investigate the core issue here, but my assumption is that, given that we only load the last 20 messages when entering a channel the first time (after bootstrap), the reply-to-messages are simply not available in memory yet. Maybe we need to tweak the message querying that we, despite a limit of 20, still add all reply-to-messages regardless",

(Draft PR https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/pull/8886)\r\n\r\nI think I found a bug with message deletion + replies in status-go. Basically, if you reply to a message, and that original message is deleted, if you then restart the app, we still get the `QuotedMessage` as the original message, nothing about it being deleted. What this creates is a situation where the original message is no longer showed in the message list, but the reply still shows that message. I assume this is a bug, but maybe we want to keep the context of the reply? @cammellos @John-44 ",

    "body": "> I mostly fixed the issue here, but there is one thing I found that I need info before going ahead. (Draft PR #8886)\r\n> \r\n> I think I found a bug with message deletion + replies in status-go. Basically, if you reply to a message, and that original message is deleted, if you then restart the app, we still get the `QuotedMessage` as the original message, nothing about it being deleted. What this creates is a situation where the original message is no longer showed in the message list, but the reply still shows that message. I assume this is a bug, but maybe we want to keep the context of the reply? @cammellos @John-44\r\n\r\nYes, as John mentioned, once you delete a message, replies as well should be gone",
