  "body": "# Bug Report\r\n\r\nOpening this issue as a replacement of https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/12363, as it has wrong description.\r\nThere was an initial assumption that chat loading animation is missing here. But it wasn't correct. The delay is happening for already loaded channels. This is a performance issue, not a missing animation bug.\r\n\r\n1. I found that removing these lines fixes the delay:\r\nhttps://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/blob/2d0047846739f076510378327ecbff85b05154f3/ui/app/AppLayouts/Chat/panels/UserListPanel.qml#L63-L70\r\nhttps://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/blob/2d0047846739f076510378327ecbff85b05154f3/ui/app/AppLayouts/Chat/panels/UserListPanel.qml#L76-L79\r\n\r\n2. I tried to replace `ExpressionRole` with `FastExpressionRole`, but it didn't really help:\r\nhttps://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/pull/13299\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Go to some big community, e.g. https://status.app/c/CxmACjEKDlRlc3QgQ29tbXVuaXR5Eg9PcGVuIGZvciBhbnlvbmUYrAEiByNGRjAwMDAqAgUJAw==#zQ3shnd55dNx9yTihuL6XMbmyM6UNjzU6jk77h5Js31jxcT5V\r\n2. Start switching between channels, note a delay.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/25482501/8fc16fb1-7d33-461c-8ffc-01937420be63\r\n",
