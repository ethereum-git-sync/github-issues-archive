    "body": "@John-44 as of this issue, we discussed that on the offsite but somehow in a rush, you've said then that if there are more than one keycard for a certain keypair we should display them as a list within a keycard specific view (without any option for selection (like radio button/checkbox). And also you've said when we run any of them we should check if the inserted keycard match any of the card from the list and proceed with that action if there is a mathc, otherwise display screen inserted keycard doesn't match known keycards.\r\n\r\nNow a question is... all actions which are available in that case (`Rename Keycard`, `Change PIN`, `Create a backup copy of this Keycard`, `Unlock Keycard`, `Create a 12-digit personal unblocking key (PUK)`, `Create a new pairing code`) are actually card specific actions and their flows in the figma design display keypair for the first screen, so we need to know in advance which keypair we're running an action for, but that's not possible if I don't know which one is selected?\r\n\r\nThere may be a case when user run the flow and on the \"insert keycard\" screen we need to ask him to insert a keycard where a certain keypair is stored, but that's not possible if previously (in case of having more than one keycard for a single keypair) non of keycard form the list is selected.",
