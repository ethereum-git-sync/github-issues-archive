    "description": "Priorities **in priority order** for the 0.12 milestone:  \r\n\r\n**1. Improve performance**\r\n- Focus on eliminating any UI freezes when the user clicks on something and the app does not display an immediate response.  Target: the app should ideally respond to all user input within 50ms, but let's start with identifying the longest UI freezes and trying to fix the worst UI freezes first.\r\n- Speed and responsiveness of switching between community channels, and 1on1 and ad-hoc group chats is particularly important, especially for channels and chats that contains a lot of history.  We should aim for about 250ms delay in the *worst* case if possible.  Having a lot of history in a channel should not slow channel switching down.\r\n- DB perf optimisations.  \r\n- Move things to async and off main thread\r\n- See Alex's great profiling work for possible tasks (Alex to continue focusing on perf. for this release cycle)\r\n- \"user facing performance in everyday app usage\" is the top priority, but any task that improves performance is worthwhile\r\n\r\n**2. Finish development of token based functionality from 0.11**\r\n- Optimise No. queries made by owner node when checking member tokens (Pascal)\r\n- Community encryption should automatically switch on/off depending on community permissions (issue #9942)\r\n- Implement the 'Admin' role (issue #10114)\r\n- Airdrop to community members (in addition to addresses)\r\n- Optimise gas required by collectable minting smart contracts (issue #9943, GravityBlast)\r\n--- After collectable minting gas optimisation is complete, start work on Asset minting contracts (GravityBlast)\r\n- Complete token remote destruct UI\r\n- Remove 'Community Permissions Settings', 'Community Tokens' and 'Discord Import Tool' feature flags (issue #10115)\r\n- Thoroughly test, and fix all bugs found. \r\n- Anything else related to Community level token permissions, collectable minting, airdropping, and remote destructing that didn't make it into 0.11\r\n\r\n**3. Finish implementing the ability for Community Owners and Admins to drag and drop channels and categories into different orders**\r\n\r\n**4. Finish anything related to the initial pairing process for syncing that wasn't completed in 0.11** (Igor)\r\n\r\n**5. Improve Mutual Contacts functionality to improve reliability and pay off tech debt** (Mishka)\r\n\r\n**6. Complete Community Directory Curation dApp integration inc. Featured functionality** (Patryk)\r\n \r\n**7. Backend for the Profile Showcase**\r\n\r\n**8. Identity Verification** (required for 'Profile Showcase')\r\n\r\n**9. Fix bugs, bugs and more bugs!**\r\n- Esp. find the cause of and fix the longstanding bug of some 'requests to join' not arriving for hours/days after they were sent!\r\n- Many 'fit and finish' bugs for the UI team\r\n\r\n**--- For the Wallet team ---**\r\n\r\n1. Continue feature development inc. kicking off development of the activity screens\r\n2. 'All accounts' section.  The ability to return all tokens owned by the user in all accounts (excluding watch only accounts) is also required for the Showcase functionality\r\n3. Widen scope of 'backup to waku' and 'syncing' so that all relevant Wallet user state is backed up and synced between devices\r\n4. Continue to ensure Wallet functionality is performant.\r\n5. Fix wallet bugs",

  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nCounterpart of the frontend task here: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/9052\r\n\r\nThis can be done before or after the front end task. It needs to be done after the Admin part however (https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/9086)\r\n\r\nIf the frontend is already implemented, hook into it. If not, just use a placeholder button.\r\n\r\nIf a community has a permission for entering, the user needs to fulfill the condition to do so.\r\n\r\nIn this case, it would be the simple have 1 SNT.\r\n\r\nIf he does not, he can't join.\r\nIf he does, he can.\r\n\r\nWhen he clicks on join, he needs to share his address with the Owner, so that the owner can validate that the user does have the valid entry condition (1 SNT).\r\n\r\nThe owner then approves the user and adds him as a member of the community, sending the signals as usual. The admin then saves the user's address in his DB so that later we can do checks on the members (the checks are not in the scope of this ticket).\r\nIf you prefer, you can split the saving of the user address in another issue (if you do, please create the issue).\r\n\r\nOut of scope is also the check on the user side that if he loses the SNT, we remove him from his side. We will do that in another issue.\r\n\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. If a community has a permission of needing 1 SNT to enter\r\n   - if user does not have SNT, a message (placeholder if needed) says that they cannot join\r\n   - if the user has SNT > 1, the button to join community is shown\r\n2. When the user clicks that button, the request is sent, but with the addition of sending the user's address to the owner\r\n3. Owner needs to validate the amount of SNT the user has, ignoring the request if the user doesn't have it. If he does, normal acceptance scenario\r\n4. [optional]: admin saves the user's address in the DB (update this acceptance criteria to show if you are doing it or not\r\n\r\n",
