    "body": "After user provides a seed phrase (or private key from keycard) we're requesting data from waku and have a delay of 30 seconds, that's why you always see loading screen after that action which lasts 30 seconds. In 90% cases data are fetched during that period, that's why you see all categories \"green\" after loading screen disappears (after those 30 seconds), but for the case when data are not fetched we're giving 2 mins extra time, if data doesn't appear within those 2 mins, re-fetch is a way to go, which is actually 2 mins more waiting with the hope that data will arrive, if not, a good way to proceed is to wait for some time, remove local Status folder and try to recover again. Actually by my opinion all is better that proceeding to create a new Status account with the same seed phrase, cause in that case you're losing all you had before, so that should be the very very last option to go with.",
