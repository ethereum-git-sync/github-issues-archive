We need to keep tech. debt at a roughly fixed level as we grow out functionality, can't let it accumulate! ;-)\r\n\r\n**2. Complete initial airdrop functionality**\r\n- Airdrop history screens\r\n- Ability to airdrop based on in-Community activity (No. of msg, No. msg in time range, joining a community, length of community membership)  Ability to combine multiple attributes into an airdrop\r\n- Ability to token gate airdrops\r\n- Live airdrop gas estimation when setting up airdrop\r\n\r\n**3. Token import functionality**\r\n- Ability for a community Owner to import ERC-20 and NFT tokens, to later be airdropped or retailed\r\n\r\n**4. Admin functionality enhancements**\r\n- Ability to mark a token gated channel as 'hidden', only visible to community members with the requisite tokens\r\n- optional service to once a month auto-kick all members who haven't been online for between 30 and 60 days (e.g. auto-kick members whose profile information like Name, Avatar, etc... can no longer be fetched)\r\n\r\n**5.

  "body": "Version 0.11, Windows 10\r\n\r\nI performed a clean fresh install of Status Desktop, and restored via seed phrase around 60 hours ago, Status Desktop has been running continually since then, and the community history archive download and unpack hasn't happened yet.\r\n\r\nEither it is:\r\nA) delayed (in which case this needs to be fixed) \r\n*or*\r\nB) it is broken (in which case it also needs to be fixed)\r\n\r\nI remember that previously we had an issue with the history download sometimes not starting for up to 7 days after a user joins a community.  This issue is to track fixing this.\r\n\r\nIf the owner node is (when online) is posting the torrent link to waku every say 8 hours (or if offline for more than 8 hours, it posts the torrent link to waku as soon as it comes online), then as long as the owner node has been online once in the last 30 days, a community member's install of Status Desktop should always be able to fetch the latest torrent link from waku store nodes at the same time as all the other initial fetching of messages from waku store nodes is performed.  Is this correct?  If so there must be a bug somewhere that is preventing this from working.  \r\n\r\nThere was a bug with fetching historical messages older than 24h from waku store nodes that I think @richard-ramos has now fixed, I wonder if this bug was impacting the Community History Archive service?\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n**Desired resolution:**\r\n\r\n- The download of the latest Community History Archive should start within 1 hour of a user joining a new community (or within 1 hour of a community member performing a fresh install of Status Desktop and restoring their communities via either syncing with another device or from the backup to waku).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n",

But we should leave this issue open until QA have confirmed that this issue is fixed, because there is also a chance that fortuitous timing of when you chose to restore being the cause of the download starting immediately (need to test this multiple times, at different times, to be sure it is fixed).  \r\n\r\nI wonder if the \"missing requests to join community\" issue that @iurimatias has been facing is also connected to this (hopefully now fixed in master) waku message retrieval from store node bug?  We shall see!",

    "body": "> I performed a clean fresh install of Status Desktop, and restored via seed phrase around 60 hours ago, Status Desktop has been running continually since then, and the community history archive download and unpack hasn't happened yet.\r\n\r\n> Either it is:\r\nA) delayed (in which case this needs to be fixed)\r\nor\r\nB) it is broken (in which case it also needs to be fixed)\r\n\r\nThere are various reasons why it might take some time for the archive protocol to kick in:\r\n\r\n1. Your node has not received a magnet link message yet (maybe even failed to get one from store nodes)\r\n2. Your node has received a magnet link message but it's outdated (no torrent is served for this link anymore)\r\n3. Your node has received a magnet link, but the torrent timed out, so it has to wait for the next one\r\n4. Your node has received a magnet link and it actually started doing its work, it just takes a while\r\n5. Or something is indeed broken\r\n\r\nA look at your logs around that time should give us enough insights (I've put plenty of them in there).\r\n\r\n> I remember that previously we had an issue with the history download sometimes not starting for up to 7 days after a user joins a community. This issue is to track fixing this.\r\n\r\n^ This is the case where a node receives a magnet link, tries to fetch the torrent info from the torrent network and fails to do so (it times out). When that happens, we retry again. If it still times out we just let it be and wait for the next magnet link, which is publish by the owner node as soon as it comes online again (or when it creates new archives).\r\n\r\n> If the owner node is (when online) is posting the torrent link to waku every say 8 hours (or if offline for more than 8 hours, it posts the torrent link to waku as soon as it comes online), then as long as the owner node has been online once in the last 30 days, a community member's install of Status Desktop should always be able to fetch the latest torrent link from waku store nodes at the same time as all the other initial fetching of messages from waku store nodes is performed. Is this correct? If so there must be a bug somewhere that is preventing this from working.\r\n\r\nThis is correct, except that right now the owner node does not republish a magnet link every 8 hours.\r\nIt publishes it whenever it starts seeding a torrent for a community. This happens when:\r\n\r\na) The owner node comes online, and it already has a torrent file to be seeded\r\nb) The owner node creates new archives, updates the torrent file, and then seeds it\r\n\r\nDue to a) this basically means, whenever the node comes online it'll publish a magnet link if it has a torrent to seed.\r\nMember nodes keep track of the last magnet link they've seen, so they ignore it if they've seen it before.\r\n\r\n> The download of the latest Community History Archive should start within 1 hour of a user joining a new community (or within 1 hour of a community member performing a fresh install of Status Desktop and restoring their communities via either syncing with another device or from the backup to waku)\r\n\r\nDownload of community archives will start as soon as a member node has received the torrent info from the magnet link.\r\nWhen joining a community, the community member will receive a magnet link along with its invite. If the torrent is available at that time, it will start the download (assuming it doesn't time out).\r\n\r\nIt's gonna be hard to put the 1 hour time constraint on that, because we never have the guarantee that someone is actually seeding the torrent.\r\n\r\nI believe all in all, it'd be better to have some UI feedback for the user when loading of archives is happening. \r\nWe can even show some progress with #n out of #m data pieces/archives so users get a feel for the progress...",
