    "description": "Priorities **in priority order** for the 0.13 milestone:\r\n\r\n**0. Performance & Memory usage**\r\n\r\n- Further improve CPU & Memory usage\r\n- Make app more responsive and snappy\r\n\r\n**1. Finish items started in 0.12**\r\n- Complete any outstanding issues related to pairing (for syncing) - Igor\r\n- Implement the 'Admin' role (issue #10114) - Mykhailo\r\n- 'Featured' category curation via curation dApp - Patryk\r\n- Any remaining work to pay off tech. debt related to mutual contacts - Mishka\r\n- When creating/editing token based permission, ability to search for and selecting Collectables from OpenSea - MichaelC\r\n\r\n**2. Channel token permissions**\r\n- Create, edit and delete channel token permissions in the permissions admin screens\r\n- This includes the \"no tokens required to view this channel\" permission\r\n- All user facing channel token permissions functionality e.g. what happens when a user tries to access a token gated channel they don't have the required tokens to access, what happens when a user only has permissions to view a channel, etc...\r\n- If a community is an open (not token gated at the community level) community, if a channel is token gated AND if **no** \"no tokens required to view this channel\" permission for that channel exists, then the channel should be automatically encrypted.  If token gating is removed from a channel, the channel should become unencrypted.\r\n- Asset (ERC-20) minting and airdropping functionality - GravityBlast\r\n\r\n**3. Add some type of cache in front of sqlite to ensure that writes don't block reads (Patryk?)**\r\n- It has been discovered that one of the causes of sometimes slow channel switching is that writes to sqlite block reads, and this is the cause of slow channel switching in many cases\r\n- Investigate the feasibility of (and if feasible implement) a general purpose cache for sqlite writes, which caches sqlite writes and then only writes them to sqlite in small chunks when no read operations are taking place (so that read operations are always prioritized, and not interrupted by writes).  Such a cache should cache all or almost all write requests from all areas of status-go\r\n\r\n**_OR_**\r\n\r\n- Perhaps it's time to bite the bullet and start the work needed to migrate both Status Desktop and Status Mobile from using sqlite to using PostgreSQL?\r\n\r\n**_OR_**\r\n\r\n- Perhaps there are some other possible solutions to this issue that should be explored before embarking on either of these large items?\r\n\r\n**4. Update app to use new 'Share URL' formats**\r\n- add functionality to status-go to generate the new 'Share URL' formats for sharing links to: User Profiles, Communities, Channel inside a Community\r\n- Update everywhere a user can share a URL from to use the new URL format\r\n- Ability to share a URL that points to a specific channel in a community (issue #10160)\r\n- Update all address inputs to accept a user pasting a 'share URL' into the input (in addition to being able to input the raw address).  This includes: Start new chat input, send contact request input in Settings, the import community key input, etc...\r\n- Update Status Desktops URL handler so that if Status is installed on a computer, when a user clicks on a Status 'Share URL' the app is launched (if not already running) and after signing in the user is automatically taken to the entity the Share URL represented inside the app.  e.g. if a user clicks on a URL for a Status Community, the user should be taken to the home screen for that community inside the Status App\r\n\r\n**5. Profile showcase backend***\r\n\r\n**6. Fix bugs, bugs and more bugs!**\r\n- The 0.13 release is targeted to be Status Desktop's first \"beta\" release, and the first release of Status Desktop that will be used by people outside of the Status Org.  So we want this release to be the best possible quality so it makes a good first impression  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**--- For the Wallet team ---**\r\n\r\n1. Complete any outstanding development related to the activity screens\r\n2. New settings screens\r\n3. Fix 'backup from waku' bugs\r\n4. Fix keycard bugs\r\n5. Implement 'imported key and account' syncing and transfer between devices\r\n6. Transaction signing dialogue (if designs are ready)\r\n\r\n",

  "body": "Version 0.11, Windows 10\r\n\r\nI performed a clean fresh install of Status Desktop, and restored via seed phrase around 60 hours ago, Status Desktop has been running continually since then, and the community history archive download and unpack hasn't happened yet.\r\n\r\nEither it is:\r\nA) delayed (in which case this needs to be fixed) \r\n*or*\r\nB) it is broken (in which case it also needs to be fixed)\r\n\r\nI remember that previously we had an issue with the history download sometimes not starting for up to 7 days after a user joins a community.  This issue is to track fixing this.\r\n\r\nIf the owner node is (when online) is posting the torrent link to waku every say 8 hours (or if offline for more than 8 hours, it posts the torrent link to waku as soon as it comes online), then as long as the owner node has been online once in the last 30 days, a community member's install of Status Desktop should always be able to fetch the latest torrent link from waku store nodes at the same time as all the other initial fetching of messages from waku store nodes is performed.  Is this correct?  If so there must be a bug somewhere that is preventing this from working.  \r\n\r\nThere was a bug with fetching historical messages older than 24h from waku store nodes that I think @richard-ramos has now fixed, I wonder if this bug was impacting the Community History Archive service?\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n**Desired resolution:**\r\n\r\n- The download of the latest Community History Archive should start within 1 hour of a user joining a new community (or within 1 hour of a community member performing a fresh install of Status Desktop and restoring their communities via either syncing with another device or from the backup to waku).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n",

But we should leave this issue open until QA have confirmed that this issue is fixed, because there is also a chance that fortuitous timing of when you chose to restore being the cause of the download starting immediately (need to test this multiple times, at different times, to be sure it is fixed).  \r\n\r\nI wonder if the \"missing requests to join community\" issue that @iurimatias has been facing is also connected to this (hopefully now fixed in master) waku message retrieval from store node bug?  We shall see!",

    "body": "> I performed a clean fresh install of Status Desktop, and restored via seed phrase around 60 hours ago, Status Desktop has been running continually since then, and the community history archive download and unpack hasn't happened yet.\r\n\r\n> Either it is:\r\nA) delayed (in which case this needs to be fixed)\r\nor\r\nB) it is broken (in which case it also needs to be fixed)\r\n\r\nThere are various reasons why it might take some time for the archive protocol to kick in:\r\n\r\n1. Your node has not received a magnet link message yet (maybe even failed to get one from store nodes)\r\n2. Your node has received a magnet link message but it's outdated (no torrent is served for this link anymore)\r\n3. Your node has received a magnet link, but the torrent timed out, so it has to wait for the next one\r\n4. Your node has received a magnet link and it actually started doing its work, it just takes a while\r\n5. Or something is indeed broken\r\n\r\nA look at your logs around that time should give us enough insights (I've put plenty of them in there).\r\n\r\n> I remember that previously we had an issue with the history download sometimes not starting for up to 7 days after a user joins a community. This issue is to track fixing this.\r\n\r\n^ This is the case where a node receives a magnet link, tries to fetch the torrent info from the torrent network and fails to do so (it times out). When that happens, we retry again. If it still times out we just let it be and wait for the next magnet link, which is publish by the owner node as soon as it comes online again (or when it creates new archives).\r\n\r\n> If the owner node is (when online) is posting the torrent link to waku every say 8 hours (or if offline for more than 8 hours, it posts the torrent link to waku as soon as it comes online), then as long as the owner node has been online once in the last 30 days, a community member's install of Status Desktop should always be able to fetch the latest torrent link from waku store nodes at the same time as all the other initial fetching of messages from waku store nodes is performed. Is this correct? If so there must be a bug somewhere that is preventing this from working.\r\n\r\nThis is correct, except that right now the owner node does not republish a magnet link every 8 hours.\r\nIt publishes it whenever it starts seeding a torrent for a community. This happens when:\r\n\r\na) The owner node comes online, and it already has a torrent file to be seeded\r\nb) The owner node creates new archives, updates the torrent file, and then seeds it\r\n\r\nDue to a) this basically means, whenever the node comes online it'll publish a magnet link if it has a torrent to seed.\r\nMember nodes keep track of the last magnet link they've seen, so they ignore it if they've seen it before.\r\n\r\n> The download of the latest Community History Archive should start within 1 hour of a user joining a new community (or within 1 hour of a community member performing a fresh install of Status Desktop and restoring their communities via either syncing with another device or from the backup to waku)\r\n\r\nDownload of community archives will start as soon as a member node has received the torrent info from the magnet link.\r\nWhen joining a community, the community member will receive a magnet link along with its invite. If the torrent is available at that time, it will start the download (assuming it doesn't time out).\r\n\r\nIt's gonna be hard to put the 1 hour time constraint on that, because we never have the guarantee that someone is actually seeding the torrent.\r\n\r\nI believe all in all, it'd be better to have some UI feedback for the user when loading of archives is happening. \r\nWe can even show some progress with #n out of #m data pieces/archives so users get a feel for the progress...",
