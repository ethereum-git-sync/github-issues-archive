  "body": "# Bug Report\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nWhen clicking on an item in the notification bar:\r\n\r\n- Behaviour is erratic/slow:\r\n  - it does not jump to the channel if the message is in a community but community is not selected in the left hand sidebar\r\n  - When it finally jumps after several seconds, it does not always get to the message\r\n- Poor feedback:\r\n\t-  There is no feedback on whether the item is clickable or what should be clicked\r\n\t- no feedback on whether the item is indeed clicked\r\n\t- no visual aid to highlight the message once jump to channel is done\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Get someone to reply to you\r\n2. open notification menu\r\n3. click on message\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n- Visual aid to understand that the item is clickable\r\n- Visual aid to understand where we should click (sometime clicking on a word and not sure if it's clickable or I am just selecting text)\r\n- Visual aid to understand that it has been clicked\r\n- Faster experience to jump to the right channel/message\r\n- Open the right community if message is from a community channel\r\n- Better location to the message: ie, open the channel with clicked message on top but with some top margin\r\n- Visual aid to locate the message (eg, temporary highlight of said message in channel),\r\n\r\n#### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nSee description\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n- Status desktop version: 0.8.0 & 0.8.1\r\n- Operating System: Fedora Linux\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110212804/207182816-fd9471a8-aa23-486d-89fe-b1e104d8300e.mp4",
