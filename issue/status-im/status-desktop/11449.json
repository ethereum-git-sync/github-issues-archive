  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nThis issue was spotted in the context of KeycardPopup. When the popup had the wrong width, the buttons would overflow. The same would apply to the buttons with long translations even if the popup has the width from design.\r\n\r\nOne solution proposed for issue is for StatusModal to support dynamic width based on content (header and footer included) and/or calculate a max width for individual footer buttons to prevent overflow.\r\n\r\n### Context\r\n\r\n> Although... with a translated app, the individual buttons widths might be much wider and so we'd probably overflow again :/ This needs a more generic solution in the long run\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @caybro in https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11438#issuecomment-1625109921_\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1464\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-07-07 at 13 30 16\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47811206/251729727-28e25f64-628b-40ec-bd86-da6a2a5774af.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n",
