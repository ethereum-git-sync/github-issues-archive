It also doesn't make sense to me that blocking a user wou ld kick them from communities the user owns, that might not be their goal they might simply not want to chat with that person anymore cc: @John-44 ",

    "body": "@iurimatias let's discuss when I'm back next week.  The challenge we are facing is that when UserA blocks UserB, UserB becomes totally invisible in all contexts to UserA.  This is a problem if (for example) UserA is also the owner of a community the UserB is a member of, because once UserA has blocked UserB, UserA will no longer be able moderate UserB's messages in the community, or even see UserB in their community.  Similar issue with ad-hoc group chats.  Anyhow, let's talk through this next week. ",
