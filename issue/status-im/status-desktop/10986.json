    "body": "Based on my analysis of possible solutions, there could be 2 ways of solving this issue \n\nMy understanding is that when we first use Status to send/receive message with albums, those message are perfectly set in the ChatView. However, we do not store those messages in a way that enables us to display them correctly when reloading the app. That’s why I am adding new 2 properties : the count of quoted message images in album and the actually images links for the quoted message. This should resolve the problem when reloading the app.  There is another way of achieving this by fetching asynchronously the quoted message infos. But this is very slow and not preferred method.\n\n1- [preferred] Add new properties in nim and do a binding with Qml\nHere I will need 2 properties : images of an album, and the actual number of images in the album. Please note that these images I need are quoted images, similar to already existing quotedMessage Text.\n\n2- [slow] Call a function to retrieve the images for a specific message id\nThis option is slow and probably asynchronous\n\nI am currently working on implementing solution 1-",

    "body": "I wonder now if it's not a problem in status-go. We do see the images when we first receive the reply, that means that the model supports showing them correctly and also that we get all the wanted data from the backend when we receive it through the signal (event from status-go).\r\n\r\nHowever, on app reload, we do not use the signal, we use a function to get messages in pages (like 20 messages), and probably that function doesn't return the album of messages as part of the message.\r\n\r\nOne way to check what you receive from status-go would be to `echo jsonSignal` in `signals_manager.nim`. That will show you all the signals received from status-go.\r\nYou can then identify what you get when you receive a reply with an album.\r\n\r\nThen, you can compare with what we get on app start by doing `echo msgsResponse` in `asyncFetchChatMessagesTask`in `message/async_tasks.nim`.\r\n\r\nIf you see that the returned message in the latter is missing info compared to the one in the former, that means we are missing something in sttaus-go.\r\n\r\nIn that case, @borismelnik can help you identify how he passed the album to the message reply.",

    "body": "I have added some `echo` lines as recommended above, here are the observations : \n\n### Before the reboot\nI added some logs lines to to print the signal received. It's just a signal here, I seems logical to me that I don't see the actual payload. So here I am missing finding the actual place where the payload is sent from `nim` to `status-go`\nI am also not able to observe any communication on the way `status-go` to `nim`, by observing on the status-go side.\n\nEx : \n```\n---> receiveSignal decoded signal : {\"type\":\"messages.new\",\"event\":{\"notifications\":null,\"statusUpdates\":[{\"publicKey\":\"0x04c429330e366166687319c372775b39a917352e1af7f1510bf0a7a7805f7a2597030753529f3ff5e55b5a27c1d0be154312fa924532ac2ad005ed403223a43e9b\",\"statusType\":1,\"clock\":1700211606,\"text\":\"\"}],\"discordOldestMessageTimestamp\":0}}\n```\n\n### After reboot\nAfter reboot, I have much more info that I can analyze after pretifying the json.  What I can see is : The quoted message which I am interested with comes with a matching text and image from the `asyncFetchChatMessagesTaskin` perspective.\nFor my particular test however, while I was expecting 2 images, only actually 1 image repeated in messages. While the albumImage count is correct.\n\nSo based on above observations, there is something not working correctly when loading the messages from status-go. So as action : \n\n- I need to confirm what is actually sent before reboot (I need better way to observe the message sent from nim to status-go)\n- Once I know above, I can either have to fix status-go or making sure the code retrieve the info and displays them correctly.\n\nEx:\n```\n[\n  {\n    \"id\": \"0x5a02b81d98a2abc6879f02a6e82a6416ff083f76347da7d589905727d87dd6cc\",\n    \"whisperTimestamp\": 1700209257936,\n    \"from\": \"0x049563f3dae3c4dc1f1ff72463ab2f7ffa5011bf0f938c0dd87db8955d61ad70ff49393ad1c1dc53890df4e091af1b3d64724017ad9b0fdce6236f8965c4489278\",\n    \"alias\": \"\",\n    \"identicon\": \"\",\n    \"seen\": true,\n    \"outgoingStatus\": \"delivered\",\n    \"quotedMessage\": {\n      \"id\": \"0xd9c8ae3adf49fe4f5c8fe18327f015652ad204c17fd377a5828b0b3f168ba258\",\n      \"contentType\": 7,\n      \"from\": \"0x049563f3dae3c4dc1f1ff72463ab2f7ffa5011bf0f938c0dd87db8955d61ad70ff49393ad1c1dc53890df4e091af1b3d64724017ad9b0fdce6236f8965c4489278\",\n      \"text\": \"Sender message 1\",\n      \"parsedText\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"paragraph\",\n          \"children\": [\n            {\n              \"literal\": \"Sender message 1\"\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ],\n      \"albumImagesCount\": 2,\n      \"image\": \"https://Localhost:39325/messages/images?messageId=0xd9c8ae3adf49fe4f5c8fe18327f015652ad204c17fd377a5828b0b3f168ba258\"\n    },\n    \"rtl\": false,\n    \"parsedText\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"paragraph\",\n        \"children\": [\n          {\n            \"literal\": \"Receiver message 1\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ],\n    \"lineCount\": 0,\n    \"text\": \"Receiver message 1\",\n    \"chatId\": \"0x04c429330e366166687319c372775b39a917352e1af7f1510bf0a7a7805f7a2597030753529f3ff5e55b5a27c1d0be154312fa924532ac2ad005ed403223a43e9b\",\n    \"localChatId\": \"0x04c429330e366166687319c372775b39a917352e1af7f1510bf0a7a7805f7a2597030753529f3ff5e55b5a27c1d0be154312fa924532ac2ad005ed403223a43e9b\",\n    \"clock\": 1700209257936,\n    \"replace\": \"\",\n    \"responseTo\": \"0xd9c8ae3adf49fe4f5c8fe18327f015652ad204c17fd377a5828b0b3f168ba258\",\n    \"ensName\": \"\",\n    \"displayName\": \"\",\n    \"image\": \"https://Localhost:39325/messages/images?messageId=0x5a02b81d98a2abc6879f02a6e82a6416ff083f76347da7d589905727d87dd6cc\",\n    \"albumId\": \"371a1c7d-26a4-4caa-8abc-d70ee3dba7b4\",\n    \"albumImagesCount\": 3,\n    \"gapParameters\": {},\n    \"timestamp\": 1700209257936,\n    \"contentType\": 7,\n    \"messageType\": 1,\n    \"compressedKey\": \"zQ3shXTwuHEukauQdkJhELxj9Bk575cRrAqzjuZfJzbabVfGa\",\n    \"emojiHash\": [\n      \"👨🏿‍🎨\",\n      \"😩\",\n      \"🐱\",\n      \"👊🏿\",\n      \"👩🏾‍🚒\",\n      \"🚣‍♂️\",\n      \"👩🏼‍🦰\",\n      \"🌰\",\n      \"🔔\",\n      \"🅿️\",\n      \"🙆🏼‍♂️\",\n      \"🤽🏿\",\n      \"🤹🏾\",\n      \"📽️\"\n    ]\n  }\n  ...\n  ]\n  \n````",

It's served by the localhost when Status in running. So I opened it on a browser (magic!), and it's one of the original message to which I replied.\n\n> The actual images would come in an album property.\n\nwhat you mentioned below matched my observation. A message can be split into multiple message, I thought there is no such thing as album in quotedMessage structure. Those images can be grouped in album later on. \n\n> It would look something like `{\"type\": \"message-new\", ...}`  with a big payload.\n\nRight... There must something else that I am missing here cause I saw similar messages type message-new but no payload. I'll post the code here in a few.\n\n> Now that I rethink about it, the album feature can be a little complex, because the images can come in multiple different messages from waku.

    "body": "Hi,\n\nThe reason why the before reload everything works perfectly is because inside MessageView.qml\n\nhttps://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/blob/78303105915e17c4e8ff4d176f8b46e3b8381dae/ui/imports/shared/views/chat/MessageView.qml#L669\n\nOn `onResponseMessageChanged` signal, we call the `messageStore.getMessageByIdAsJson(responseToMessageWithId)` to obtain the images of the quotedMessage. \n\nBut the model is not made aware of this change at any time. Therefore, when reloading the application, the message doesn't contain the necessary quoted Images to be displayed.\nHowever, the quotedMessage text already exists in the model.\n\nI am currently exploring a solution where I gather the images from the message module in nim.\n\nCurrently, I am able to retrieve one image per quotedMessage. Once all the images retrieved, I will expose a quotedMessageAlbumCount and quotedMessageAlbumImages to be used in the MessageView component for any replies.\n",
