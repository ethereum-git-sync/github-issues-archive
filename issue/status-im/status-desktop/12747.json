So the information displayed in the screencast is technically correct.\r\n\r\nHowever I agree that in this case it looks a bit confusing.  Not sure if there is a design quick fix here or not though.  Perhaps something @benjthayer could take a look quick look at *after* the work on profile and WalletConnect has been completed?  Profile and WalletConnect have to take design priority over this item.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
