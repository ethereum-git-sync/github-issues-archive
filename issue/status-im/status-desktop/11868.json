  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nWe've got some repeated patterns in the status-go Wallet Activity and Collectibles modules with regards to management of async tasks triggered by the client. We can probably develop a common\"task manager\" module that handles:\r\n- Client registration (no need to hardcode the requestID in the Client)\r\n- TaskID handler registration (distribute handlers of each taskID across different modules)\r\n- Common structure for response events (for easily identifying on the client side which response event comes from which task run), no need to use different events for each new task.\r\n- Single generic API function for Task execution.\r\n\r\nWe're now manually managing task distribution between threads (1 scheduler -> 1 thread). Is this desired, or do we want something more flexible like a thread pool? There are some thread pool implementations available.\r\n\r\n",
