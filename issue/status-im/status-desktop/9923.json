    "description": "**1. Finish anything that wasn't completed in the previous 0.16 cycle**\r\n\r\n- And fix bugs as usual.  We need to keep tech. debt at a roughly fixed level as we grow out functionality, can't let it accumulate! ;-)\r\n\r\n- Ensure accounts stored on Keycard are taken into consideration for community permissions\r\n\r\n**2. Token import functionality**\r\n- Ability for a community Owner to import ERC-20 and NFT tokens, to later be airdropped or retailed\r\n\r\n**3. Binaries over Waku**\r\n- Improve transfer of binaries over waku via splitting into chunks https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/9923\r\n- Posting of small files (max size somewhere in the region of 1 to 2mb).  Requires above item before going live\r\n\r\n\r\n**4.  IPFS service for community minted NFTs and other binary community assets**\r\n\r\n- In order for NFT tokens minted in our UI to be correctly displayed with all metadata on OpenSea, their assets need to be stored in IPFS (because IPFS is supported by OpenSea)\r\n\r\n- Will work something like this: IPFS pinning server is integrated into Status Desktop. When a community mints a NFT, the associated assets are IPFS pinned by the community control node.  The community control node then sends a 'user invisible message' to all other community members via Waku, and the Status Desktop installs of all community members then fetch the NFT assets and pin them as well.  This means that every member of a community that is running Status Desktop will always be 'IPFS pinning' all assets related to the community, so that as long as one community member that uses Status Desktop is online, the assets are guaranteed to be available via IPFS.\r\n\r\n- Use a similar scheme to the above for other community assets (that are not related to token minting) like: Community banner image, community icon, community description.\r\n\r\n- Use a similar scheme to the above but for status user data.  Status users pin assets related to their profile (banner image, avatar) using IPFS, and all of the user's mutual contacts also pin that user's profile data.  Must incorporate a setting so that users can opt-out of pinning their mutual contact's profile data.\r\n\r\n**5. Automatic bandwidth test on app startup**\r\n\r\n- automatic bandwidth test on app startup, and use results to automatically configure the waku shard usage appropriately depending on the available bandwidth (at the 'user has tons of bandwidth' end of the spectrum all waku shards will use waku Relay mode, at the 'user has very little bandwidth' end of the spectrum all waku shards will use waku filter + light push mode, and in between these two ends of the spectrum the user will use a mix of waku relay mode and waku filter + light push mode for different shards).  Plus also use  the results of the bandwidth test to automatically set the bittorred throttling at an appropriate setting at the beginning of each new session.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

  "body": "## Problem:\r\n- Waku isn't designed to send large messages\r\n\r\n- libp2p (which Waku is built on top of) is in the process of being optimised by ProtocolLabs and others for messages up to 125kb in size, as part of the work to implement Ethereum's DankSharding (EIP-4844)\r\n\r\n- Users expect good quality images in a messaging app, but Status currently has a 300kb image size limit, and images that user's post are recompressed to fit inside this size limit (which means that large images currently look rubbish in Status).\r\n\r\n- It would be nice to raise the length limit for audio messages in the future\r\n\r\n- We would like to allow users to share small files (e.g. up to 2mb) in the future\r\n\r\n- The community web onboarding screens (the screen a user who doesn't have Status installed arrives on when they open a community URL that has been sent to them in a browser) requires communities to use a large high quality image as their banner (see example screen below)\r\n![2023-03-16 13_44_23-Sharing for Mobile â€“ Figma](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22846356/225636968-e84110e3-a15d-4e82-8d83-90dd3c48f861.png)\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n- Add support to status-go to split binary files that are larger than 125kb into several waku messages, each with a 125kb payload.  Then at the recipient's end, reconstruct the binary from these multiple waku messages.\r\n\r\n- Increase the max size limit for each image sent in a message to 1.5mb.  If an image is less than 1.5mb it should not be recompressed.  If an image is larger than 1.5mb it should be recompressed to 1.5mb using the recompression functionality that is already in status-go today.\r\n\r\n- Increase the max size of audio messages to 1.5mb (e.g. at it's largest size, it would be split into twelve 125kb waku messages)\r\n\r\n- Increase the max size of community banner images to 2.5mb (e.g. at it's largest size, it would be split into twenty 125kb waku messages)\r\n\r\n- Set the max size of a community logo image as 250kb (e.g. at it's largest size, it would be split into two 125kb waku messages)\r\n\r\n- Set the max size of a user avatar image as 125kb  (e.g. at it's largest size, it would be split into two 125kb waku messages)\r\n\r\n## Other notes\r\n\r\n- This feature should be worked on by the Desktop team (not the Mobile team, because the Mobile has more work to do to get to MVP) \r\n\r\n- The desktop team shouldn't work on this feature until after the 0.13 release\r\n\r\n- Before starting work on this feature, whoever is going to implement it should speak to both @cammellos (because this is an approach that @cammellos has already been thinking about) and @felicio (because @felicio will need to add support for this into status.js)   \r\n\r\ncc'ing @iurimatias ",
