While the link is loading it cannot be used to reach the community. \r\n![image](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/50769329/8571eccc-65d7-4166-a57e-ee65ae7bb6a0)\r\n\r\nAttempts at restarting seem to make no difference. Also unexpectedly, the issue has also been seen on the control node for the community where the data to unfurl would be coming from anyway.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nShare a link to a community in a chat. Observe how long it takes to unfurl and become usable.\r\n\r\n#### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nDelays un unfurling community URLs do not prevent users from reaching a community.\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n- Status desktop version: Master\r\n- Operating System: Mac\r\n\r\n",

I had to manually revert the change in my branch to be able to add someone as a contact.\r\n\r\n@borismelnik do you know how long it will take to fix #10852? If it takes more than a few days, it might be worth to revert the original change until then, because it makes it hard to test.",
