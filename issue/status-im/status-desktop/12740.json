  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nAfter the app displays the seed phrase, it checks if the user has written it down correctly by asking to type a few words of the seed phrase. The input is considered correct if the word is correctly typed in full. The seed words (if Status follows the BIP39 standard, that is) are chosen such that they differ in the first 4 letters. This means that it is sufficient to correctly back up the first 4 letters of every word. Only requiring the user to type 4 letters can speed up the backup process.\r\n\r\nSuggested improvement: at the \"check seed phrase\" screen, consider the word as correct when the first 4 letters are typed correctly.",
