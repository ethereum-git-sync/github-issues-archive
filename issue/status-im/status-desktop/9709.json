So if a user starts writing a message, navigates somewhere else and later returns to where they were writing the message, the un-posted message should still be in the message input field. \r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Scenario 1 - message input box persistence in community channels\r\n\r\n<ins>Steps to reproduce:</ins>\r\n\r\n1. Navigate to any community channel screen that contains a message input field. \r\n\r\n2. Type a message into the message input field, but do not post the message \r\n\r\n3. Navigate away from that messaging screen to anywhere else in the app \r\n\r\n4.
