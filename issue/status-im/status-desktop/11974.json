It,s possible however that the user never shared them (very old account), or more probable, they lost their account and re-imported.\r\n\r\nIf that's the case, when the user's node gets the signal to get the shared addresses, the app should add a notification of some sort asking to select the shared addresses.\r\n\r\nI propose a notification in the activity center, but I'll leave it up to designers.\r\n\r\nOnce that prompt/notification is clicked by the user, it should make them go to the \"edit shared addresses\" modal, which will send the shared addresses correctly to the owner\r\n\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n- There is a prompt/notification that is shown to users that have no shared addresses in their DB for a specific community when asked by the owner\r\n- When clicked, that prompt goes to the edit shared addresses modal\r\n\r\n",

Clicking on it can open the \"edit shared\" addresses modal or the \"join community\" modal depending on the state.",
