Finish items started in 0.12**\r\n- Complete any outstanding issues related to pairing (for syncing) - Igor\r\n- Implement the 'Admin' role (issue #10114) - Mykhailo\r\n- Any remaining work to pay off tech. debt related to mutual contacts - Mishka\r\n- When creating/editing token based permission, ability to search for and selecting Collectables from OpenSea - MichaelC\r\n\r\n**2. Channel token permissions**\r\n- Create, edit and delete channel token permissions in the permissions admin screens\r\n- This includes the \"no tokens required to view this channel\" permission\r\n- All user facing channel token permissions functionality e.g. what happens when a user tries to access a token gated channel they don't have the required tokens to access, what happens when a user only has permissions to view a channel, etc...\r\n- If a community is an open (not token gated at the community level) community, if a channel is token gated AND if **no** \"no tokens required to view this channel\" permission for that channel exists, then the channel should be automatically encrypted.  If token gating is removed from a channel, the channel should become unencrypted.\r\n\r\n**3. DB perf improvements**\r\n- https://www.notion.so/Database-related-performance-1dbaa7ea894c461d885e55676683be07\r\n- Alex and Patryk to work on this, with help from Lukáš\r\n\r\n**4. Update app to use new 'Share URL' formats**\r\n- add functionality to status-go to generate the new 'Share URL' formats for sharing links to: User Profiles, Communities, Channel inside a Community (issue https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/10851)\r\n- Update everywhere a user can share a URL from to use the new URL format (issue https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/10852)\r\n- New/updated URL unroll designs for inside chat, including specific unrolls for the new User Profile, Community and Channel inside a Community URLs (issue https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/10585)\r\n- Ability to share a URL that points to a specific channel in a community (issue #10160)\r\n- Update all address inputs to accept a user pasting a 'share URL' into the input (in addition to being able to input the raw address).  This includes: Start new chat input, send contact request input in Settings, the import community key input, etc...\r\n- Update Status Desktops URL handler so that if Status is installed on a computer, when a user clicks on a Status 'Share URL' the app is launched (if not already running) and after signing in the user is automatically taken to the entity the Share URL represented inside the app.  e.g. if a user clicks on a URL for a Status Community, the user should be taken to the home screen for that community inside the Status App\r\n\r\n**5. Mint Assets functionality**\r\n- Also includes some small improvements to the mint Collectables functionality\r\n- Noelia, GravityBlast\r\n\r\n**6.

And how can I chat with them?\r\n\r\n@uraioa  Current versions of mobile still use the old (uncompressed) key format. I think newer versions will use the same format, but they are not ready yet.\r\n\r\nAs for what to do in the meantime, we still support the old format, so starting the chat on Desktop is possible.\r\n\r\nWhat you need to do is hit the pencil icon in the top of the channel list. If you Hover it, it says \"Start chat\".\r\n\r\nThen, in the input that opens at the top, you can paste the chat key of the other person. Even if it starts with 0x, you should see a popup to send them a contact request.\r\n\r\nHope it helps.",

    "body": "@uraioa @ZiMoFangCong Are you using Status Mobile 1.x (the version that is currently in the app stores) or a pre-alpha of Status Mobile 2.x?\r\n\r\nThe reason I'm asking is that the old legacy Status Mobile 1.x uses Waku1, and Status Desktop and Status Mobile 2.x use Waku2.  Waku1 and Waku2 are completely different protocols, and won't interop.   Also the device syncing functionality is only available in Status Desktop and will be available in future releases of Status Mobile 2.x, but it is not present Status Mobile 1.x (and wouldn't work anyway, because of the different underlying messaging protocols being used).\r\n\r\nSyncing a single user profile across two different installations of Status Desktop works today, and will this functionality will be present in a future Status Mobile 2.x release.  \r\n\r\nFor chat compatibility, today it's possible for different Status Desktop and Status Mobile 2.x users to message with each other (this is fully tested and being heavily dogfooded).  But it won't be possible for Status Mobile 1.x users to message with Status Desktop and Status Mobile 2.x users, and vice versa.    \r\n\r\nWhen the Status Mobile 2.x app store release comes out, all Status Mobile 1.x users will update to the new version.  After this has happened, all Status clients will be using the same protocols and will be fully compatible.  But at the moment Status Mobile 2.x is still \"pre-alpha\".  A public alpha release of Status Mobile 2.x is scheduled to happen later this year.\r\n\r\n",
