    "body": "Findings while fixing the wallet tests\r\n\r\n- High instability due to the sensitive availability of objects. Squish doesn't help with this and all the fine details of an item's state change must be considered; e.g. enabled or not, time to load ...\r\n  - Our complex and \"unstable\" data model makes this hard to implement without improvised `sleep`s which introduce further unpredictable behaviours that lead to instability\r\n    - The side effects are not always reproducible\r\n    - Small changes in logic or backend behaviour might affect the reproducibility\r\n    - Tests are fickle and, most of the time don't fail\r\n  - Debugging this is time-consuming and requires restarting the app very often\r\n- Lookup based on the control's content and not respecting the `objectName` rule made it hard to debug and reproduce the problem\r\n  - Some were reported in the PRs review and postponed for later. Doing it later makes it much harder\r\n  - Very hard to debug when the issue is reproducible only in CI (different platform).\r\n    - On the other side, if tests were running would have been caught early, and a fix easier deployed, by the person close to the context\r\n- Identifying actions QML actions from the python tests using squish is a nightmare. The squish tools available don't help much.\r\n  - I find it hard to improve this without a custom implementation\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n- It looks to me that the ways of control lookup by real-names don't work very well on our controls library and the workarounds we have are very costly in maintenance\r\n  - e.g. `objectName` for dynamically generated delegates or complex input controls where internal subcontrols have to be accessed\r\n- From my experience, squish might be a better fit for recording and replaying tests to be run in bulk at regression, where they can be redone if failing due to changes, than as an integration testing framework.\r\n- I consider that we should strive to find a better way of making UX unit-tests if we don't do real progress on the current approach\r\n  - e.g. test only QML part of the presentation layer after refactoring to have a good separation between controllers and models. Then separately test controllers and models for the right expected behaviour. The QML part can be unit-tested using the QTest framework",
