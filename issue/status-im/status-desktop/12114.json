All channels break at once.\r\n\r\nThe problem was found while working on https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/12046, but it was found that when the control node is updated to 0.14, the list of community members is restored normally. See comment [here](https://github.com/status-im/status-go/pull/3996#issuecomment-1708908041).\r\n\r\nAdding a new community member sometimes restores the correct list of community channel members, but after a while the problem may reappear.\r\n\r\nAlso note: \r\n- The community member sheet looks normal, only the channel member list is broken\r\n- I did not succeed to reproduce this issue with status-go tests and fresh communities. It's most likely that this only appears in older communities",
