We need to keep tech. debt at a roughly fixed level as we grow out functionality, can't let it accumulate! ;-)\r\n\r\n**2. Complete initial airdrop functionality**\r\n- Airdrop history screens\r\n- Ability to airdrop based on in-Community activity (No. of msg, No. msg in time range, joining a community, length of community membership)  Ability to combine multiple attributes into an airdrop\r\n- Ability to token gate airdrops\r\n- Live airdrop gas estimation when setting up airdrop\r\n\r\n**3.

Admin functionality enhancements**\r\n- Ability to mark a token gated channel as 'hidden', only visible to community members with the requisite tokens\r\n- optional service to once a month auto-kick all members who haven't been online for between 30 and 60 days (e.g. auto-kick members whose profile information like Name, Avatar, etc... can no longer be fetched)\r\n\r\n**5. QR scanner**\r\n- Needed for private key transfer\r\n- Ethereum key QRs (send modal triggered)\r\n- User Share URL in a QR (opens user profile dialogue) \r\n- Community and Channel inside Community URL in QRs (takes user to Community or Channel in Community)\r\n\r\n**6.

  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nIf you activate a link for a community that you do not know, we should start fetching its info, similarly to when a link is posted in the chat.\r\n\r\nIt also needs an Ephemeral notification that says that we are loading the data. You can reuse the one we have for the links.\r\n\r\nOnce the data is loaded, we should open the community in Spectate mode.\r\n\r\nThere should be an error ephemeral notification if we can't find the data.\r\n\r\nFinally, if we do know the community, but we are not spectating, it should just open it in spectate mode.\r\n\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n- Activating a community deep link should:\r\n  - show the community if we already have it in the left bar\r\n  - add it and show it in spectate mode if we have it in our DB but no longer spectating\r\n  - fetch its data and then add it and show it in spectate mode when the data is fetched\r\n    - show a loading ephemeral notification at the start of the fetch\r\n    - show an error ephemeral notification if the data fetch fails or doesn't return anything\r\n    - if the fetch succeeds, add the community to the left bar and open it in spectate mode\r\n\r\n",
