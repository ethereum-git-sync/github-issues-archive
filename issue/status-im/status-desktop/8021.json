  "body": "Prior us moving to `status.prod` and Waku2, when a user joined a community, the user's node would request/receive history messages from mailservers.\r\n\r\nThis is important because otherwise the user will join an empty chat room and only sees new messages that come in in real-time.\r\n\r\nThis is also important for the community protocol to work properly, as the member node needs to receive the latest published magnet link message to get access to possibly existing community archives.\r\n\r\nFor some reason, I don't see the member node receiving history messages from store nodes upon joining a community anymore.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Run two instances of Status Desktop both with a different account, owner and member\r\n2. Create a community with the owner account, make sure to also send a few messages in the #general channel \r\n3. Invite/share community with the member account\r\n4. Member account goes to community and requests access\r\n5. Owner accepts\r\n6. Once member node receives ACK from owner, it sees all channels/categories\r\n\r\nAfter 6, history message should be fetched from store nodes (from past 30 days), but this doesn't seem to be happening.\r\n\r\n/cc'ing @richard-ramos ",

    "body": "Okay, quick update here.\r\n\r\nWhat we're experiencing here is the result of how we changed the way users will enter communities.\r\n\r\nIn the past, users would receive some sort of community share link, they would request access from the chat view (at this point, the member account hasn't subscribed to the community channel yet) and as soon as the request was accepted, the community would be added to the app, the node would subscribe to the community channel and also request historic messages (past 30 days).\r\n\r\nNow, this is a bit different:\r\n\r\nThe member account receives a share link, but instead of requesting access here, the account uses that link to \"visit\" the community. By doing that, it also subscribes to the community channel to receive the community description. It will also receive anything else that was published on that channel (including magnet link messages for the archive protocol).\r\n**Now** the user requests access and has already seen the latest community channel messages. So after the request to join has been accepted, it looks like historic messages from the community channel aren't fetched (when in fact they have been fetched already)\r\n\r\nI'll close this issue.\r\n",
