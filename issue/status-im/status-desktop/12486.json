  "body": "# Bug Report\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nIt's not purely  a bug, but it's not really  a feature either. It's basically that it's bad UX right now in the Create Community Popup.\r\nWhen you enter a Name and Description, the Next button is still disabled.\r\n\r\nWe should make it clear which fields are necessary.\r\n\r\nI'll leave it up to the design and UI team to decide what is the best way. Propositions:\r\n- Add an asterisk `*` next to the obligatory field\r\n- Add text somewhere of the missing fields that gets updated when a field is filled\r\n- Add a tooltip on the button saying which fields are missing\r\n- Let the button be enabled, but clicking it shows an \"error\" state on the mssing states\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n0. Be in release (or set `isDevBuild` to `false` in `CreateCommunityPopup.qml`)\r\n1. Go to the portal\r\n2. Hit Create New Community\r\n3. Hit Create New\r\n4. Enter Name and Description\r\n5. Button is still disabled and we don't know why\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Thanks for pointing this out @caybro @jrainville .\r\n\r\nI agree disabling the `Next` button leaves the user some work to do to understand what they need to do in order to proceed, especially if they have entered a valid name and description, which as a user, I would assume to be the mandatory fields in the form. It's also not the most accessible pattern for form validation. Disabling the primary action works better when there are less fields to fulfil which makes it easier for the user to understand what is required of them and why they may be blocked.\r\n\r\nI think the 2 most appropriate routes in this case would be as shown in the below:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.figma.com/file/qHfFm7C9LwtXpfdbxssCK3/Kuba%E2%8E%9CDesktop---Communities?type=design&node-id=43835-146934&mode=design&t=fU1iSksYsHLXzkSd-4\r\n\r\nRoute 01) Enable the `Next` button regardless of whether mandatory fields have been completed. Clicking it is the event that validates all mandatory fields with red stroke and relevant validation message unique to each field, scrolling user to first validated form field for them to address the issue. This does mean we may need to revisit all other forms in the app. Currently we disable the primary action until the mandatory fields have been completed with the input in the correct format. So we'd need to apply this new logic to forms such as changing passwords, creating channels, editing channels, importing communities etc. Might not be too much work but it is a consideration. This would be preferred from a UX perspective and is more inline with industry trends.\r\n\r\nRoute 02) Simply suffix `(required)` to the required field label. Less elegant but quite clear for the user to understand what fields are mandatory as they are filling out the form and perhaps the quickest to implement at this stage of development. I personally prefer this to the asterix route as the asterix always requires a legend to explain what the asterix means which is always hard to find a spot in the UI for and means the user has to piece things together themselves. The alternative is to use `optional` for any optional fields especially if there are more mandatory fields than optional fields. This leaves the user to derive that the other fields are mandatory, however this isn't as useful for this case given the community colour is technically mandatory but a colour is autogenerated for them so they don't need to take action on that field.\r\n\r\ncc @John-44 wdyt?
