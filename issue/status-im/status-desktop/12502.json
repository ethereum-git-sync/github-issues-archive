Tokenisation of community ownership**\r\n- Work needed already evaluated in spike.  Community and 'Channel in a Community' URLs don't need to be signed if this will present problems. Patryk to work on this as a continuation of the spike already done.\r\n- See priority 4 below, as this also has some implications for the tokenisation of community work.\r\n\r\n**3.

We have the UI on the desktop ready to go for this feature, and Mobile is going to need the backend for this feature as well, so let's try to get it done in 0.14 [#11081](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11081)\r\n\r\n**4. Community tokens visible in wallet when received by user who is not a member of that community**\r\n- Solution obvs. needs to be fully decenteralised and permissionless\r\n- Perhaps whenever a community token is A) sent from a Status Wallet to another user or B) airdropped by a community or C) retailed by a community, a M2M (invisible to the user) Waku message should be sent to the recipient's *ethereum address*?\r\n- This message could either: A) contain the metadata for the token B) tell the user that they have received token, and to check the metadata in either another Waku channel where Control Nodes periodically post Metadata OR check the metadata embedded in the token contract (embedding metadata in the token contract might be a better idea?).  \r\n- The token metadata stored in the token contract is signed by the Community's private key to ensure authenticity.  When the community's private key changes due to ownership of a community being transferred or due to the control node being moved, a transaction must be made to update this metadata so it is signed by the community's new private key.\r\n- See here for how a Waku message can be sent to and Ethereum address https://rfc.vac.dev/spec/20/\r\n\r\n**5. Discord history import into a single channel in an existing community**\r\n- Pay off any Discord history import service tech. debt first\r\n- Then build the import into a single channel functionality, designs for this are already complete\r\n\r\n**6. UI for community owner to enable manual Waku static shading for their community**\r\n- This will be off by default in 0.15\r\n- This UI is only for the Owner of a community (not TokenMasters or Admins)\r\n- Figma designs are here https://www.figma.com/file/qHfFm7C9LwtXpfdbxssCK3/Kuba%E2%8E%9CDesktop---Communities?type=design&node-id=37242%3A222352&mode=design&t=rw6q6NQYmiz3rSn2-1\r\n\r\n**7.

  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\n**Problem to solve:** \r\nThere is a common scenario with _models definition_ when this **model contains a reference to another model.**  _Example:_ the basic token model where there is  reference to the community (communityId), but no other details related to the community itself (name, icon) so there will be useful to have a utility model class that deals with that.\r\n\r\n**There is the following proposal from** @micieslak :\r\nCreate a generic model in C++ called, for example, **LeftJoinModel**, which does more or less what LEFT JOIN does in SQL. Such a model would take two models as input and roles on which the join is to be made. As a result, it would have all the roles from both source models.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of this solution is that it is delegated a fairly common problem to a completely separate and independent component, which it can be covered with extensive tests and benchmarked to know its performance characteristics. It also simplifies the backend, which does not have to deal with preparing specific, complicated models. Once well implemented and tested, it provides a way to conveniently and dynamically combine two models. \r\n\r\n- A basic implementation can be based on persistent indexes `QPersistentModelIndex`. \r\n\r\n- It can also be later extended with other types of joins as well.",
