  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\n**Problem to solve:** \r\nThere is a common scenario with _models definition_ when this **model contains a reference to another model.**  _Example:_ the basic token model where there is  reference to the community (communityId), but no other details related to the community itself (name, icon) so there will be useful to have a utility model class that deals with that.\r\n\r\n**There is the following proposal from** @micieslak :\r\nCreate a generic model in C++ called, for example, **LeftJoinModel**, which does more or less what LEFT JOIN does in SQL. Such a model would take two models as input and roles on which the join is to be made. As a result, it would have all the roles from both source models.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of this solution is that it is delegated a fairly common problem to a completely separate and independent component, which it can be covered with extensive tests and benchmarked to know its performance characteristics. It also simplifies the backend, which does not have to deal with preparing specific, complicated models. Once well implemented and tested, it provides a way to conveniently and dynamically combine two models. \r\n\r\n- A basic implementation can be based on persistent indexes `QPersistentModelIndex`. \r\n\r\n- It can also be later extended with other types of joins as well.",
