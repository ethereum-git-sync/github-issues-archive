  "body": "# Bug Report\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nHard issue to describe or reproduce, but sometimes, a chat/channel becomes bold (marked as having unread messages), but when you go to see it, there is nothing to be seen (at least in the newest messages)\r\n\r\nThis seems to happen mostly with group chats, but it has happened with others too.\r\n\r\nWhat I think is happening is that a store node fetch happens and we retrieve \"new\" messages that are pretty old.\r\nIf that is the case, I think we shouldn't display the unread message marker, since it is more confusing than anything. \r\nWe need to double check with others (designers and John maybe) to confirm that and set a \"deadline\". Like we only show the unread marker for messages coming in from the last X minutes?\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nUnknown.\r\n\r\nI think it can be reproduced more easily by having an account with old communities and chats and re-importing the seed phrase.\r\nThe syncing + node store fetches reproduce the issue I think.\r\n\r\n## Additional info\r\n\r\n- Status desktop version: 0.8.1\r\n\r\n",
