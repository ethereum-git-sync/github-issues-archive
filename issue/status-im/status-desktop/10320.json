    "description": "Priorities **in priority order** for the 0.12 milestone:  \r\n\r\n**1. Improve performance**\r\n- Focus on eliminating any UI freezes when the user clicks on something and the app does not display an immediate response.  Target: the app should ideally respond to all user input within 50ms, but let's start with identifying the longest UI freezes and trying to fix the worst UI freezes first.\r\n- Speed and responsiveness of switching between community channels, and 1on1 and ad-hoc group chats is particularly important, especially for channels and chats that contains a lot of history.  We should aim for about 250ms delay in the *worst* case if possible.  Having a lot of history in a channel should not slow channel switching down.\r\n- DB perf optimisations.  \r\n- Move things to async and off main thread\r\n- See Alex's great profiling work for possible tasks (Alex to continue focusing on perf. for this release cycle)\r\n- \"user facing performance in everyday app usage\" is the top priority, but any task that improves performance is worthwhile\r\n\r\n**2. Finish development of token based functionality from 0.11**\r\n- Optimise No. queries made by owner node when checking member tokens (Pascal)\r\n- Community encryption should automatically switch on/off depending on community permissions (issue #9942)\r\n- Implement the 'Admin' role (issue #10114)\r\n- Airdrop to community members (in addition to addresses)\r\n- Optimise gas required by collectable minting smart contracts (issue #9943, GravityBlast)\r\n--- After collectable minting gas optimisation is complete, start work on Asset minting contracts (GravityBlast)\r\n- Complete token remote destruct UI\r\n- Remove 'Community Permissions Settings', 'Community Tokens' and 'Discord Import Tool' feature flags (issue #10115)\r\n- Thoroughly test, and fix all bugs found. \r\n- Anything else related to Community level token permissions, collectable minting, airdropping, and remote destructing that didn't make it into 0.11\r\n\r\n**3. Finish implementing the ability for Community Owners and Admins to drag and drop channels and categories into different orders**\r\n\r\n**4. Finish anything related to the initial pairing process for syncing that wasn't completed in 0.11** (Igor)\r\n\r\n**5. Improve Mutual Contacts functionality to improve reliability and pay off tech debt** (Mishka)\r\n\r\n**6. Complete Community Directory Curation dApp integration inc. Featured functionality** (Patryk)\r\n \r\n**7. Backend for the Profile Showcase**\r\n\r\n**8. Identity Verification** (required for 'Profile Showcase')\r\n\r\n**9. Fix bugs, bugs and more bugs!**\r\n- Esp. find the cause of and fix the longstanding bug of some 'requests to join' not arriving for hours/days after they were sent!\r\n- Many 'fit and finish' bugs for the UI team\r\n\r\n**--- For the Wallet team ---**\r\n\r\n1. Continue feature development inc. kicking off development of the activity screens\r\n2. 'All accounts' section.  The ability to return all tokens owned by the user in all accounts (excluding watch only accounts) is also required for the Showcase functionality\r\n3. Widen scope of 'backup to waku' and 'syncing' so that all relevant Wallet user state is backed up and synced between devices\r\n4. Continue to ensure Wallet functionality is performant.\r\n5. Fix wallet bugs",

  "body": "Version 0.11, Windows 10\r\n\r\nThe 'max balance' button functionality (the button in the top right of both the Send and Bridge modals) is incorrect in a few of ways: \r\n\r\n**1) The button is in a red error state when no amount to Send/Bridge has been entered, see screenshot below.**  The button should not be in the red error state, because when the 'amount to send/bridge' is 0.00 it is impossible for this number (zero!) to exceed the available balance of whatever token has been selected.\r\n\r\n![2023-04-15 12_22_55-Status Desktop](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22846356/232211365-3d440c13-e481-4de8-9ee6-9ebe0e4bcfc0.png)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**2) Clicking on the 'max balance' button does nothing.** Clicking on the 'max balance' button is supposed to populate the 'Amount to send/bridge' field with the 100% of the balance of whatever ERC-20 token is selected.  \r\n\r\nIf ETH (not a ERC-20) is selected, the behaviour should be slightly different:\r\n\r\n- if the user's ETH balance is more than 0.1, the 'max balance' button should always display the ETH balance in that account **minus 0.09 ETH**\r\n\r\n- if the user's ETH balance is more than 0.06, the 'max balance' button should always display the ETH balance in that account **minus 0.05 ETH**\r\n\r\n- if the user's ETH balance is less than 0.06 and more than 0.03 ETH, the  'max balance' button should always display the ETH balance in that account **minus 0.025 ETH**\r\n\r\n- if the user's ETH balance is less than 0.03, the 'max balance' button should always display \"Max: 0.00 [\"ETH\" or base currency abbreviation]\r\n\r\nThe above is to help prevent a user from sending all their ETH, which would be impossible because they wouldn't have any ETH to pay the gas fee, and to help users leave a little bit of ETH in their accounts so the tokens in that account aren't stranded there with no way to transfer be cause there isn't enough ETH to pay for gas.  \r\n\r\nA user can always override these guardrails by directly entering an ETH value into the 'Amount to bridge/send' field.  As long as the ETH value the user enters is above the: ETH balance the user has in the account *minus* the estimated 'Max Fees', the \"Send\" button should be active and the user should be able to proceed with making the transaction.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**3) When the user first opens the Send or Bridge modal, the 'max balance' button displays the copy of \"No balances active\"** (see screenshot below).  This copy should be changed to \"No token selected\"\r\n\r\n![2023-04-15 12_24_27-Status Desktop](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22846356/232211680-bf613048-0a89-4852-9227-660168c65818.png)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**4) When a user switches between accounts in the Send or Bridge modals, using the tabs above the Send or Bridge modals, the 'max balance' button doesn't update to show the correct max balance for the currently selected account.**\r\n\r\nSee screenshots below - the 'max balance' button is always showing the max balance of the \"Status account\", even when \"Frist test account\" is selected.  Also the \"Recent\" activity shown under the \"Recent\" tab is not being updated when a user switches accounts, this also needs to be fixed.\r\n\r\n![2023-04-15 12_52_29-Status Desktop](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22846356/232217934-77feaca7-2c15-44b4-94af-b9e31d0fc805.png)\r\n\r\n![2023-04-15 12_51_58-Status Desktop](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22846356/232217960-60d06b3b-feb5-4b9e-b1e7-b16f866b25c0.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
