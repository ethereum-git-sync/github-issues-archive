  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nWe've just had an issue with our release branch where the latest RC was pointed to a develop branch of status-go instead of the `desktop/release/x` branch. Because of the migrations, we cannot go back.\r\n\r\nWe've also had a couple of cases in the past where `master` was **not** pointed at status-go's `develop`, which can also cause problems.\r\n\r\nSo the idea of this issue if to create a script that would be run in Gihub actions before merging and it would make sure that we are pointing to the right branch on status-go.\r\n\r\nFor PRs pointing to `master`:\r\n- make sure that the status-go branch is `develop`\r\n- we'd be able to get rid of the `waiting-for-status-go` label\r\n\r\nFor PRs pointing to `release/`:\r\n- make sure that the status-go branch is `desktop/release`\r\n- make sure the version matches the `release` branch's version\r\n  - eg: `release/0.14.x` needs to point to `desktop/release/0.14.x` (same `0.14.x`)",
