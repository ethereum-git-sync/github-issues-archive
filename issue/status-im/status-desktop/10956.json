  "body": "A new subset of activity details screens have been created which cover Receive and Send transactions which are a result of a Buy or Sell operation via an exchange. \r\n\r\nGiven we cannot detect (and therefore label a Buy or Sell Tx), whenever the Tx is detected to be coming from or going to an exchange address we hold in the list of known counterparties, we should show the following: \r\n\r\n**For a Buy Tx** - show a Receive Tx from the exchange address\r\n**For a Sell Tx** - show a Send Tx to the exchange address \r\n\r\nGiven these transactions happen outside of Status on the exchange itself, the ‘Signing method’ section of the activity detail will be omitted.\r\n\r\nThe send and receive Tx’s in these instances showcase the name of the exchange and feature the exchange icon both in the activity header and body of the Tx in the From/To sections as shown.\r\n\r\nThere are a total of 4 new activity details flows:\r\n1) Receive Tx as a result of a Buy operation via an exchange on Mainnet\r\n2) Receive Tx as a result of a Buy operation via an exchange on Arbitrum\r\n3) Send Tx as a result of a Sell operation via an exchange on Mainnet\r\n4) Send Tx as a result of a Sell operation via an exchange on Arbitrum\r\n\r\nThis new format of activity details (showing the exchange icon and name) should be used whenever we detect the Tx involves an address we hold in the list of known counterparties.\r\n\r\nNew activity overview list items for these scenarios are here:\r\nhttps://www.figma.com/file/FkFClTCYKf83RJWoifWgoX/Wallet-v2?type=design&node-id=12457-303137&t=ApnsesITUY1dehw8-4\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1253\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-06-06 at 17 13 24\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/110033914/e1fee596-b445-4103-814e-ded0c2f2c19b\">\r\n\r\n\r\nActivity details designs here:\r\nhttps://www.figma.com/file/FkFClTCYKf83RJWoifWgoX/Wallet-v2?type=design&node-id=15324-456837&t=ApnsesITUY1dehw8-4\r\n",
