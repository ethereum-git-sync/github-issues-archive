  "body": "There's an issue that will become more apparent the more users run the archive protocol with lots of data.\r\nFrom a community member perspective the archive protocol works as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Member node receives magnet link message from owner node\r\n2. Member node parses magnet link into torrent metadata and tries to fetch torrent info\r\n3. Once torrent info has been received, member node determines which archives to download based on archive hashes\r\n3.1. It will only download archives that aren't tracked as already downloaded\r\n4. Once download of all missing archives is done, it will extract messages from archives and import them into the database\r\n\r\nStep 3) and 4) can take a while and there's a chance users will close the app while this is in progress.\r\nFor 3) this is not to critical. The next time a magnet link message is received, the member node will again check which archives to download based on the hashes and then import the messages afterwards.\r\n\r\nThere's a problem though if 3) was finished, but 4) was not. We're then in a state of downloaded archives that are not imported into the database and also won't be anymore because they are marked as downloaded.\r\n\r\nTo account for that, we should also check if an archive has finished importing into the database and if it hasn't, messages should be picked up in the next cycle.",
