Notify clients of visible tokens update and cache on demand in NIM\r\n- [ ] Show loading balance \r\n  - Optionally, update waiting for graph state, if the view is opened, as soon as the data is fetched\r\n- [ ] Refactor the preview into a specific data model and separate the balance graph view from the price view\r\n  - See https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/pull/7951#discussion_r1023705959\r\n- [ ] Have a \"moving window\" in the graph to access older history or prune the cache for older balances",
