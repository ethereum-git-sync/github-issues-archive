    "description": "**1. Finish anything that wasn't completed in the previous 0.15 cycle**\r\n\r\n- And fix bugs as usual.  We need to keep tech. debt at a roughly fixed level as we grow out functionality, can't let it accumulate! ;-)\r\n\r\n\r\n**2. Discord history import into a single channel in an existing community**\r\n\r\n- Pay off any Discord history import service tech. debt first\r\n\r\n- Then build the import into a single channel functionality, designs for this are already complete\r\n\r\n**3.  IPFS service for community minted NFTs and other binary community assets**\r\n\r\n- In order for NFT tokens minted in our UI to be correctly displayed with all metadata on OpenSea, their assets need to be stored in IPFS (because IPFS is supported by OpenSea)\r\n\r\n- Will work something like this: IPFS pinning server is integrated into Status Desktop. When a community mints a NFT, the associated assets are IPFS pinned by the community control node.  The community control node then sends a 'user invisible message' to all other community members via Waku, and the Status Desktop installs of all community members then fetch the NFT assets and pin them as well.  This means that every member of a community that is running Status Desktop will always be 'IPFS pinning' all assets related to the community, so that as long as one community member that uses Status Desktop is online, the assets are guaranteed to be available via IPFS.\r\n\r\n- Use a similar scheme to the above for other community assets (that are not related to token minting) like: Community banner image, community icon, community description.\r\n\r\n- Use a similar scheme to the above but for status user data.  Status users pin assets related to their profile (banner image, avatar) using IPFS, and all of the user's mutual contacts also pin that user's profile data.  Must incorporate a setting so that users can opt-out of pinning their mutual contact's profile data.\r\n\r\n\r\n**4. Automatic bandwidth test on app startup**\r\n\r\n- automatic bandwidth test on app startup, and use results to automatically configure the waku shard usage appropriately depending on the available bandwidth (at the 'user has tons of bandwidth' end of the spectrum all waku shards will use waku Relay mode, at the 'user has very little bandwidth' end of the spectrum all waku shards will use waku filter + light push mode, and in between these two ends of the spectrum the user will use a mix of waku relay mode and waku filter + light push mode for different shards).  Plus also use  the results of the bandwidth test to automatically set the bittorred throttling at an appropriate setting at the beginning of each new session.\r\n\r\n\r\n**5. Tokenisation of community ownership**\r\n\r\n- This is a big epic, first task is to design the architecture / specification of how we could do this, and then get this spec reviewed by folks like Andrea.  We shouldn't start writing any code until the approach for tokenising community ownership has been agreed.\r\n\r\n",

Notify clients of visible tokens update and cache on demand in NIM\r\n- [ ] Show loading balance \r\n  - Optionally, update waiting for graph state, if the view is opened, as soon as the data is fetched\r\n- [ ] Refactor the preview into a specific data model and separate the balance graph view from the price view\r\n  - See https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/pull/7951#discussion_r1023705959\r\n- [ ] Have a \"moving window\" in the graph to access older history or prune the cache for older balances",
