  "body": "# Bug Report\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nIf you reject a community request from a user as an owner, the approval or un-reject button fails with error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nERR 2023-05-26 13:49:03.269-04:00 Error accepting request to join community  topics=\"community-service\" tid=58360 file=service.nim:1394 msg=\"Community request not found: 0x98e482804751f91040f1fdad17f55dbcc33c74aa3e03d99b8588db55bdcd2027\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n0. Be an owner of an on request community\r\n1. Have User B send you a community request to join\r\n2. Reject the request\r\n3. Go in the members management panel, in the Rejected tab\r\n4. Click on `Accept`\r\n\r\nit doesn't do anything and there is an error in the console (see above)\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe request is approved or at the very least the rejection is removed so that the user can request again (former is better)\r\n\r\n#### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nNothing happens and there is an error\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nI'm guessing the request was removed from the table when we removed. Maybe we just need to update its state instead of removing it.\r\n\r\n- Status desktop version: master (`0b9d7e19625992aed4b9605dce645b004afa9dae`)\r\n- Operating System: Ubuntu 20\r\n\r\n",
