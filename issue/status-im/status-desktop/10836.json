We need to keep tech. debt at a roughly fixed level as we grow out functionality, can't let it accumulate! ;-)\r\n\r\n**2. Complete initial airdrop functionality**\r\n- Airdrop history screens\r\n- Ability to airdrop based on in-Community activity (No. of msg, No. msg in time range, joining a community, length of community membership)  Ability to combine multiple attributes into an airdrop\r\n- Ability to token gate airdrops\r\n- Live airdrop gas estimation when setting up airdrop\r\n\r\n**3. Token import functionality**\r\n- Ability for a community Owner to import ERC-20 and NFT tokens, to later be airdropped or retailed\r\n\r\n**4. Admin functionality enhancements**\r\n- Ability to mark a token gated channel as 'hidden', only visible to community members with the requisite tokens\r\n- optional service to once a month auto-kick all members who haven't been online for between 30 and 60 days (e.g. auto-kick members whose profile information like Name, Avatar, etc... can no longer be fetched)\r\n\r\n**5. QR scanner**\r\n- Needed for private key transfer\r\n- Ethereum key QRs (send modal triggered)\r\n- User Share URL in a QR (opens user profile dialogue) \r\n- Community and Channel inside Community URL in QRs (takes user to Community or Channel in Community)\r\n\r\n**6. Chat functionality enhancements**\r\n- Introduce @channel as a new type of global @ mention.  This @ mention only @ mention's everyone who has posted a message in a channel in the last 30 days \r\n\r\n**7. Binaries over Waku**\r\n- Improve transfer of binaries over waku via splitting into chunks https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/9923\r\n- Posting of small files (max size somewhere in the region of 1 to 2mb).

  "body": "# Bug Report\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nIf you reject a community request from a user as an owner, the approval or un-reject button fails with error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nERR 2023-05-26 13:49:03.269-04:00 Error accepting request to join community  topics=\"community-service\" tid=58360 file=service.nim:1394 msg=\"Community request not found: 0x98e482804751f91040f1fdad17f55dbcc33c74aa3e03d99b8588db55bdcd2027\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n0. Be an owner of an on request community\r\n1. Have User B send you a community request to join\r\n2. Reject the request\r\n3. Go in the members management panel, in the Rejected tab\r\n4. Click on `Accept`\r\n\r\nit doesn't do anything and there is an error in the console (see above)\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe request is approved or at the very least the rejection is removed so that the user can request again (former is better)\r\n\r\n#### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nNothing happens and there is an error\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nI'm guessing the request was removed from the table when we removed. Maybe we just need to update its state instead of removing it.\r\n\r\n- Status desktop version: master (`0b9d7e19625992aed4b9605dce645b004afa9dae`)\r\n- Operating System: Ubuntu 20\r\n\r\n",
