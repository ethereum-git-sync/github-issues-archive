Update app to use new 'Share URL' formats**\r\n- add functionality to status-go to generate the new 'Share URL' formats for sharing links to: User Profiles, Communities, Channel inside a Community (issue https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/10851)\r\n- Update everywhere a user can share a URL from to use the new URL format (issue https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/10852)\r\n- New/updated URL unroll designs for inside chat, including specific unrolls for the new User Profile, Community and Channel inside a Community URLs (issue https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/10585)\r\n- Ability to share a URL that points to a specific channel in a community (issue #10160)\r\n- Update all address inputs to accept a user pasting a 'share URL' into the input (in addition to being able to input the raw address).

  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nAs discovered when working on the community airdrop feature, to airdrop tokens to users in a community, we need their wallet address.\r\n\r\nHowever, currently, users only share their addresses when the community already has a permission. In the airdrop use case, most of the time, the community will start with no permission and then the permission will be created for certain channels or for admins, using the airdrop feature.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the temporary solution is to **always** ask users to share their wallet address when joining any community.\r\n\r\nThe flow is already there for permissioned communities, we just need to expand it to those without permissions as well.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a community with no permission, the spectate screen stays the same, but when the user clicks on the \"Join the community\" button, they will instead see the popup that asks for them to share their address, regardless of it being on request or not.\r\nFigma: https://www.figma.com/file/17fc13UBFvInrLgNUKJJg5/Kuba%E2%8E%9CDesktop?type=design&node-id=2244-260547&t=FFyigg7zVGKkn0sX-0\r\n(ignore the captcha)\r\nIt's possible that this popup is already implemented and can be reused from the permissioned community flow.\r\n\r\n**Additional info**\r\nWe now use a new mechanism for sharing the address that adds the needed chainIDs to check the tokens for the owner, but since there is no permission yet, ie no balance to check, you can make it so it shares no chainID for now.\r\n\r\nThen, if the owner adds a permission, it would be the owner's responsibility to check all of Status' known chains and create the chainID array to fulfill the new permissions.\r\n@0x-r4bbit can you confirm if the mechanism is already working like this where the control node will check all chains if the user has no chainID set yet? \r\n\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n- All communities ask to reveal addresses\r\n- The control node aggregates those addresses, same as for a permissioned community \r\n- If a community becomes permissioned after that, the user's address is able to be checked. The is kicked or kept depending on whether they possess the tokens\r\n- Stays backwards compatible with old communities\r\n  - For example, the Status CC community should not encounter any problem even if the users didn't share their address\r\n  - ie even if we ask new communities to share address all the time, old communities with no addresses should still work as intended.\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Adding some addition info here:\r\n\r\n### Status Desktop\r\n\r\nFirst of all, extending the no-permission-community case should be as simple as changing\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/blob/0b280f090e8b01db75c97ffabde543dd6e8e0143/ui/app/AppLayouts/Chat/views/CommunityColumnView.qml#L101-L104\r\n\r\nwith \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/blob/0b280f090e8b01db75c97ffabde543dd6e8e0143/ui/app/AppLayouts/Chat/ChatLayout.qml#L90-L92\r\n\r\n`requestToJoinCommunityWithAuthentication()` automatically spins up the authentication modal provided by the keycard module. After entering a password and confirming, this should then trigger \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/blob/0b280f090e8b01db75c97ffabde543dd6e8e0143/src/app/modules/main/chat_section/module.nim#L859-L860\r\n\r\nwhich will ultimately perform an async request-to-join using the provided password.\r\n\r\nThe provided password is what makes the difference here. When status-go's `RequestToJoinCommunity()` is called and its arguments include a `password`, it will automatically try to unlock the user accounts keystore using that password and verify the unlocked accounts. For each account, a signature is then created (using its private key), and both are then attached to the `RequestToJoin` message which will be sent to the network.\r\n\r\nThe owner node will then check those accounts accordingly for ownership and necessary funds.\r\n\r\n### status-go\r\n\r\n> We now use a new mechanism for sharing the address that adds the needed chainIDs to check the tokens for the owner, but since there is no permission yet, ie no balance to check, you can make it so it shares no chainID for now.\r\n\r\nMinor correction here: \r\n\r\nAdding the chainIDs to the accounts has not landed in status-go yet and is current being refactored. Once the refactor is done, if the community was a token-permission-community, then we'd obtain a list of wallet + chainID combinations during the process of creating the request to join message. **Again this is being worked on right now** so at the moment, there'll be checks on all supported chains by the owner node.\r\n\r\nHowever, since we're dealing with a community that does **not** have permissions, status-go is simply ignoring the attached accounts at the moment. This needs change.\r\n\r\nThis is the code that checks the wallet addresses if the community in question has `BECOME_MEMBER` permissions. Notice that all of this is ignore if there aren't any such permissions. So to make this work, we'll have to move the conditions around a bit, and also ensure that we **don't** mark the request as declined/reject it mistakenly. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/status-im/status-go/blob/15d2b4fe80d256dc0ee599174d1e30161381c589/protocol/communities/manager.go#L1511-L1582\r\n\r\nThen, regarding\r\n\r\n> Then, if the owner adds a permission, it would be the owner's responsibility to check all of Status' known chains and create the chainID array to fulfill the new permissions.\r\n\r\nAs for now, the owner will not actually figure out the chainIDs for other users. It's the users responsibility to provide chain IDs to check on. So if we move from a non-permission to a permission- community, then all existing members will be considered invalid. But since we will have an API that checks on all chains, we could make it a special case for when we move from 0 to > 0 permissions.\r\n\r\nSo only in **that** case, the owner node makes the effort to checks on all chains for all members and trying to figure out all chain IDs.",
