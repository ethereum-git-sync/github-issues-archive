Open the image in this link https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/927668982964715521/1115199506624024617/IMG_20230605_104339.jpg?width=1556&height=779\r\n(if the link is dead, use the image below)\r\n2. Right click on it and select copy image\r\n3. Go in a community and hit CTRL+V\r\n\r\nResult: an empty image appears. You can hover and see the X, but it doesn't show the image itself. Submitting the message just closes the input and doesn't send anything\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nImage is shown when pasted and can get sent as a message\r\n\r\n#### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nNo image is shown, except the empty image zone\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n```\r\nWarning: qrc:/imports/shared/status/StatusChatInputImageArea.qml:24:13: QML Image: Error decoding: data:image/jpeg;base64,: Unsupported image format (qrc:/imports/shared/status/StatusChatInputImageArea.qml:24, )\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Status desktop version: 0.12.0\r\n- Operating System: Ubuntu 20\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/11926403/25b240ac-5715-429c-91e9-cae60210c705)",
