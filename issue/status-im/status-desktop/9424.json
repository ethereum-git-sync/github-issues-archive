  "body": "Okay so here's a funny scenario:\r\n\r\n1. I have two accounts A and B each logged-in to their own desktop instances\r\n2. B sends A three contact requests, A does only respond to the latest one\r\n3. After the request was accepted, the chat of A<->B shows 2 empty chat messages from B\r\n\r\nThis is most likely because a contact request comes as a message signal and is probably interpreted as a chat message as well. \r\nThen, desktop probably doesn't render render the requests textmessage. I assume it doesn't do that because the contenttype of the message isn't \"text\" but \"unknown\".\r\n\r\nThis needs to be checked, I'm just thinking out loud here.\r\n\r\nEither way, I think we should **not** render previous contact request messages as chat message in the first place.\r\nHere's a screenshot from A's perspective after accepting the request:\r\n![Screenshot from 2023-02-03 12-52-39](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/445106/216598011-99377f28-e44f-49dc-b0aa-0360c3632bd6.png)\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Hi there! Can I ask you guys something here?\r\nThis step caught my eye:\r\n> 2. B sends A three contact requests\r\n\r\nQ: Are there any plans to change this behavior by limiting the possible number of sent requests to one?\r\nAFAIK, by design, if you send a request once to a chat key, it should get the `Pending` status for the sender, which prevents them from sending more requests to the same chat key.\r\n\r\nTL;DR\r\n\r\nWhy this worries me:\r\n1. It looks like a possible spam vector (for desktop clients mostly).\r\nOn mobile we have this issue https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/issues/14947\r\nAnd here is the behavior John suggests to prevent possible spam in the form of annoying repetitive requests if they are canceled by the recipient: https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/issues/14798#issuecomment-1406434296 \r\nOne more scenario: if the request is canceled by the sender. In this case, it's also canceled on the receiver's side. You can send another one, but the receiver will also have only one request (-> the user is protected from spammy repeated requests in the Activity center).\r\n\r\n2. There is a mismatch between mobile and desktop behavior in this case.\r\nIf you send multiple contact requests from desktop to mobile, only the first request (and the first message) will be displayed on mobile in the Activity center. After accepting the request, all requests will be displayed in the chat history and will remain in `Pending` status forever (except for the first one). This inconsistency could also be fixed by adding the `Pending` status when the request is sent for the first time.\r\n\r\nThese are not urgent questions. It's just that we are close to the first release cut, so we are already thinking about such things :)\r\nAnd please correct me if I misunderstand the scenario itself or if this is already covered somewhere.

The receiver will then get multiple requests. Senders will also not get notified when a request was rejected AFAIK. \r\n\r\nI'm aware that this is a potential spam vector, but I think we went for it either way.\r\n\r\n> One more scenario: if the request is canceled by the sender. In this case, it's also canceled on the receiver's side. You can send another one, but the receiver will also have only one request (-> the user is protected from spammy repeated requests in the Activity center).\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this is actually the case right now. Whether or not a sender cancels a request is not something that the receiver will get notified about. \r\n\r\n> There is a mismatch between mobile and desktop behavior in this case.\r\nIf you send multiple contact requests from desktop to mobile, only the first request (and the first message) will be displayed on mobile in the Activity center. After accepting the request, all requests will be displayed in the chat history and will remain in Pending status forever (except for the first one). This inconsistency could also be fixed by adding the Pending status when the request is sent for the first time.\r\n\r\nI think this is an important point.\r\n\r\n@MishkaRogachev do you know from the top of your head what's the implementation parity between mobile and desktop for these cases?",

This doesn't look right to me, because this is what makes it so easy to quickly send a large number of requests.\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67952253/217008099-759bfe1d-0abf-48b2-8306-c3858d295354.mov\r\n\r\nSo in terms of spam, I just wanted to bring your attention and make sure you're aware of _this way_ to send multiple contact requests. Let me know if it's better to forward this to the QA team for further discussion on whether this is correct, logging an issue, etc, I don't mean to shower you with these questions if you are not working specifically on this functionality :)\r\n\r\nIn terms of parity between mobile and desktop, I will also ask Andrea what is the desirable behavior from our side in this case.",
