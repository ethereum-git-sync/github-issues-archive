I assume not only communities that I have been part of, but maybe communities I've seen/have been spectated?\r\n2. If 1) is true, then leaving a community should not remove it from the feature section (I'm not sure if it should add it)\r\n3. A while-importing but then deleted community should not show up anywhere and unless the import was finished, it's not published anywhere either.\r\n\r\nSo at this point I'm wondering if this issue is partially wrong expectations and partially funny results because the import doesn't spectate any communities.\r\n\r\n",

I've talked to @richard-ramos who confirmed that atm, the \"featured\" section of the portal has \"undefined\" behaviour because it isn't connected to the contract that should aggregate the actual data.\r\n2. Leaving a community does seem to indeed make that community show up in the featured section, but this will be solved once that section talks to the contract instead.\r\n3. I don't think there's a way to have multiple instances of the same community show up in the featured section via leaving the same community multiple times, at least if you've been the owner of that community, because rejoining is impossible atm\r\n\r\nHaving all that said, I'm not sure what to do here. I guess it makes sense to revisit, once the \"featured\" section is considered functional?",
