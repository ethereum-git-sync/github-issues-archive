    "description": "**1. Complete initial airdrop functionality**\r\n- Airdrop history screens\r\n- Ability to airdrop based on in-Community activity (No. of msg, No. msg in time range, joining a community, length of community membership)  Ability to combine multiple attributes into an airdrop\r\n- Ability to token gate airdrops\r\n- Live airdrop gas estimation when setting up airdrop\r\n\r\n**2. Community Admin functionality enhancements**\r\n- optional service to once a month auto-kick all members who haven't been online for between 30 and 60 days (e.g. auto-kick members whose profile information like Name, Avatar, etc... can no longer be fetched)\r\n\r\n**3.  IPFS service for community minted NFTs and other binary community assets**\r\n\r\n- In order for NFT tokens minted in our UI to be correctly displayed with all metadata on OpenSea, their assets need to be stored in IPFS (because IPFS is supported by OpenSea)\r\n\r\n- Will work something like this: IPFS pinning server is integrated into Status Desktop. When a community mints a NFT, the associated assets are IPFS pinned by the community control node.  The community control node then sends a 'user invisible message' to all other community members via Waku, and the Status Desktop installs of all community members then fetch the NFT assets and pin them as well.  This means that every member of a community that is running Status Desktop will always be 'IPFS pinning' all assets related to the community, so that as long as one community member that uses Status Desktop is online, the assets are guaranteed to be available via IPFS.\r\n\r\n- Use a similar scheme to the above could be used for other community assets (that are not related to token minting) in the future like: Community banner image, community icon, community description, etc...\r\n\r\n- Use a similar scheme to the above could be used for status user data in the future.  Status users pin assets related to their profile (banner image, avatar, showcase contents) using IPFS, and all of the user's mutual contacts also pin that user's profile data.  Must incorporate a setting so that users can opt-out of pinning their mutual contact's profile data.\r\n\r\n**4. QR scanner**\r\n- Needed for private key transfer\r\n- Ethereum key QRs (send modal triggered)\r\n- User Share URL in a QR (opens user profile dialogue) \r\n- Community and Channel inside Community URL in QRs (takes user to Community or Channel in Community)\r\n\r\n\r\n**5. Telegram history import into a single channel in an existing community**\r\n\r\n\r\n**--- Wallet Team ---**\r\n\r\n1. Total balance graphs for 'All accounts' and each individual account\r\n\r\n2. Advanced transaction signing\r\n\r\n",

  "body": "Part of https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/12018\r\n\r\nSomething that has come up while testing the import tool for the final switch.\r\n@iurimatias has imported a channel which in discord looks like this:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2022-11-30 16-32-18](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/445106/204840204-14ca4c87-7441-4426-8c7b-bc3cb57de003.png)\r\n\r\nAfter importing the messages into Status, the message looks like this:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2022-11-30 16-33-03](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/445106/204840395-456aca1d-fe98-4922-b905-0b1b20ecaf68.png)\r\n\r\nHere's what the data looks like:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n      {\r\n        \"id\": \"SOME_ID\"\r\n        \"name\": \"Loud Mountainous Macropod@bridge\",\r\n        \"discriminator\": \"0000\",\r\n        \"nickname\": \"jakubgs@gitter\",\r\n        \"color\": null,\r\n        \"isBot\": true,\r\n        \"avatarUrl\": \"https://cdn.discordapp.com/embed/avatars/0.png\"\r\n      },\r\n```\r\nWe're using the author's `name` property so this should not be causing this. \r\nHowever it turns out that there's more message author data with the same `id` that looks like this (in fact, it's the first message of the channel that has this data):\r\n\r\n```json\r\n    {\r\n        \"id\": \"SOME_ID\",\r\n        \"name\": \"jakubgs@gitter\",\r\n        \"discriminator\": \"0000\",\r\n        \"nickname\": \"jakubgs@gitter\",\r\n        \"color\": null,\r\n        \"isBot\": true,\r\n        \"avatarUrl\": \"https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/633669913697058816/c367bdc0b5f5593254719b07526e3d93.png?size=512\"\r\n      },\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo what happens here is that, when the import tool runs into the first message, it'll save the author data (where `name` and `nickname` happen to be the same), then later when it runs into the message where the author data has the same ID but different `name`, it will just associate the already stored author data with that message (which is correct cause it's the same author ID).\r\n\r\nThis is a special case for messages that originate from bots (see `isBot: true`).\r\n\r\nWe need to handle cases where discord messages can have author data where the ID is the same, but the `name` is different (in which case `isBot: true`).\r\n\r\n### Possible solution\r\n\r\nDuring the import, when processing author data, check if `isBot: true` and create a custom author `id` and update the message author id accordingly, such that for every bot message there's a distinct author entry in the database as well.",
