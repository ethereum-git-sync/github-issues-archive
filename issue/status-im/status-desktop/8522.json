  "body": "Part of https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/12018\r\n\r\nSomething that has come up while testing the import tool for the final switch.\r\n@iurimatias has imported a channel which in discord looks like this:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2022-11-30 16-32-18](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/445106/204840204-14ca4c87-7441-4426-8c7b-bc3cb57de003.png)\r\n\r\nAfter importing the messages into Status, the message looks like this:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2022-11-30 16-33-03](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/445106/204840395-456aca1d-fe98-4922-b905-0b1b20ecaf68.png)\r\n\r\nHere's what the data looks like:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n      {\r\n        \"id\": \"SOME_ID\"\r\n        \"name\": \"Loud Mountainous Macropod@bridge\",\r\n        \"discriminator\": \"0000\",\r\n        \"nickname\": \"jakubgs@gitter\",\r\n        \"color\": null,\r\n        \"isBot\": true,\r\n        \"avatarUrl\": \"https://cdn.discordapp.com/embed/avatars/0.png\"\r\n      },\r\n```\r\nWe're using the author's `name` property so this should not be causing this. \r\nHowever it turns out that there's more message author data with the same `id` that looks like this (in fact, it's the first message of the channel that has this data):\r\n\r\n```json\r\n    {\r\n        \"id\": \"SOME_ID\",\r\n        \"name\": \"jakubgs@gitter\",\r\n        \"discriminator\": \"0000\",\r\n        \"nickname\": \"jakubgs@gitter\",\r\n        \"color\": null,\r\n        \"isBot\": true,\r\n        \"avatarUrl\": \"https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/633669913697058816/c367bdc0b5f5593254719b07526e3d93.png?size=512\"\r\n      },\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo what happens here is that, when the import tool runs into the first message, it'll save the author data (where `name` and `nickname` happen to be the same), then later when it runs into the message where the author data has the same ID but different `name`, it will just associate the already stored author data with that message (which is correct cause it's the same author ID).\r\n\r\nThis is a special case for messages that originate from bots (see `isBot: true`).\r\n\r\nWe need to handle cases where discord messages can have author data where the ID is the same, but the `name` is different (in which case `isBot: true`).\r\n\r\n### Possible solution\r\n\r\nDuring the import, when processing author data, check if `isBot: true` and create a custom author `id` and update the message author id accordingly, such that for every bot message there's a distinct author entry in the database as well.",
