Token permissions to enable control of community smart contracts**\r\n- Before a community founder can use any of the community token admin functionality, they first have to deploy Owner and Token Master contracts.\r\n- This work involves: new empty state screen for Mint and Airdrop tokens (before current empty state screen is revealed), new flow for deploying the community's Owner and Token Master contracts in a single step, a fixed uneditable permission giving anybody who holds the Token Master token admin rights for the community should be automatically created.\r\n- Only the holder of the single Owner token can access the Token Master airdrop, remote destruct, and view holders functions. Anybody who holds the Token Master token can access all token admin options, excluding those related to the Token Master token itself, as well as being and Admin of the community.\r\n- This will all be explained in more detail in the designs.\r\n\r\nBackend Epic: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11249\r\n\r\n**2. Update Community Admin home screen inc control node transfer and associated dialogues**\r\n- Remove ability for a Owner to leave a community on the computer that's running as that community's control node\r\n- Community Admin home screen cleanup (inc. adding at least one of the three graphs, whichever is easiest to implement).\r\n  - Graph issue: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11152  \r\n  - Community overview: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11278\r\n\r\n**3. Ability for user to select & manage accounts shared with each community control node**\r\n- This item is quite a bit of work\r\n- Touches Community settings, as well as all of the community join flows\r\n- Backend issues: \r\n  - Join API: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11154\r\n  - Edit API: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11153\r\n\r\n**4. Encryption for token gated channels that are inside Open (not token gated) communities**\r\n[#10998](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/10998)\r\n\r\n**5. Final screens and bits and bobs needed prior to public beta**\r\n- Modal that's shown every time after login, reminding user's that Status Desktop is in Beta [#11044](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11044)\r\n- The bug with 'requests to join' a community not constantly arriving, or sometimes arriving after a delay, must be fixed. [#8264](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/8264)\r\n- Anything that didn't get completed in 0.13 related to new share URL format\r\n- All the outstanding bugs and small items that got pushed into the 0.14 milestone.\r\n\r\n\r\n**--- Things that we SHOULD NOT work on during the 0.14 cycle ---**\r\n- Messaging and UI teams shouldn't work on perf. in 0.14 (but Wallet team should!)\r\n- Anything big mutual contacts related, other than fixing small bugs we find like #10497 #10498 #11120 #11121  (hopefully this functionality working good enough now!)\r\n\r\n**--- Wallet Team ---**\r\n\r\n1. Finish any outstanding work related to Activity screens (top priority - aim to have complete by July 14th)\r\n\r\n2. Updated Wallet Settings screens UI inc. account syncing functionality  *Synced information should immediately be reflected in the UI after it is received (sometimes synced info is currently only displayed after the next app restart, this needs to be fixed)*\r\n\r\n3. Wallet performance and memory consumption optimisations\r\n\r\n4. Fix bugs, clean up loose ends (to get things in a good state before the work on the Mobile wallet starts)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Hi @alexandraB99 the transfer ownership flows are now ready for development. I can setup a call with whoever is picking this up to go through but below is an overall summary:\r\n\r\nThe Community Settings / Overview screen has been tidied up and now contains a control node banner. There are 2 states for the banner:\r\n\r\n1) Where the user's device is the control node - in this instance, the banner copy relates to keeping the control node online and has the CTA to `Move control node`\r\n\r\n2) Where the user's device is not the control node (this could be a Community admin or the owner who is on a different device)\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"1\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/110033914/5bb7dfc7-d6c1-483c-a788-609682c703e1\">\r\n\r\nIn both states of the banner, there is a `Learn more` link which links to our Status documentation on control nodes - the link for this is stipulated in the designs.\r\n\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\n\r\n**If the user's device IS the control node**\r\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"2\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/110033914/3fe9dbf0-b2a8-401e-8dad-c12202333f5c\">\r\n\r\nWhen the user clicks `Move control node` they authenticate (given the subsequent dialog reveals the Community private key). \r\n\r\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"4\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/110033914/da27e668-3692-4c07-8171-7288873f3510\">\r\n\r\nOnce authenticated the user can copy the private key, check the relevant acknowledgements and finally `Delete private key and stop control node`. After this, the Community overview screen shows a toast confirming that the device is no longer the control node. The control node banner state is flipped - the copy and buttons are now focused on the reverse action - making the device the control node.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"5\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/110033914/d8a20c83-28b1-4886-80bf-e47f255991cb\">\r\n\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**If the user's device is NOT the control node**\r\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"3\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/110033914/8c7332ee-1991-4a82-b25d-f25ef9fbdc2f\">\r\n\r\nWhen the user clicks `Make this device the control node` we check if there are existing control nodes. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"6\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/110033914/97b566d4-9fcb-4ea7-9105-9c9d3c27a382\">\r\n\r\nIf so an amber warning shows, clarifying to the user that there are other devices acting as the control node for the Community and that running multiple control nodes will cause issues. The user is not blocked from entering the private key and becoming the control node however. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"7\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/110033914/e0224154-1493-4b4b-ad24-012c8ba04ea1\">\r\n\r\nOnce the user has entered the private key for the Community, the key is checked and validated and if it is the correct private key for that Community, we enable the button `Make this device the control node for [Community name]`. This triggers authentication (only if needed from a dev perspective). A toast is shown over the Community overview page confirming the user's device is now the control node. The control node banner is switched to the variant that requests the user keep the device online and shows the button to `Move control node`\r\n\r\n\r\nFigma designs:\r\nhttps://www.figma.com/file/17fc13UBFvInrLgNUKJJg5/Kuba%E2%8E%9CDesktop?type=design&node-id=31171-630010&t=IIt7pohtmgc4Y7G6-4\r\n\r\n\r\nThis work also impacts the following:\r\n\r\n**Community overview** screen designs which are updated and added to the Kuba file here.
