All my attempts to reproduce it have failed so far. I hope that the peculiar HTML code visible below will help someone identify the root cause:\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nWhile trying to mention another user in the chat, I've ran into the known https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/7686 issue. Haven't seen this issue before, I naturally tried to understand what's going on by sending another message featuring a similar mention. To my surprise, the client inserted a short blurb of HTML code (probably related to how the mention is being rendered in the client?) before the second message I sent, even though this time it rendered the mention correctly.\r\n\r\nI wasn't sure what I did to make this happen as follow up attempts to do the same was not successful:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"924\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/175462/205632397-35d1a010-f2e1-45b1-ab40-6e2e51c2b023.png\">\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n- Status desktop version: 0.8\r\n- Operating System: macOS",
