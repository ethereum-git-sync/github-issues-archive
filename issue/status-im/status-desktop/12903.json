  "body": "# Bug Report\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nI was added as a TokenMaster to a community owned by Nastya.\r\n\r\nThere are other members in the community, yet I can only see myself in the member list.\r\n\r\nI assume this is because the shared addresses were not shared with the TokenMaster. I did try to reload the app and it didn't help.\r\n\r\nThis might be related to https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/12902\r\n\r\nWhat I see in the member list:\r\n![image](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/11926403/8ef52f26-0d01-4da6-8654-15398383e606)\r\n\r\nActual members:\r\n![image](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/11926403/f51976e6-9d84-47ca-ae1c-359af12f79b7)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create an on request community in Account A\r\n2. Invite Account B to community\r\n3. Join using Account B and approve using A\r\n4. A mints the Owner token and airdrops a TM token to B\r\n5. B is now a TM\r\n6. A mints a new community token (asset or collectible doesn't matter)\r\n7. B tries to airdrop the token\r\n8. The member list only contains B\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe member list contains the list of all the members, except the owner\r\n\r\n#### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nOnly contains himself\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nTested on testnet\r\n\r\n- Status desktop version: 0.15.0 RC5\r\n- Operating System: Ubuntu 20\r\n\r\n",
