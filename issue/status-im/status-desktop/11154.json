Token permissions to enable control of community smart contracts**\r\n- Before a community founder can use any of the community token admin functionality, they first have to deploy Owner and Token Master contracts.\r\n- This work involves: new empty state screen for Mint and Airdrop tokens (before current empty state screen is revealed), new flow for deploying the community's Owner and Token Master contracts in a single step, a fixed uneditable permission giving anybody who holds the Token Master token admin rights for the community should be automatically created.\r\n- Only the holder of the single Owner token can access the Token Master airdrop, remote destruct, and view holders functions. Anybody who holds the Token Master token can access all token admin options, excluding those related to the Token Master token itself, as well as being and Admin of the community.\r\n- This will all be explained in more detail in the designs.\r\n\r\nBackend Epic: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11249\r\n\r\n**2. Updates to control node transfer and associated dialogues**\r\n- Remove ability for a Owner to leave a community on the computer that's running as that community's control node\r\n- Community Admin home screen cleanup (inc. adding at least one of the three graphs, whichever is easiest to implement).\r\n  - Graph issue: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11152  \r\n  - Community overview: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11278\r\n\r\n**3. Ability for user to select & manage accounts shared with each community control node**\r\n- This item is quite a bit of work\r\n- Touches Community settings, as well as all of the community join flows\r\n- Backend issues: \r\n  - Join API: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11154\r\n  - Edit API: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11153\r\n\r\n**4. Encryption for token gated channels that are inside Open (not token gated) communities**\r\n[#10998](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/10998)\r\n\r\n**5. Final screens and bits and bobs needed prior to public beta**\r\n- Modal that's shown every time after login, reminding user's that Status Desktop is in Beta [#11044](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11044)\r\n- The bug with 'requests to join' a community not constantly arriving, or sometimes arriving after a delay, must be fixed. [#8264](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/8264)\r\n- Anything that didn't get completed in 0.13 related to new share URL format\r\n- All the outstanding bugs and small items that got pushed into the 0.14 milestone.\r\n\r\n**6. Profile showcase backend**\r\n- The long-delayed profile showcase backend!  We have the UI on the desktop ready to go for this feature, and Mobile is going to need the backend for this feature as well, so let's try to get it done in 0.14 [#11081](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11081)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**--- Things that we SHOULD NOT work on during the 0.14 cycle ---**\r\n- Messaging and UI teams shouldn't work on perf. in 0.14 (but Wallet team should!)\r\n- Anything big mutual contacts related, other than fixing small bugs we find like #10497 #10498 #11120 #11121  (hopefully this functionality working good enough now!)\r\n\r\n**--- Wallet Team ---**\r\n\r\n1. Finish any outstanding work related to Activity screens (top priority - aim to have complete by July 14th)\r\n\r\n2. Updated Wallet Settings screens UI inc. account syncing functionality  *Synced information should immediately be reflected in the UI after it is received (sometimes synced info is currently only displayed after the next app restart, this needs to be fixed)*\r\n\r\n3. Wallet performance and memory consumption optimisations\r\n\r\n4. Fix bugs, clean up loose ends (to get things in a good state before the work on the Mobile wallet starts)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

If it does have permissions, we share the addresses that fulfill the permissions.\r\n\r\nWhat we now want is to give the user the option to choose which address they want to share.\r\n\r\nThere is also the choice to just share all addresses, in that case, it uses the same method we have right now.\r\n\r\nThe new API will pass a list of addresses to the backend, and then to the owner.\r\n\r\nOne caveat, if the list of addresses does **not** fulfill the permissions to join, we need to reject the call before sending to the Owner. That means returning an error.\r\n\r\nIf it does fulfill the permission to join, or if there is no permission to join, then the call is valid and is sent to the Owner and the flow stays the same as before.\r\n\r\nAlso, if the community has Admin permissions, they do **not** have to be fulfilled for the call to be valid. For example, if a community requires 10 SNT to join and 1 special collectible to be admin, if the user only has 10 SNT in the shared addresses, that is valid. \r\n\r\nMost of the code should be already there, we just need to modify or add a new API endpoint in status-go so that we don't just pass the password, we also pass the list of addresses the user wants to share.\r\n\r\nThere is **no UI** work to be done with this task. Mostly status-go, but also a little bit of Nim to modify the functions that will be called from QML. Feel free to use a placeholder UI to test, but status-go tests can suffice.\r\n\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n- There is a new or modified API that let's users pass the addresses they want to share with the Owner instead of always passing all addresses\r\n- It is still possible to pass all addresses\r\n- If there is a member permission and the list of addresses does not fulfill that permission, the call should error and not send to the Owner\r\n\r\n",
