  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nIn the following issue, to be able to merge the models for message reactions and emojiReactions, I made the below proposal. This requires some refactoring therefore I created this ticket.\r\n\r\nTicket : https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/10703\r\nPR     : https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/pull/13003\r\nCommit : [commit](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/commit/a56903da439fd65bc3d3c01c3b35acf356c3d8bb)\r\n\r\n> ### Proposal\r\n> \r\n> We need to use the counter attached to each reactions in a message.\r\n> The way it will work is that we will always have all the reactions available, but, in :\r\n> \r\n> case 1 : reactionsModel\r\n> \r\n> add reaction will not add new reaction, but just increment counter\r\n> remove reaction will not delete reaction, but just decrement counter\r\n> if counter is 0, it's not displayed but not removed from the model\r\n> if counter > 0 and I reacted, it's highlighted blue\r\n> if counter > 0 and I did NOT react, it's highlighted grey\r\n> the SortFilterProxyModel will be on the number of reactions (> 0) instead\r\n> case 2 : emojiReactionsModel\r\n> \r\n> no SortFilterProxyModel\r\n> if counter is 0, it's not highlighted\r\n> if counter > 0, it's highlighted\r\n> This way, the view will adapt for the same data coming from the model. the size of the model will not vary during the execution. This requires modification in the model, and adaptation in the view for each cases.",
