  "body": "# Bug Report\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThe desktop application started crashing immediately after logging in for the main user that I've been using for several days. So now I'm blocked from accessing this account.\r\n\r\nI've updated my macOS to the latest version - Ventura 13.0, since it helped other users (e.g. [this issue](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/8161)), but it didn't work for me.\r\n\r\nLooks like the app crashes after loading the db (see video below). But the exact reason is still unclear. What I could recall:\r\n\r\n1. I have two users, both have a community (Status community on the main account and test one on the second)\r\n2. Touch ID is enabled for both users. I tried to log in with both touch ID and password - unsuccessfully\r\n3. But I still can log in to my second test account with one contact, one 1-1 chat, and one community\r\n4. On the main account I have the Status community, 74 contacts, 14 1-1 chats\r\n5. The main account is also restored on the mobile app\r\n6. During the day, I switched between users many times\r\n7. Today I updated the Desktop app to the latest develop 0.7.9, but I was able to use it for a while after the update\r\n8. Both users had the issue with receiving messages\r\n\r\nVideo  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZM7zLbq6HjiWTdN6_TrePcWcrFcGX3uq/view?usp=sharing\r\n\r\nLogs from terminal: [desktop_crash1.log](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/files/9973076/desktop_crash1.log)\r\n\r\n#### Chronology of events\r\n\r\n1. Installed Status 3/11\r\n2. Restored a multiaccount from the same seed phrase on Desktop and Mobile\r\n3. Used it for one week\r\n4. Created another multiaccount \r\n5. Updated version from 0.7.0 to 0.7.9\r\n6. Used it for a while (a couple of hours)\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nCan log in to both users\r\n\r\n#### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nCan only log in to the additional test user\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n- Status desktop version: 0.7.9\r\n- Operating System: MacBook Pro, macOS Ventura 13.0\r\n\r\n",

I got this error when accidentally built **0.7.x** with status-go **develop** branch. If 0.7.9 assembled with status-go develop, it should not work at all, we need to add some guards to stop building incompatible versions e.g having same release branch naming in all status repos",

Could you tell me is there are any updates on this?\r\n> \r\n> I'm still blocked from using Status Desktop, so I was wondering if you guys mind if I reinstall the app today? I'm keeping this for now in case it helps fix it, so let me know if I shouldn't delete the crashed version. I'm using the mobile version all this time but would like to get back to using Desktop :)\r\n\r\nThat fixed by @PascalPrecht in master",
