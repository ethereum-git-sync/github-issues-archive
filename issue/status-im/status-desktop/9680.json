    "description": "Priorities **in priority order** for the 0.12 milestone:  \r\n\r\n**1. Improve performance**\r\n- Focus on eliminating any UI freezes when the user clicks on something and the app does not display an immediate response.  Target: the app should ideally respond to all user input within 50ms, but let's start with identifying the longest UI freezes and trying to fix the worst UI freezes first.\r\n- Speed and responsiveness of switching between community channels, and 1on1 and ad-hoc group chats is particularly important, especially for channels and chats that contains a lot of history.  We should aim for about 250ms delay in the *worst* case if possible.  Having a lot of history in a channel should not slow channel switching down.\r\n- DB perf optimisations.  \r\n- Move things to async and off main thread\r\n- See Alex's great profiling work for possible tasks (Alex to continue focusing on perf. for this release cycle)\r\n- \"user facing performance in everyday app usage\" is the top priority, but any task that improves performance is worthwhile\r\n\r\n**2. Finish development of token based functionality from 0.11**\r\n- Optimise No. queries made by owner node when checking member tokens (Pascal)\r\n- Community encryption should automatically switch on/off depending on community permissions (issue #9942)\r\n- Implement the 'Admin' role (issue #10114)\r\n- Airdrop to community members (in addition to addresses)\r\n- Optimise gas required by collectable minting smart contracts (issue #9943, GravityBlast)\r\n--- After collectable minting gas optimisation is complete, start work on Asset minting contracts (GravityBlast)\r\n- Complete token remote destruct UI\r\n- Remove 'Community Permissions Settings', 'Community Tokens' and 'Discord Import Tool' feature flags (issue #10115)\r\n- Thoroughly test, and fix all bugs found. \r\n- Anything else related to Community level token permissions, collectable minting, airdropping, and remote destructing that didn't make it into 0.11\r\n\r\n**3. Finish implementing the ability for Community Owners and Admins to drag and drop channels and categories into different orders**\r\n\r\n**4. Finish anything related to the initial pairing process for syncing that wasn't completed in 0.11** (Igor)\r\n\r\n**5. Improve Mutual Contacts functionality to improve reliability and pay off tech debt** (Mishka)\r\n\r\n**6. Complete Community Directory Curation dApp integration inc. Featured functionality** (Patryk)\r\n \r\n**7. Backend for the Profile Showcase**\r\n\r\n**8. Identity Verification** (required for 'Profile Showcase')\r\n\r\n**9. Fix bugs, bugs and more bugs!**\r\n- Esp. find the cause of and fix the longstanding bug of some 'requests to join' not arriving for hours/days after they were sent!\r\n- Many 'fit and finish' bugs for the UI team\r\n\r\n**--- For the Wallet team ---**\r\n\r\n1. Continue feature development inc. kicking off development of the activity screens\r\n2. 'All accounts' section.  The ability to return all tokens owned by the user in all accounts (excluding watch only accounts) is also required for the Showcase functionality\r\n3. Widen scope of 'backup to waku' and 'syncing' so that all relevant Wallet user state is backed up and synced between devices\r\n4. Continue to ensure Wallet functionality is performant.\r\n5. Fix wallet bugs",

  "body": "Version: 0.9\r\nOS: Windows 10\r\n\r\nThere are positioning, iconography, and functionality consistency issues with the edit image floating action button (FAB) that is present wherever an image is added or edited. \r\n\r\nThese issues are present across the following screens:\r\n- Edit Profile\r\n- Create Community\r\n- Edit Community\r\n- Onboarding Create Profile\r\n\r\n**Related issue**\r\nSee issue #9682 that should probably be worked on at the same time as working on this issue.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Scenario 1 - Positioning \r\n\r\nBefore an image is added for a ‘community icon’ or ‘community banner’ or a ‘user avatar’, the blue circular ‘add image’ floating action button (FAB) is aligned to the top right of the image field.\r\n\r\nAfter an image is populated into any of these fields, the edit FAB jumps to the bottom right of the image field (which is incorrect - it should remain in the top right position where the add image FAB was).\r\n\r\n\r\n<ins>Steps to reproduce:</ins>\r\n\r\n1. Click on a Community you are the Owner of in the primary nav bar, **that doesn’t currently have a community logo or banner image**\r\n\r\n2. Navigate to the admin screens for that Community\r\n\r\n3. Click ‘Edit Community’ \r\n\r\n4. Click the  ‘+’ FAB to add an image to the empty community logo image field, and add an image.\r\n \r\n\r\n<ins>What currently incorrectly happens</ins>\r\n\r\n5. As soon as the image has been added, the ‘add image’ FAB disappears, and an ‘edit image’ FAB appears at the bottom right of the image field\r\n\r\n\r\n<ins>What is supposed to happen</ins>\r\n\r\n5. The ‘edit image’ FAB should appear in the same ‘aligned to the top right of the image field’ position where the ‘add image’ FAB was previously located.\r\n\r\n\r\n<ins>Other information</ins>\r\n\r\n![2 Correct Positioning](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/124154641/222126210-90ed7541-58d8-4fd1-b9a9-014cb8669b3e.png)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n![2 Incorrect Positioning](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/124154641/222126330-6e9014ca-be3f-4c2f-94fd-559261c3c71d.png)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n**This same bug is also present in the Settings/Profile screen (the user avatar image field).**\r\n![2 profile](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/124154641/222126429-40a5f29a-ca94-412e-8fb7-012826ee52d5.png)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n## Scenario 2 - Incorrect FAB Icon used in Create and Edit community screens\r\n\r\nWhen an image for a ‘community icon’, ‘community banner’ or a ‘user avatar’ is added, the ‘add image’ FAB changes to an ‘edit image’ FAB. \r\n\r\nThe ‘edit image’ FAB currently uses a different icon in the Edit Profile and Edit Community screens. The Edit Profile screen currently has the correct ‘edit image’ FAB icon, and the FAB icon used in the *‘Create Community’* and *‘Edit Community’* screens is incorrect.  \r\n\r\n<ins>Steps to reproduce:</ins>\r\n\r\n1. In the primary nav bar, click on a Community you are the Owner of, **that already has community logo and banner images added**.\r\n\r\n2. Navigate to the admin screens for that Community\r\n\r\n3. Click ‘Edit Community’ \r\n\r\n<ins>What currently incorrectly happens</ins>\r\n\r\n4. The FAB icon for the community logo and banner image fields currently incorrectly shows a box with a pen. \r\n\r\n<ins>What is supposed to happen</ins>\r\n\r\n4. The FAB icon for the community logo and banner image fields should be the same as the icon used for the user avatar field FAB in the Edit Profile screen. This icon should be used for all ‘edit image’ FABs.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n ## Scenario 3 - FAB Functionality is inconsistent\r\n\r\nThe image FAB functionality is also different between the Community Admin and Edit Profile screens. When a user left clicks on the edit image FAB in the Edit Profile screen it opens a contextual menu, however when the user left clicks on the FAB in the *Create Community* and *Edit Community* screens it directly opens an OS file picker dialog. This is incorrect, the FAB functionality should be the same on both of these screens. The Edit Profile screen currently has the correct FAB functionality, with a context menu opening when the user left clicks on this button.. \r\n\r\n<ins>Steps to reproduce:</ins>\r\n\r\n1. In the primary nav bar, click on a Community you are the Owner of, **that already has community logo and banner images added**.\r\n\r\n2. Navigate to the admin screens for that Community\r\n\r\n3. Click ‘Edit Community’ \r\n\r\n4. Left click the ‘edit image’ FAB in either the community logo or banner image field\r\n\r\n\r\n<ins>What currently incorrectly happens</ins>\r\n\r\n5. When a user Left clicks the ‘edit image’ FAB a OS file picker dialog opens directly. \r\n\r\n\r\n<ins>What is supposed to happen</ins>\r\n\r\n5. When a user Left clicks the ‘edit image’ FAB, a contextual menu with the two options (Upload a file and Remove image) opens. The menu and functionality should be the same as the ‘edit image’ FAB in the Edit Profile screen.     \r\n\r\n<ins>Other information</ins>\r\n\r\nNote: Edit profile screen\r\n1. Navigate to Settings/Profile\r\n2. Left click on the ‘edit image’ FAB in the user avatar image field\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n![2 Functionality](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/124154641/222127556-36c26501-4f6a-47de-8cf2-ef114a07d8d6.png)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n### <ins>tl:dr</ins>\r\nEdit Profile and Edit Community image field FABs need to be uniform across Status. Currently the icon and functionality are not the same in the different screens. Also the FABs (in both screens) incorrectly jump position once an avatar/logo/banner has been uploaded.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
