Channel token permissions**\r\n- Create, edit and delete channel token permissions in the permissions admin screens\r\n- This includes the \"no tokens required to view this channel\" permission\r\n- All user facing channel token permissions functionality e.g. what happens when a user tries to access a token gated channel they don't have the required tokens to access, what happens when a user only has permissions to view a channel, etc...\r\n- If a community is an open (not token gated at the community level) community, if a channel is token gated AND if **no** \"no tokens required to view this channel\" permission for that channel exists, then the channel should be automatically encrypted.  If token gating is removed from a channel, the channel should become unencrypted.\r\n\r\n**3. DB perf improvements**\r\n- https://www.notion.so/Database-related-performance-1dbaa7ea894c461d885e55676683be07\r\n- Alex and Patryk to work on this, with help from Lukáš\r\n\r\n**4. Update app to use new 'Share URL' formats**\r\n- add functionality to status-go to generate the new 'Share URL' formats for sharing links to: User Profiles, Communities, Channel inside a Community\r\n- Update everywhere a user can share a URL from to use the new URL format\r\n- New/updated URL unroll designs for inside chat, including specific unrolls for the new User Profile, Community and Channel inside a Community URLs\r\n- Ability to share a URL that points to a specific channel in a community (issue #10160)\r\n- Update all address inputs to accept a user pasting a 'share URL' into the input (in addition to being able to input the raw address).  This includes: Start new chat input, send contact request input in Settings, the import community key input, etc...\r\n- Update Status Desktops URL handler so that if Status is installed on a computer, when a user clicks on a Status 'Share URL' the app is launched (if not already running) and after signing in the user is automatically taken to the entity the Share URL represented inside the app.  e.g. if a user clicks on a URL for a Status Community, the user should be taken to the home screen for that community inside the Status App\r\n\r\n**5. Mint Assets functionality**\r\n- Also includes some small improvements to the mint Collectables functionality\r\n- Noelia, GravityBlast\r\n\r\n**6.

    "body": "Hi @micieslak , @alexandraB99 confirmed with the design team that the following rules should apply to these components.\r\n\r\n1) Where there is a primary CTA such as 'Add', this should be augmented with the number of items selected if that CTA is directly related to the application/sending/submission etc of the selected items. So in the top component example, selecting a checklist item should result in +1 being appended to the 'Add' label.. For example, if the user selects 1 item, the button label should read 'Add 1'. The count on the button should increase/decrease based on checklist item selection/deselection. This is important as it clarifies to the user how many selections they currently have when some/all of those selections might be out of view due to scrolling of the list / searching.\r\n\r\n2) Selected items should only be shown when the user is searching the list if there are matching strings in that value. If not, those selected items should be hidden until the search is changed to include matching strings or cleared.\r\n\r\nHope that helps, any further questions on that just shout. We can add creating flows for these components to our list if helpful - just let us know. \r\n\r\ncc @John-44 @xAlisher ",

    "body": "> Hi @micieslak , @alexandraB99 confirmed with the design team that the following rules should apply to these components.\r\n> \r\n> 1. Where there is a primary CTA such as 'Add', this should be augmented with the number of items selected if that CTA is directly related to the application/sending/submission etc of the selected items. So in the top component example, selecting a checklist item should result in +1 being appended to the 'Add' label.. For example, if the user selects 1 item, the button label should read 'Add 1'. The count on the button should increase/decrease based on checklist item selection/deselection. This is important as it clarifies to the user how many selections they currently have when some/all of those selections might be out of view due to scrolling of the list / searching.\r\n> 2. Selected items should only be shown when the user is searching the list if there are matching strings in that value. If not, those selected items should be hidden until the search is changed to include matching strings or cleared.\r\n\r\nThanks @benjthayer for explanation. It applies nicely to the first screen I posted but it remains in contradiction to what we have for invite popup:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2023-05-11 12-10-25](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/20650004/2a6c8668-cb28-4f01-b702-6613f7fe8f8d)\r\n\r\nhttps://www.figma.com/file/17fc13UBFvInrLgNUKJJg5/Kuba%E2%8E%9CDesktop?type=design&node-id=2990-353179&t=ZroCPZZNm3oxj8e2-0\r\n\r\nAccording to the design, selected items are always visible in search results. Do we want to just remove them from search result? Should \"Next\" button contain some information how many items are selected?",

    "body": "Hi @micieslak yes in the above case `Invite Contacts to CryptoKitties` in order to be consistent, `simon` would not be present in the list as it does not contain a string matching that entered by the user. \r\n\r\nThe next button wouldn't be augmented with the number of users selected on this occasion given the `Next` action doesn't directly relate to user selected. It just takes the user onwards in the jouney. I've edited those screens slightly to align to this.\r\n\r\nThe `Send invites` button would be augmented with the number however as this does directly relate to the number of selected users. I've adjusted that button to include the number of selected users.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1524\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-05-11 at 11 24 29\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/110033914/4b43d83c-50cc-4acf-8578-dd78bd2fa73a\">\r\n\r\nhttps://www.figma.com/file/17fc13UBFvInrLgNUKJJg5/Kuba%E2%8E%9CDesktop?type=design&node-id=2927-344073&t=Os6iVseYwCZb4YRQ-4\r\n\r\nHope that sounds ok from your perspective and makes sense? :)",
