    "description": "Priorities **in priority order** for the 0.12 milestone:  \r\n\r\n**1. Improve performance**\r\n- Focus on eliminating any UI freezes when the user clicks on something and the app does not display an immediate response.  Target: the app should ideally respond to all user input within 50ms, but let's start with identifying the longest UI freezes and trying to fix the worst UI freezes first.\r\n- Speed and responsiveness of switching between community channels, and 1on1 and ad-hoc group chats is particularly important, especially for channels and chats that contains a lot of history.  We should aim for about 250ms delay in the *worst* case if possible.  Having a lot of history in a channel should not slow channel switching down.\r\n- DB perf optimisations.  \r\n- Move things to async and off main thread\r\n- See Alex's great profiling work for possible tasks (Alex to continue focusing on perf. for this release cycle)\r\n- \"user facing performance in everyday app usage\" is the top priority, but any task that improves performance is worthwhile\r\n\r\n**2. Finish development of token based functionality from 0.11**\r\n- Optimise No. queries made by owner node when checking member tokens (Pascal)\r\n- Community encryption should automatically switch on/off depending on community permissions (issue #9942)\r\n- Implement the 'Admin' role (issue #10114)\r\n- Airdrop to community members (in addition to addresses)\r\n- Optimise gas required by collectable minting smart contracts (issue #9943, GravityBlast)\r\n--- After collectable minting gas optimisation is complete, start work on Asset minting contracts (GravityBlast)\r\n- Complete token remote destruct UI\r\n- Remove 'Community Permissions Settings', 'Community Tokens' and 'Discord Import Tool' feature flags (issue #10115)\r\n- Thoroughly test, and fix all bugs found. \r\n- Anything else related to Community level token permissions, collectable minting, airdropping, and remote destructing that didn't make it into 0.11\r\n\r\n**3. Finish implementing the ability for Community Owners and Admins to drag and drop channels and categories into different orders**\r\n\r\n**4. Finish anything related to the initial pairing process for syncing that wasn't completed in 0.11** (Igor)\r\n\r\n**5. Improve Mutual Contacts functionality to improve reliability and pay off tech debt** (Mishka)\r\n\r\n**6. Complete Community Directory Curation dApp integration inc. Featured functionality** (Patryk)\r\n \r\n**7. Backend for the Profile Showcase**\r\n\r\n**8. Identity Verification** (required for 'Profile Showcase')\r\n\r\n**9. Fix bugs, bugs and more bugs!**\r\n- Esp. find the cause of and fix the longstanding bug of some 'requests to join' not arriving for hours/days after they were sent!\r\n- Many 'fit and finish' bugs for the UI team\r\n\r\n**--- For the Wallet team ---**\r\n\r\n1. Continue feature development inc. kicking off development of the activity screens\r\n2. 'All accounts' section.  The ability to return all tokens owned by the user in all accounts (excluding watch only accounts) is also required for the Showcase functionality\r\n3. Widen scope of 'backup to waku' and 'syncing' so that all relevant Wallet user state is backed up and synced between devices\r\n4. Continue to ensure Wallet functionality is performant.\r\n5. Fix wallet bugs",

  "body": "# Bug Report\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nIn the scope of checking Desktop <-> Mobile sync some data, several issues were noticed when syncing on direction Mobile -> Desktop (desktop client came from offline) \r\nThe issue is not consistent and most visible on multi accounts with a lot of activity/data (not reproducible for me on fresh multi accounts, but constantly bumped onto when using my main account)\r\n\r\nThis data contains: \r\n- community request accepting\r\n- changing nickname\r\n- mentions/replies in AC (from time to time)\r\n- sometimes blocking the user\r\n\r\nThe reason why the issue is in the desktop repo is that it is working better in the direction Desktop -> Mobile.\r\nMoreover, seems that community requests just cannot be accepted from the activity center on the desktop, and it is worth additional reporting/investigating (cc @anastasiyaig ), video is attached.\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4557972/231745099-ba2b2fcb-8abb-4f05-8059-e7eb75aef83d.mp4\r\n\r\nMay be it is better to split that us into several issues, just wanted to let you know that there are definitely issues in terms of syncing data.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n**Prerequisites:** User1 is restored on the desktop and on the mobile client, he is the admin of the community A\r\n1. as User1 (desktop): close the app\r\n2. as User2 (from the third device): send community request\r\n3. as User1 (mobile): accept it, make sure that the user is a member of the community\r\n4. as User1 (mobile): set nickname to any user\r\n5. as User3 (from the third device): mention User1 in the community\r\n5. as User1 (mobile): block any user\r\n6. as User1 (desktop): open the app, log in, and check the data (best to wait for 5-10 mins) \r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\nall data is synced\r\n\r\n#### Actual behavior\r\n![Status Desktop 2023-04-13 13-09-57](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4557972/231741400-3a952a0e-a8c2-46b1-9c82-25e8ef2882c1.png)\r\n3. AC community request is still there, however, the user is already shown as a member of community\r\n4. Nickname was not synced\r\n5. Blocked users (from time to time) are not synced\r\n6. Mentions/replies sometimes are not fetched (also not reproducible every time) \r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n**Desktop app:**\r\n- Status desktop version: RC 8 0.11\r\n- Operating System: Mac OSx Ventura\r\n- Logs: \r\n[app_20230413_115518.log](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/files/11221451/app_20230413_115518.log)\r\n[app_20230413_121133.log](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/files/11221452/app_20230413_121133.log)\r\n\r\n**Mobile app:**\r\n- Build: 1.22\r\n- OS: IOS 16\r\n- Logs:\r\n[logs (32).zip](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/files/11221610/logs.32.zip)\r\n",
