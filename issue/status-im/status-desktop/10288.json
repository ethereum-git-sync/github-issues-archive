Token permissions to enable control of community smart contracts**\r\n- Before a community founder can use any of the community token admin functionality, they first have to deploy Owner and Token Master contracts.\r\n- This work involves: new empty state screen for Mint and Airdrop tokens (before current empty state screen is revealed), new flow for deploying the community's Owner and Token Master contracts in a single step, a fixed uneditable permission giving anybody who holds the Token Master token admin rights for the community should be automatically created.\r\n- Only the holder of the single Owner token can access the Token Master airdrop, remote destruct, and view holders functions. Anybody who holds the Token Master token can access all token admin options, excluding those related to the Token Master token itself, as well as being and Admin of the community.\r\n- This will all be explained in more detail in the designs.\r\n\r\nBackend Epic: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11249\r\n\r\n**2. Updates to control node transfer and associated dialogues**\r\n- Remove ability for a Owner to leave a community on the computer that's running as that community's control node\r\n- Community Admin home screen cleanup (inc. adding at least one of the three graphs, whichever is easiest to implement).\r\n  - Graph issue: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11152  \r\n  - Community overview: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11278\r\n\r\n**3. Ability for user to select & manage accounts shared with each community control node**\r\n- This item is quite a bit of work\r\n- Touches Community settings, as well as all of the community join flows\r\n- Backend issues: \r\n  - Join API: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11154\r\n  - Edit API: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11153\r\n\r\n**4. Encryption for token gated channels that are inside Open (not token gated) communities**\r\n[#10998](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/10998)\r\n\r\n**5. Final screens and bits and bobs needed prior to public beta**\r\n- Modal that's shown every time after login, reminding user's that Status Desktop is in Beta [#11044](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11044)\r\n- The bug with 'requests to join' a community not constantly arriving, or sometimes arriving after a delay, must be fixed. [#8264](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/8264)\r\n- Anything that didn't get completed in 0.13 related to new share URL format\r\n- All the outstanding bugs and small items that got pushed into the 0.14 milestone.\r\n\r\n**6. Profile showcase backend**\r\n- The long-delayed profile showcase backend!  We have the UI on the desktop ready to go for this feature, and Mobile is going to need the backend for this feature as well, so let's try to get it done in 0.14 [#11081](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11081)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**--- Things that we SHOULD NOT work on during the 0.14 cycle ---**\r\n- Messaging and UI teams shouldn't work on perf. in 0.14 (but Wallet team should!)\r\n- Anything big mutual contacts related, other than fixing small bugs we find like #10497 #10498 #11120 #11121  (hopefully this functionality working good enough now!)\r\n\r\n**--- Wallet Team ---**\r\n\r\n1. Finish any outstanding work related to Activity screens (top priority - aim to have complete by July 14th)\r\n\r\n2. Updated Wallet Settings screens UI inc. account syncing functionality  *Synced information should immediately be reflected in the UI after it is received (sometimes synced info is currently only displayed after the next app restart, this needs to be fixed)*\r\n\r\n3. Wallet performance and memory consumption optimisations\r\n\r\n4. Fix bugs, clean up loose ends (to get things in a good state before the work on the Mobile wallet starts)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

  "body": "# Bug Report\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nIn the scope of checking Desktop <-> Mobile sync some data, several issues were noticed when syncing on direction Mobile -> Desktop (desktop client came from offline) \r\nThe issue is not consistent and most visible on multi accounts with a lot of activity/data (not reproducible for me on fresh multi accounts, but constantly bumped onto when using my main account)\r\n\r\nThis data contains: \r\n- community request accepting\r\n- changing nickname\r\n- mentions/replies in AC (from time to time)\r\n- sometimes blocking the user\r\n\r\nThe reason why the issue is in the desktop repo is that it is working better in the direction Desktop -> Mobile.\r\nMoreover, seems that community requests just cannot be accepted from the activity center on the desktop, and it is worth additional reporting/investigating (cc @anastasiyaig ), video is attached.\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4557972/231745099-ba2b2fcb-8abb-4f05-8059-e7eb75aef83d.mp4\r\n\r\nMay be it is better to split that us into several issues, just wanted to let you know that there are definitely issues in terms of syncing data.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n**Prerequisites:** User1 is restored on the desktop and on the mobile client, he is the admin of the community A\r\n1. as User1 (desktop): close the app\r\n2. as User2 (from the third device): send community request\r\n3. as User1 (mobile): accept it, make sure that the user is a member of the community\r\n4. as User1 (mobile): set nickname to any user\r\n5. as User3 (from the third device): mention User1 in the community\r\n5. as User1 (mobile): block any user\r\n6. as User1 (desktop): open the app, log in, and check the data (best to wait for 5-10 mins) \r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\nall data is synced\r\n\r\n#### Actual behavior\r\n![Status Desktop 2023-04-13 13-09-57](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4557972/231741400-3a952a0e-a8c2-46b1-9c82-25e8ef2882c1.png)\r\n3. AC community request is still there, however, the user is already shown as a member of community\r\n4. Nickname was not synced\r\n5. Blocked users (from time to time) are not synced\r\n6. Mentions/replies sometimes are not fetched (also not reproducible every time) \r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n**Desktop app:**\r\n- Status desktop version: RC 8 0.11\r\n- Operating System: Mac OSx Ventura\r\n- Logs: \r\n[app_20230413_115518.log](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/files/11221451/app_20230413_115518.log)\r\n[app_20230413_121133.log](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/files/11221452/app_20230413_121133.log)\r\n\r\n**Mobile app:**\r\n- Build: 1.22\r\n- OS: IOS 16\r\n- Logs:\r\n[logs (32).zip](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/files/11221610/logs.32.zip)\r\n",

At some point of playing around I also received the nickname update and mentions.\r\n\r\nWill investigate further.",
