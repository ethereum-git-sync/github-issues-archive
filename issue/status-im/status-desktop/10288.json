    "description": "Priorities **in priority order** for the 0.13 milestone:\r\n\r\n**1. Finish items started in 0.12**\r\n- Complete any outstanding issues related to pairing (for syncing) - Igor\r\n- Implement the 'Admin' role (issue #10114) - Mykhailo\r\n- 'Featured' category curation via curation dApp - Patryk\r\n- Any remaining work to pay off tech. debt related to mutual contacts - Mishka\r\n- When creating/editing token based permission, ability to search for and selecting Collectables from OpenSea - MichaelC\r\n\r\n**2. Channel token permissions**\r\n- Create, edit and delete channel token permissions in the permissions admin screens\r\n- This includes the \"no tokens required to view this channel\" permission\r\n- All user facing channel token permissions functionality e.g. what happens when a user tries to access a token gated channel they don't have the required tokens to access, what happens when a user only has permissions to view a channel, etc...\r\n- If a community is an open (not token gated at the community level) community, if a channel is token gated AND if **no** \"no tokens required to view this channel\" permission for that channel exists, then the channel should be automatically encrypted.  If token gating is removed from a channel, the channel should become unencrypted.\r\n- Asset (ERC-20) minting and airdropping functionality - GravityBlast\r\n\r\n**3. Add some type of cache in front of sqlite to ensure that writes don't block reads (Patryk?)**\r\n- It has been discovered that one of the causes of sometimes slow channel switching is that writes to sqlite block reads, and this is the cause of slow channel switching in many cases\r\n- Investigate the feasibility of (and if feasible implement) a general purpose cache for sqlite writes, which caches sqlite writes and then only writes them to sqlite in small chunks when no read operations are taking place (so that read operations are always prioritized, and not interrupted by writes).  Such a cache should cache all or almost all write requests from all areas of status-go\r\n\r\n**_OR_**\r\n\r\n- Perhaps it's time to bite the bullet and start the work needed to migrate both Status Desktop and Status Mobile from using sqlite to using PostgreSQL?\r\n\r\n**_OR_**\r\n\r\n- Perhaps there are some other possible solutions to this issue that should be explored before embarking on either of these large items?\r\n\r\n**4. Update app to use new 'Share URL' formats**\r\n- add functionality to status-go to generate the new 'Share URL' formats for sharing links to: User Profiles, Communities, Channel inside a Community\r\n- Update everywhere a user can share a URL from to use the new URL format\r\n- Ability to share a URL that points to a specific channel in a community (issue #10160)\r\n- Update all address inputs to accept a user pasting a 'share URL' into the input (in addition to being able to input the raw address).  This includes: Start new chat input, send contact request input in Settings, the import community key input, etc...\r\n- Update Status Desktops URL handler so that if Status is installed on a computer, when a user clicks on a Status 'Share URL' the app is launched (if not already running) and after signing in the user is automatically taken to the entity the Share URL represented inside the app.  e.g. if a user clicks on a URL for a Status Community, the user should be taken to the home screen for that community inside the Status App\r\n\r\n**5. Profile showcase backend***\r\n\r\n**6. Fix bugs, bugs and more bugs!**\r\n- The 0.13 release is targeted to be Status Desktop's first \"beta\" release, and the first release of Status Desktop that will be used by people outside of the Status Org.  So we want this release to be the best possible quality so it makes a good first impression  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**--- For the Wallet team ---**\r\n\r\n1. Complete any outstanding development related to the activity screens\r\n2. New settings screens\r\n3. Fix 'backup from waku' bugs\r\n4. Fix keycard bugs\r\n5. Implement 'imported key and account' syncing and transfer between devices\r\n6. Transaction signing dialogue (if designs are ready)\r\n\r\n",

  "body": "# Bug Report\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nIn the scope of checking Desktop <-> Mobile sync some data, several issues were noticed when syncing on direction Mobile -> Desktop (desktop client came from offline) \r\nThe issue is not consistent and most visible on multi accounts with a lot of activity/data (not reproducible for me on fresh multi accounts, but constantly bumped onto when using my main account)\r\n\r\nThis data contains: \r\n- community request accepting\r\n- changing nickname\r\n- mentions/replies in AC (from time to time)\r\n- sometimes blocking the user\r\n\r\nThe reason why the issue is in the desktop repo is that it is working better in the direction Desktop -> Mobile.\r\nMoreover, seems that community requests just cannot be accepted from the activity center on the desktop, and it is worth additional reporting/investigating (cc @anastasiyaig ), video is attached.\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4557972/231745099-ba2b2fcb-8abb-4f05-8059-e7eb75aef83d.mp4\r\n\r\nMay be it is better to split that us into several issues, just wanted to let you know that there are definitely issues in terms of syncing data.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n**Prerequisites:** User1 is restored on the desktop and on the mobile client, he is the admin of the community A\r\n1. as User1 (desktop): close the app\r\n2. as User2 (from the third device): send community request\r\n3. as User1 (mobile): accept it, make sure that the user is a member of the community\r\n4. as User1 (mobile): set nickname to any user\r\n5. as User3 (from the third device): mention User1 in the community\r\n5. as User1 (mobile): block any user\r\n6. as User1 (desktop): open the app, log in, and check the data (best to wait for 5-10 mins) \r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\nall data is synced\r\n\r\n#### Actual behavior\r\n![Status Desktop 2023-04-13 13-09-57](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4557972/231741400-3a952a0e-a8c2-46b1-9c82-25e8ef2882c1.png)\r\n3. AC community request is still there, however, the user is already shown as a member of community\r\n4. Nickname was not synced\r\n5. Blocked users (from time to time) are not synced\r\n6. Mentions/replies sometimes are not fetched (also not reproducible every time) \r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n**Desktop app:**\r\n- Status desktop version: RC 8 0.11\r\n- Operating System: Mac OSx Ventura\r\n- Logs: \r\n[app_20230413_115518.log](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/files/11221451/app_20230413_115518.log)\r\n[app_20230413_121133.log](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/files/11221452/app_20230413_121133.log)\r\n\r\n**Mobile app:**\r\n- Build: 1.22\r\n- OS: IOS 16\r\n- Logs:\r\n[logs (32).zip](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/files/11221610/logs.32.zip)\r\n",
