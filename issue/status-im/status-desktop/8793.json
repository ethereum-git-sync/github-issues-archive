I'm pretty sure that both CPU and memory usage is several times worse on OSX compared to Windows, and want to make sure we don't forget to look into this (I know everybody has their hands full with other tasks for 0.11 at this point.\r\n\r\nOSX having much worse resource usage is good news because it means there is something OSX specific causing the worst perf and resource consumption problems, ",
