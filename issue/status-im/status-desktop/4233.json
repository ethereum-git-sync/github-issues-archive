We must NOT do that at any point. Like you then said, it would break everything as there is then no way to find what the original text is.\r\n\r\nRight now, we have a JS script that transforms `qsTr` into `qsTrId` because we want to use IDs since status-react uses IDs as well and we can reuse some of their translations.\r\n\r\nThat script doesn't not work the other way around.\r\n\r\nBut all that is not really necessary, because whether we use `qsTr` or `qsTrId` doesn't matter.
