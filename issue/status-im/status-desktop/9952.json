We need to keep tech. debt at a roughly fixed level as we grow out functionality, can't let it accumulate! ;-)\r\n\r\n**2. Complete initial airdrop functionality**\r\n- Airdrop history screens\r\n- Ability to airdrop based on in-Community activity (No. of msg, No. msg in time range, joining a community, length of community membership)  Ability to combine multiple attributes into an airdrop\r\n- Ability to token gate airdrops\r\n- Live airdrop gas estimation when setting up airdrop\r\n\r\n**3. Token import functionality**\r\n- Ability for a community Owner to import ERC-20 and NFT tokens, to later be airdropped or retailed\r\n\r\n**4. Admin functionality enhancements**\r\n- Ability to mark a token gated channel as 'hidden', only visible to community members with the requisite tokens\r\n- optional service to once a month auto-kick all members who haven't been online for between 30 and 60 days (e.g. auto-kick members whose profile information like Name, Avatar, etc... can no longer be fetched)\r\n\r\n**5.

  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nRight now, the gif models are inside the `input_area` module. However, there is an `input_area` module created for each channel in the backend. That means that  we have the gif models multiple times in the backend.\r\n\r\nThis feels pretty useless, since there are few reasons to have a different state for each channel. The only thing that could differ is if you want to keep the search for the chat, but that's very minor.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it creates a a lot of useless memory usage, because each time you load a gif popup on  a different channel, we keep that model in memory. Also, we fetch the favorites, recents, etc. for each of them instead of reusing.",
