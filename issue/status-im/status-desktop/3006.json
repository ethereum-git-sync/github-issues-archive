    "body": "I've been testing this multiple times, an observation using newly created account each time is: \nWhen the app is starting CPU usage knows to reach 65%, but only for a few seconds, after that it drops to 15% and after like 10-15 seconds it normalizes itself and CPU usage varies between 7.5 and 10.5%. That's the case when nothing is added, just bare app is running (no chats, wallet, communities, dapp browser and so) and the app is an active window all the time. If I move the app to the background CPU usage drops to below 1% (like 0.3 - 0.5%) and moving it back to the foreground CPU usage easily increases to, as I mentioned, 7.5-10.5%.\n\nSo in any case I was not able to reach 20% of CPU usage (tested on BigSur, version 11.1, 2.6 GHz 6-Core Intel Core i7), but anyway average CPU usage of ~10% for an empty app is maybe too high.\n\nWith everything enabled and added two chats added (one public and one private) CPU in my case is ~15%.\n\nReasons for high CPU usage may be different:\n1. unoptimized code\n2. having some hard processing in the main thread\n3. nested updates (e.g. exposing property (which is a list of items) and exposing properties for that item, then when we need to update such architecture there is no need to send signal for each property of the item, it's enough when the data are set to emit just a single signal for the list property)\n4. resetting whole model instead of updating exact item from model\n5. we're running background logic and maintaining UI even it's not displayed (this is the case for all parts which are off by default like wallet, dapp browser, communities, activity center and so). Instead we should initialize that parts only if user turns them on (do sort of lazy initialization). That will reduce lot of CPU and memory usage, cause so far we initialize everything what app contains at the app start (like for any case) regardless we really need that or not.\n\nOne big obstacle is that we cannot use any profiler/analyzer like this: https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-cpu-usage-analyzer.html",

    "body": "Hey @flexsurfer , there is now a likely fix for this in PR #3081 but first I would like to provide some context for this and what to expect of CPU usage in different contexts:\r\n\r\nThe issue itself was introduced in this commit https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/commit/dc9de1968fb6924fedd962f8ec47371a7b8dbfa0 on march 25.\r\n\r\nLooking at activity monitor isn't very reliable sometimes as it can fluctuate a lot, the best is to look at the usage over a period of time, for that we created a script to measure this (can be found here https://gist.github.com/iurimatias/ae0896e3d54fd635d4baa773fc206d44 , very hacky but it works), and with it I could verify this issue was happening and this was the commit where the cpu usage definitely became much higher.\r\n\r\n**Before that commit**: average cpu usage: 2%  minimum 0.6%\r\n**After that commit**: average cpu usage: 12%  minimum 6.8%\r\n\r\n***now* with the fix on master/3081**: average cpu usage: 1.5% minimum 0%\r\n\r\nSo it's a definitive improvement. It's important to also understand the different situations (as the words 'idle' sometimes mean different things to different people depending on the context)\r\n\r\n* Background - app is completely in the background not selected\r\n* Foreground idle - app is in the foreground but the user is not doing anything at all\r\n* Foreground active - app is in the foreground and user is actively using it\r\n\r\n**Background**\r\n\r\nhere we're getting according to last I measured\r\n\r\n```\r\n{ cpu_per: 0.8899999999999989,\r\nmem_per: 2.300000000000005,\r\nvsz: 6190531.633333334,\r\nrss: 394075.1666666667,\r\ncpu_min: 0,\r\ncpu_max: 10.1\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Background Idle**\r\n\r\nSo the app is in the foreground but the user is not doing anything, so it's \"idle\"\r\n\r\n```\r\n{ cpu_per: 1.4983333333333326,\r\nmem_per: 2.300000000000005,\r\nvsz: 6190509.7,\r\nrss: 393817.8333333333,\r\ncpu_min: 0.6,\r\ncpu_max: 18.1 }\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Foreground active**\r\nHere I got these results, which are actually pretty good\r\n\r\n```\r\n{ cpu_per: 5.599166666666667,\r\n  mem_per: 2.400000000000001,\r\n  vsz: 6217631.5,\r\n  rss: 407376.93333333335,\r\n  cpu_min: 0.7,\r\n  cpu_max: 15.6 }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen an app is in use, it *will* use a lot more CPU, I verified **this happens with other apps as well so it is to be expected**\r\n\r\nfor example discord:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/176720/127223276-fbe84a79-de49-4219-abd7-63fd36833fc3.mov\r\n\r\ndiscord is electron so it kinda sucks, but even Telegram that is in C++/Qt has high usage with normal usage:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/176720/127223388-028c3518-833e-4cb8-9dcb-deca34f0aa7e.mov\r\n\r\nin our case I got this:\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/176720/127223423-3e73b2ca-39c2-42b0-87ef-a59137a9d641.mov\r\n\r\n",
