The channel doesn't change, no line appears in the logs, it's as if I had never clicked.\r\n\r\nIn the other community, everything works fine.\r\n\r\nRestarting the app the first time didn't help, but the issue disappeared the second time \"-.-\r\n\r\nUpon restart, I also got a notification from a several hours old message in a new channel (`spiffworkflow`) in the Status CC community. Just a hunch, but I think there was some blocking condition there.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/11161531/bc17e767-0428-4919-a789-bb8e3587b450\r\n\r\nLogs:\r\n[app_20230711_100500.log](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/files/12015036/app_20230711_100500.log)\r\n\r\n[geth.log.zip](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/files/12015040/geth.log.zip)\r\n\r\n",
