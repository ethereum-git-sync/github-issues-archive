New application version is released\r\n2. User gets a notification there is an update (already implemented)\r\n3. User clicks to download new version, a screen like the following should appear:\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2021-12-01 at 3 31 20 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/176720/144309466-b0501aeb-de41-423c-bf1f-62bab3f1b17f.png)\r\n\r\n4. clicking the `Get Status` button should download the binary for the new application\r\n\r\n**other notes**\r\n- since we know what OS the user is in, then that binary should already be the one appropriate for that platform\r\n\r\n### Open questions\r\n\r\nsome of the following is not well defined and/or is missing and could require clarification before starting the task:\r\n- What is the `'Check what's new` link, where would it link to and how could that data be updated\r\n- How problematic are translations here, what languages should be supported\r\n- Most users also want a sha256 file and this is missing here\r\n",
