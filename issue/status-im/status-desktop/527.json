  "body": "Suggested by @zah \r\n> A solution is to introduce an I/O thread that will run a separate message loop responsible for operations that may perform I/O and computational tasks without blocking the GUI thread. Then the workflow will be like this:\r\n> 1) User performs action\r\n> 2) Code running on the GUI threads decides to create a \"task\" for the I/O thread. The task is posted to something we call \"AsyncChannel\"\r\n> 3) A loop in the I/O thread receives the task from the AsyncChannel. It starts executing arbitrary code using the async/await paradign. Multiple such tasks can progress in parallel (similar to goroutines). \r\n> 4) Some of the tasks in the I/O thread perform network requests to the Status GO RPC service. These requests are handled in the Status Go thread. The results are awaited and handled back in the Nim I/O thread.\r\n> 5) Any such I/O or compute task can notify the UI for progress at any time by sending a Qt signal back to the UI thread.\r\n> With this setup, you'll have 3 long-running threads and you don't need to deal with spawning new ones. The ownership of all the data is well assigned to a thread and there are no gc safety issues ",
