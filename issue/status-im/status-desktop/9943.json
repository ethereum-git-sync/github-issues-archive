Improve performance**\r\n- Focus on eliminating any UI freezes when the user clicks on something and the app does not display an immediate response.  Target: the app should ideally respond to all user input within 50ms, but let's start with identifying the longest UI freezes and trying to fix the worst UI freezes first.\r\n- Speed and responsiveness of switching between community channels, and 1on1 and ad-hoc group chats is particularly important, especially for channels and chats that contains a lot of history.  We should aim for about 250ms delay in the *worst* case if possible.  Having a lot of history in a channel should not slow channel switching down.\r\n- DB perf optimisations.  \r\n- Move things to async and off main thread\r\n- See Alex's great profiling work for possible tasks (Alex to continue focusing on perf. for this release cycle)\r\n- \"user facing performance in everyday app usage\" is the top priority, but any task that improves performance is worthwhile\r\n\r\n**2. Finish development of token based functionality from 0.11**\r\n- Optimise No. queries made by owner node when checking member tokens (Pascal)\r\n- Community encryption should automatically switch on/off depending on community permissions (issue #9942)\r\n- Implement the 'Admin' role (issue #10114)\r\n- Airdrop to community members (in addition to addresses)\r\n- Optimise gas required by collectable minting smart contracts (issue #9943, GravityBlast)\r\n--- After collectable minting gas optimisation is complete, start work on Asset minting contracts (GravityBlast)\r\n- Complete token remote destruct UI\r\n- Remove 'Community Permissions Settings', 'Community Tokens' and 'Discord Import Tool' feature flags (issue #10115)\r\n- Thoroughly test, and fix all bugs found. \r\n- Anything else related to Community level token permissions, collectable minting, airdropping, and remote destructing that didn't make it into 0.11\r\n\r\n**3. Finish implementing the ability for Community Owners and Admins to drag and drop channels and categories into different orders**\r\n\r\n**4. Finish anything related to the initial pairing process for syncing that wasn't completed in 0.11** (Igor)\r\n\r\n**5. Improve Mutual Contacts functionality to improve reliability and pay off tech debt** (Mishka)\r\n\r\n**6. Complete Community Directory Curation dApp integration inc. Featured functionality** (Patryk)\r\n \r\n**7. Backend for the Profile Showcase**\r\n\r\n**8. Identity Verification** (required for 'Profile Showcase')\r\n\r\n**9. Fix bugs, bugs and more bugs!**\r\n- Esp. find the cause of and fix the longstanding bug of some 'requests to join' not arriving for hours/days after they were sent!\r\n- Many 'fit and finish' bugs for the UI team\r\n\r\n**--- For the Wallet team ---**\r\n\r\n1. Continue feature development inc. kicking off development of the activity screens\r\n2. 'All accounts' section.  The ability to return all tokens owned by the user in all accounts (excluding watch only accounts) is also required for the Showcase functionality\r\n3. Widen scope of 'backup to waku' and 'syncing' so that all relevant Wallet user state is backed up and synced between devices\r\n4. Continue to ensure Wallet functionality is performant.\r\n5. Fix wallet bugs",

  "body": "**This is an improvement for the 0.12 release**\r\n\r\n-- Change request --\r\n\r\n@jrainville recently mentioned that the NFT contract that a community owner deploys to mint a token via the community admin UI requires a lot of gas to deploy.\r\n\r\nThis issue is to optimise the contract to reduce the amount of gas needed to deploy the NFT contract.  \r\n\r\nOne approach could be to split the contract into multiple contracts.  Currently the UI lets users change the following contract settings prior to deployment:\r\n\r\n- soulbound/not soulbound\r\n- unlimited supply/specific finite supply\r\n- remotely destructible / not remotely destructible \r\n\r\nInstead of having one large contract that handles all these permutations, one optimisation idea would be to instead have a number of contracts, each optimised for a specific permutation e.g.\r\n\r\n1. A soulbound, unlimited supply, remotely destructible contract\r\n2. A soulbound, specific finite supply, remotely destructible contract\r\n3. A soulbound, unlimited supply, not remotely destructible contract\r\n4. A soulbound, specific finite supply, not remotely destructible contract\r\n5. A not soulbound, unlimited supply, remotely destructible contract\r\n6. A not soulbound, specific finite supply, remotely destructible contract\r\n7. A not soulbound, unlimited supply, not remotely destructible contract\r\n8. A not soulbound, specific finite supply, not remotely destructible contract\r\n\r\nAnd then depending on what options the community owner choses in the UI, a different contract would be deployed.  \r\n\r\nThis is just one idea for optimising the gas usage of our NFT contract, other changes that can also further reduce gas usage are also welcome :-)\r\n\r\ncc'ing @gravityblast @jrainville @iurimatias  ",
