Channel token permissions**\r\n- Create, edit and delete channel token permissions in the permissions admin screens\r\n- This includes the \"no tokens required to view this channel\" permission\r\n- All user facing channel token permissions functionality e.g. what happens when a user tries to access a token gated channel they don't have the required tokens to access, what happens when a user only has permissions to view a channel, etc...\r\n- If a community is an open (not token gated at the community level) community, if a channel is token gated AND if **no** \"no tokens required to view this channel\" permission for that channel exists, then the channel should be automatically encrypted.  If token gating is removed from a channel, the channel should become unencrypted.\r\n\r\n**3. DB perf improvements**\r\n- https://www.notion.so/Database-related-performance-1dbaa7ea894c461d885e55676683be07\r\n- Alex and Patryk to work on this, with help from Lukáš\r\n\r\n**4. Update app to use new 'Share URL' formats**\r\n- add functionality to status-go to generate the new 'Share URL' formats for sharing links to: User Profiles, Communities, Channel inside a Community (issue https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/10851)\r\n- Update everywhere a user can share a URL from to use the new URL format (issue https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/10852)\r\n- New/updated URL unroll designs for inside chat, including specific unrolls for the new User Profile, Community and Channel inside a Community URLs (issue https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/10585)\r\n- Ability to share a URL that points to a specific channel in a community (issue #10160)\r\n- Update all address inputs to accept a user pasting a 'share URL' into the input (in addition to being able to input the raw address).  This includes: Start new chat input, send contact request input in Settings, the import community key input, etc...\r\n- Update Status Desktops URL handler so that if Status is installed on a computer, when a user clicks on a Status 'Share URL' the app is launched (if not already running) and after signing in the user is automatically taken to the entity the Share URL represented inside the app.  e.g. if a user clicks on a URL for a Status Community, the user should be taken to the home screen for that community inside the Status App\r\n\r\n**5. Mint Assets functionality**\r\n- Also includes some small improvements to the mint Collectables functionality\r\n- Noelia, GravityBlast\r\n\r\n**6. Profile showcase backend**\r\n\r\n\r\n**--- For the Wallet team ---**\r\ntldr; continue building out Ben's wallet designs\r\n\r\n1.

  "body": "**This is an improvement for the 0.12 release**\r\n\r\n-- Change request --\r\n\r\n@jrainville recently mentioned that the NFT contract that a community owner deploys to mint a token via the community admin UI requires a lot of gas to deploy.\r\n\r\nThis issue is to optimise the contract to reduce the amount of gas needed to deploy the NFT contract.  \r\n\r\nOne approach could be to split the contract into multiple contracts.  Currently the UI lets users change the following contract settings prior to deployment:\r\n\r\n- soulbound/not soulbound\r\n- unlimited supply/specific finite supply\r\n- remotely destructible / not remotely destructible \r\n\r\nInstead of having one large contract that handles all these permutations, one optimisation idea would be to instead have a number of contracts, each optimised for a specific permutation e.g.\r\n\r\n1. A soulbound, unlimited supply, remotely destructible contract\r\n2. A soulbound, specific finite supply, remotely destructible contract\r\n3. A soulbound, unlimited supply, not remotely destructible contract\r\n4. A soulbound, specific finite supply, not remotely destructible contract\r\n5. A not soulbound, unlimited supply, remotely destructible contract\r\n6. A not soulbound, specific finite supply, remotely destructible contract\r\n7. A not soulbound, unlimited supply, not remotely destructible contract\r\n8. A not soulbound, specific finite supply, not remotely destructible contract\r\n\r\nAnd then depending on what options the community owner choses in the UI, a different contract would be deployed.  \r\n\r\nThis is just one idea for optimising the gas usage of our NFT contract, other changes that can also further reduce gas usage are also welcome :-)\r\n\r\ncc'ing @gravityblast @jrainville @iurimatias  ",

    "body": "A few thoughts:\r\nProbably we can't manipulate smart contracts because we need to keep OpenZeppelin implementation in order to work correctly with OpenSea, and other vendors. We need to keep standards.\r\nWe can optimize smart contract compilation, however then we need to check: deployment cost and all other operations cost (airdrop, burning), because optimisation has impact on them.\r\nA sensible approach is to make such optimization in the end when we have all functionalities implemented. Then we can compare costs.\r\nDeployment on Optimism is not so expensive.",
