Parsing shared url with ens name should ask mailservers for a contact by ENS name\r\n\r\nRight now, we support passing a chat key, but we need to support an ENS name as well as per https://github.com/vacp2p/rfc/pull/602#discussion_r1213035855\r\n\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n- Activating a deep link with an ENS name should:\r\n  - open 1-1 chat with the user with that user if they are mutual contact\r\n  - open user profile if they are **not** mutual contact (only if this one is implemented first https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/10892)\r\n",

But we can make a crutch on the client side: if `/u` is not followed by `zQ3sh`, we can parse the url in nim and request pubkey from ENSService. Is a desktop-side crutch not as scary as a status-go crutch? :)",
