  "body": "QT's SystemTrayIcon's `showNotification` and `messageClicked` are very limited and don't give any context of which notification is clicked.\r\n\r\nThat was \"fixed\" in DOtherside by passing a notification identifier and we generate the OS notification manually. That caused issues with Windows and made the tray icon unusable.\r\nI decided to revert that for Windows, because having a working tray icon is more important than having the click on notification go to the right channel (this PR https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/pull/8507).\r\n\r\nThis issue is better saved for when we move to QT 6 so as not to duplicate the work.\r\n\r\nThe work needed would be to patch QT (either with a fork or by submitting a PR to their code) and enable those two functions above to take an ID.
