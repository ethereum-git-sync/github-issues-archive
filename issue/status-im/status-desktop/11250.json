Token permissions to enable control of community smart contracts**\r\n- Before a community founder can use any of the community token admin functionality, they first have to deploy Owner and Token Master contracts.\r\n- This work involves: new empty state screen for Mint and Airdrop tokens (before current empty state screen is revealed), new flow for deploying the community's Owner and Token Master contracts in a single step, a fixed uneditable permission giving anybody who holds the Token Master token admin rights for the community should be automatically created.\r\n- Only the holder of the single Owner token can access the Token Master airdrop, remote destruct, and view holders functions. Anybody who holds the Token Master token can access all token admin options, excluding those related to the Token Master token itself, as well as being and Admin of the community.\r\n- This will all be explained in more detail in the designs.\r\n\r\nBackend Epic: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11249\r\n\r\n**2. Updates to control node transfer and associated dialogues**\r\n- Remove ability for a Owner to leave a community on the computer that's running as that community's control node\r\n- Community Admin home screen cleanup (inc. adding at least one of the three graphs, whichever is easiest to implement).\r\n  - Graph issue: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11152  \r\n  - Community overview: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11278\r\n\r\n**3. Ability for user to select & manage accounts shared with each community control node**\r\n- This item is quite a bit of work\r\n- Touches Community settings, as well as all of the community join flows\r\n- Backend issues: \r\n  - Join API: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11154\r\n  - Edit API: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11153\r\n\r\n**4. Encryption for token gated channels that are inside Open (not token gated) communities**\r\n[#10998](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/10998)\r\n\r\n**5. Final screens and bits and bobs needed prior to public beta**\r\n- Modal that's shown every time after login, reminding user's that Status Desktop is in Beta [#11044](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11044)\r\n- The bug with 'requests to join' a community not constantly arriving, or sometimes arriving after a delay, must be fixed. [#8264](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/8264)\r\n- Anything that didn't get completed in 0.13 related to new share URL format\r\n- All the outstanding bugs and small items that got pushed into the 0.14 milestone.\r\n\r\n**6. Profile showcase backend**\r\n- The long-delayed profile showcase backend!  We have the UI on the desktop ready to go for this feature, and Mobile is going to need the backend for this feature as well, so let's try to get it done in 0.14 [#11081](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11081)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**--- Things that we SHOULD NOT work on during the 0.14 cycle ---**\r\n- Messaging and UI teams shouldn't work on perf. in 0.14 (but Wallet team should!)\r\n- Anything big mutual contacts related, other than fixing small bugs we find like #10497 #10498 #11120 #11121  (hopefully this functionality working good enough now!)\r\n\r\n**--- Wallet Team ---**\r\n\r\n1. Finish any outstanding work related to Activity screens (top priority - aim to have complete by July 14th)\r\n\r\n2. Updated Wallet Settings screens UI inc. account syncing functionality  *Synced information should immediately be reflected in the UI after it is received (sometimes synced info is currently only displayed after the next app restart, this needs to be fixed)*\r\n\r\n3. Wallet performance and memory consumption optimisations\r\n\r\n4. Fix bugs, clean up loose ends (to get things in a good state before the work on the Mobile wallet starts)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nPart of https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11249\r\n\r\nImplement the backend to mint the TokenMaster and Owner tokens.\r\n\r\nDesigns for reference: https://www.figma.com/file/17fc13UBFvInrLgNUKJJg5/Kuba%E2%8E%9CDesktop?node-id=33640%3A574386&mode=dev\r\n\r\nThe important parts are the settings. Those should be hard-coded in the backend when deploying (they can **not** be edited by the user):\r\n- Owner token:\r\n  - Name: `OWN` + 3 first letters of the community (in caps)\r\n  - Image: Community's logo + little crown in the bottom right corner. The color is the color of the community\r\n  - 1 total\r\n  - 1 available\r\n  - Is transferable\r\n  - Not destructible\r\n  - Is automatically \"airdropped\" to the community owner (the user minting)\r\n- TokenMaster token:\r\n  - Name: `TM` + 3 first letters of the community (in caps)\r\n  - Image: Community's logo + little token icon in the bottom right corner. The color is the color of the community\r\n  - Infinite supply\r\n  - Infinite available\r\n  - Not transferable (soulbound)\r\n  - Destructible by the owner\r\n  - None are airdropped at first\r\n\r\nSimilarly to the other deploys, the owner can select the network and the account with which to deploy. Do note that the account chosen to deploy with is the account that will have the minted Owner token.\r\n\r\nIf the deployment fails at any of the step, the whole thing is canceled. We do not want a state when the owner token deployed and not the TokenMaster token.\r\n\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n- The status-go backend to deploy the TokenMaster and Owner token is available\r\n- The Nim code to call the status-go api is there too and reports the success or failure\r\n- There is one Owner token minted to the owner along with the deploy\r\n- Follows the hard-coded setting above\r\n\r\n",
