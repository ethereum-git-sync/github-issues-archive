This allows the user to at a glance see which accounts are related\r\n\r\n<img width=\"841\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4670881/179222087-825c1154-3515-43ea-a1db-0f00d6716bd5.png\">\r\n\r\nhttps://www.figma.com/file/idUoxN7OIW2Jpp3PMJ1Rl8/branch/G1GVE21KLEWwBwT1uK6IIh/%E2%9A%99%EF%B8%8F-Settings-%7C-Desktop?node-id=1009%3A108126\r\n\r\n### In the future\r\n\r\nIn the future the user may want to migrate the account to another location, and we should cover those flows from here (e.g. `Moving Account 1 to keycard, will also move Account 3 and 4`). At that point, the origin of these accounts becomes very important",
