I deleted the Status folder and installed this release build: https://ci.infra.status.im/job/status-desktop/job/release/job/release%2F0.15.x/14/\r\n2. Recovered my user from the seed phrase\r\n\r\nResult: empty account.\r\nThere were many contacts and communities there, including the Status CC community, but now there's nothing there.\r\n\r\nI tried to recover the same user on mobile (on release as well), and all communities and contacts were restored from waku.\r\nAfter that, I tried to perform a backup on mobile, and then restore the user again on desktop, but it didnâ€™t work.\r\n\r\nSome other users faced the same issue before. Ping @pavloburykh and @VolodLytvynenko for more details if needed. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Delete the Status folder from your machine\r\n2. Install Status Desktop \r\n3. Recover your user with seed phrase\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\nCommunities and contacts are restored\r\n\r\n#### Actual behavior\r\nNo communities and contacts\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n- Status desktop version: https://ci.infra.status.im/job/status-desktop/job/release/job/release%2F0.15.x/14/\r\n- Operating System: MacBook pro, Ventura 13.6.1, Intel \r\n\r\n",

If you select \"New to Status\", it makes no sense to try to fetch data for that account, since it's completely new.\r\n\r\nAs for the difference between mobile and desktop, I agree that we should resolve it.\r\n\r\nI don't have hard opinions on whether it should be mobile adopting the Desktop design of having new vs old user, or Desktop adopting the mobile way of old user only using Pairing.\r\n\r\nOn one hand, I agree that if you already have Status, using Pairing is 100% better than seed phrase, however, if you did lose your other device, or your account got deleted or corrupted, you might not have the option to pair, so using the seed phrase to recover the data is nice.\r\n\r\nI guess it's important in that case to make the options clear to the user, so they know what to expect.\r\n",

    "body": "@qoqobolo the difference between:\r\n1. `I am new to Status` and \r\n2. `I already use Status` \r\n\r\nis that for the first option if you provide a seed phrase we assume that the seed phrase was generated somewhere else and the user has never before associated that seed phrase with the Status app. \r\n\r\nThe second option (`I already use Status`) should be used to sync from the other device (if the user has it) and only in case the user really doesn't have another device (lost it) should go to the step to recover the data using seed phrase or keycard.\r\n\r\nOf course user may use an already used seed phrase in the first case as well as a new seed phrase (generated out of the Status app) in the second case, but those are not the cases we are taking care of and we cannot guarantee for the data consistency in those cases cause we don't have a central server to check if that seed phrase was associated with the Status app before or not.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if the user provided a seed phrase that was already used in the Status app for the first flow, we don't fetch backed-up data in that case. So it looks like the user has created a brand new Status account using the wanted seed phrase. In the second case if:\r\n- data are fully fetched the user proceeds to the app and all good, has everything he had before, \r\n- data are partially fetched (the profile-related data are mandatory) other data can be fetched and applied later when they arrive (if not changed locally, cause in that case those will be the newest valid data)\r\n- data are not fetched then you have an option to create a new Status account using a previously used seed phrase, but it would look like you followed the first option, providing a known seed phrase. \r\n\r\nSome reasons why data are not fetched could be:\r\n- there is no backed-up data for the seed phrase\r\n- there is no data for the seed phrase on the nodes the user is connected to\r\n\r\nOne more thing we should be aware of is if we use the \"old\" seed phrase, following the first option (`I am new to Status` onboarding flow) after you log in to the app, the backup can be created with an empty app state (no contacts, no communities, no wallet accounts...) that will make that backup the most recent one and any previously backed up data won't be considered as valid after that if you try to recover using that seed phrase.\r\n\r\nOfc at the end it might be some bug in the desktop app code, but the way to check if the recovering feature works or not is:\r\n- create a brand new Status account (seed phrase that was not used before)\r\n- add some wallet accounts, contacts... basically any details we're backing up\r\n- for the dev builds we should have \"Backup data\" available on the Settings/Syncing screen and click it\r\n- then remove the local Status folder and try to recover using the seed phrase you are sure you have backed up the data for\r\n- if all is recovered then the feature works (and we can assume that in some cases waku doesn't send data for other seed phrases, where the reasons might be one of the two above-mentioned) if not, then we have an issue on the desktop app side.",

    "body": "Hey @saledjenic, thanks for the detailed explanation! It was good to get deeper insights into how this feature works.\r\nBut the difference between `I am new to Status` and `I already use Status` flows (in terms of restoring data) is already clear to me. \r\n\r\nWhat I'm still concerned about is that we have the difference between _mobile_ and _desktop_ in these flows.\r\n\r\n**Desktop:**\r\nyou can choose either `I am new to Status` or `I already use Status` and there will be the option to use your seed phrase (with the difference you described above)\r\n\r\n**Mobile:**\r\n- if you choose `I am new to Status` you can create a brand new account OR you can use your \"old\" seed phrase _and your backed up data will be restored_;\r\n- if you choose `I already use Status` **you can only sync your device with another one** (no option to use your seed)\r\n\r\nAnd in fact, both approaches make sense, but I think it also makes sense to discuss whether we need this difference in the functionality. \r\n\r\nPerhaps @John-44 might also have some thoughts on this matter. Please take a look at this whenever you have spare time (starting from [this comment](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/12797#issuecomment-1819212822)). ",
