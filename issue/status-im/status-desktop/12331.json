  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nThe QML Storybook app has been adopted to the daily basis UI development. It speeds up both creating new components and maintenance existing ones and also fosters better isolation. However there is no good mechanism to prevent from regressions. There is automatic checker for Storybook pages but it validates only if given page is compilable.\r\n\r\nTo address that problem the idea is to allow defining qml unit tests directly in the Storybook's pages or provide other mechanism of close integration of storybook and unit tests. An argument in favor of this solution is the fact that Storybook provides a stub mechanism and many mock models that could be easily reused in unit tests.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this task is to collect ideas and explore possibilities. \r\n",

    "body": "On second thought, I'm not sure if nesting `TestCase {}` directly in the page is a good idea. Tests tend to be long, containing hundreds lines of repetitive code. Storing it inside pages - where the main intention is to present the component's functionality with it's all states, may be too much and not very beneficial. Additionally within pages are usually connected to some additional switches or models.\r\n\r\nHowever Storybook could automatically detect tests related to given page via naming convention.\r\nE.g. for `StatusInput.qml` we have `StatusInputPage.qml` in Storybook's `page` directory. Storybook could look for corresponding `tst_StatusInput.qml` file and allow to run it directly from Storybook.\r\nHot reloading could be used to re-run tests for given page whenever there are changes detected (in test file or or anywhere else).\r\nMoreover, if the tests were run directly from the Storybook thread, they could be easily debugged from within QtCreator.",
