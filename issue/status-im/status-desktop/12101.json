    "body": "> Ok so it seems likely the idea is that the right click menu is the intended way to invite users, can you confirm if that's the case @benjthayer\r\n\r\nCorrect. The community admin overview screen was cleaned up and the CTA to invite user removed given the user can invite people to the community in other ways including right-clicking the Community name, community icon, channel area and accessing the share link when selecting `View community` when right-clicking the Community icon in the left side App/Community bar. Personally, I think we would benefit from a menu accessed by the Community name much like Discord has where a user could access notification settings, invite people etc but for now, this is the design intent yes. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.figma.com/file/qHfFm7C9LwtXpfdbxssCK3/Kuba%E2%8E%9CDesktop---Communities?type=design&node-id=2771-384218&mode=design&t=8SsfD1Yqvy4e6hqQ-4",
