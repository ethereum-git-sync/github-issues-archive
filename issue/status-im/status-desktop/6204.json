We need to keep tech. debt at a roughly fixed level as we grow out functionality, can't let it accumulate! ;-)\r\n\r\n**2. Complete initial airdrop functionality**\r\n- Airdrop history screens\r\n- Ability to airdrop based on in-Community activity (No. of msg, No. msg in time range, joining a community, length of community membership)  Ability to combine multiple attributes into an airdrop\r\n- Ability to token gate airdrops\r\n- Live airdrop gas estimation when setting up airdrop\r\n\r\n**3. Token import functionality**\r\n- Ability for a community Owner to import ERC-20 and NFT tokens, to later be airdropped or retailed\r\n\r\n**4. Admin functionality enhancements**\r\n- Ability to mark a token gated channel as 'hidden', only visible to community members with the requisite tokens\r\n- optional service to once a month auto-kick all members who haven't been online for between 30 and 60 days (e.g. auto-kick members whose profile information like Name, Avatar, etc... can no longer be fetched)\r\n\r\n**5. QR scanner**\r\n- Needed for private key transfer\r\n- Ethereum key QRs (send modal triggered)\r\n- User Share URL in a QR (opens user profile dialogue) \r\n- Community and Channel inside Community URL in QRs (takes user to Community or Channel in Community)\r\n\r\n**6. Chat functionality enhancements**\r\n- Introduce @channel as a new type of global @ mention.  This @ mention only @ mention's everyone who has posted a message in a channel in the last 30 days \r\n\r\n**7. Binaries over Waku**\r\n- Improve transfer of binaries over waku via splitting into chunks https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/9923\r\n- Posting of small files (max size somewhere in the region of 1 to 2mb).
