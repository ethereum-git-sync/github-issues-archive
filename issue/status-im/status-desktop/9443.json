Token permissions to enable control of community smart contracts**\r\n- Before a community founder can use any of the community token admin functionality, they first have to deploy Owner and Token Master contracts.\r\n- This work involves: new empty state screen for Mint and Airdrop tokens (before current empty state screen is revealed), new flow for deploying the community's Owner and Token Master contracts in a single step, a fixed uneditable permission giving anybody who holds the Token Master token admin rights for the community should be automatically created.\r\n- Only the holder of the single Owner token can access the Token Master airdrop, remote destruct, and view holders functions. Anybody who holds the Token Master token can access all token admin options, excluding those related to the Token Master token itself, as well as being and Admin of the community.\r\n- This will all be explained in more detail in the designs.\r\n\r\n**2. Updates to control node transfer and associated dialogues**\r\n- Remove ability for a Owner to leave a community on the computer that's running as that community's control node\r\n- Community Admin home screen cleanup (inc. adding at least one of the three graphs, whichever is easiest to implement).  \r\n\r\n**3. Ability for user to select & manage accounts shared with each community control node**\r\n- This item is quite a bit of work\r\n- Touches Community settings, as well as all of the community join flows\r\n\r\n**4. Encryption for token gated channels that are inside Open (not token gated) communities**\r\n- Assigned to Patryk?\r\n\r\n**5. Final screens and bits and bobs needed prior to public beta**\r\n- Modal that's shown every time after login, reminding user's that Status Desktop is in Beta\r\n- The bug with 'requests to join' a community not constantly arriving, or sometimes arriving after a delay, must be fixed.\r\n- Anything that didn't get completed in 0.13 related to new share URL format\r\n- All the outstanding bugs and small items that got pushed into the 0.14 milestone.\r\n\r\n**6. Profile showcase backend**\r\n- The long-delayed profile showcase backend!  We have the UI on the desktop ready to go for this feature, and Mobile is going to need the backend for this feature as well, so let's try to get it done in 0.14\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**--- Things that we SHOULD NOT work on during the 0.14 cycle ---**\r\n- Messaging and UI teams shouldn't work on perf. in 0.14 (but Wallet team should!)\r\n- Anything mutual contacts related, other than #10497 #10498 (hopefully this functionality working good enough now!)\r\n- Community Channel drag and drop (assuming this is now working!)\r\n\r\n**--- Wallet Team ---**\r\n\r\n1. Finish any outstanding work related to Activity screens (top priority - aim to have complete by July 14th)\r\n\r\n2. Updated Wallet Settings screens inc. account syncing functionality  *Synced information should immediately be reflected in the UI after it is received (sometimes synced info is currently only displayed after the next app restart, this needs to be fixed)*\r\n\r\n3. Fix bugs, clean up loose ends (to get things in a good state before the work on the Mobile wallet starts)\r\n\r\n4. Total balance graphs for 'All accounts' and each individual account\r\n\r\n5. Advanced transaction signing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

  "body": "### Description\n\nSend Modal has one of the most complex user workflows in the wallet module; hence the implementation is also complex and has grown organically. Even though it has already substantially improved, with this epic, we look into how to improve it even more\n\n### Prototyping\n\nInconveniences\n\n- Working with Send Modal requires starting the APP, waiting for tokens update, and having multiple accounts with different values to cover many cases, which is slow and error-prone.\n\nImprovement brainstorming\n\n- Add an abstraction layer based on the current MVC implementation and integrate it with Story-Book\n  - This might require extensive work but can be done in steps using multiple facades and be finalized later on after MVP\n  - I should improve a lot by refactoring and covering multiple use cases without depending on network requests and manual setup\n\n### Layouting\n\nInconsistencies\n\n- The main content is resized by [StackLayout](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/blob/46d4193bbdd4a993088a8bc91ebdc47944fe9105/ui/imports/shared/popups/SendModal.qml#L170) but can't see any usage for it (switching between multiple items)\n- Some items have hardcoded sizes and don't adapt, e.g. [TokenListView](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/blob/46d4193bbdd4a993088a8bc91ebdc47944fe9105/ui/imports/shared/views/TokenListView.qml#L41)\n- Layout hints follow the parent's size, e.g. [group1 ColumnLayout](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/blob/46d4193bbdd4a993088a8bc91ebdc47944fe9105/ui/imports/shared/popups/SendModal.qml#L177)\n  - Defeats the purpose of size hints\n\nSome first steps were started [with #9414 fix](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/pull/9414)\n\nImprovement brainstorming\n\n- Switch the main layout simple layout (ColumnLayout?) that takes size hints from the content (impicitWidth/implicitHeight)\n- The underlying dialog implementation will adjust the size based on the layout's hints.\n  - The dialog also has some size limitations, therefore have the main layout fill parent and follow these limits.\n  - All items inside should offer size hints (preferred, min or max) and adapt to (layouts should work ok here)\n- Scrollable content should be scrollable if the content doesn't fit the requirements.\n  - e.g. `interactive: contentWidth > width`\n- Follow contributing guidelines [Positioning and sizing(https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/blob/46d4193bbdd4a993088a8bc91ebdc47944fe9105/ui/StatusQ/src/contributing.md#L44) and [Layouts](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/blob/46d4193bbdd4a993088a8bc91ebdc47944fe9105/ui/StatusQ/src/contributing.md#L85)\n\n\n\n\n\nSome more improvements that can also be moved out of this task and created as a separate task  are defined below , most of them involve moving logic from the UI to the BE (nim)\n\n1. When sending request the last request should be executed only\n2. Cards should not be greyed out when loading is on going\n3. Moving disabled and preferred chains ui state to him and make it more reliable?\n4. Calculating entered address and giving it colours can be done on him sideâ€¨handling usage of modal for send, ens and stickers and bridge can be simplified further",
