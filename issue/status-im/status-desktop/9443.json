  "body": "### Description\n\nSend Modal has one of the most complex user workflows in the wallet module; hence the implementation is also complex and has grown organically. Even though it has already substantially improved, with this epic, we look into how to improve it even more\n\n### Prototyping\n\nInconveniences\n\n- Working with Send Modal requires starting the APP, waiting for tokens update, and having multiple accounts with different values to cover many cases, which is slow and error-prone.\n\nImprovement brainstorming\n\n- Add an abstraction layer based on the current MVC implementation and integrate it with Story-Book\n  - This might require extensive work but can be done in steps using multiple facades and be finalized later on after MVP\n  - I should improve a lot by refactoring and covering multiple use cases without depending on network requests and manual setup\n\n### Layouting\n\nInconsistencies\n\n- The main content is resized by [StackLayout](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/blob/46d4193bbdd4a993088a8bc91ebdc47944fe9105/ui/imports/shared/popups/SendModal.qml#L170) but can't see any usage for it (switching between multiple items)\n- Some items have hardcoded sizes and don't adapt, e.g. [TokenListView](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/blob/46d4193bbdd4a993088a8bc91ebdc47944fe9105/ui/imports/shared/views/TokenListView.qml#L41)\n- Layout hints follow the parent's size, e.g. [group1 ColumnLayout](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/blob/46d4193bbdd4a993088a8bc91ebdc47944fe9105/ui/imports/shared/popups/SendModal.qml#L177)\n  - Defeats the purpose of size hints\n\nSome first steps were started [with #9414 fix](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/pull/9414)\n\nImprovement brainstorming\n\n- Switch the main layout simple layout (ColumnLayout?) that takes size hints from the content (impicitWidth/implicitHeight)\n- The underlying dialog implementation will adjust the size based on the layout's hints.\n  - The dialog also has some size limitations, therefore have the main layout fill parent and follow these limits.\n  - All items inside should offer size hints (preferred, min or max) and adapt to (layouts should work ok here)\n- Scrollable content should be scrollable if the content doesn't fit the requirements.\n  - e.g. `interactive: contentWidth > width`\n- Follow contributing guidelines [Positioning and sizing(https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/blob/46d4193bbdd4a993088a8bc91ebdc47944fe9105/ui/StatusQ/src/contributing.md#L44) and [Layouts](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/blob/46d4193bbdd4a993088a8bc91ebdc47944fe9105/ui/StatusQ/src/contributing.md#L85)\n\n\n\n\n\nSome more improvements that can also be moved out of this task and created as a separate task  are defined below , most of them involve moving logic from the UI to the BE (nim)\n\n1. When sending request the last request should be executed only\n2. Cards should not be greyed out when loading is on going\n3. Moving disabled and preferred chains ui state to him and make it more reliable?\n4. Calculating entered address and giving it colours can be done on him sideâ€¨handling usage of modal for send, ens and stickers and bridge can be simplified further",
