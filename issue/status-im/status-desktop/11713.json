Here are some ideas\r\n- before backuping/syncing do a verification that we do not backup/sync unsigned CommunityDescription\r\n- do not keep unsigned CommunityDescription (this will require on each community request from db to restore the current state and track that we never save or backup/sync restored community)\r\n- if it is unsigned - take CommunityDescription from the `EventData` struct (we keep here CommunityDescription on top of which the first event was generated)\r\n\r\nWould be nice to have some discussion and find the solution, but we will need some person who is familiar with the backuping/syncing code in order to understand pros and cons of this or those solutions",
