Here are some ideas\r\n- before backuping/syncing do a verification that we do not backup/sync unsigned CommunityDescription\r\n- do not keep unsigned CommunityDescription (this will require on each community request from db to restore the current state and track that we never save or backup/sync restored community)\r\n- if it is unsigned - take CommunityDescription from the `EventData` struct (we keep here CommunityDescription on top of which the first event was generated)\r\n\r\nWould be nice to have some discussion and find the solution, but we will need some person who is familiar with the backuping/syncing code in order to understand pros and cons of this or those solutions",

    "body": "> * do not keep unsigned CommunityDescription (this will require on each community request from db to restore the current state and track that we never save or backup/sync restored community)\r\n\r\nI am opting for that option. As I've been saying from the start, we shouldn't store unsigned `CommunityDescription` message in the database. This not only causes syncing issues but I also believe it can lead to problems in various scenarios. I haven't tested this, but I am pretty sure that sharing community won't work if we have unsigned `CommunityDescription` in the database. We use `ShareCommunity` when inviting users to the community. AFAIK admins can invite users to the community. Consider the following stack trace:\r\n```\r\ncommunity.ToBytes\r\nsendChatMessage\r\nSendChatMessage\r\nSendChatMessages\r\nShareCommunity\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf an admin sends an unsigned `CommunityDescription`, it will fail on the receiver's end, thus preventing users from viewing the invitation.\r\n\r\n> I wonder if instead of backing up all the community description, we should just back up the id, then fetch it?\r\n\r\nThat's a good idea. It could also be applied to the `ShareCommunity` logic, i.e. instead of sharing whole `CommunityDescription` we could just share the id. With that in place, we wouldn't need to store signed `CommunityDescription` in the database anymore.",
