Here are some ideas\r\n- before backuping/syncing do a verification that we do not backup/sync unsigned CommunityDescription\r\n- do not keep unsigned CommunityDescription (this will require on each community request from db to restore the current state and track that we never save or backup/sync restored community)\r\n- if it is unsigned - take CommunityDescription from the `EventData` struct (we keep here CommunityDescription on top of which the first event was generated)\r\n\r\nWould be nice to have some discussion and find the solution, but we will need some person who is familiar with the backuping/syncing code in order to understand pros and cons of this or those solutions",

    "body": "> For now, I see only 1 corner case: If the control node will lost his community key or will be offline - the community won't be backuped.

In my understanding - the community must have the possibility to \"live\" even if the control node is \"dead\" :) But I can be wrong\r\n\r\nIn theory, once the control node comes back online or just sends an updated version, the member would update to the latest. \r\n\r\nThe same corner case could happen with the current backup. If the member was last online one week ago, did a backup and then re-syncs, they'll have a week old community description. They'll need the new one.  \r\n\r\nAs for the community being able to live when the control node is dead, that is true, up to a certain point. It should be the case for small periods of time, but if the control node never comes back online, the community is basically doomed, because no new users can join, the history archive will stop working and even the ratchet keys will stop to be rotated.\r\n\r\nSo as for this particular corner case, I think my solution is ok.",

    "body": "> * do not keep unsigned CommunityDescription (this will require on each community request from db to restore the current state and track that we never save or backup/sync restored community)\r\n\r\nI am opting for that option. As I've been saying from the start, we shouldn't store unsigned `CommunityDescription` message in the database. This not only causes syncing issues but I also believe it can lead to problems in various scenarios. I haven't tested this, but I am pretty sure that sharing community won't work if we have unsigned `CommunityDescription` in the database. We use `ShareCommunity` when inviting users to the community. AFAIK admins can invite users to the community. Consider the following stack trace:\r\n```\r\ncommunity.ToBytes\r\nsendChatMessage\r\nSendChatMessage\r\nSendChatMessages\r\nShareCommunity\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf an admin sends an unsigned `CommunityDescription`, it will fail on the receiver's end, thus preventing users from viewing the invitation.\r\n\r\n> I wonder if instead of backing up all the community description, we should just back up the id, then fetch it?\r\n\r\nThat's a good idea. It could also be applied to the `ShareCommunity` logic, i.e. instead of sharing whole `CommunityDescription` we could just share the id. With that in place, we wouldn't need to store signed `CommunityDescription` in the database anymore.",
