    "description": "**1. Finish anything that wasn't completed in the previous 0.14 cycle**\r\n\r\n- And fix bugs as usual. We need to keep tech. debt at a roughly fixed level as we grow out functionality, can't let it accumulate! ;-)\r\n\r\n**2. Tokenisation of community ownership**\r\n\r\n- Work needed already evaluated in spike.  Community and 'Channel in a Community' URLs don't need to be signed if this will present problems. Patryk to work on this as a continuation of the spike already done.\r\n- See priority 4 below, as this also has some implications for the tokenisation of community work.\r\n\r\n**3. Profile showcase backend**\r\n- The long-delayed profile showcase backend!  We have the UI on the desktop ready to go for this feature, and Mobile is going to need the backend for this feature as well, so let's try to get it done in 0.14 [#11081](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11081)\r\n\r\n**4. Community tokens visible in wallet when received by user who is not a member of that community**\r\n- Solution obvs. needs to be fully decenteralised and permissionless\r\n- Perhaps whenever a community token is A) sent from a Status Wallet to another user or B) airdropped by a community or C) retailed by a community, a M2M (invisible to the user) Waku message should be sent to the recipient's *ethereum address*?\r\n- This message could either: A) contain the metadata for the token B) tell the user that they have received token, and to check the metadata in either another Waku channel where Control Nodes periodically post Metadata OR check the metadata embedded in the token contract (embedding metadata in the token contract might be a better idea?).  \r\n- The token metadata stored in the token contract is signed by the Community's private key to ensure authenticity.  When the community's private key changes due to ownership of a community being transferred or due to the control node being moved, a transaction must be made to update this metadata so it is signed by the community's new private key.\r\n- See here for how a Waku message can be sent to and Ethereum address https://rfc.vac.dev/spec/20/\r\n\r\n**5. Complete initial airdrop functionality**\r\n- Airdrop history screens\r\n- Ability to airdrop based on in-Community activity (No. of msg, No. msg in time range, joining a community, length of community membership)  Ability to combine multiple attributes into an airdrop\r\n- Ability to token gate airdrops\r\n- Live airdrop gas estimation when setting up airdrop\r\n\r\n**6. Token import functionality**\r\n- Ability for a community Owner to import ERC-20 and NFT tokens, to later be airdropped or retailed\r\n\r\n**7. Admin functionality enhancements**\r\n- Ability to mark a token gated channel as 'hidden', only visible to community members with the requisite tokens\r\n- optional service to once a month auto-kick all members who haven't been online for between 30 and 60 days (e.g. auto-kick members whose profile information like Name, Avatar, etc... can no longer be fetched)\r\n\r\n**8. QR scanner**\r\n- Needed for private key transfer\r\n- Ethereum key QRs (send modal triggered)\r\n- User Share URL in a QR (opens user profile dialogue) \r\n- Community and Channel inside Community URL in QRs (takes user to Community or Channel in Community)\r\n\r\n**9. Chat functionality enhancements**\r\n- Introduce @channel as a new type of global @ mention.  This @ mention only @ mention's everyone who has posted a message in a channel in the last 30 days \r\n- Introduce the ability to search the users in the right side members/users bar.  At the same time, make any adaptations needed so that the right side members/users bar can scale to 10,000 users.\r\n\r\n\r\n**--- Wallet Team ---**\r\n\r\n1. Sending Community created tokens to Status users who are not members of that community\r\n- See priority 4) in the messaging priorities list above.\r\n\r\n2. Send NFT functionality\r\n\r\n3.

    "body": "Hey @borismelnik @John-44 \r\n\r\nI've added an example of a pinned message which includes a gallery of images in situ of both the main chat area and the pinned messages dialog.\r\n\r\nInside the pinned messages dialog, we remove any independent image and link interactions - so clicking anywhere on the gallery message inside that dialog (including on an image) should cause the dialog to close and the user to be auto-scrolled to the relevant message in situ. (This is how it works now anyway - we can always revisit if we agree we want to allow light-boxing of images and links to be clickable globally for pinned messages)\r\n\r\nBoth designs (the gallery message inside the chat and that inside the dialog) are essentially the same.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"Pinned message - edit\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/110033914/9fd1cf93-c1d8-4f62-8638-bbd4661d1ffc\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"Pinned message with image gallery\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/110033914/4b8b3ab4-f5d2-449c-aa34-d11e1016a3a4\">\r\n\r\nFigma links (`Chat | Desktop` Figma file):\r\nhttps://www.figma.com/file/Mr3rqxxgKJ2zMQ06UAKiWL/%F0%9F%92%AC-Chat%E2%8E%9CDesktop?type=design&node-id=21982-657117&t=D998NtlASOPeLoyb-4\r\n\r\nhttps://www.figma.com/file/Mr3rqxxgKJ2zMQ06UAKiWL/%F0%9F%92%AC-Chat%E2%8E%9CDesktop?type=design&node-id=21982-655449&t=D998NtlASOPeLoyb-4\r\n\r\nCaybro has done a lot of work on pinned messages recently following the below issue so might be worth giving him a ping to see if there is anything that can be leveraged as a basis :)\r\nhttps://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/9396#issuecomment-1412364116\r\n\r\n",
