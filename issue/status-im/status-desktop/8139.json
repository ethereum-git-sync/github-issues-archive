    "body": "On my Windows laptop (a nice laptop, but 3 years old), using the 0.9 release CPU usage hovers around a very reasonable 1.5% to 2% most of the time.    Sometimes it goes down to 0.9%, and sometimes up as high as 2.8% (window visible but not in focus) which is very reasonable and absolutely fine.  For me, memory consumption is around 1.8 to 2.2 gig, which while high-ish is perfectly usable for a windows laptop with 16gb ram.  This is all using Windows 10.\r\n\r\nSo I think Status Desktop's CPU perf. and memory resource issues are very much OSX specific (or m1 Arm specific?) as resource usage when running Status Desktop on an x86 laptop with Windows 10 is fine.",

    "body": "@John-44 @iurimatias The high CPU consumption is reproducible when using an account with Status community. But I think we can lower the priority and not sure it's a blocker. The MacOs Activity monitor will show the CPU usage/Core. This is different than Windows Task Manager where it will show the overall CPU usage. A 50% CPU usage reported on an 8 core Mac is equivalent to 6.25% overall CPU consumption reported on 8 core Windows. It a bit is higher than on Windows, but pretty close (the average I've been experiencing is around 35%/core).\r\n\r\nI've been profiling the CPU usage while the app is in the background and about 90% of the app CPU usage is used by `status-go`. @richard-ramos @0x-r4bbit Do you think it's normal for status-go to constantly use CPU on the following call stack?\r\n<img width=\"1449\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-03-02 at 11 49 08\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47811206/222393324-2d55ce5b-ae59-4bd8-b410-f1ecf20fd002.png\">\r\n\r\nThis is the profiling data reported by `Instruments`, but I think a Mac is needed to open it:\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1rBLe1zAteGHYIBNiIGdqtzYxz2YrmP9E/view?usp=sharing",

It's consuming both CPU and memory.\r\n@richard-ramos I've seen you logged in a go issue on it (https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48437).
