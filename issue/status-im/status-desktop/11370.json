Tokenisation of community ownership**\r\n- Work needed already evaluated in spike.  Community and 'Channel in a Community' URLs don't need to be signed if this will present problems. Patryk to work on this as a continuation of the spike already done.\r\n- See priority 4 below, as this also has some implications for the tokenisation of community work.\r\n\r\n**3. Profile showcase backend**\r\n- The long-delayed profile showcase backend!  We have the UI on the desktop ready to go for this feature, and Mobile is going to need the backend for this feature as well, so let's try to get it done in 0.14 [#11081](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11081)\r\n\r\n**4. Community tokens visible in wallet when received by user who is not a member of that community**\r\n- Solution obvs. needs to be fully decenteralised and permissionless\r\n- Perhaps whenever a community token is A) sent from a Status Wallet to another user or B) airdropped by a community or C) retailed by a community, a M2M (invisible to the user) Waku message should be sent to the recipient's *ethereum address*?\r\n- This message could either: A) contain the metadata for the token B) tell the user that they have received token, and to check the metadata in either another Waku channel where Control Nodes periodically post Metadata OR check the metadata embedded in the token contract (embedding metadata in the token contract might be a better idea?).  \r\n- The token metadata stored in the token contract is signed by the Community's private key to ensure authenticity.  When the community's private key changes due to ownership of a community being transferred or due to the control node being moved, a transaction must be made to update this metadata so it is signed by the community's new private key.\r\n- See here for how a Waku message can be sent to and Ethereum address https://rfc.vac.dev/spec/20/\r\n\r\n**5. Discord history import into a single channel in an existing community**\r\n- Pay off any Discord history import service tech. debt first\r\n- Then build the import into a single channel functionality, designs for this are already complete\r\n\r\n**6. UI for community owner to enable manual Waku static shading for their community**\r\n- This will be off by default in 0.15\r\n- This UI is only for the Owner of a community (not TokenMasters or Admins)\r\n- Figma designs are here https://www.figma.com/file/qHfFm7C9LwtXpfdbxssCK3/Kuba%E2%8E%9CDesktop---Communities?type=design&node-id=37242%3A222352&mode=design&t=rw6q6NQYmiz3rSn2-1\r\n\r\n**7. Community chat functionality enhancements**\r\n- Ability to mark a token gated channel as 'hidden', only visible to community members with the requisite tokens\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**--- Wallet Team ---**\r\n\r\n1.

  "body": "Nowadays, anyone with access to a community's private key is considered a control node. To import a community, one needs to transfer this private key across clients, which is problematic for many reasons.\r\n\r\nCommunity ownership should be tokenized, i.e., bound to the owner of the Owner Token. To accomplish this, community updates should be signed not by the community's private key, but by the signer specified by the holder of the Owner Token.\r\n\r\n- How is community ownership transferred?\r\nTransfer the Owner Token to another account. Once this account receives the Owner Token, it needs to set a new signer using `ownerToken.setSigner(...)`.\r\n- How do clients know who the signer of the community updates should be?\r\nIf the community has an Owner Token assigned, then the signer is identified by `ownerToken.getSigner()`. If not, the signer is the community itself.\r\n- Why is the concept of `setSigner/getSigner` necessary? Couldn't we simply check the signature against the holder of the Owner Token?\r\nThis concept enables the establishment of a control node without needing to import the wallet containing the Owner Token.\r\n- How can clients trust the Owner Token address bound to a given community?\r\nThe Owner Token must be deployed by the community address and only the first deployment is valid. This is to prevent malicious owners from deploying multiple Owner Tokens with potentially harmful intentions in the future. Furthermore, the contract's bytecode will be provided by Status and must be validated by clients.\r\n- How will Status provide the contract's bytecode?\r\nThe contract's bytecode will be deployed within the official status-go repository.\r\n\r\nTasks:\r\n- [x] [Community Ownership] extend Owner Token contract with `setSigner/getSigner` API\r\n- [x] #11954\r\n- [x] #11956\r\n- [x] #11957\r\n- [x] #11958\r\n- [x] #11964\r\n- [x] #11963\r\n- [x] #11961\r\n- [x] #11962\r\n- [x] #11969\r\n- [ ] #11974\r\n- [x] #11945\r\n- [ ] #12175\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/12656\r\n- [ ] Have a QA test the Epic as a whole\r\n\r\nSpikes:\r\n- [x] #11371\r\n\r\nThings that may be affected and need to be checked:\r\n- ~~new URL format, is the data signed with community's private key?
