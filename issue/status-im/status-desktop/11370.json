  "body": "Nowadays, anyone with access to a community's private key is considered a control node. To import a community, one needs to transfer this private key across clients, which is problematic for many reasons.\r\n\r\nCommunity ownership should be tokenized, i.e., bound to the owner of the Owner Token. To accomplish this, community updates should be signed not by the community's private key, but by the signer specified by the holder of the Owner Token.\r\n\r\n- How is community ownership transferred?\r\nTransfer the Owner Token to another account. Once this account receives the Owner Token, it needs to set a new signer using `ownerToken.setSigner(...)`.\r\n- How do clients know who the signer of the community updates should be?\r\nIf the community has an Owner Token assigned, then the signer is identified by `ownerToken.getSigner()`. If not, the signer is the community itself.\r\n- Why is the concept of `setSigner/getSigner` necessary? Couldn't we simply check the signature against the holder of the Owner Token?\r\nThis concept enables the establishment of a control node without needing to import the wallet containing the Owner Token.\r\n- How can clients trust the Owner Token address bound to a given community?\r\nThe Owner Token must be deployed by the community address and only the first deployment is valid. This is to prevent malicious owners from deploying multiple Owner Tokens with potentially harmful intentions in the future. Furthermore, the contract's bytecode will be provided by Status and must be validated by clients.\r\n- How will Status provide the contract's bytecode?\r\nThe contract's bytecode will be deployed within the official status-go repository.\r\n\r\nTasks:\r\n- [ ] extend Owner Token contract with `setSigner/getSigner` API\r\n- [ ] deploy Owner Token through community address\r\n- [ ] obtain first deployed Owner Token and get the signer\r\n- [ ] validate Owner Token contract against known bytecode\r\n- [ ] enable community updates to be signed by anyone\r\n\r\nSpikes:\r\n- [x] #11371",
