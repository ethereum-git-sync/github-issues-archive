We want to remove all the others.\r\n\r\nIf the master setting is turned off, all unfurlings will stop working then.\r\n\r\nAll the code references to those individual settings can be removed. The whitelist array/object can probably be deleted too.\r\n\r\n#### Out of scope\r\n\r\n- the new setting for senders\r\n- removing the status-go code for the whitelist (this issue is only for the Desktop code)\r\n- no need for a migration to clean the DB or the QT settings\r\n\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n- The Messaging settings page now only has the \"Display Message Link Previews\" settings and none of the other individual site settings\r\n- Disabling that master setting makes all unfurlings stop\r\n- The settings code is removed from the different files\r\n\r\n",
