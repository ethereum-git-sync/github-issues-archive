    "body": "A beginning of this task was done here https://github.com/status-im/nim-status-client/pull/965\r\nbut it seems like we'll need to update the Registry on Windows and make a call as root on Linux, which can be a problem for us, since we do not have a real installer. We just unzip the app where needed and run it.\r\n\r\nOne possibility would be to have button in the app the first time you run it where once pressed, asks your for elevated privileges, once we get those, we can update the registry or equivalent on other OS, then the user can close the app and reopen.\r\n\r\nAnother issue I faced is that I don't know how to **not** open a new instance of the app when calling the protocol URl. Right now, I can use the URI to open the app and go to the right channel, but if the app is already opened, it will open the app another time, which is not wanted.\r\n\r\nOther apps like Discord open the wanted channel in the same app, but I'm not sure how they do it. I looked at QT's documentation and Windows' one and couldn't find a real solution.\r\n\r\nOne possibility I thought of would be to have a file descriptor next to the app executable that when the app is opened, it starts watching the file descriptor and when a URI is called, it calls a bash script or something that sets the file descriptor to the URI, which procs an event in the already opened app, otherwise we open a new app. (docs for SocketNotifier https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qsocketnotifier.html#details)\r\n\r\nIt's probably not the standard way to do it, but like I said, I couldn't find a standard way.\r\n\r\nHopefully, you are someone with experience with desktop app and protocol URIs and can lend a hand 😄 ",

This EIP is a bit more complex because there was more parameters that can be passed through the url, but nothing too difficult.\r\n\r\nEither way, you're right, it would be done through another issue.
