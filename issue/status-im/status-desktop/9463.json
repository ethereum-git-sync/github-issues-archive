    "description": "Priorities **in priority order** for the 0.12 milestone:  \r\n\r\n**1. Improve performance**\r\n- Focus on eliminating any UI freezes when the user clicks on something and the app does not display an immediate response.  Target: the app should ideally respond to all user input within 50ms, but let's start with identifying the longest UI freezes and trying to fix the worst UI freezes first.\r\n- Speed and responsiveness of switching between community channels, and 1on1 and ad-hoc group chats is particularly important, especially for channels and chats that contains a lot of history.  We should aim for about 250ms delay in the *worst* case if possible.  Having a lot of history in a channel should not slow channel switching down.\r\n- DB perf optimisations.  \r\n- Move things to async and off main thread\r\n- See Alex's great profiling work for possible tasks (Alex to continue focusing on perf. for this release cycle)\r\n- \"user facing performance in everyday app usage\" is the top priority, but any task that improves performance is worthwhile\r\n\r\n**2. Finish development of token based functionality from 0.11**\r\n- Optimise No. queries made by owner node when checking member tokens (Pascal)\r\n- Community encryption should automatically switch on/off depending on community permissions (issue #9942)\r\n- Implement the 'Admin' role (issue #10114)\r\n- Airdrop to community members (in addition to addresses)\r\n- Optimise gas required by collectable minting smart contracts (issue #9943, GravityBlast)\r\n--- After collectable minting gas optimisation is complete, start work on Asset minting contracts (GravityBlast)\r\n- Complete token remote destruct UI\r\n- Remove 'Community Permissions Settings', 'Community Tokens' and 'Discord Import Tool' feature flags (issue #10115)\r\n- Thoroughly test, and fix all bugs found. \r\n- Anything else related to Community level token permissions, collectable minting, airdropping, and remote destructing that didn't make it into 0.11\r\n\r\n**3. Finish implementing the ability for Community Owners and Admins to drag and drop channels and categories into different orders**\r\n\r\n**4. Finish anything related to the initial pairing process for syncing that wasn't completed in 0.11** (Igor)\r\n\r\n**5. Improve Mutual Contacts functionality to improve reliability and pay off tech debt** (Mishka)\r\n\r\n**6. Complete Community Directory Curation dApp integration inc. Featured functionality** (Patryk)\r\n \r\n**7. Backend for the Profile Showcase**\r\n\r\n**8. Identity Verification** (required for 'Profile Showcase')\r\n\r\n**9. Fix bugs, bugs and more bugs!**\r\n- Esp. find the cause of and fix the longstanding bug of some 'requests to join' not arriving for hours/days after they were sent!\r\n- Many 'fit and finish' bugs for the UI team\r\n\r\n**--- For the Wallet team ---**\r\n\r\n1. Continue feature development inc. kicking off development of the activity screens\r\n2. 'All accounts' section.  The ability to return all tokens owned by the user in all accounts (excluding watch only accounts) is also required for the Showcase functionality\r\n3. Widen scope of 'backup to waku' and 'syncing' so that all relevant Wallet user state is backed up and synced between devices\r\n4. Continue to ensure Wallet functionality is performant.\r\n5. Fix wallet bugs",

DMs that do not arrive until a day later or after a restart\r\n2. Messages in chats that arrive later and appear in the history, sometimes changing the context of a message sent in multiple parts.\r\n3. In a group chat, having members of the group chat not being able to see messages from 1 or more parties while the rest of the users can see everyone's.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Send DM and ask recipient if they can see it straight away\r\n2. Observe messages after a restart or simply arriving later and being inserted into the history of the previous day\r\n3. Chat with a group and confirm if all members can see each message\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nMessages arrive in a timely manner\r\n\r\n#### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe arrival time of the messages is unpredictable from the UI\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n- Status desktop version: 0.10.0 RC3\r\n- Operating System: Mac\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "> Fix ability to receive messages from not mutual contacts (maybe with additional rules)\r\n\r\nWe used to have a mechanism to get the first 1-1 message from a user as a message in the activity center. Maybe it was removed from designs or maybe we just lost it? @John-44 do you know? IMO, it can still be useful in those cases where someone lost their mutual contacts without knowing. That way, they can receive an AC notification from contact X and realize that they are no longer a contact.\r\n\r\n> Ensure that current contact requests mechanism works properly\r\n\r\nOtherwise, I think \"Ensure that current contact requests mechanism works properly\" is still important to fix. Right now, it seems a little broken. If you lose your contacts, you can still chat with the person, but it should be blocked. I know we've had a couple of issues where the \"blurb\" with the hand image was showing inappropriately, but people could still write. It should be that we show that \"blurb\" and image + button to add contact when you are not mutual and also disable the input.\r\nLet me see if I find the design for that.\r\nedit: I can't find it :shrug: \r\n\r\n> Mutual contacts recovery\r\n\r\nAs for \"Mutual contacts recovery\", that would obviously be a good solution, but it's not that simple. We already have some other efforts on this anyway, so don't bother with it.",
