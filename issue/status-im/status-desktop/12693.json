So wondering what is a use case where the user can generate accounts one after another without providing an account name that the app needs to auto-generate names for them?\r\n\r\nThanks @saledjenic , it's just a way of populating the name field so the user can progress without being blocked in the account creation flow. The user might want to add multiple accounts just to see how they all look in the UI when they first join Status and then go back to edit the names when they know what they want to do with those accounts later. Naming them `Account 1, 2, 3` etc is just a simple and common convention for this but open to other ideas of course :)",
