  "body": "# Bug Report\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThe function `buildTokensAndCollectibles` from the communities module is called a lot when you start the app and it is sync, so it can freeze the app a little.\r\n\r\nThe reason why it is called so much is that we trigger it each time the wallet tokens are rebuilt (that's just once), and also when `eventCollectiblesOwnershipUpdateFinished` is received. It should also be done once, but somehow it is received multiple times.\r\n\r\nThere are multiple solutions that are not mutually exclusive:\r\n- make `getCommunityTokens` async. This is not easy, because `buildTokensAndCollectibles` expects it to be sync at the moment\r\n- Split the community part from the normal tokens\r\n  - Call the communityToken part only when the communities are loaded and when we receive a specific call that a new community token was added\r\n  - We then need to update the model smartly, probably by having a `clean` function that removes only the tokens of a certain type.\r\n- Check if the update on collectible actually makes sense\r\n  - I don't think we even add the collectibles from our wallet in the list (but maybe we should and it's a bug)\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nJust open the app and see how much `wakuext_getCommunityTokens` is called\r\nI also had two wallet accounts and one community with permissions (no special tokens)\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n`buildTokensAndCollectibles` is only called once at the start\r\n\r\n#### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n`buildTokensAndCollectibles` is called multiple times\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n- Status desktop version: master `0405ea0b892a13aab02d9a58a8830abe8210a5f5`\r\n- Operating System: Ubuntu 20\r\n\r\n",
