  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nStart of the backend work for the permissions.\r\n\r\nHere is the Figma design: https://www.figma.com/file/17fc13UBFvInrLgNUKJJg5/Kuba%E2%8E%9CDesktop?node-id=2934%3A480020&t=vSq2M0qiqm2EG3Qh-0\r\n\r\n**Important**: the goal of this task is **not** to implement the Figma above, but rather to prepare the backend that will hook into that front-end.\r\n\r\nTo this end, you can use a placeholder front-end with only a button saying \"Add Basic SNT Permission\" that will add that permission to the community in the backend and propagate it.\r\n\r\nBasically, the backend should have the new properties to accept permissions, but we can start with only SNT. \r\nSo it would require that users must have 1 SNT (on testnet to start) to be able to join.\r\nNo need to implement the periodic checking of the users on the admin side yet.\r\nOnly add the permission and make sure it is propagated to users. No need to implement the blocking on the user side yet, it will be done in another task.\r\n\r\nWhen doing the backend, make sure to make the API and Permission Objects extendable so they can later support all the customization seen in the Figma above. Feel free to talk to Alisher and Andrea for more info on the feature design (Alisher) and on the best way to implement it (Andrea).\r\nFor questions about contracts, you can ask Michal and Andrea Franz.\r\n\r\nBetter to make small increments so we can have people look at it fast and soon, so no work is wasted. Feel free to add TODOs for anything that is out of scope of the basic feature, but will be extended.\r\n\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. Admin has a button that can be clicked that adds the \"Needs to have 1 SNT to join this community\"\r\n2. Once that button is clicked, that permission is saved in the community (DB) and shared to other users who also save it\r\n    - The other users will not yet have the UI for that, but we can do a log with a TODO to prove that it works\r\n3. When the permission is there, the Admin has access to the opposite button to remove the permission\r\n4. Once the Remove  button is clicked, the same happens as in step 2, but the permission is removed\r\n\r\n",
