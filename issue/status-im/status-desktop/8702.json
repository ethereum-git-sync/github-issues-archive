Finish items started in 0.12**\r\n- Complete any outstanding issues related to pairing (for syncing) - Igor\r\n- Implement the 'Admin' role (issue #10114) - Mykhailo\r\n- Any remaining work to pay off tech. debt related to mutual contacts - Mishka\r\n- When creating/editing token based permission, ability to search for and selecting Collectables from OpenSea - MichaelC\r\n\r\n**2. Channel token permissions**\r\n- Create, edit and delete channel token permissions in the permissions admin screens\r\n- This includes the \"no tokens required to view this channel\" permission\r\n- All user facing channel token permissions functionality e.g. what happens when a user tries to access a token gated channel they don't have the required tokens to access, what happens when a user only has permissions to view a channel, etc...\r\n- If a community is an open (not token gated at the community level) community, if a channel is token gated AND if **no** \"no tokens required to view this channel\" permission for that channel exists, then the channel should be automatically encrypted.  If token gating is removed from a channel, the channel should become unencrypted.\r\n\r\n**3. DB perf improvements**\r\n- https://www.notion.so/Database-related-performance-1dbaa7ea894c461d885e55676683be07\r\n- Alex and Patryk to work on this, with help from Lukáš\r\n\r\n**4. Update app to use new 'Share URL' formats**\r\n- add functionality to status-go to generate the new 'Share URL' formats for sharing links to: User Profiles, Communities, Channel inside a Community (issue https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/10851)\r\n- Update everywhere a user can share a URL from to use the new URL format (issue https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/10852)\r\n- New/updated URL unroll designs for inside chat, including specific unrolls for the new User Profile, Community and Channel inside a Community URLs (issue https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/10585)\r\n- Ability to share a URL that points to a specific channel in a community (issue #10160)\r\n- Update all address inputs to accept a user pasting a 'share URL' into the input (in addition to being able to input the raw address).  This includes: Start new chat input, send contact request input in Settings, the import community key input, etc...\r\n- Update Status Desktops URL handler so that if Status is installed on a computer, when a user clicks on a Status 'Share URL' the app is launched (if not already running) and after signing in the user is automatically taken to the entity the Share URL represented inside the app.  e.g. if a user clicks on a URL for a Status Community, the user should be taken to the home screen for that community inside the Status App\r\n\r\n**5. Mint Assets functionality**\r\n- Also includes some small improvements to the mint Collectables functionality\r\n- Noelia, GravityBlast\r\n\r\n**6. Profile showcase backend**\r\n\r\n\r\n**--- For the Wallet team ---**\r\ntldr; continue building out Ben's wallet designs\r\n\r\n1. Complete any outstanding development related to the activity screens\r\n2. All accounts overview screens\r\n3. New settings screens\r\n4. Implement 'imported key and account' syncing and transfer between devices\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Here's a theory on what's happening, which I've now confirmed:\r\n\r\n1. Anthony sends contact request to other account\r\n2. This will create a local `contact` with the properties `added: true`, `hasAddedUs: false` (which is an outgoing request essentially)\r\n3. Time goes by, and the backup routine kicks in. That account is now being backed-up\r\n4. At some point after that, but before the second backup kicks in, that other account confirms the contact request\r\n5. The local contact on Anthony's node is now `added true`, `hasAddedUs: true` -> a mutual contact\r\n6. Now Anthony wipes out his Status folder, and reimports his account into a new instance\r\n7. Upon account recovery, his node will receive backedup data and recovers his contacts. \r\n8. Because the backedup data doesn't have the latest state, the recovered account shows up as outgoing pending contact request.\r\n9. The other party still has Anthony as a contact, flagged as `added: true`, hasAddedUs: true`\r\n\r\nThe result is the issue Anthony is experiencing.\r\nThis one is a tricky case. Reimporting a seedphrase should not be considered a day-to-day activity and is considered an edge case. However, I think it's still worth exploring solutions on getting higher chances that the backed up data is more up to date.\r\n\r\nIn this particular case, what we could do, is whenever we receive a contact request response, we back up our contact data.\r\n\r\nIt's a similar problem to what I've described in https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/8702#issuecomment-1359276117 and really boils down to whether we're willing to preform backups in certain events or not.\r\n\r\n@cammellos @John-44 How do you feel about this?

    "body": "That's tricky indeed. IMO we should ensure once the \"relevant event\" is received we eventually sync our data before the app is closed. This would minimize the risk of data inconsistency.\r\n\r\nTo keep the network bandwidth low we should probably use some [Debounce](https://reactivex.io/documentation/operators/debounce.html) mechanism instead of performing a backup for every \"relevant event\". Example:\r\n```\r\nfunc handleContactRequest() {\r\n    ...\r\n    backup.debounce() // ensure backup is performed before app is closed, but not more often than once per specified interval\r\n}\r\n```\r\ncall `backup.debounce()` in every \"relevant event\".\r\n\r\nAnother, very naive solution, would be to keep the \"dirty\" state of the backup and perform backup just once before the app is closed. It has a drawback though, as it may block the app just before it is closed.\r\n```\r\nfunc handleContactRequest() {\r\n    ...\r\n    backup.makeDirty()\r\n}\r\nfunc beforeAppExit() {\r\n   if (backup.isDirty()) {\r\n       backup.perform() // blocking\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```",

    "body": "we should generally move away from backing up eagerly since it's a high cost for the network and doesn't scale, in situations like this it's better to be eventually consistent, we can piggyback for example contact information in ACK and message responses, so that state will eventually be restored.\r\n\r\nFor example, in a case like this one, we could on restore resend a contact request to pending contacts and they could carry back information on whether we have been added already in the ACK (that's just an extra byte).\r\n\r\nWe should look for more solutions like the above (for sure there are better), low bandwidth, low reliance on mailservers, rather than increasing dependency on mailservers, until we have a better way to store data.",
