    "description": "Priorities **in priority order** for the 0.12 milestone:  \r\n\r\n**1. Improve performance**\r\n- Focus on eliminating any UI freezes when the user clicks on something and the app does not display an immediate response.  Target: the app should ideally respond to all user input within 50ms, but let's start with identifying the longest UI freezes and trying to fix the worst UI freezes first.\r\n- Speed and responsiveness of switching between community channels, and 1on1 and ad-hoc group chats is particularly important, especially for channels and chats that contains a lot of history.  We should aim for about 250ms delay in the *worst* case if possible.  Having a lot of history in a channel should not slow channel switching down.\r\n- DB perf optimisations.  \r\n- Move things to async and off main thread\r\n- See Alex's great profiling work for possible tasks (Alex to continue focusing on perf. for this release cycle)\r\n- \"user facing performance in everyday app usage\" is the top priority, but any task that improves performance is worthwhile\r\n\r\n**2. Finish development of token based functionality from 0.11**\r\n- Optimise No. queries made by owner node when checking member tokens (Pascal)\r\n- Community encryption should automatically switch on/off depending on community permissions (issue #9942)\r\n- Implement the 'Admin' role (issue #10114)\r\n- Airdrop to community members (in addition to addresses)\r\n- Optimise gas required by collectable minting smart contracts (issue #9943, GravityBlast)\r\n--- After collectable minting gas optimisation is complete, start work on Asset minting contracts (GravityBlast)\r\n- Complete token remote destruct UI\r\n- Remove 'Community Permissions Settings', 'Community Tokens' and 'Discord Import Tool' feature flags (issue #10115)\r\n- Thoroughly test, and fix all bugs found. \r\n- Anything else related to Community level token permissions, collectable minting, airdropping, and remote destructing that didn't make it into 0.11\r\n\r\n**3. Finish implementing the ability for Community Owners and Admins to drag and drop channels and categories into different orders**\r\n\r\n**4. Finish anything related to the initial pairing process for syncing that wasn't completed in 0.11** (Igor)\r\n\r\n**5. Improve Mutual Contacts functionality to improve reliability and pay off tech debt** (Mishka)\r\n\r\n**6. Complete Community Directory Curation dApp integration inc. Featured functionality** (Patryk)\r\n \r\n**7. Backend for the Profile Showcase**\r\n\r\n**8. Identity Verification** (required for 'Profile Showcase')\r\n\r\n**9. Fix bugs, bugs and more bugs!**\r\n- Esp. find the cause of and fix the longstanding bug of some 'requests to join' not arriving for hours/days after they were sent!\r\n- Many 'fit and finish' bugs for the UI team\r\n\r\n**--- For the Wallet team ---**\r\n\r\n1. Continue feature development inc. kicking off development of the activity screens\r\n2. 'All accounts' section.  The ability to return all tokens owned by the user in all accounts (excluding watch only accounts) is also required for the Showcase functionality\r\n3. Widen scope of 'backup to waku' and 'syncing' so that all relevant Wallet user state is backed up and synced between devices\r\n4. Continue to ensure Wallet functionality is performant.\r\n5. Fix wallet bugs",

    "body": "Here's a theory on what's happening, which I've now confirmed:\r\n\r\n1. Anthony sends contact request to other account\r\n2. This will create a local `contact` with the properties `added: true`, `hasAddedUs: false` (which is an outgoing request essentially)\r\n3. Time goes by, and the backup routine kicks in. That account is now being backed-up\r\n4. At some point after that, but before the second backup kicks in, that other account confirms the contact request\r\n5. The local contact on Anthony's node is now `added true`, `hasAddedUs: true` -> a mutual contact\r\n6. Now Anthony wipes out his Status folder, and reimports his account into a new instance\r\n7. Upon account recovery, his node will receive backedup data and recovers his contacts. \r\n8. Because the backedup data doesn't have the latest state, the recovered account shows up as outgoing pending contact request.\r\n9. The other party still has Anthony as a contact, flagged as `added: true`, hasAddedUs: true`\r\n\r\nThe result is the issue Anthony is experiencing.\r\nThis one is a tricky case. Reimporting a seedphrase should not be considered a day-to-day activity and is considered an edge case. However, I think it's still worth exploring solutions on getting higher chances that the backed up data is more up to date.\r\n\r\nIn this particular case, what we could do, is whenever we receive a contact request response, we back up our contact data.\r\n\r\nIt's a similar problem to what I've described in https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/8702#issuecomment-1359276117 and really boils down to whether we're willing to preform backups in certain events or not.\r\n\r\n@cammellos @John-44 How do you feel about this?

    "body": "That's tricky indeed. IMO we should ensure once the \"relevant event\" is received we eventually sync our data before the app is closed. This would minimize the risk of data inconsistency.\r\n\r\nTo keep the network bandwidth low we should probably use some [Debounce](https://reactivex.io/documentation/operators/debounce.html) mechanism instead of performing a backup for every \"relevant event\". Example:\r\n```\r\nfunc handleContactRequest() {\r\n    ...\r\n    backup.debounce() // ensure backup is performed before app is closed, but not more often than once per specified interval\r\n}\r\n```\r\ncall `backup.debounce()` in every \"relevant event\".\r\n\r\nAnother, very naive solution, would be to keep the \"dirty\" state of the backup and perform backup just once before the app is closed. It has a drawback though, as it may block the app just before it is closed.\r\n```\r\nfunc handleContactRequest() {\r\n    ...\r\n    backup.makeDirty()\r\n}\r\nfunc beforeAppExit() {\r\n   if (backup.isDirty()) {\r\n       backup.perform() // blocking\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```",
