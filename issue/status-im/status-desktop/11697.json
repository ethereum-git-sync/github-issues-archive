  "body": "# Bug Report\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\n @vpavlin is having a weird case where he didn't open the app in a long while (more than a month), then he had to re-import using his seed phrase on a new computer.\r\n\r\nWhen he imported the community using the community link, he could see himself in the member list on the right, but the community was asking him request to join anyway.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if we have a bug where re-importing an account makes it so you don't auto-join a community or it's because it's been too long and he doesn't have the ratchet key.\r\n\r\nMaybe this is normal, because it's an encrypted community and you don't have access to any of the keys? I guess pairing would solve that? cc @igor-sirotin @osmaczko \r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n0. Be part of a community that has request to join and is encrypted (has a permission)\r\n1. close that account\r\n2. (optional) don't use the app for a month (lol)\r\n3. re-import that account in another instance\r\n4. Import the community using its link\r\n5. Spectate the community\r\n\r\nCheck if it auto-joins\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nIt auto joins?\r\n\r\n#### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nYou see yourself in the list, but you need to request to join\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n- Status desktop version: 0.13.2\r\n\r\n",
