    "body": "After review with John, the final decision was to implement the original design intent.\r\n\r\nThat is: when a user types their message, hitting enter, should automatically create the chat and send the message to the recipients currently in the To: field. When doing so, the 'To' input field and Confirm/Reject buttons should be removed.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to disable the input. The user hitting enter on the message is effectively them confirming the current state of the recipient/members and sending the message.\r\n\r\nThe only time the user cannot send a message is when they have not yet selected their first member/recipient - which makes sense as you have no-one to send the message to yet.\r\n",
