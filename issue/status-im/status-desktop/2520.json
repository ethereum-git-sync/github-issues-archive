  "body": "Hello \r\nFirst thank you for status.\r\nEverything works fine except for notification.\r\nPlease send notification to `notify-send` on Linux.\r\nThat way the users can config their notification the way they like through notifier app like [dunst](https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst)\r\n\r\nFor some reason that I cant explain I dont get any notification on my lappy but I do on my desktop.\r\nThis is very strange since both devices run the same OS :/\r\nHowever, the notification that I do have on the desktop does disappear like 5 sec after. Thats useless!\r\n\r\nI wouldnt have any issue if status would send notification to `notify-send`\r\nMy dunst is configured to keep notification up until I click on it. Therefore I cant miss any messages ;)\r\n\r\nThanks!",
