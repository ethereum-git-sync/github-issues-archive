We need to keep tech. debt at a roughly fixed level as we grow out functionality, can't let it accumulate! ;-)\r\n\r\n**2. Tokenisation of community ownership**\r\n- Work needed already evaluated in spike.  Community and 'Channel in a Community' URLs don't need to be signed if this will present problems. Patryk to work on this as a continuation of the spike already done.\r\n- See priority 4 below, as this also has some implications for the tokenisation of community work.\r\n\r\n**3. Profile showcase backend**\r\n- The long-delayed profile showcase backend!  We have the UI on the desktop ready to go for this feature, and Mobile is going to need the backend for this feature as well, so let's try to get it done in 0.14 [#11081](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11081)\r\n\r\n**4. Community tokens visible in wallet when received by user who is not a member of that community**\r\n- Solution obvs. needs to be fully decenteralised and permissionless\r\n- Perhaps whenever a community token is A) sent from a Status Wallet to another user or B) airdropped by a community or C) retailed by a community, a M2M (invisible to the user) Waku message should be sent to the recipient's *ethereum address*?\r\n- This message could either: A) contain the metadata for the token B) tell the user that they have received token, and to check the metadata in either another Waku channel where Control Nodes periodically post Metadata OR check the metadata embedded in the token contract (embedding metadata in the token contract might be a better idea?).  \r\n- The token metadata stored in the token contract is signed by the Community's private key to ensure authenticity.  When the community's private key changes due to ownership of a community being transferred or due to the control node being moved, a transaction must be made to update this metadata so it is signed by the community's new private key.\r\n- See here for how a Waku message can be sent to and Ethereum address https://rfc.vac.dev/spec/20/\r\n\r\n**5. Refactor synchronisation of contacts**\r\n- To fix various contact request issues, is a large work item\r\n- Mishka and Igor to work on this?\r\n- https://github.com/status-im/status-go/issues/3720\r\n- https://github.com/status-im/status-go/issues/3803#issuecomment-1654588500\r\n\r\n**6. Discord history import into a single channel in an existing community**\r\n- Pay off any Discord history import service tech. debt first\r\n- Then build the import into a single channel functionality, designs for this are already complete\r\n\r\n**7. Community chat functionality enhancements**\r\n- Ability to mark a token gated channel as 'hidden', only visible to community members with the requisite tokens\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**--- Wallet Team ---**\r\n\r\n1. Sending Community created tokens to Status users who are not members of that community\r\n- See priority 4) in the messaging priorities list above.\r\n\r\n2. Send NFT functionality\r\n\r\n3.

    "body": "@John-44 - me and @endulab had a small discussion about that task. It turns out that it may be problematic to detect particular types of errors bc they all comes as strings with some sentences describing the problem. What we can do is to parse that and categorize by using some heuristics. However when underlying text is changed, it gets broken easily. One option, proposed by @endulab is to present original message (e.g. in some tooltip) when user wants to know details related to the error. The drawback is that it would be always English.",

    "body": "@micieslak @endulab thanks for looking into this!  \r\n\r\nI agree that the better option as proposed by @endulab would be to present the original error message as this would be more robust.  However could the original message be displayed in the red error text as per the design, and not in a tooltip (or am I misunderstanding something?).  Before we do this, do you have some examples of the error strings that could be returned? I'm wondering about how user facing those strings are.\r\n\r\nTrying to detect particular types of errors via parsing strings and categorizing using heuristics seems fragile, and likely to be a source of bugs in the future.\r\n\r\nSo let's take a look at the error message strings that are passed back to us first, and if they are ok we can just use them 🤞  \r\n\r\nIf the error strings passed back to us turn out to be really rubbish (e.g. totally not user facing), then perhaps we could detect some of the most common errors and display nice error messages for these common errors, and for all the other errors just publish the error strings as we get them?
