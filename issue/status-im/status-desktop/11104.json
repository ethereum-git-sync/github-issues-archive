    "body": "@John-44 - me and @endulab had a small discussion about that task. It turns out that it may be problematic to detect particular types of errors bc they all comes as strings with some sentences describing the problem. What we can do is to parse that and categorize by using some heuristics. However when underlying text is changed, it gets broken easily. One option, proposed by @endulab is to present original message (e.g. in some tooltip) when user wants to know details related to the error. The drawback is that it would be always English.",

    "body": "@micieslak @endulab thanks for looking into this!  \r\n\r\nI agree that the better option as proposed by @endulab would be to present the original error message as this would be more robust.  However could the original message be displayed in the red error text as per the design, and not in a tooltip (or am I misunderstanding something?).  Before we do this, do you have some examples of the error strings that could be returned? I'm wondering about how user facing those strings are.\r\n\r\nTrying to detect particular types of errors via parsing strings and categorizing using heuristics seems fragile, and likely to be a source of bugs in the future.\r\n\r\nSo let's take a look at the error message strings that are passed back to us first, and if they are ok we can just use them 🤞  \r\n\r\nIf the error strings passed back to us turn out to be really rubbish (e.g. totally not user facing), then perhaps we could detect some of the most common errors and display nice error messages for these common errors, and for all the other errors just publish the error strings as we get them?
