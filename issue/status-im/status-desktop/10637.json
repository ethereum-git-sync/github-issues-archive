Finish items started in 0.12**\r\n- Complete any outstanding issues related to pairing (for syncing) - Igor\r\n- Implement the 'Admin' role (issue #10114) - Mykhailo\r\n- Any remaining work to pay off tech. debt related to mutual contacts - Mishka\r\n- When creating/editing token based permission, ability to search for and selecting Collectables from OpenSea - MichaelC\r\n\r\n**2. Channel token permissions**\r\n- Create, edit and delete channel token permissions in the permissions admin screens\r\n- This includes the \"no tokens required to view this channel\" permission\r\n- All user facing channel token permissions functionality e.g. what happens when a user tries to access a token gated channel they don't have the required tokens to access, what happens when a user only has permissions to view a channel, etc...\r\n- If a community is an open (not token gated at the community level) community, if a channel is token gated AND if **no** \"no tokens required to view this channel\" permission for that channel exists, then the channel should be automatically encrypted.  If token gating is removed from a channel, the channel should become unencrypted.\r\n\r\n**3. DB perf improvements**\r\n- https://www.notion.so/Database-related-performance-1dbaa7ea894c461d885e55676683be07\r\n- Alex and Patryk to work on this, with help from Lukáš\r\n\r\n**4. Update app to use new 'Share URL' formats**\r\n- add functionality to status-go to generate the new 'Share URL' formats for sharing links to: User Profiles, Communities, Channel inside a Community (issue https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/10851)\r\n- Update everywhere a user can share a URL from to use the new URL format (issue https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/10852)\r\n- New/updated URL unroll designs for inside chat, including specific unrolls for the new User Profile, Community and Channel inside a Community URLs (issue https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/10585)\r\n- Ability to share a URL that points to a specific channel in a community (issue #10160)\r\n- Update all address inputs to accept a user pasting a 'share URL' into the input (in addition to being able to input the raw address).  This includes: Start new chat input, send contact request input in Settings, the import community key input, etc...\r\n- Update Status Desktops URL handler so that if Status is installed on a computer, when a user clicks on a Status 'Share URL' the app is launched (if not already running) and after signing in the user is automatically taken to the entity the Share URL represented inside the app.  e.g. if a user clicks on a URL for a Status Community, the user should be taken to the home screen for that community inside the Status App\r\n\r\n**5. Mint Assets functionality**\r\n- Also includes some small improvements to the mint Collectables functionality\r\n- Noelia, GravityBlast\r\n\r\n**6. Profile showcase backend**\r\n\r\n\r\n**--- For the Wallet team ---**\r\ntldr; continue building out Ben's wallet designs\r\n\r\n1. Complete any outstanding development related to the activity screens\r\n2. All accounts overview screens\r\n3. New settings screens\r\n4.

  "body": "To help align the desktop experience with mobile, the plan is to alter the desktop customisation colours to those used on mobile. \r\n\r\nThis will mean that wherever the user has the option to select a custom colour in the app, the colours the user can select from will be from the new mobile palette.\r\n\r\nThe wallet flows for `Add new account` and `Edit account` will inherit the new palette, as will the Community creation and editing flows.\r\n\r\nA couple of points to clarify:\r\n\r\n1) White and black are combined into a single selection in the new palette. When this option is selected, the customisation colour will be shown as black when the user is in light theme and white when in dark theme. This change should be automatic and instant upon theme change.\r\n\r\n2) For Communities, there are 'Standard colours' to select from - these should be changed to be a subset of the mobile palette as shown in the attached.\r\n\r\n3) There is a slight difference in the shade used for each custom hue depending on whether the user is in light theme or dark theme. That breakdown is also shown in the attached. The change from one shade of the hue to the next when the user switches theme should be automatic and instantaneous. The change in hue is subtle so in most cases the user will not notice the difference but it helps to create balance and maintain contrast equivalency across themes.\r\n\r\nGiven these colours are shared across desktop and mobile apps, it may be worth aligning with the token naming conventions used in mobile so any future changes to the palette are easily synced between the 2 platforms. \r\n \r\n<img width=\"1280\" alt=\"Accout create\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/110033914/cf6568e7-c4bc-4d29-928f-4f88b5c3c0f4\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1280\" alt=\"Account edit\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/110033914/1f148352-4ba3-459d-afdf-b41ba261bfb5\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1537\" alt=\"Community create\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/110033914/4ca65a32-e0ec-465f-96c7-811718b21a9d\">\r\n\r\nThis is the full new customisation palette (see colour labels which confirm which tint/shade of the hue should be used for light theme and which for dark theme).\r\n<img width=\"1920\" alt=\"Customisation colours - mobile\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/110033914/95823d8b-c346-4ac5-80a6-057aca221d45\">\r\n\r\n\r\ncc @John-44 @Khushboo-dev-cpp ",
