Performance**\r\n- Some folks should focus on trying to identify and DB perf. issues\r\n- Also try to identify and improve status-go perf. issues\r\n*improvements to DB and status-go perf. can benefit Status Mobile as well as Status Desktop*\r\n- UI layer perf. improvements.  Try to identify places where the app doesn't respond to user input immediately, and attempt to fix the worse offenders\r\n\r\n**3. fix bugs everywhere**\r\n\r\n**5. Graphs for Community Admin home screen**\r\n- this is a task for the UI team\r\n\r\n**6. QR scanner**\r\n\r\n**Other possible items (but that may be moved to a subsequent milestone)**\r\n- opt-in auto-update functionality\r\n- Integrate final transaction signing modal into community admin areas\r\n- Airdrop history screens\r\n- Live airdrop gas estimation when setting up airdrop\r\n- automatic bandwidth test on app startup, and use results to automatically configure the waku shard usage appropriately depending on the available bandwidth (at the 'user has tons of bandwidth' end of the spectrum all waku shards will use waku Relay mode, at the 'user has very little bandwidth' end of the spectrum all waku shards will use waku filter + light push mode, and in between these two ends of the spectrum the user will use a mix of waku relay mode and waku filter + light push mode for different shards).  Plus also use  the results of the bandwidth test to automatically set the bittorred throttling at an appropriate setting at the beginning of each new session.\r\n",

  "body": "To help align the desktop experience with mobile, the plan is to alter the desktop customisation colours to those used on mobile. \r\n\r\nThis will mean that wherever the user has the option to select a custom colour in the app, the colours the user can select from will be from the new mobile palette.\r\n\r\nThe wallet flows for `Add new account` and `Edit account` will inherit the new palette, as will the Community creation and editing flows.\r\n\r\nA couple of points to clarify:\r\n\r\n1) White and black are combined into a single selection in the new palette. When this option is selected, the customisation colour will be shown as black when the user is in light theme and white when in dark theme. This change should be automatic and instant upon theme change.\r\n\r\n2) For Communities, there are 'Standard colours' to select from - these should be changed to be a subset of the mobile palette as shown in the attached.\r\n\r\n3) There is a slight difference in the shade used for each custom hue depending on whether the user is in light theme or dark theme. That breakdown is also shown in the attached. The change from one shade of the hue to the next when the user switches theme should be automatic and instantaneous. The change in hue is subtle so in most cases the user will not notice the difference but it helps to create balance and maintain contrast equivalency across themes.\r\n\r\nGiven these colours are shared across desktop and mobile apps, it may be worth aligning with the token naming conventions used in mobile so any future changes to the palette are easily synced between the 2 platforms. \r\n \r\n<img width=\"1280\" alt=\"Accout create\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/110033914/cf6568e7-c4bc-4d29-928f-4f88b5c3c0f4\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1280\" alt=\"Account edit\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/110033914/1f148352-4ba3-459d-afdf-b41ba261bfb5\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1537\" alt=\"Community create\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/110033914/4ca65a32-e0ec-465f-96c7-811718b21a9d\">\r\n\r\nThis is the full new customisation palette (see colour labels which confirm which tint/shade of the hue should be used for light theme and which for dark theme).\r\n<img width=\"1920\" alt=\"Customisation colours - mobile\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/110033914/95823d8b-c346-4ac5-80a6-057aca221d45\">\r\n\r\n\r\ncc @John-44 @Khushboo-dev-cpp ",
