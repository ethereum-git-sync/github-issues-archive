Channel token permissions**\r\n- Create, edit and delete channel token permissions in the permissions admin screens\r\n- This includes the \"no tokens required to view this channel\" permission\r\n- All user facing channel token permissions functionality e.g. what happens when a user tries to access a token gated channel they don't have the required tokens to access, what happens when a user only has permissions to view a channel, etc...\r\n- If a community is an open (not token gated at the community level) community, if a channel is token gated AND if **no** \"no tokens required to view this channel\" permission for that channel exists, then the channel should be automatically encrypted.  If token gating is removed from a channel, the channel should become unencrypted.\r\n\r\n**3. DB perf improvements**\r\n- https://www.notion.so/Database-related-performance-1dbaa7ea894c461d885e55676683be07\r\n- Alex and Patryk to work on this, with help from Lukáš\r\n\r\n**4. Update app to use new 'Share URL' formats**\r\n- add functionality to status-go to generate the new 'Share URL' formats for sharing links to: User Profiles, Communities, Channel inside a Community\r\n- Update everywhere a user can share a URL from to use the new URL format\r\n- New/updated URL unroll designs for inside chat, including specific unrolls for the new User Profile, Community and Channel inside a Community URLs\r\n- Ability to share a URL that points to a specific channel in a community (issue #10160)\r\n- Update all address inputs to accept a user pasting a 'share URL' into the input (in addition to being able to input the raw address).  This includes: Start new chat input, send contact request input in Settings, the import community key input, etc...\r\n- Update Status Desktops URL handler so that if Status is installed on a computer, when a user clicks on a Status 'Share URL' the app is launched (if not already running) and after signing in the user is automatically taken to the entity the Share URL represented inside the app.  e.g. if a user clicks on a URL for a Status Community, the user should be taken to the home screen for that community inside the Status App\r\n\r\n**5. Mint Assets functionality**\r\n- Also includes some small improvements to the mint Collectables functionality\r\n- Noelia, GravityBlast\r\n\r\n**6.

    "body": "> the disabled text input field should contain grey hint text saying “You need to be a member of this group to send messages”.\r\n\r\n@benjthayer @John-44 @imagiMary We have the same feature for 1to1 chats where the chat and the message context menu (pin, unpin, remove message) are disabled if the other user is no longer a contact. IMO it would be great to keep it consistent with this feature, but this requires 2 changes on 1to1 chats:\r\n1. Display a placeholder text when the chat is disabled.\r\n2. The user should continue to be able to delete his own messages.\r\n\r\nWDYT? Should I also update the 1to1 chat and implement these 2 changes? (please note that we need a new placeholder text for 1to1 chats if we're going to align it with the group chat)\r\n",
