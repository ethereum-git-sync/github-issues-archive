    "body": "It's a very reasonable request. There's a challenge involved, to my understanding:\r\n\r\nDiscord and Slack are using Electron, which means that underneath what's displayed is the web DOM, and therefore it's possible to tap into the DOM and get e.g. the `textContent` of the nodes in the DOM. Likewise, since they're web DOM based, they get the familiar ability to click-drag-copy/paste (anywhere in a browser's displayed content) pretty much for free.\r\n\r\nHowever, Qt/QML doesn't have the web DOM, it has its own concept of \"scene graph\", which works differently.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I just tried click-drag-copy/paste across multiple messages from multiple sources in Telegram Desktop (which is Qt based)  and the result is very similar to Slack/Discord... so it *should* be possible somehow.",
