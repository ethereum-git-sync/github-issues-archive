    "body": "Alright, quick update here:\r\n\r\nI can reproduce this reliably and the problem is that, after re-importing an account, the contacts are shown as requests because they have their system tag `added = false` **although** they should be `added = true` since they have been accepted in the past.\r\n\r\nI do some further digging, but right now I think there are two options where stuff can go sideways:\r\n\r\n1. The requests we see as requests are indeed the requests that were sent originally. When reimporting an account, we probably receive the original contact requests from the store nodes, at which point they were indeed `added = false`. And since there are no contacts in the local database after reimporting, from the app's perspective they indeed look like new requests.\r\n2. Another place where this **could** go wrong is when the app receives a backup from store nodes and maybe for some reason, the `added = true` flag isn't set in the backup message. I looked at the code and I'd say this is rather unlikely but still throwing it out here as an option for brainstorming\r\n\r\nI'm gonna do further investigation to get to the bottom of this.",

User A wipes out their Status folder and re-imports their account (no device syncing has happened)\r\n3. After re-importing, User A receives the contact request from 1) via store nodes. Because the database doesn't have any contacts yet, this looks like a new contact request, even though this was accepted before\r\n\r\nThe result is the issue @anastasiyaig has described here in the og issue. Plenty of contacts that she's already accepted now show up as contact requests.\r\n\r\nMy first guess was to rely on backups, they seem to be processed first anyways. But since we can't guarantee the backup we get is indeed up-to-date (due to the 8 hour tolerance), this isn't really an option.\r\n\r\nYou mentioned:\r\n\r\n>  the user should be pairing up their devices before entering the seed phrase\r\n\r\nMaybe I'm missing something here, but isn't pairing devices only available **after** the seed phrase was entered?
