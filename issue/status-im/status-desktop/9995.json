Performance**\r\n- Some folks should focus on trying to identify and DB perf. issues\r\n- Also try to identify and improve status-go perf. issues\r\n*improvements to DB and status-go perf. can benefit Status Mobile as well as Status Desktop*\r\n- UI layer perf. improvements.  Try to identify places where the app doesn't respond to user input immediately, and attempt to fix the worse offenders\r\n\r\n**3. fix bugs everywhere**\r\n\r\n**5. Graphs for Community Admin home screen**\r\n- this is a task for the UI team\r\n\r\n**6. QR scanner**\r\n\r\n**Other possible items (but that may be moved to a subsequent milestone)**\r\n- opt-in auto-update functionality\r\n- Integrate final transaction signing modal into community admin areas\r\n- Airdrop history screens\r\n- Live airdrop gas estimation when setting up airdrop\r\n- automatic bandwidth test on app startup, and use results to automatically configure the waku shard usage appropriately depending on the available bandwidth (at the 'user has tons of bandwidth' end of the spectrum all waku shards will use waku Relay mode, at the 'user has very little bandwidth' end of the spectrum all waku shards will use waku filter + light push mode, and in between these two ends of the spectrum the user will use a mix of waku relay mode and waku filter + light push mode for different shards).  Plus also use  the results of the bandwidth test to automatically set the bittorred throttling at an appropriate setting at the beginning of each new session.\r\n",

  "body": "# Bug Report\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nWhen scrolled to the bottom of the wallet activities, loading more transaction is triggered that must appear once loaded. If not connected no non-archival node, app must fetch all transactions, but at some point 0 transactions are returned and `allTxLoaded` is set to `true`.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nAdd a watch only account with many transactions: 0xe4edb277e41dc89ab076a1f049f4a3efa700bce8\r\nOpen wallet->activities and scroll to the bottom several times, until you see a text at the bottom: \"You have reached the beginning of the activity for this account\".\r\n\r\nThe number of loaded transactions is small compared to the real number on etherscan.\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\nLoad all transactions till the very first\r\n#### Actual behavior\r\nNot all transactions are loaded\r\n\r\n\r\n",
