That means that anyone seeing the community can see what are the channels in the community, even if they are not joined.\r\n\r\nWe need to change this so that the channel list is apart from the shared community description. \r\n\r\nThis requires a big change, so we need to discuss it thoroughly before implementing.\r\n\r\n### Acceptance criteria\r\n\r\n- The channel list isn't available to someone who has not joined a closed community\r\n- Everything is normal for someone who is joined",
