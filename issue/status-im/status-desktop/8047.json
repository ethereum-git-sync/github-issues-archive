Ability for user to select & manage accounts shared with each community control node**\r\n- This item is quite a bit of work\r\n- Touches Community settings, as well as all of the community join flows\r\n\r\n**2. Updates to control node transfer dialogues**\r\n- Remove ability for a Owner to leave a community on the computer that's running as that community's control node\r\n- Community Admin home screen cleanup (inc. adding at least one of the three graphs, whichever is easiest to implement).  \r\n\r\n**3. finish anything that wasn't completed in 0.13**\r\n- Encryption for token gated channels that are inside Open (not token gated) communities (Patryk)  **Important!**\r\n- Anything that didn't get completed in 0.13 related to new share URL format\r\n- Make sure all Community token functionality *is very well tested*, fix any issues found\r\n\r\n**4. Final screens and bits and bobs needed prior to public beta**\r\n- Modal that's shown every time after login, reminding user's that Status Desktop is in Beta\r\n- The bug with 'requests to join' a community not constantly arriving, or sometimes arriving after a delay, must be fixed.\r\n- All the outstanding bugs and small items that got pushed into the 0.14 milestone.\r\n\r\n**5. Profile showcase backend**\r\n- The long-delayed profile showcase backend!  We have the UI on the desktop ready to go for this feature, and Mobile is going to need the backend for this feature as well, so let's try to get it done in 0.14\r\n\r\n**6. Token permissions to enable control of community smart contracts**\r\n- So that for example, a token based permission could give multiple people the ability to mint or airdrop a single community's tokens.\r\n\r\n**--- Things that we SHOULD NOT work on during the 0.14 cycle ---**\r\n- Messaging and UI teams shouldn't work on perf. in 0.14 (but Wallet team should!)\r\n- Anything mutual contacts related, other than #10497 #10498 (hopefully this functionality working good enough now!)\r\n- Community Channel drag and drop (assuming this is now working!)\r\n\r\n**--- Wallet Team ---**\r\n\r\n1. Finish any outstanding work related to Activity screens (top priority - aim to have complete by July 14th)\r\n\r\n2. Updated Wallet Settings screens inc. account syncing functionality  *Synced information should immediately be reflected in the UI after it is received (sometimes synced info is currently only displayed after the next app restart, this needs to be fixed)*\r\n\r\n3. Fix bugs, clean up loose ends (to get things in a good state before the work on the Mobile wallet starts)\r\n\r\n4. Total balance graphs for 'All accounts' and each individual account\r\n\r\n5. Advanced transaction signing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
