  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nI have installed the Status Desktop app recently and have noticed few minor UI/UX improvements that would help a new user. Will keep adding as comments any other UX improvements i noticed would be nicer to have.\r\n\r\n1. When a contact request is sent to someone, there is no way to know whether the request is in pending state from the app UI. It is hard to know what is the status of a request. Until the request is approved, contact is not seen in the UI. This would confuse new users wrt the state of the contact request. \r\nSuggestion : It would be good to display the contact(with a pending status by the side). \r\n\r\n2. When a request is sent to join a community that is encrypted, ï»¿before the membership is approved there should be a message on each channel indicating content cannot be seen because community is encrypted and membership needs to be approved. Right now, each channel just shows empty with a link to \"fetch messages\" which doesn't do anything. This doesn't look like a good user experience and is confusin.  Attaching a screenshot below which shows the same.\r\n<img width=\"1562\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-06-19 at 6 07 42 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/20137744/ba7d6233-245e-4644-93af-dc6638d24634\">\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "3. The initial sync to download message history takes a lot of time. It would be better UX to show the user percentage status of download in each channel. As of now, just a general message that says `Downloading history archives in progress` is not of much help, especially when it takes hours to syncup. \r\n4. Archive/history sync would be better if it is from recent to oldest messages. The download of history would be nicer if it was done from recent messages to oldest. Right now it looks like oldest messages are downloaded first(like all the way in 2019/2020)..which may not be of much interest to new users to start with.  ",
