  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nThe [toChannelGroupDto](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/blob/b414d616a672238fee9ffc2afd3a15346bf3656a/src/app_service/service/community/dto/community.nim#L525-L553) function in the desktop is essentially a redundant replication of [getChannelGroups](https://github.com/status-im/status-go/blob/eb437e9d8dd5bd1ca3b18fa05c4853d6ae8f4956/services/chat/api.go#L214-L237) from status-go. This isn't just a mere duplication of logic; it leads to numerous data inconsistency issues. Sometimes, we propagate `ChannelGroupDto` directly from status-go, and at other times, we run our conversion. This inconsistency opens up potential mismatches between the two. Ideally, we should maintain synchronization with the status-go version. However, given that status-go is platform-agnostic and can be altered by any team (such as mobile), ensuring consistent synchronization is impractical. Any deviation can be incredibly challenging to debug. When issues arise, tracing them back to the root cause, particularly if one lacks experience, is like searching for a needle in a haystack, with `toChannelGroupDto` being the last suspected culprit.\r\n\r\nThe \"ChannelGroups\" concept in status-go was intended to unify the sections. But, `ChannelGroup` isn't really used much by clients. It's used at first when getting sections, but after that, specific types like `Community` are used, which means the desktop has to change how it handles things.\r\n\r\nThere are a few ways to solve this:\r\n\r\nA) Remove `toChannelGroupDto` from the desktop and rely on status-go's conversion (this would require creating a new API, such as `communityToChannelGroup(communityID)`).\r\nB) Do away with the \"ChannelGroups\" idea in status-go and retain it solely within status-desktop.\r\nC) Modify all status-go signals to be of type `ChannelGroup`, either as a replacement for or in addition to `Community`.",
