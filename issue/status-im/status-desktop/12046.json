Doesn't matter if the app is started with that community upfront. No errors or relevant warning in console; seems like some race condition. Group chats or my own test community seems not affected at all\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n- Status desktop version: master\r\n- Operating System: Linux\r\n\r\n",
