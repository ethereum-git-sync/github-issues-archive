Token permissions to enable control of community smart contracts**\r\n- Before a community founder can use any of the community token admin functionality, they first have to deploy Owner and Token Master contracts.\r\n- This work involves: new empty state screen for Mint and Airdrop tokens (before current empty state screen is revealed), new flow for deploying the community's Owner and Token Master contracts in a single step, a fixed uneditable permission giving anybody who holds the Token Master token admin rights for the community should be automatically created.\r\n- Only the holder of the single Owner token can access the Token Master airdrop, remote destruct, and view holders functions. Anybody who holds the Token Master token can access all token admin options, excluding those related to the Token Master token itself, as well as being and Admin of the community.\r\n- This will all be explained in more detail in the designs.\r\n\r\nBackend Epic: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11249\r\n\r\n**2. Update Community Admin home screen inc control node transfer and associated dialogues**\r\n- Remove ability for a Owner to leave a community on the computer that's running as that community's control node\r\n- Community Admin home screen cleanup (inc. adding at least one of the three graphs, whichever is easiest to implement).\r\n  - Graph issue: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11152  \r\n  - Community overview: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11278\r\n\r\n**3. Ability for user to select & manage accounts shared with each community control node**\r\n- This item is quite a bit of work\r\n- Touches Community settings, as well as all of the community join flows\r\n- Backend issues: \r\n  - Join API: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11154\r\n  - Edit API: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11153\r\n\r\n**4. Encryption for token gated channels that are inside Open (not token gated) communities**\r\n[#10998](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/10998)\r\n\r\n**5. Final screens and bits and bobs needed prior to public beta**\r\n- Modal that's shown every time after login, reminding user's that Status Desktop is in Beta [#11044](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11044)\r\n- The bug with 'requests to join' a community not constantly arriving, or sometimes arriving after a delay, must be fixed. [#8264](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/8264)\r\n- Anything that didn't get completed in 0.13 related to new share URL format\r\n- All the outstanding bugs and small items that got pushed into the 0.14 milestone.\r\n\r\n\r\n**--- Things that we SHOULD NOT work on during the 0.14 cycle ---**\r\n- Messaging and UI teams shouldn't work on perf. in 0.14 (but Wallet team should!)\r\n- Anything big mutual contacts related, other than fixing small bugs we find like #10497 #10498 #11120 #11121  (hopefully this functionality working good enough now!)\r\n\r\n**--- Wallet Team ---**\r\n\r\n1. Finish any outstanding work related to Activity screens (top priority - aim to have complete by July 14th)\r\n\r\n2. Updated Wallet Settings screens UI inc. account syncing functionality  *Synced information should immediately be reflected in the UI after it is received (sometimes synced info is currently only displayed after the next app restart, this needs to be fixed)*\r\n\r\n3. Wallet performance and memory consumption optimisations\r\n\r\n4. Fix bugs, clean up loose ends (to get things in a good state before the work on the Mobile wallet starts)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nAs part of \"Changing shared address settings from within Community\" (WIP design: https://www.figma.com/file/uHwhhUsne96HBhkunsD7Po/WIP-flows?type=design&node-id=8-34093&t=kwGGwrG4wikQ1eK5-0)\r\nwe need to implement an API that users can use to change which address they share with the owner.\r\n\r\nThe API will accept a community ID and a list of addresses.\r\n\r\nThose addresses will then be sent to the control node, which will save them instead of the old ones (old ones are deleted/replaced).\r\n\r\nBoth the control and the user node will need to do a verification on the new addresses to make sure that the user still fulfills the requirements. If they do not, they lose the privilege they had.\r\n\r\nNo need to implement any UI for this. This is backend only, so mostly status-go, but if possible, do the service, controller, module and view code too (should be just a chain of calls up to status-go). You can just use a random placeholder UI element if you need to test it, but status-go tests can do the trick.\r\n\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n- There is a new status-go API that members of a community can call to change their shared addresses\r\n- Once it is called, the control node updates the addresses in their DB and uses the new ones instead \r\n- If the new addresses do **not** fulfill all the permissions, the user loses privilege\r\n  - If they were admin and no longer fulfill the admin permission, they become member (if they fulfill the member permission if it exists)\r\n  - If they were member and no longer fulfill the member permission, they are kicked\r\n  - If there were channel permissions and they no longer fulfill them, they lose read or write access depending on the type.\r\n",
