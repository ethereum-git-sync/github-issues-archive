    "description": "**1. Finish anything that wasn't completed in the previous 0.14 cycle**\r\n\r\n- And fix bugs as usual. We need to keep tech. debt at a roughly fixed level as we grow out functionality, can't let it accumulate! ;-)\r\n\r\n**2. Tokenisation of community ownership**\r\n\r\n- Work needed already evaluated in spike.  Community and 'Channel in a Community' URLs don't need to be signed if this will present problems. Patryk to work on this as a continuation of the spike already done.\r\n- See priority 4 below, as this also has some implications for the tokenisation of community work.\r\n\r\n**3. Profile showcase backend**\r\n- The long-delayed profile showcase backend!  We have the UI on the desktop ready to go for this feature, and Mobile is going to need the backend for this feature as well, so let's try to get it done in 0.14 [#11081](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11081)\r\n\r\n**4. Community tokens visible in wallet when received by user who is not a member of that community**\r\n- Solution obvs. needs to be fully decenteralised and permissionless\r\n- Perhaps whenever a community token is A) sent from a Status Wallet to another user or B) airdropped by a community or C) retailed by a community, a M2M (invisible to the user) Waku message should be sent to the recipient's *ethereum address*?\r\n- This message could either: A) contain the metadata for the token B) tell the user that they have received token, and to check the metadata in either another Waku channel where Control Nodes periodically post Metadata OR check the metadata embedded in the token contract (embedding metadata in the token contract might be a better idea?).  \r\n- The token metadata stored in the token contract is signed by the Community's private key to ensure authenticity.  When the community's private key changes due to ownership of a community being transferred or due to the control node being moved, a transaction must be made to update this metadata so it is signed by the community's new private key.\r\n- See here for how a Waku message can be sent to and Ethereum address https://rfc.vac.dev/spec/20/\r\n\r\n**5. Complete initial airdrop functionality**\r\n- Airdrop history screens\r\n- Ability to airdrop based on in-Community activity (No. of msg, No. msg in time range, joining a community, length of community membership)  Ability to combine multiple attributes into an airdrop\r\n- Ability to token gate airdrops\r\n- Live airdrop gas estimation when setting up airdrop\r\n\r\n**6. Token import functionality**\r\n- Ability for a community Owner to import ERC-20 and NFT tokens, to later be airdropped or retailed\r\n\r\n**7. Admin functionality enhancements**\r\n- Ability to mark a token gated channel as 'hidden', only visible to community members with the requisite tokens\r\n- optional service to once a month auto-kick all members who haven't been online for between 30 and 60 days (e.g. auto-kick members whose profile information like Name, Avatar, etc... can no longer be fetched)\r\n\r\n**8. QR scanner**\r\n- Needed for private key transfer\r\n- Ethereum key QRs (send modal triggered)\r\n- User Share URL in a QR (opens user profile dialogue) \r\n- Community and Channel inside Community URL in QRs (takes user to Community or Channel in Community)\r\n\r\n**9. Chat functionality enhancements**\r\n- Introduce @channel as a new type of global @ mention.  This @ mention only @ mention's everyone who has posted a message in a channel in the last 30 days \r\n- Introduce the ability to search the users in the right side members/users bar.  At the same time, make any adaptations needed so that the right side members/users bar can scale to 10,000 users.\r\n\r\n\r\n**--- Wallet Team ---**\r\n\r\n1. Sending Community created tokens to Status users who are not members of that community\r\n- See priority 4) in the messaging priorities list above.\r\n\r\n2. Send NFT functionality\r\n\r\n3. WalletConnect 2.0 support\r\n\r\n4. Total balance graphs for 'All accounts' and each individual account\r\n\r\n5. Advanced transaction signing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

If the user is unblocked, he is not returned to the contact list **_Nastya_**: this might be outdated, because we move the user to Blocked list instead and unblocking him brings him back to contacts.\r\n- chat history with the unblocked user does not recover\r\n- you can add the unblocked user to contacts, start a new 1-1 chat with him, create a group chat, see new messages from him in a public chat/community channel **_Nastya_**: this needs clarification, if we block and then unblock user, so we need to resend contact request?\r\n- blocked user is not removed from group chat members (neither for the admin nor other members). Only messages from him are removed\r\n- blocked users list is synced across devices\r\n- you can’t receive any push notifications from the blocked user\r\n- you can’t see the blocked user in the mention suggestions list in chats\r\n- messages from the blocked user that he sent while you were offline are not fetched when you are back online\r\n- all notifications from the blocked user should also be removed from the activity center\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "> Linking this, as it introduced an explicit difference in desktop/mobile:\r\n> \r\n> * [fix: set only blocked flag to blocked contact for desktop app status-go#2635](https://github.com/status-im/status-go/pull/2635)\r\n\r\n@cammellos @iurimatias @anastasiyaig  is a difference between Status Desktop and Status Mobile warranted here?\r\n\r\nI would have thought that the 'Block user' behaviour should be identical on both Mobile and Desktop.\r\n\r\nIMHO when a user is blocked on both Status Desktop or Status Mobile (it shouldn't matter which), then:\r\n\r\n- The fact that the user has been blocked should be synced via our sync mechanism to all of the users devices.\r\n\r\nThen, on all of the users devices (both Desktop and Mobile), it should appear as if that user 'doesn't exist, and never existed'.  Specifically, this means that:\r\n\r\n- Every message from the blocked user should be deleted from the DB on all of the user's devices.\r\n\r\n- The blocked user should not appear **anywhere** in the UI  on the user's devices (including community member lists, if the blocked user's chat key is pasted into 'add contact' nothing should be returned, 1on1 chats, it should be like they don't exist in ad-hoc group chats even if they are still in the ad-hoc group chat, there should be zero notifications relating to the blocked user in the Notification Centre, etc, etc...)\r\n\r\n- The one and only exception to the above is the Settings/Messaging/Users screen, which should contain a list of all blocked users, so that the user has a way to unblock someone.\r\n\r\nI can't see why there should be any difference in the above functionality between Mobile and Desktop, esp. as blocked users must be synced across all of the user's devices, and therefor I would have thought that the fact that a user has been blocked should be acted upon in the same way on all of the user's devices (both Mobile and Desktop.  But perhaps I'm missing something?",
