If the user is unblocked, he is not returned to the contact list **_Nastya_**: this might be outdated, because we move the user to Blocked list instead and unblocking him brings him back to contacts.\r\n- chat history with the unblocked user does not recover\r\n- you can add the unblocked user to contacts, start a new 1-1 chat with him, create a group chat, see new messages from him in a public chat/community channel **_Nastya_**: this needs clarification, if we block and then unblock user, so we need to resend contact request?\r\n- blocked user is not removed from group chat members (neither for the admin nor other members). Only messages from him are removed\r\n- blocked users list is synced across devices\r\n- you can’t receive any push notifications from the blocked user\r\n- you can’t see the blocked user in the mention suggestions list in chats\r\n- messages from the blocked user that he sent while you were offline are not fetched when you are back online\r\n- all notifications from the blocked user should also be removed from the activity center\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "> Linking this, as it introduced an explicit difference in desktop/mobile:\r\n> \r\n> * [fix: set only blocked flag to blocked contact for desktop app status-go#2635](https://github.com/status-im/status-go/pull/2635)\r\n\r\n@cammellos @iurimatias @anastasiyaig  is a difference between Status Desktop and Status Mobile warranted here?\r\n\r\nI would have thought that the 'Block user' behaviour should be identical on both Mobile and Desktop.\r\n\r\nIMHO when a user is blocked on both Status Desktop or Status Mobile (it shouldn't matter which), then:\r\n\r\n- The fact that the user has been blocked should be synced via our sync mechanism to all of the users devices.\r\n\r\nThen, on all of the users devices (both Desktop and Mobile), it should appear as if that user 'doesn't exist, and never existed' to the user who blocked them.  Specifically, this means that:\r\n\r\n- Every message from the blocked user should be deleted from the DB on all of the user's devices.\r\n\r\n- The blocked user should not appear **anywhere** in the UI  on the user's devices (including community member lists, if the blocked user's chat key is pasted into 'add contact' nothing should be returned, 1on1 chats, it should be like they don't exist in ad-hoc group chats even if they are still in the ad-hoc group chat, there should be zero notifications relating to the blocked user in the Notification Centre, etc, etc...)\r\n\r\n- The one and only exception to the above is the Settings/Messaging/Users screen, which should contain a list of all blocked users, so that the user has a way to unblock someone.\r\n\r\nI can't see why there should be any difference in the above functionality between Mobile and Desktop, esp. as blocked users must be synced across all of the user's devices, and therefor I would have thought that the fact that a user has been blocked should be acted upon in the same way on all of the user's devices (both Mobile and Desktop.  But perhaps I'm missing something?",
