If the user is unblocked, he is not returned to the contact list **_Nastya_**: this might be outdated, because we move the user to Blocked list instead and unblocking him brings him back to contacts.\r\n- chat history with the unblocked user does not recover\r\n- you can add the unblocked user to contacts, start a new 1-1 chat with him, create a group chat, see new messages from him in a public chat/community channel **_Nastya_**: this needs clarification, if we block and then unblock user, so we need to resend contact request?\r\n- blocked user is not removed from group chat members (neither for the admin nor other members). Only messages from him are removed\r\n- blocked users list is synced across devices\r\n- you can’t receive any push notifications from the blocked user\r\n- you can’t see the blocked user in the mention suggestions list in chats\r\n- messages from the blocked user that he sent while you were offline are not fetched when you are back online\r\n- all notifications from the blocked user should also be removed from the activity center\r\n\r\n",
