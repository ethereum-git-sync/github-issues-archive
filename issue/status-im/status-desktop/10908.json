Ability for user to select & manage accounts shared with each community control node**\r\n- This item is quite a bit of work\r\n- Touches Community settings, as well as all of the community join flows\r\n\r\n**2. Updates to control node transfer dialogues**\r\n- Remove ability for a Owner to leave a community on the computer that's running as that community's control node\r\n- Community Admin home screen cleanup (inc. adding at least one of the three graphs, whichever is easiest to implement).  \r\n\r\n**3. finish anything that wasn't completed in 0.13**\r\n- Profile showcase backend\r\n- Anything that didn't get completed in 0.13 related to new share URL format\r\n- Make sure all Community token functionality *is very well tested*, fix any issues found\r\n\r\n**4. Final screens and bits and bobs needed prior to public beta**\r\n- Modal that's shown every time after login, reminding user's that Status Desktop is in Beta\r\n- The bug with 'requests to join' a community not constantly arriving, or sometimes arriving after a delay, must be fixed.\r\n- All the outstanding bugs and small items that got pushed into the 0.14 milestone.\r\n\r\n**5. QR scanner**\r\n- Needed for private key transfer\r\n- Ethereum key QRs (send modal triggered)\r\n- User Share URL in a QR (opens user profile dialogue) \r\n- Community and Channel inside Community URL in QRs (takes user to Community or Channel in Community)\r\n\r\n**6. Token permissions to enable control of community smart contracts**\r\n- So that for example, a token based permission could give multiple people the ability to mint or airdrop a single community's tokens.\r\n\r\n**--- Things that we SHOULD NOT work on during the 0.14 cycle ---**\r\n- Messaging and UI teams shouldn't work on perf. in 0.14 (but Wallet team should!)\r\n- Anything mutual contacts related, other than #10497 #10498 (hopefully this functionality working good enough now!)\r\n- Community Channel drag and drop (assuming this is now working!)\r\n\r\n**--- Wallet Team ---**\r\n\r\n1. Finish any outstanding work related to Activity screens (top priority - aim to have complete by July 14th)\r\n\r\n2. Updated Wallet Settings screens inc. account syncing functionality  *Synced information should immediately be reflected in the UI after it is received (sometimes synced info is currently only displayed after the next app restart, this needs to be fixed)*\r\n\r\n3. Fix bugs, clean up loose ends (to get things in a good state before the work on the Mobile wallet starts)\r\n\r\n4. Total balance graphs for 'All accounts' and each individual account\r\n\r\n5. Advanced transaction signing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Hey @Cuteivist, @saledjenic is correct, the validation in the add flow should match that in the edit flow. Both flows should allow the user to add a space in the account name.\r\n\r\nThe things we validate against that are not allowed are:\r\n- Name length >20 chars \r\n- Use of special characters \r\n- Use of emojis\r\n- Where the name, emoji and colour of account are all the same as another account\r\n\r\n`Wallet v2` desktop designs (where we detail the account name validation in full)\r\nhttps://www.figma.com/file/FkFClTCYKf83RJWoifWgoX/Wallet-v2?type=design&node-id=12322-276497&t=FtIXdCmy5P9mwadY-4\r\n\r\nThe mobile designs follow the desktop designs on this and should be consistent (I see a couple of validation states currently missing in the mobile designs but when they are taken into the UI design phase these should be added).\r\nhttps://www.figma.com/file/Q92CTbwanXZwSWrHWKfJqS/Wallet-UX-for-Mobile?type=design&node-id=3258-493247&t=NW34ozUYZ14epE2Z-4\r\n\r\nThe user can change the account name from wallet settings as well, but we just launch the same edit dialog shown in the `Wallet v2` file - so in the settings file, we just link back to `Wallet v2`:\r\nhttps://www.figma.com/file/idUoxN7OIW2Jpp3PMJ1Rl8/%E2%9A%99%EF%B8%8F-Settings-%7C-Desktop?type=design&node-id=15264-365634&t=fCeOLj4DMXZznv0z-4\r\n\r\nHope that helps clarify @Cuteivist , just shout if not :)\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1850\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-06-05 at 09 47 18\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/110033914/fd770e44-d6c5-436d-998f-2f06ea14fc2c\">\r\n",
