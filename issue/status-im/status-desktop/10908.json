Channel token permissions**\r\n- Create, edit and delete channel token permissions in the permissions admin screens\r\n- This includes the \"no tokens required to view this channel\" permission\r\n- All user facing channel token permissions functionality e.g. what happens when a user tries to access a token gated channel they don't have the required tokens to access, what happens when a user only has permissions to view a channel, etc...\r\n- If a community is an open (not token gated at the community level) community, if a channel is token gated AND if **no** \"no tokens required to view this channel\" permission for that channel exists, then the channel should be automatically encrypted.  If token gating is removed from a channel, the channel should become unencrypted.\r\n\r\n**3. DB perf improvements**\r\n- https://www.notion.so/Database-related-performance-1dbaa7ea894c461d885e55676683be07\r\n- Alex and Patryk to work on this, with help from Lukáš\r\n\r\n**4. Update app to use new 'Share URL' formats**\r\n- add functionality to status-go to generate the new 'Share URL' formats for sharing links to: User Profiles, Communities, Channel inside a Community (issue https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/10851)\r\n- Update everywhere a user can share a URL from to use the new URL format (issue https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/10852)\r\n- New/updated URL unroll designs for inside chat, including specific unrolls for the new User Profile, Community and Channel inside a Community URLs (issue https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/10585)\r\n- Ability to share a URL that points to a specific channel in a community (issue #10160)\r\n- Update all address inputs to accept a user pasting a 'share URL' into the input (in addition to being able to input the raw address).  This includes: Start new chat input, send contact request input in Settings, the import community key input, etc...\r\n- Update Status Desktops URL handler so that if Status is installed on a computer, when a user clicks on a Status 'Share URL' the app is launched (if not already running) and after signing in the user is automatically taken to the entity the Share URL represented inside the app.  e.g. if a user clicks on a URL for a Status Community, the user should be taken to the home screen for that community inside the Status App\r\n\r\n**5. Mint Assets functionality**\r\n- Also includes some small improvements to the mint Collectables functionality\r\n- Noelia, GravityBlast\r\n\r\n**6.

    "body": "Hey @Cuteivist, @saledjenic is correct, the validation in the add flow should match that in the edit flow. Both flows should allow the user to add a space in the account name.\r\n\r\nThe things we validate against that are not allowed are:\r\n- Name length >20 chars \r\n- Use of special characters \r\n- Use of emojis\r\n- Where the name, emoji and colour of account are all the same as another account\r\n\r\n`Wallet v2` desktop designs (where we detail the account name validation in full)\r\nhttps://www.figma.com/file/FkFClTCYKf83RJWoifWgoX/Wallet-v2?type=design&node-id=12322-276497&t=FtIXdCmy5P9mwadY-4\r\n\r\nThe mobile designs follow the desktop designs on this and should be consistent (I see a couple of validation states currently missing in the mobile designs but when they are taken into the UI design phase these should be added).\r\nhttps://www.figma.com/file/Q92CTbwanXZwSWrHWKfJqS/Wallet-UX-for-Mobile?type=design&node-id=3258-493247&t=NW34ozUYZ14epE2Z-4\r\n\r\nThe user can change the account name from wallet settings as well, but we just launch the same edit dialog shown in the `Wallet v2` file - so in the settings file, we just link back to `Wallet v2`:\r\nhttps://www.figma.com/file/idUoxN7OIW2Jpp3PMJ1Rl8/%E2%9A%99%EF%B8%8F-Settings-%7C-Desktop?type=design&node-id=15264-365634&t=fCeOLj4DMXZznv0z-4\r\n\r\nHope that helps clarify @Cuteivist , just shout if not :)\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1850\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-06-05 at 09 47 18\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/110033914/fd770e44-d6c5-436d-998f-2f06ea14fc2c\">\r\n",
