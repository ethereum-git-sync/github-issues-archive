  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nIn the following task there's a high level description of the basic requirements for the data management related to the tokens order and it's persistence. It also includes a basic list of points identified by the team that need to be defined BEFORE any other development of the UI / backend, since there are some agreements that need to be taken.\r\n\r\n**Please, use this task as the basis for the needed discussions and later solution proposals.**\r\n\r\n### High level requirements:\r\n[Design assets](https://www.figma.com/file/eM26pyHZUeAwMLviaS1KJn/%E2%9A%99%EF%B8%8F-Wallet-Settings%3A-Manage-Tokens?type=design&node-id=32%3A177050&mode=design&t=2Coix0wrE0gbxGNg-1)\r\n\r\n[Design collectibles](https://www.figma.com/file/eM26pyHZUeAwMLviaS1KJn/%E2%9A%99%EF%B8%8F-Wallet-Settings%3A-Manage-Tokens?type=design&node-id=25%3A132375&mode=design&t=2Coix0wrE0gbxGNg-1)\r\n\r\nIn `Wallet Settings / Manage tokens / Assets and Collectibles` tab (same ordering behavior for both, assets and collectibles, however data management will be different since backend provides data in a different way):\r\n\r\n1. Initial tokens list order (meaning initial, the first time the user wants to create a `custom order`, otherwise, the order will be the one decided previousy by the user) will be by `name`. \r\n2. There will be 2 different list orders that will need to be stored independently (that means, they need to be stored in the ddbb and be loaded whenever needed from the backend):\r\n    - `Flat list` tokens order --> Meaning `arrange by community` switch is OFF. Here they are displayed `TOKEN ITEMS`.\r\n    - `Grouped by community list` tokens order --> Meaning `arrange by community` switch is ON. Here they are displayed `GROUP ITEMS`.\r\nThe ordering when switch is OFF dictates the order in which the tokens are ordered within the Community groups when the switch is ON. There is NO possibility of reordering inside a community / collection group for MVP.\r\n3. Whenever the user changes from switch OFF to switch ON, the previous `grouped by community list` is **dropped***** and a new one is initialized using the following condition: Presort collections / community tokens with most tokens on top. Here the requirement from figma:\r\n```\r\nWhen arranging by community groups all collectibles/assets into their respective communities:\r\n- Collections/communities with most tokens are placed first\r\n- Tokens retain their respective order from previous view (we can’t assume the user wants to change respective ordering)`\r\n```\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** *** We should clarify with design team that point bc after last designs maybe it's doable to just keep always 2 different lists (flat and group) without the need of dropping when switching the switch! \r\n\r\n### What do we need to specify on this stage?\r\n\r\n- Internal representation of position (position of tokens and position of group). Probably we need to differentiate between `assets` and `collectibles` **position** management\r\n- Backend API for paginated access according to specified criteria (sorting/filtering/groupping). That is specific for `collectibles`:\r\n  - Format for specifying those criteria\r\n  - How we want to maintain the flow (e.g. can we have arbitrary number of paginated flows or maybe after simplification we can stick to one/two model(s) exposed from a backend serving paginated flow) backend API for saving custom order defined by the user by dnd and other settings (like grouped mode).\r\n- Identify if there's the need of more agreements related to `assets` amangement.",
