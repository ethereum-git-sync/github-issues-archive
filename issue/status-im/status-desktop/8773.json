  "body": "# Bug Report\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nVery weird bug that happened to me and Rick. \r\n\r\nI opened the app and everything looked normal, but then I started seeing notifications come in for new messages (both OS and ephemeral depending on the focus state of the app), but **none** of my channel or communities showed the badge for new messages. I checked my muted channels just in case, and it wasn't that either.\r\n\r\nTurns out, one of my private group chats just disappeared from the list. I could not see it at all, but  I could still receive the messages and notifications. So the signals from status-go worked.\r\n\r\nThis means the issue is either in Nim or QML.\r\n\r\nClosing and reopening didn't fix it.\r\n\r\nWe could fix it by kicking me out of the group and re-adding me. Then I could see the group and even the old messages. \r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nNo idea. It happened seemingly randomly\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n- Status desktop version: 0.8.1\r\n- Operating System: Ubuntu 20\r\n",
