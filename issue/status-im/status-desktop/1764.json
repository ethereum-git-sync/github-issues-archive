  "body": "Right now, if I write a message in a channel, then wait any amount of time, say one full day, then write another message, if no one else wrote in between, my image and username won't reappear.\n\nThis can cause confusion, especially if a day passed, because the \"Date\" message will appear in between the messages and the newest message will have no image or username, so it's hard to tell who wrote it.\n\nSo we should do a bit like Discord and if there is more than X minutes passed between one message and the other, even if the two messages are from the same user, we should show the username and pic again.\n\nI would say X = 2 minutes sounds good, but we should make it configurable easily (not hardcoded at multiple places)",
