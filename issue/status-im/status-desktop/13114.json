And it seems that the chat records of the two clients cannot be synchronized.\r\nIn other words, mobile and desktop still cannot communicate at the same time. Is there any solution? If it is because the function implementation is not yet complete, then I will wait for the update.\r\n\r\nMobile version: 1.25\r\nDesktop version: 0.15-rc.9",
