    "body": "I've started introducing myself with this part of the app to grasp a context before starting to fix this bug.\n\nThere are 2 things that need to be fixed:\n- verifying account address, in case the address belongs to a keypair that is migrated to a keycard\n- generating a signature for signing the joining community request in case a profile keypair is migrated to a keycard\n\nBut before that, I have some questions for @messenger-team, that might result in some other issues:\n1. I see that the address used as `airdropAddress` is always the default wallet account of the logged-in user, actually the profile that is joining a community, is that what we want?\n2. I also see that we're letting users select which addresses they would like to reveal to the community, but I don't see in the code that we're letting users join the community if they didn't select the default wallet address as an address to be revealed to the community. Is that what we want? How I get it is that addresses selected to be revealed are those other community members may see, but one used for airdrop doesn't need to be revealed and I guess that's the valid case?\n3. Also not sure why we need to sign a community request [here](https://github.com/status-im/status-go/blob/ac813ef5d8f012ba4a0b532483ceeebc553aa3b1/protocol/messenger_communities.go#L987) with all addresses users want to reveal? I somehow expected a community request to be signed once, using the logged-in user chat address, not using wallet addresses.\n4. In case we really need to sign a community request for each revealed address and let's that we want to reveal X addresses where each of them belongs to a different keypair that is migrated to a keycard, then it means we need to ask used to provide X different keycard while requesting to join community process it ongoing and provide pin for each of them to complete the request? \n5. This one is not a question, but more a concern based on code I've seen today, while analyzing this issue. I see that you're fetching the accounts from the wallet-section/send module, [here](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/blob/2c5eeea50311554fad2343a4aebebfba10128a93/ui/app/AppLayouts/Wallet/stores/RootStore.qml#L21) to offer users addresses to select which addresses they would like to share when joining a token gated community and also using that model to select the airdrop address. That approach is not very good, much better is to inject wallet-accounts-service in the module where wallet-related data are necessary and grab them from that service and use them in a form you like/need. \nAn issue (that might be hidden) because of that is that there is no guarantee in the order of accounts model fetched from wallet-section/send module, especially when we know that we have drag&drop feature for accounts and that we know that accounts model is just a UI model. That further means, referring to point 1. of this comment, [this](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/blob/2c5eeea50311554fad2343a4aebebfba10128a93/ui/imports/shared/popups/CommunityIntroDialog.qml#L90) and similar approaches in other places in the app are wrong.\n\n@jrainville @alexjba @endulab @osmaczko ",
