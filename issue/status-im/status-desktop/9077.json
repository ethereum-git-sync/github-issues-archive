    "description": "Priorities **in priority order** for the 0.12 milestone:  \r\n\r\n**1. Improve performance**\r\n- Focus on eliminating any UI freezes when the user clicks on something and the app does not display an immediate response.  Target: the app should ideally respond to all user input within 50ms, but let's start with identifying the longest UI freezes and trying to fix the worst UI freezes first.\r\n- Speed and responsiveness of switching between community channels, and 1on1 and ad-hoc group chats is particularly important, especially for channels and chats that contains a lot of history.  We should aim for about 250ms delay in the *worst* case if possible.  Having a lot of history in a channel should not slow channel switching down.\r\n- DB perf optimisations.  \r\n- Move things to async and off main thread\r\n- See Alex's great profiling work for possible tasks (Alex to continue focusing on perf. for this release cycle)\r\n- \"user facing performance in everyday app usage\" is the top priority, but any task that improves performance is worthwhile\r\n\r\n**2. Finish development of token based functionality from 0.11**\r\n- Optimise No. queries made by owner node when checking member tokens (Pascal)\r\n- Community encryption should automatically switch on/off depending on community permissions (issue #9942)\r\n- Implement the 'Admin' role (issue #10114)\r\n- Airdrop to community members (in addition to addresses)\r\n- Optimise gas required by collectable minting smart contracts (issue #9943, GravityBlast)\r\n--- After collectable minting gas optimisation is complete, start work on Asset minting contracts (GravityBlast)\r\n- Complete token remote destruct UI\r\n- Remove 'Community Permissions Settings', 'Community Tokens' and 'Discord Import Tool' feature flags (issue #10115)\r\n- Thoroughly test, and fix all bugs found. \r\n- Anything else related to Community level token permissions, collectable minting, airdropping, and remote destructing that didn't make it into 0.11\r\n\r\n**3. Finish implementing the ability for Community Owners and Admins to drag and drop channels and categories into different orders**\r\n\r\n**4. Finish anything related to the initial pairing process for syncing that wasn't completed in 0.11** (Igor)\r\n\r\n**5. Improve Mutual Contacts functionality to improve reliability and pay off tech debt** (Mishka)\r\n\r\n**6. Complete Community Directory Curation dApp integration inc. Featured functionality** (Patryk)\r\n \r\n**7. Backend for the Profile Showcase**\r\n\r\n**8. Identity Verification** (required for 'Profile Showcase')\r\n\r\n**9. Fix bugs, bugs and more bugs!**\r\n- Esp. find the cause of and fix the longstanding bug of some 'requests to join' not arriving for hours/days after they were sent!\r\n- Many 'fit and finish' bugs for the UI team\r\n\r\n**--- For the Wallet team ---**\r\n\r\n1. Continue feature development inc. kicking off development of the activity screens\r\n2. 'All accounts' section.  The ability to return all tokens owned by the user in all accounts (excluding watch only accounts) is also required for the Showcase functionality\r\n3. Widen scope of 'backup to waku' and 'syncing' so that all relevant Wallet user state is backed up and synced between devices\r\n4. Continue to ensure Wallet functionality is performant.\r\n5. Fix wallet bugs",

  "body": "Skeleton loading states are currently being developed for wallet via the following issue:\r\nhttps://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/7661#issuecomment-1378622237\r\n\r\nIn order to design the counterpart load failure states for these, we need to first define the potential load failure scenarios we wish to support for wallet.\r\n\r\nOnce we have a comprehensive list of ways in which a page, tab or list item may fail to load, we can design a solution that is extensible to all scenarios and considered for all platforms.\r\n\r\nThe below questions are the kinds of things it would be great to know but as much detail as possible would be ideal: \r\n\r\n- Can there be an entire page load failure? Eg you tap on wallet and nothing loads\r\n- Can the contents of an entire tab fail to load? Eg you tap on Assets, Collectibles or Activity and nothing loads.\r\n- What matrix of load failures do we need to support for each asset, collectible and activity item? If some of the data fails to load do we show the entire item as failing to load or should we show what has loaded and present an error for each of the data points that has failed to load? Eg could the collectible name load but not the thumbnail or vice vera? For assets, could the token name and logo load but none of the data or vice versa?. Or could the asset name, logo and quantity load but not the % change? Is it possible for us to know the user has a certain number of assets but no data for any of them load?\r\n\r\nAlso, should the user encounter a data load failure, what are the actions we can invite them to take? Is it possible/worthwhile providing a 'Retry' / 'Reload' action. What other things should they check/try before they do: that they are connected to the network/check peers/ restart app etc?\r\n\r\n@alaibe \r\n@Khushboo-dev-cpp \r\n@stefandunca \r\n@dlipicar \r\n\r\n",

Calls to Infura exhausted for the day\r\n2. Infura is down\r\n-  No assets values for an account\r\n-  No new history fetches ?\r\n-  Send/Bridge not possible\r\n4. Opensea is down\r\n- No collectibles listed at all\r\n5. Crypto compare is down\r\n- Market values will not be loaded on main page and details page\r\n6. Any if the above are not available in current location of user we have seen this with opensea. \r\nI am sure I may be missing some more scenarios. Please add more @alaibe ?",
