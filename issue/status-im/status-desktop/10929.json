    "description": "**1. Finish anything that wasn't completed in the previous 0.16 cycle**\r\n\r\n- And fix bugs as usual.  We need to keep tech. debt at a roughly fixed level as we grow out functionality, can't let it accumulate! ;-)\r\n\r\n- Ensure accounts stored on Keycard are taken into consideration for community permissions\r\n\r\n**2. Token import functionality**\r\n- Ability for a community Owner to import ERC-20 and NFT tokens, to later be airdropped or retailed\r\n\r\n**3. Sending tokens to other users in chat**\r\n- Rebuild this functionality, based on a new design that utilizes the profile showcase functionality\r\n\r\n**4. Binaries over Waku**\r\n- Improve transfer of binaries over waku via splitting into chunks https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/9923\r\n- Posting of small files (max size somewhere in the region of 1 to 2mb).  Requires above item before going live\r\n\r\n**5. Chat functionality enhancements**\r\n- Introduce @channel as a new type of global @ mention.  This @ mention only @ mention's everyone who has posted a message in a channel in the last 30 days \r\n- Introduce the ability to search the users in the right side members/users bar.  At the same time, make any adaptations needed so that the right side members/users bar can scale to 10,000 users.\r\n\r\n**6. Automatic bandwidth test on app startup**\r\n- automatic bandwidth test on app startup, and use results to automatically configure the waku shard usage appropriately depending on the available bandwidth (at the 'user has tons of bandwidth' end of the spectrum all waku shards will use waku Relay mode, at the 'user has very little bandwidth' end of the spectrum all waku shards will use waku filter + light push mode, and in between these two ends of the spectrum the user will use a mix of waku relay mode and waku filter + light push mode for different shards).  Plus also use  the results of the bandwidth test to automatically set the bittorred throttling at an appropriate setting at the beginning of each new session.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
