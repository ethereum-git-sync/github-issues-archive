    "description": "**1. Finish anything that wasn't completed in the previous 0.19 cycle**\r\n\r\n\r\n**2. Opt-in auto-update functionality**\r\n\r\n- Desktop app downloads update in the background, displays global informing user that update is available.  When user presses the 'Update' button, Status Desktop closes and simultaneously automatically launches an 'updater' app that performs the update.  When the update is complete, the 'updater app' closes itself and re-launches Status Desktop.  Or something like that ;-)\r\n\r\n**3. Telegram history import into a single channel in an existing community**\r\n\r\n**4. Message input improvements**\r\n\r\n- Fix all bugs with message input component\r\n\r\n- Needs to handle markdown entered into the message input field correctly\r\n\r\n- Add SpellChecking\r\n\r\n\r\n**5. Automatic bandwidth test on app startup**\r\n- automatic bandwidth test on app startup, and use results to automatically configure the waku shard usage appropriately depending on the available bandwidth (at the 'user has tons of bandwidth' end of the spectrum all waku shards will use waku Relay mode, at the 'user has very little bandwidth' end of the spectrum all waku shards will use waku filter + light push mode, and in between these two ends of the spectrum the user will use a mix of waku relay mode and waku filter + light push mode for different shards).  Plus also use  the results of the bandwidth test to automatically set the bittorred throttling at an appropriate setting at the beginning of each new session.\r\n\r\n\r\n**6. Stress testing and perf**\r\n\r\n- Create a test user account with 5,000 mutual contacts. See what breaks, or if this causes poor performance. Then fix whatever found. Realistically the requirement is 'only' for the experience of having up to 2,000 mutual contacts to work well. But if we test with 5,000 mutual contacts, it will make it easier to see issues.\r\n\r\n- Create a test community that contains 20,000 members. Test, see what breaks and what perf. issues are encountered. Then fix whatever needs fixing. Member bar is probably one area that will have issues\r\n\r\n**7. Audio messages**\r\n\r\n- Re-enable the posting of Audio messages in 1on1, ad-hoc group chats and community chats\r\n\r\n\r\n**8. Restart work on Browser**\r\n\r\n- Start with conducting a spike to work out how can ensure we always have the latest version of Chromium in our app.  If a security critical bug is fixed in Chromium, how can we have that fix in our app in 24h to 48h?\r\n\r\n- Do we need to automate building our own fork of QtWebEngine, so we can create new builds of QtWebEngine each time a new version of Chromium is released?\r\n\r\n- Can we use the UnGoogled version of Chromium?\r\n\r\n- We need to answer the above questions before proceeding further with the browser work.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Possible items (these will probably be shifted to a subsequent milestone)**\r\n- Code Formatting\r\n- Start ENS functionality redesign/rebuild\r\n- Linking to Messages\r\n\r\n",
