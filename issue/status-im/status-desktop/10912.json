There's a progress bar that indicates that *something* is happening, and I'm not able yet to do anything with the app (which is fine)\r\n3. However, while this loads, I'm already getting OS notifications with messages\r\n4. This makes the impression the app is done doing its thing and was ready to receive/process messages, however it's in fact still in that loading state\r\n\r\nI propose we queue all incoming messages during loading/bootstrap and emit them to the notifier once the UI is ready/usable.\r\nOr in other words, Don't show notifications with incoming messages if I'm not yet able to view these messages.",
