  "body": "Images sent from Status Desktop do not include `width` and `height`. On `status-mobile` the image dimensions need to be known in advance for a few reasons including:\r\n\r\n1. When building a collage/album of 3 images, either one image will be displayed horizontally/landscape and the other 2 below it, or one image will be displayed vertically/portrait and the other 2 beside it. The photo's dimensions need to be known to know which style to use\r\n2. When using a loading placeholder, and making it occupy only as much space as the image\r\n\r\nAlso not having the dimensions currently causes images sent from Status Desktop to be cropped https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/issues/16048\r\n\r\nAdding for reference: `status-go` PRs that implement `image-width` and `image-height` fields: https://github.com/status-im/status-go/pull/3061, https://github.com/status-im/status-go/pull/3121",
