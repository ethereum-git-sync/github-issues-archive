And will remove them on click.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. React to a message with üëç \r\n2. Click `Add reaction` (or open message context menu)\r\n3. Note üëç is not highlighted in the popup\r\n\r\n<img width=\"534\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/25482501/364837a8-f6ee-4805-8a48-da5f10af97ce\">\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThis is a good question.\r\n\r\n1. Currently this `Add reaction` toggles the reaction, despite the name of the button. If the reactions has already been added, it will be removed. E.g. Discord does always Add the reaction, never removes it from this menu.\r\n\r\n1. I don't know if we have designs on this, but from code I can see that at some point of developing it was intended to highlight added reactions.",

    "body": "@igor-sirotin as discussed offline, it feels like the `Add reaction` emoji menu should not be a route for removing a user's existing reaction to a post - given as you say the icon and tooltip clarifying the action pertain to **adding** emoji reactions only, not removing them. \r\n\r\nAligning with Discord, clicking on the emoji you have reacted with again via the emoji menu should not remove your emoji reaction. The user should only be able to remove their emoji by clicking on it underneath the message. \r\n\r\nOne enhancement we discussed for the emoji menu was to subtly highlight (eg tick a tick or some form of wash) the emoji/s you have already reacted with so it makes it optimally clear that a) you have already reacted (especially useful for posts which have a lot of emoji reactions) and b) if so, which emoji/s you have used on the post. It is a minor annoyance for me in Discord that I don't have any feedback as to what emoji if any I have already used on a post - especially if I open the emoji menu, hit the same emoji as I used before and nothing happens except for the menu closing.\r\n\r\n@John-44 it would be great to get your thoughts on the above and confirmation of whether the enhancement mentioned should be in scope for MVP or come later.",
