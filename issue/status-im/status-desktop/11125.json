Token permissions to enable control of community smart contracts**\r\n- Before a community founder can use any of the community token admin functionality, they first have to deploy Owner and Token Master contracts.\r\n- This work involves: new empty state screen for Mint and Airdrop tokens (before current empty state screen is revealed), new flow for deploying the community's Owner and Token Master contracts in a single step, a fixed uneditable permission giving anybody who holds the Token Master token admin rights for the community should be automatically created.\r\n- Only the holder of the single Owner token can access the Token Master airdrop, remote destruct, and view holders functions. Anybody who holds the Token Master token can access all token admin options, excluding those related to the Token Master token itself, as well as being and Admin of the community.\r\n- This will all be explained in more detail in the designs.\r\n\r\nBackend Epic: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11249\r\n\r\n**2. Updates to control node transfer and associated dialogues**\r\n- Remove ability for a Owner to leave a community on the computer that's running as that community's control node\r\n- Community Admin home screen cleanup (inc. adding at least one of the three graphs, whichever is easiest to implement).\r\n  - Graph issue: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11152  \r\n  - Community overview: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11278\r\n\r\n**3. Ability for user to select & manage accounts shared with each community control node**\r\n- This item is quite a bit of work\r\n- Touches Community settings, as well as all of the community join flows\r\n- Backend issues: \r\n  - Join API: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11154\r\n  - Edit API: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11153\r\n\r\n**4. Encryption for token gated channels that are inside Open (not token gated) communities**\r\n[#10998](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/10998)\r\n\r\n**5. Final screens and bits and bobs needed prior to public beta**\r\n- Modal that's shown every time after login, reminding user's that Status Desktop is in Beta [#11044](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11044)\r\n- The bug with 'requests to join' a community not constantly arriving, or sometimes arriving after a delay, must be fixed. [#8264](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/8264)\r\n- Anything that didn't get completed in 0.13 related to new share URL format\r\n- All the outstanding bugs and small items that got pushed into the 0.14 milestone.\r\n\r\n**6. Profile showcase backend**\r\n- The long-delayed profile showcase backend!  We have the UI on the desktop ready to go for this feature, and Mobile is going to need the backend for this feature as well, so let's try to get it done in 0.14 [#11081](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11081)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**--- Things that we SHOULD NOT work on during the 0.14 cycle ---**\r\n- Messaging and UI teams shouldn't work on perf. in 0.14 (but Wallet team should!)\r\n- Anything big mutual contacts related, other than fixing small bugs we find like #10497 #10498 #11120 #11121  (hopefully this functionality working good enough now!)\r\n\r\n**--- Wallet Team ---**\r\n\r\n1. Finish any outstanding work related to Activity screens (top priority - aim to have complete by July 14th)\r\n\r\n2. Updated Wallet Settings screens UI inc. account syncing functionality  *Synced information should immediately be reflected in the UI after it is received (sometimes synced info is currently only displayed after the next app restart, this needs to be fixed)*\r\n\r\n3. Wallet performance and memory consumption optimisations\r\n\r\n4. Fix bugs, clean up loose ends (to get things in a good state before the work on the Mobile wallet starts)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nImproves https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/pull/11114\r\n\r\nIn that PR, we added the Permissions model to the curated communities model.\r\n\r\nI had to copy the `tokenListModel` and the `collectiblesListModel` creation code from the `chat_section/module` to the `communities/module` because the portal needs the assets list to display the tokens and icons correctly.\r\n\r\nOne thing that is missing is to update that model  when a new token is added, for example when it is minted in a community (either by you or the owner).\r\n\r\nSo the function called `onCommunityTokenMetadataAdded` in `chat_section/module` needs to also be copied to the `communities/module`.\r\n\r\nThis is a good opportunity to refactor that code.\r\n\r\nRight now, each section has to populate that token list. They all share the same token list (basic tokens), plus the tokens added to that particular section. This is bad for memory, but also for CPU usage, because each time a token is added, the event is processed by all sections.\r\n\r\nWe could easily just remove the token lists from the chat_section modules and instead use the one from the communities module.\r\n\r\nThe only downside is that we'd have access to tokens from all communities in the permission creation screen of a community. \r\nTo remedy this situation, we just need to add the `communityId` to the token, so that when creating a permission in a community, we only show the tokens that are from that community, or where the `communityId` is empty, meaning that they are global.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n- When a token is minted in a community, it appears in the list of tokens in the Create permission screen of the community settings\r\n- Once a permission is created using that token, it appears correctly in the community portal on that community's card.\r\n- Same thing if the creation is done by someone else (you are not the owner)\r\n",
