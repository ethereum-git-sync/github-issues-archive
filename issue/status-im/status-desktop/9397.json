  "body": "Currently, messages on the desktop app feature the time that the message was posted only (eg HH:MM AM/PM). That means the user has to scroll up or down to see the nearest date marker to understand which day the message was sent. This is less of a problem if the message happens to be posted directly before or after a date marker but can cause issues in busy channels/chats where it is less easy to gain this context by scrolling.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1038\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-02-01 at 16 58 39\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110033914/216110343-b3629f62-e9f8-4c77-a23d-9099cba22923.png\">\r\n\r\nAligning to the new mobile designs, as confirmed with @John-44, every message should feature a relative timestamp if the date and time is recent, moving to an absolute timestamp as time passes. The time is also 24 hr clock with AM/PM removed.\r\n\r\nThe timestamp conventions for mobile which should be aligned to in desktop are:\r\n\r\nToday 09:41\r\nYesterday 09:41\r\nMon 09:41\r\nSun 09:41\r\nSat 09:41\r\nFri 09:41\r\nThu 09:41\r\n25 Jan 09:41\r\nEtc\r\n31 Dec 2022 09:41",
