We need to keep tech. debt at a roughly fixed level as we grow out functionality, can't let it accumulate! ;-)\r\n\r\n**2. Tokenisation of community ownership**\r\n- Work needed already evaluated in spike.  Community and 'Channel in a Community' URLs don't need to be signed if this will present problems. Patryk to work on this as a continuation of the spike already done.\r\n- See priority 4 below, as this also has some implications for the tokenisation of community work.\r\n\r\n**3. Profile showcase backend**\r\n- The long-delayed profile showcase backend!  We have the UI on the desktop ready to go for this feature, and Mobile is going to need the backend for this feature as well, so let's try to get it done in 0.14 [#11081](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11081)\r\n\r\n**4. Community tokens visible in wallet when received by user who is not a member of that community**\r\n- Solution obvs. needs to be fully decenteralised and permissionless\r\n- Perhaps whenever a community token is A) sent from a Status Wallet to another user or B) airdropped by a community or C) retailed by a community, a M2M (invisible to the user) Waku message should be sent to the recipient's *ethereum address*?\r\n- This message could either: A) contain the metadata for the token B) tell the user that they have received token, and to check the metadata in either another Waku channel where Control Nodes periodically post Metadata OR check the metadata embedded in the token contract (embedding metadata in the token contract might be a better idea?).  \r\n- The token metadata stored in the token contract is signed by the Community's private key to ensure authenticity.  When the community's private key changes due to ownership of a community being transferred or due to the control node being moved, a transaction must be made to update this metadata so it is signed by the community's new private key.\r\n- See here for how a Waku message can be sent to and Ethereum address https://rfc.vac.dev/spec/20/\r\n\r\n**5. Discord history import into a single channel in an existing community**\r\n- Pay off any Discord history import service tech. debt first\r\n- Then build the import into a single channel functionality, designs for this are already complete\r\n\r\n**6. UI for community owner to enable manual Waku static shading for their community**\r\n- This will be off by default in 0.15\r\n- This UI is only for the Owner of a community (not TokenMasters or Admins)\r\n- Figma designs are here https://www.figma.com/file/qHfFm7C9LwtXpfdbxssCK3/Kuba%E2%8E%9CDesktop---Communities?type=design&node-id=37242%3A222352&mode=design&t=rw6q6NQYmiz3rSn2-1\r\n\r\n**7. Community chat functionality enhancements**\r\n- Ability to mark a token gated channel as 'hidden', only visible to community members with the requisite tokens\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**--- Wallet Team ---**\r\n\r\n1.

  "body": "The design of the wallet settings area for the mobile app has uncovered a number of small enhancements we can also bring to desktop for alignment. I've done my best to be as detailed on those changes below. \n\n\n**Wallet settings designs Figma**\nhttps://www.figma.com/file/idUoxN7OIW2Jpp3PMJ1Rl8/%E2%9A%99%EF%B8%8F-Settings-%7C-Desktop?type=design&node-id=15264-338833&mode=design&t=iftwPJwVkmFPNGIT-4\n\n\n--\n\n\n1. Consistency in terminology: Any reference to `Keys` or `Master keys` or `Master keypairs` are now all replaced with `Keypairs` for consistency. This change impacts many of the menu, screens and dialogs in the wallet settings area including CTAs and validation. E.g:\n\n<img width=\"661\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-07-25 at 15 55 56\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/110033914/d063af61-c3a8-4a4d-be72-255301e346fc\">\n\n<img width=\"452\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-07-25 at 15 56 30\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/110033914/94c5cd42-ac80-47d8-94d6-d92875c10a84\">\n\n\n--\n\n\n\n2. Change in terminology: Any reference to `Watch-only` or `Watch-only accounts` has been changed to `Watched address` or `Watched addresses` (if plural).\n\n<img width=\"784\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-07-25 at 15 37 21\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/110033914/f4004370-7aa5-456f-a352-2ce88edab8d0\">\n\n<img width=\"1154\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-07-25 at 15 37 52\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/110033914/b5fd074b-3126-4a43-8d27-725f3c6defc3\">\n\n\n--\n\n\n3. Change in terminology: Instead of referring to synced keys, we refer to `added` keypairs which require import. This change is made mainly in the following flows:\nhttps://www.figma.com/file/idUoxN7OIW2Jpp3PMJ1Rl8/%E2%9A%99%EF%B8%8F-Settings-%7C-Desktop?type=design&node-id=15777-377915&mode=design&t=iftwPJwVkmFPNGIT-4\n\nSpecifically:\n\n\n--\n\n\na) Copy change in the `Key syncing` panel (which is dynamically shown on the device which has added new keypairs and accounts to enable the user to add those keypairs/accounts to their synced devices via the QR button).\n\nOld copy: `Key syncing`\nNew copy: `Import keypairs from this device to your other synced devices` \n\nNew design:\nhttps://www.figma.com/file/idUoxN7OIW2Jpp3PMJ1Rl8/%E2%9A%99%EF%B8%8F-Settings-%7C-Desktop?type=design&node-id=17597-392050&mode=design&t=iftwPJwVkmFPNGIT-4\n\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"Wallet\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/110033914/1c125b42-926e-44e5-b251-fd8d931cd4b1\">\n\nOld design:\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"Wallet\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/110033914/17368467-663b-4ba2-80e2-92c44c2be024\">\n\n\n--\n\n\nb) On the counterparty device - the one where the new keypair needs to be added, there is a copy change in the `Import` panel:\n\nOld copy: `Key syncing`\nOld CTA: `Import missing keys to this device` (button also now orange)\n\nNew copy: \n- If 1 keypair requires import: `1 keypair requires import to use on this device`\n- If >1 keypair requires import: `2 keypairs require import to use on this device`\nNew CTA: \n- If 1 keypair requires import: `Import missing keypair` \n- If >1 keypair requires import: `Import 2 missing keypairs`\n\nNew design:\nhttps://www.figma.com/file/idUoxN7OIW2Jpp3PMJ1Rl8/%E2%9A%99%EF%B8%8F-Settings-%7C-Desktop?type=design&node-id=15777-377334&mode=design&t=iftwPJwVkmFPNGIT-4\n\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"Wallet\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/110033914/1d7fa28e-51b7-41b5-a793-7b56dc8cd36c\">\n\nOld design:\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"Wallet\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/110033914/053b349d-2be9-4175-9989-194759caa88d\">\n\nNote: the orange text below the keypair name of the keypair that requires import has also changed format to specify the date the keypair was originally added.\nOld copy format: `Synced from [device name] - finalise import to use accounts`\nNew copy format: `Added to [device name] - [date added to device]` -- IGNORE!\n\n\n--\n\n\nc) Copy change to finalise import dialog header:\nOld dialog title: `Finalise import of synced keys`\nNew dialog title: `Import missing keypairs`\n\nOld dialog copy: `[n] public keys have been synced from [n] devices. To use the associated accounts on this device, you will also need to import the keypairs.`\nNew dialog copy: `To use the associated accounts on this device, you need to import their keypairs.`\nNB - each list item was also previously formatted: `Import [n] keypair from [device name]`, now it is written: `From [device name]` as the list item reads on from the title, i.e. `Import missing keypairs... from [device name]`. There is also an additional label within the device grouping at the top right clarifying how many keypairs will be imported: `Import [n] keypairs`. Finally, there is a slight design change to the layout of the keypair list items within the device grouping - note the slight separation / padding between the keypairs in the new design.\n\nNew design:\nhttps://www.figma.com/file/idUoxN7OIW2Jpp3PMJ1Rl8/%E2%9A%99%EF%B8%8F-Settings-%7C-Desktop?type=design&node-id=15778-380982&mode=design&t=iftwPJwVkmFPNGIT-4\n\n<img width=\"480\" alt=\"Finalise import5\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/110033914/69f0bd33-4eb6-4336-99f8-2589a06acde3\">\n\nOld design:\n<img width=\"480\" alt=\"Finalise import2\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/110033914/f193d6f5-a45a-4301-a241-25e68380fd25\">\n\n\n--\n\n\nd) Title changed on dialog where user selects import method.\nOld dialog title: `Import [keypair name] keypair from [device name]`\nNew dialog title: `Import [keypair name]`\n\nNew design:\nhttps://www.figma.com/file/idUoxN7OIW2Jpp3PMJ1Rl8/%E2%9A%99%EF%B8%8F-Settings-%7C-Desktop?type=design&node-id=15778-381242&mode=design&t=iftwPJwVkmFPNGIT-4\n\n<img width=\"480\" alt=\"Finalise import3\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/110033914/63c81a7a-818c-4a0f-b56d-2be0fc9fbae8\">\n\nOld design:\n<img width=\"480\" alt=\"Finalise import4\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/110033914/da8b8d0e-f8cb-447d-ac37-495ea7b31f77\">\n\n\n--\n\n\ne) Copy change on toast messages:\nUse `keypair` instead of the other variants of this term described above\n\nEg:\nDesign:\nhttps://www.figma.com/file/idUoxN7OIW2Jpp3PMJ1Rl8/%E2%9A%99%EF%B8%8F-Settings-%7C-Desktop?type=design&node-id=15814-383391&mode=design&t=iftwPJwVkmFPNGIT-4\n\n<img width=\"428\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-07-25 at 16 54 10\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/110033914/3cde6010-f41b-4abf-a6f5-9e3721393a00\">\n\n\n--\n\n\nf) Copy change on CTA for Import via seed phrase and private key dialogs:\nOld CTA copy: `Import [keypair name] key`\nNew dialog title: `Import [keypair name] keypair`\n\nPrivate key:\nhttps://www.figma.com/file/idUoxN7OIW2Jpp3PMJ1Rl8/%E2%9A%99%EF%B8%8F-Settings-%7C-Desktop?type=design&node-id=15778-384761&mode=design&t=iftwPJwVkmFPNGIT-4\n\nSeed phrase:\nhttps://www.figma.com/file/idUoxN7OIW2Jpp3PMJ1Rl8/%E2%9A%99%EF%B8%8F-Settings-%7C-Desktop?type=design&node-id=15778-384802&mode=design&t=iftwPJwVkmFPNGIT-4\n\n\n--\n\n\nf) Copy and CTA change on account page in wallet settings (keypair requires import)\n\nNew design:\nhttps://www.figma.com/file/idUoxN7OIW2Jpp3PMJ1Rl8/%E2%9A%99%EF%B8%8F-Settings-%7C-Desktop?type=design&node-id=15778-386239&mode=design&t=iftwPJwVkmFPNGIT-4\n\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"Finalise import6\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/110033914/76b48149-ff52-4337-9e1b-c1cdff32c765\">\n\nOld design:\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"Finalise import7\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/110033914/9751aa2b-f379-4aff-9f03-a634ac497f10\">\n\n\n--\n\n\ng) Copy and CTA change on account in wallet (keypair requires import)\n\nNew design:\nhttps://www.figma.com/file/idUoxN7OIW2Jpp3PMJ1Rl8/%E2%9A%99%EF%B8%8F-Settings-%7C-Desktop?type=design&node-id=15778-386172&mode=design&t=iftwPJwVkmFPNGIT-4\n\n<img width=\"1188\" alt=\"Account\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/110033914/4163fe25-b949-466d-8b4c-67deb9452b0b\">\n\n\nOld design:\n\n<img width=\"1188\" alt=\"Account2\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/110033914/4ab17f80-180b-4e5f-89a3-a7ea69658a5c\">\n\n\n--\n\n\nh) Copy change on QR generation dialog instructions (to reference new import button labelling):\n\nOld copy: `On your other device, navigate to the Wallet screen\nand select ‘Finalise import of synced keypairs’.

The intention is that the signposting, copy and flows will be the same for the user irrespective of if the missing keypair is a result of  a waku backup or if the keypair has been added to a synced device and not yet imported. I will create a separate issue for that once the mobile designs are finalised and ready to be rolled out to desktop.\n\ncc. @John-44 @xAlisher @saledjenic ",
