    "body": "This is the \"wanted\" behaviour in status-go:\r\n```go\r\n// ErrAccountAlreadyExists is returned if an account attempted to import is\r\n// already present in the keystore.\r\nErrAccountAlreadyExists = errors.New(\"account already exists\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe have 2 options:\r\n- Show a warning in the UI saying \"you can't import this account again, it already exists\". We can also tell them if they lost their password, they can delete the database and re-import\r\n- Edit status-go to permit doing that, but then, it wouldn't re-encrypt the existing DB. We'd need to erase the previous one and re-create it, so the user might get bamboozled\r\n- I guess there is a third option which is the mix of both where we still return the error as it is from status-go, we show a warning in the UI, but add a button that says \"I want to create a new DB I understand that I'll lose my data\", then we create a new status-go endpoint that does what I said above, forces the deletion of the old DB and re-creates it.\r\n\r\ncc'ing @iurimatias and @cammellos for their opinion on the matter",
