We need to keep tech. debt at a roughly fixed level as we grow out functionality, can't let it accumulate! ;-)\r\n\r\n**2. Tokenisation of community ownership**\r\n- Work needed already evaluated in spike.  Community and 'Channel in a Community' URLs don't need to be signed if this will present problems. Patryk to work on this as a continuation of the spike already done.\r\n- See priority 4 below, as this also has some implications for the tokenisation of community work.\r\n\r\n**3. Profile showcase backend**\r\n- The long-delayed profile showcase backend!  We have the UI on the desktop ready to go for this feature, and Mobile is going to need the backend for this feature as well, so let's try to get it done in 0.14 [#11081](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11081)\r\n\r\n**4. Community tokens visible in wallet when received by user who is not a member of that community**\r\n- Solution obvs. needs to be fully decenteralised and permissionless\r\n- Perhaps whenever a community token is A) sent from a Status Wallet to another user or B) airdropped by a community or C) retailed by a community, a M2M (invisible to the user) Waku message should be sent to the recipient's *ethereum address*?\r\n- This message could either: A) contain the metadata for the token B) tell the user that they have received token, and to check the metadata in either another Waku channel where Control Nodes periodically post Metadata OR check the metadata embedded in the token contract (embedding metadata in the token contract might be a better idea?).  \r\n- The token metadata stored in the token contract is signed by the Community's private key to ensure authenticity.  When the community's private key changes due to ownership of a community being transferred or due to the control node being moved, a transaction must be made to update this metadata so it is signed by the community's new private key.\r\n- See here for how a Waku message can be sent to and Ethereum address https://rfc.vac.dev/spec/20/\r\n\r\n**5. Discord history import into a single channel in an existing community**\r\n- Pay off any Discord history import service tech. debt first\r\n- Then build the import into a single channel functionality, designs for this are already complete\r\n\r\n**6. UI for community owner to enable manual Waku static shading for their community**\r\n- This will be off by default in 0.15\r\n- This UI is only for the Owner of a community (not TokenMasters or Admins)\r\n- Figma designs are here https://www.figma.com/file/qHfFm7C9LwtXpfdbxssCK3/Kuba%E2%8E%9CDesktop---Communities?type=design&node-id=37242%3A222352&mode=design&t=rw6q6NQYmiz3rSn2-1\r\n\r\n**7. Community chat functionality enhancements**\r\n- Ability to mark a token gated channel as 'hidden', only visible to community members with the requisite tokens\r\n\r\n**8. Refactor synchronisation of contacts**\r\n- To fix various contact request issues, is a large work item\r\n- Mishka and Igor to work on this?\r\n- https://github.com/status-im/status-go/issues/3720\r\n- https://github.com/status-im/status-go/issues/3803#issuecomment-1654588500\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**--- Wallet Team ---**\r\n\r\n1.

    "body": "Hi @caybro. At this very moment I'm working on the mobile side and just yesterday me and a couple other designers, including Ben and John, discussed a bunch of details, but the designs are pretty stable as far as I understand.\r\n\r\nI believe you'll be able to start working on the desktop side _without_ dummy data as early as next week, since I'm going to open the status-go PR this week (it may be a bit rough on the edges, but totally usable). But as you said, I started with dummy data on the client in the beginning too, so that works of course.\r\n\r\nLet's keep in touch since the new link unfurling code will still evolve a couple PRs down the road. Thanks\r\n\r\n>  Then when @ilmotta let's folks know here that the status-go implementation has stabilised, the UI components can then be wired to the backed at that point.\r\n\r\nWill do :+1:  @John-44",

Figma designs recently changed because you can see in the screenshot I took in https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/issues/17073 that the small top left circle had the image preview itself and there was no first letter of the domain to show.\r\n\r\nAbout the `S` prefix shown in the following image, I don't understand the value for the user, at least in the Figma example. @benjthayer, could you help us understand this requirement?

While it can be considered duplicative of the URL, it is in place as much to standardise the design for all cards - so there is the same layout and margins etc between previews with and without favicons.\r\n\r\ncc @mariocnovoa ",
