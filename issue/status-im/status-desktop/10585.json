    "body": "Hi @caybro. At this very moment I'm working on the mobile side and just yesterday me and a couple other designers, including Ben and John, discussed a bunch of details, but the designs are pretty stable as far as I understand.\r\n\r\nI believe you'll be able to start working on the desktop side _without_ dummy data as early as next week, since I'm going to open the status-go PR this week (it may be a bit rough on the edges, but totally usable). But as you said, I started with dummy data on the client in the beginning too, so that works of course.\r\n\r\nLet's keep in touch since the new link unfurling code will still evolve a couple PRs down the road. Thanks\r\n\r\n>  Then when @ilmotta let's folks know here that the status-go implementation has stabilised, the UI components can then be wired to the backed at that point.\r\n\r\nWill do :+1:  @John-44",
