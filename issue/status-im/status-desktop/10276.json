Finish items started in 0.12**\r\n- Complete any outstanding issues related to pairing (for syncing) - Igor\r\n- Implement the 'Admin' role (issue #10114) - Mykhailo\r\n- Any remaining work to pay off tech. debt related to mutual contacts - Mishka\r\n- When creating/editing token based permission, ability to search for and selecting Collectables from OpenSea - MichaelC\r\n\r\n**2. Channel token permissions**\r\n- Create, edit and delete channel token permissions in the permissions admin screens\r\n- This includes the \"no tokens required to view this channel\" permission\r\n- All user facing channel token permissions functionality e.g. what happens when a user tries to access a token gated channel they don't have the required tokens to access, what happens when a user only has permissions to view a channel, etc...\r\n- If a community is an open (not token gated at the community level) community, if a channel is token gated AND if **no** \"no tokens required to view this channel\" permission for that channel exists, then the channel should be automatically encrypted.  If token gating is removed from a channel, the channel should become unencrypted.\r\n\r\n**3. DB perf improvements**\r\n- https://www.notion.so/Database-related-performance-1dbaa7ea894c461d885e55676683be07\r\n- Alex and Patryk to work on this, with help from Lukáš\r\n\r\n**4. Update app to use new 'Share URL' formats**\r\n- add functionality to status-go to generate the new 'Share URL' formats for sharing links to: User Profiles, Communities, Channel inside a Community\r\n- Update everywhere a user can share a URL from to use the new URL format\r\n- New/updated URL unroll designs for inside chat, including specific unrolls for the new User Profile, Community and Channel inside a Community URLs\r\n- Ability to share a URL that points to a specific channel in a community (issue #10160)\r\n- Update all address inputs to accept a user pasting a 'share URL' into the input (in addition to being able to input the raw address).  This includes: Start new chat input, send contact request input in Settings, the import community key input, etc...\r\n- Update Status Desktops URL handler so that if Status is installed on a computer, when a user clicks on a Status 'Share URL' the app is launched (if not already running) and after signing in the user is automatically taken to the entity the Share URL represented inside the app.  e.g. if a user clicks on a URL for a Status Community, the user should be taken to the home screen for that community inside the Status App\r\n\r\n**5. Mint Assets functionality**\r\n- Also includes some small improvements to the mint Collectables functionality\r\n- Noelia, GravityBlast\r\n\r\n**6. Profile showcase backend**\r\n\r\n\r\n**--- For the Wallet team ---**\r\ntldr; continue building out Ben's wallet designs\r\n\r\n1. Complete any outstanding development related to the activity screens\r\n2. All accounts overview screens\r\n3. New settings screens\r\n4.

  "body": "I had to restore my account from seed phrase, and the following happened:\r\n\r\n1) The \"Fetching data...\" screen was correctly displayed.  Notice that it's telling me that \"1/1\" of my profile records have been successfully fetched\r\n\r\n![2023-04-12 18_06_25-Status Desktop](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22846356/231532678-7778b667-245f-4290-8974-c73561f6478a.png)\r\n\r\n2) However after waiting for two minutes and then pressing the \"Continue\" button, I was taken to the 'Unable to fetch your profile' screen, which is the screen a user should see when their user profile data (username, avatar, etc...) has *not* been fetched.\r\n\r\n![2023-04-12 18_08_16-Status Desktop](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22846356/231533074-50dbd38b-2a49-415f-8a2e-80628ca22862.png)\r\n\r\n3) I then pressed the \"Try to fetch profile again\" button (even though I know this should only induce two minute delay to see if further data arrives from Waku).  The app appeared to crash, and was unresponsive for several minutes\r\n\r\n4) Then just as I was about to force quite the app, it unfroze and took me back to the \"Fetching data...\" screen (it should have displayed this screen immediately after I pressed the \"Try to fetch profile again\" button on the proceeding screen).  Strangely, this screen now says that \"9/10\" of 'Community membership' information is downloaded, when the previous time this screen was displayed (in step 1) it said that \"9/9\" of 'Community membership' information was successfully downloaded,\r\n\r\n![2023-04-12 18_11_07-Status Desktop](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22846356/231534545-351ad109-bef6-4bd8-95ca-79ba2dc99b78.png)\r\n\r\n5) After waiting on the \"Fetching data...\" screen for around 5min I pressed the \"Continue\" button again, and was taken to the 'Unable to fetch your profile' screen again\r\n\r\n![2023-04-12 18_08_16-Status Desktop](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22846356/231535098-2f82a6b0-a441-45c5-b70a-237938ec213e.png)\r\n\r\n6) This time I pressed the \"Create new profile with the same chatkey\" button, and entered my chat name and chose an avatar image.  *Issue minor here: when I pressed the primary action button, the app froze for about a second before I was taken to the loading screen\"\r\n\r\nGood news: when I arrived back in Status, my communities were restored and it looks like my mutual contacts were restored :-)\r\n\r\n**Summary of the issues found**\r\n\r\n**Issue 1:** Restore of my username and avatar failed even though the \"Fetching data...\" screen told me that this information had been successfully restored.\r\n\r\n**Issue 2:** App froze for several minutes after pressing the \"Try to fetch profile again\" button on the 'Unable to fetch your profile' screen,\r\n\r\n**Issue 3:** The second time I viewed the \"Fetching data...\" screen (after pressing the \"Try to fetch profile again\" button), it showed that there were 10 pieces of community membership information (even though the last time I was on this screen in the same flow it said there were only 9 pieces of community membership information).  This 10th piece of community membership information never downloaded, even after waiting for more than 5 minutes.\r\n\r\n**Issue 4.** Even though my mutual contacts had been restored, the secondary nav bar in the messages section was empty.  I know that the chat history for 1on1 and ad-hoc group chats cannot be restored due to 'perfect forward secrecy', however at a minimum I should be able to see the ad-hoc group chats that I'm part of (even though there would be no history in them), because without this I have no way of knowing the ad-hoc group chats I'm in.  It would also be good for the 1on1 chats to be restored (again, even though the history in these chats can't be restored).  \r\n\r\nSo I think we should:\r\n- Add a list of the ad-hoc group chats and 1on1 chats the user is in, and the *recency order* of these chats to the data we back up to Waku.\r\n- When the user restores from a backup to waku, we should use this data to repopulate the list of 1on1 and ad-hoc group chats the user is in in the 'Messages' section of the app. \r\n\r\n I've done a seperate, more detailed writup of this issue here **https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/10324**\r\n\r\n**Possible minor improvement idea:** Because I haven't been using a keycard, on the \"Fetching data...\" screen the \"Keycards\" spinner was always spinning\r\n![2023-04-12 18_30_48-2023-04-12 18_06_25-Status Desktop png ‎- Photos](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22846356/231537630-5003bc97-33fd-4896-aa84-8431e251a2c1.png)\r\nIf a user isn't doesn't have any data to back up to waku in any category, how about if we backup to waku a message which tells us that 'the user has no information to backup to waku in this category'.  In my particular case that's described above, such a message could be used to show \"0/0\" and a green bar against \"Keycards\".  \r\n\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\nThere are bunch of issues in this issue, they should probably be split up into different issues so they can be worked on separately.  Sorry for not doing this, I just wanted to get everything I had just experienced written down quickly, and I've got a bunch of other things waiting on me.  \r\n\r\n",
