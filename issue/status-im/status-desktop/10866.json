Complete initial airdrop functionality**\r\n- Airdrop history screens\r\n- Ability to airdrop based on in-Community activity (No. of msg, No. msg in time range, joining a community, length of community membership)  Ability to combine multiple attributes into an airdrop\r\n- Ability to token gate airdrops\r\n- Live airdrop gas estimation when setting up airdrop\r\n\r\n**3.

Admin functionality enhancements**\r\n- Ability to mark a token gated channel as 'hidden', only visible to community members with the requisite tokens\r\n- optional service to once a month auto-kick all members who haven't been online for between 30 and 60 days (e.g. auto-kick members whose profile information like Name, Avatar, etc... can no longer be fetched)\r\n\r\n**5.

  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nRelated to https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/10863\r\n\r\nCurrently, it's the receivers that fetch the data from links, but with the new feature added with the issue above, it's the sender that will fetch the data and send it with the message.\r\n\r\nThis issue is to add a setting in the Messaging section. Above `Display Message Link Previews`, add a setting to enable or disable that fetch.\r\n\r\nFeel free to find a name for it or ask designers for one.\r\n\r\nThere might already be a setting in status-go for that. You can ask @ilmotta for it.\r\nIf there is not, then you can just use a QT setting instead for simplicity\r\n\r\nThis issue is gonna be easier to implement once https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/10863 is done, but it can be implemented parallel or before, especially if the setting is already in status-go.\r\nIt's also possible that #10863 depends on that setting, but we can hardcode it when working on it, so it's not 100% necessary to have it.\r\n\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n- There is a new switch setting in the Messaging section that enables and disables the fetching and sending of data from links\r\n- When the setting is ON, the feature to fetch and send link data with messages is activated.\r\n- When the setting is OFF, that feature is deactivated, meaning there is NO fetch (no call to status-go and the web when typing a link) and no additional data sent with the message; ie the link is sent bare and the receiver will NOT have an unfurl, at least after https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/10863 is implemented\r\n\r\n",
