    "body": "Currently the logic is split between `RootStore` (using `isUserAllowedToSendMessage` and `chatInputPlaceHolderText`) and inline, directly in `ChatColumnView.qml` bindings. In RootStore we handle One-to-one chats and group chats and community/channels and others seems to be handled inline, in property bindings.\r\n\r\nThe RootStore properties are also used in multiple places to enable/disable other features if the user is not allowed to send messages. This might bring inconsistencies when the chat input is disabled for reasons handled elsewhere.\r\n\r\nI think we should also review all the flows where the user is currently not allowed to send messages to determine if we need to enable/disable other features like `Delete his own messages`, `View messages received before being blocked from chat`.\r\nAfter this step we can proceed on refactoring the `enabled` and `textInput.placeholderText`.\r\n\r\nWould be nice if the refactoring brings in these improvements:\r\n1. Aggregate the business logic to be clear on which conditions the chat is disabled (probably a state based mechanism would be nice here as @alexandraB99 mentioned) and what placeholder text should be used for each case.\r\n2. Make it clear what are the conditions where other features should be enabled/disabled (Eg. `Delete his own messages`, `View messages received before being blocked from chat`)",
