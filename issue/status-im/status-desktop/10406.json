Or perhaps an issue with the export (check if other folks can see messages after 19th November 2020 in #infra) and another issue with creating new weekly archives? Or something else? ;-) \r\n\r\n",

Some archives have not been downloaded (this is unlikely because the node only starts importing into the database once all archives have been downlaoded\r\n2. All archvies are downloaded but not all have been imported. This should also not be the case, at least the node should keep importing messages from all archives that were previously downloaded\r\n\r\nIt's hard to tell without looking into the database. I do see all messages from discord in my installation.\r\nSo I think I'd have to look into your database @John-44 to figure out what's going on",
