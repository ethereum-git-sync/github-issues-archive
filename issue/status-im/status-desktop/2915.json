    "body": "This is a non issue. The test was performed under ropsten and reason the status is not updated is that -> we set the VerifyTransactionURL  to mainnet \nhttps://github.com/status-im/status-go/blob/f1569e4bde50e993611288a59b7a415a010cbfa8/params/config.go#L614\nThis is  because -> the URL for verifying transaction is a separate piece of config, we always point it to mainnet, and we don't want to change it if the user changes network, as otherwise someone could trick them and send a ropsten transaction instead of a mainnet\nSo if any one wants to test for development please set\n\"VerifyTransactionChainID\": 3 &\n \"VerifyTransactionURL\": \"https://ropset.infura.io/v3/\" & INFURA_TOKEN_RESOLVED here\n https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/blob/7f058f3141dee2e0b2a66037501475c3b1825968/src/app_service/common/account_constants.nim#L156 \n and everything should work as expected. \nThe PR only fixed the broken UI",
