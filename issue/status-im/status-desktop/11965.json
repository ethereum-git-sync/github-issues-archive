I'm not the designer, but I assume that two lines is what we aim for yes, so if it's possible to easily adjust the width so that it always fits on two lines, it would be nice.\r\n\r\nIf it's not easy to do programatically, you can try to use English, French and German and see what is the optimal width that is needed for all three languages to fit on two lines.\r\n",
