  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nThe current design approach is to use a single scrollable area in each view. This opens up a new performance challenge whenever a view contains multiple list views because the list views need to unrolled.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this task is to provide a concept of a custom layout that can arrange multiple list views and items without unrolling the list views.\r\n\r\n#### Motivated by\r\n\r\n> As a basic PoC it works nice for small number of elements. What bother me the most is performance problem that we quickly encounter for bigger, but not even really high, number of tokens. Even with e.g. 200 tokens we have really significant delays on fold/unfold and moving to hidden (in seconds). Also memory consumption goes really high.\r\n\r\n> I know that's obvious but will repeat once again (for other reviewers). We instantiate all necessary delegates for all model items up-front. We don't take advantage of built-in ListView mechanism to instantiate only what we need, because lists have height of their contentHeight. Scrolling is managed separately by outer ScrollView. And the fact that we are not taking advantage of ListView automatic delegates management is caused by specific design with 3 lists under one common scrollable with some other components in between.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> _Originally posted by @micieslak in https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/pull/12469#pullrequestreview-1716248591_\r\n            ",
