  "body": "A few issues spotted with the password change flow when using it today:\r\n\r\n1) The `Change password and restart Status` button does not actually restart status. There is a long pause followed by a final confirmation which then prompts the user to restart. I wonder if we should rename the button `Change password` and put reference to the fact a restart will be required in the copy at the top of the dialog. That way the user isn't pressing a button that says `restart` twice which feels a little odd.\r\n\r\n2) Once the new password has been validated (the password confirmation field entry matches the new password field entry), the button turns into the spinner variant. However, the spinner is static which makes the app look as if it has crashed and there is no other feedback that something is happening or what is expected of the user. We should perhaps consider some message warning the user not to quit the app during this phase of the password change especially if important re-encryption processes are ongoing?\r\n\r\n3) As with the onboarding flow where the user sets their password for the firs time, when the user is changing their password it feels consistent to also allow them to decide if they want to use biometrics for their new password at this point as opposed to having to set it up later.\r\n\r\n4) This dialog also closes when the user clicks outside of it, which if done accidentally may be quite annoying as it clears all entered passwords. It might be better if the user can only explicitly click the `X` to close this dialog.\r\n\r\n5) More of a general UX one - its better to house form labels outside of the input. Given there are 3 inputs on this form all asking for a password, having the labels omnipresent as opposed to relying on prompt text will give a little more clarity to the user and avoid them having to delete the string in order to re-reveal the prompt text to ensure they entered the correct password in the correct field.\r\n\r\n6) When the password has been successfully changed, notification bars come in displaying issues with the app which makes it look like the password changes has broken the app somehow. Not sure if it's possible to temporarily disable banners coming in if we know that the password change triggers them so we are only showing them when there is a persistent issue that is not related to the password change / re-encryption.\r\n\r\nNothing to change in development for now - these are just observations and suggestions for further discussion and may require design changes ahead of any iterative development work üëç\r\n\r\ncc @John-44 @saledjenic \r\n\r\n\r\n(NB long pause in middle of video while password change is being done)\r\nhttps://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/110033914/84902494-cec9-465c-b973-6f0a8f82f402\r\n",
