  "body": "A few issues spotted with the password change flow when using it today:\r\n\r\n1) The `Change password and restart Status` button does not actually restart status. There is a long pause followed by a final confirmation which then prompts the user to restart. I wonder if we should rename the button `Change password` and put reference to the fact a restart will be required in the copy at the top of the dialog. That way the user isn't pressing a button that says `restart` twice which feels a little odd.\r\n\r\n2) Once the new password has been validated (the password confirmation field entry matches the new password field entry), the button turns into the spinner variant. However, the spinner is static which makes the app look as if it has crashed and there is no other feedback that something is happening or what is expected of the user. We should perhaps consider some message warning the user not to quit the app during this phase of the password change especially if important re-encryption processes are ongoing?\r\n\r\n3) As with the onboarding flow where the user sets their password for the firs time, when the user is changing their password it feels consistent to also allow them to decide if they want to use biometrics for their new password at this point as opposed to having to set it up later.\r\n\r\n4) This dialog also closes when the user clicks outside of it, which if done accidentally may be quite annoying as it clears all entered passwords. It might be better if the user can only explicitly click the `X` to close this dialog.\r\n\r\n5) More of a general UX one - its better to house form labels outside of the input. Given there are 3 inputs on this form all asking for a password, having the labels omnipresent as opposed to relying on prompt text will give a little more clarity to the user and avoid them having to delete the string in order to re-reveal the prompt text to ensure they entered the correct password in the correct field.\r\n\r\n6) When the password has been successfully changed, notification bars come in displaying issues with the app which makes it look like the password changes has broken the app somehow. Not sure if it's possible to temporarily disable banners coming in if we know that the password change triggers them so we are only showing them when there is a persistent issue that is not related to the password change / re-encryption.\r\n\r\nNothing to change in development for now - these are just observations and suggestions for further discussion and may require design changes ahead of any iterative development work 👍\r\n\r\ncc @John-44 @saledjenic \r\n\r\n\r\n(NB long pause in middle of video while password change is being done)\r\nhttps://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/110033914/84902494-cec9-465c-b973-6f0a8f82f402\r\n",

    "body": "@benjthayer a few comments to your improvement proposals:\r\n\r\n> 1.\r\n\r\nGood idea for point 1. but we need to let the user know the process may take a while (basically it depends on the size of the local db, the bigger db, the longer it takes).\r\n\r\n> 2.\r\n\r\nWould be good first to check why we display that spinner static, could be that it's displayed without connection to some start/end events. But it could be also that the main event loop gets blocked somehow and that results in the stuck spinner.\r\n\r\n> 3.\r\n\r\nMakes sense.\r\n\r\n> 4.\r\n\r\nA few months ago we changed that and made all popups close if the user clicks outside of the popup or close button, in case of sensitive popups like changing password/migrating keypair or so at the point where we're doing some processing a popup is disabled and while actions are ongoing user is unable to close it (except force close the app). I wouldn't change this behavior (but that's just my opinion :) ).\r\n\r\n> 5. \r\n\r\nNot sure that I fully understand what we need to do/change here.\r\n\r\n> 6.\r\n\r\nFully agree, while the re-encryption is ongoing we should stop any app updates/actions/responses cause the only step after it will be app restart. But those banners are mostly related to point 2. where I guess the event loop gets stuck and everything gets blocked till the password is changed and that is not controlled by us but it should be.\r\n",

    "body": "Thanks for your reply @saledjenic ! Agreed with John to park this for now given there are other higher priority items to focus on but good to have these points and your thoughts logged for when we have time to focus on these enhancements. For point 5, the prompt text inside the input is the only indicator to the user what password (new or old) needs to be input. It's generally better to have any instruction to the user presented in the label above the input so that instruction does not get obscured when the input is filled: \r\n\r\nIn this state everything is fine - it is clear to the user what they need to do as the prompts inside the password inputs are seen:\r\n<img width=\"518\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-08-25 at 10 10 01\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/110033914/40f6419a-b6fd-4970-8243-8595224163b8\">\r\n\r\nHowever, in this state, if the user wants to check they've put the correct password in the correct fields (i.e. they want to ensure they haven't accidentally added the old password into the new password or new password confirmation field) they have to delete their input to reveal the prompt text again...\r\n\r\n<img width=\"515\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-08-25 at 10 10 10\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/110033914/79da424a-0f9f-46d6-b288-bc77a093ac77\">\r\n\r\n",
