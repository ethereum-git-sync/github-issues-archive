Token permissions to enable control of community smart contracts**\r\n- Before a community founder can use any of the community token admin functionality, they first have to deploy Owner and Token Master contracts.\r\n- This work involves: new empty state screen for Mint and Airdrop tokens (before current empty state screen is revealed), new flow for deploying the community's Owner and Token Master contracts in a single step, a fixed uneditable permission giving anybody who holds the Token Master token admin rights for the community should be automatically created.\r\n- Only the holder of the single Owner token can access the Token Master airdrop, remote destruct, and view holders functions. Anybody who holds the Token Master token can access all token admin options, excluding those related to the Token Master token itself, as well as being and Admin of the community.\r\n- This will all be explained in more detail in the designs.\r\n\r\n**2. Updates to control node transfer and associated dialogues**\r\n- Remove ability for a Owner to leave a community on the computer that's running as that community's control node\r\n- Community Admin home screen cleanup (inc. adding at least one of the three graphs, whichever is easiest to implement).  \r\n\r\n**3. Ability for user to select & manage accounts shared with each community control node**\r\n- This item is quite a bit of work\r\n- Touches Community settings, as well as all of the community join flows\r\n\r\n**4. Encryption for token gated channels that are inside Open (not token gated) communities**\r\n[#10998](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/10998)\r\n\r\n**5. Final screens and bits and bobs needed prior to public beta**\r\n- Modal that's shown every time after login, reminding user's that Status Desktop is in Beta [#11044](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11044)\r\n- The bug with 'requests to join' a community not constantly arriving, or sometimes arriving after a delay, must be fixed. [#8264](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/8264)\r\n- Anything that didn't get completed in 0.13 related to new share URL format\r\n- All the outstanding bugs and small items that got pushed into the 0.14 milestone.\r\n\r\n**6. Profile showcase backend**\r\n- The long-delayed profile showcase backend!  We have the UI on the desktop ready to go for this feature, and Mobile is going to need the backend for this feature as well, so let's try to get it done in 0.14 [#11081](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11081)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**--- Things that we SHOULD NOT work on during the 0.14 cycle ---**\r\n- Messaging and UI teams shouldn't work on perf. in 0.14 (but Wallet team should!)\r\n- Anything mutual contacts related, other than #10497 #10498 (hopefully this functionality working good enough now!)\r\n\r\n**--- Wallet Team ---**\r\n\r\n1. Finish any outstanding work related to Activity screens (top priority - aim to have complete by July 14th)\r\n\r\n2. Updated Wallet Settings screens UI inc. account syncing functionality  *Synced information should immediately be reflected in the UI after it is received (sometimes synced info is currently only displayed after the next app restart, this needs to be fixed)*\r\n\r\n3. Wallet performance and memory consumption optimisations\r\n\r\n4. Fix bugs, clean up loose ends (to get things in a good state before the work on the Mobile wallet starts)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

  "body": "Big lines of the feature:\r\n- Create, edit and delete channel token permissions in the permissions admin screens\r\n- All user facing channel token permissions functionality e.g. what happens when a user tries to access a token gated channel they don't have the required tokens to access, what happens when a user only has permissions to view a channel, etc...\r\n- If a community is an open (not token gated at the community level) community, if a channel is token gated, then the channel should be automatically encrypted. If token gating is removed from a channel, the channel should become unencrypted.\r\n\r\nIssues will be attached to this Epic to track them.\r\n\r\nI recommend starting with a normal \"read and write\" channel and then we can do a \"read only channel\".\r\n\r\nThe harder part is making sure encryption works well on the backend per channel. So a good starting issue would be to create the backend to handle the keys/encryption for specific users for specific channels. It,s possible to use the same `groupID` for all the channels in the permission, but it might be simpler to have a different `groupID` per channel \r\n\r\nContact @Samyoul before starting work on this to get tips and also see where he is at, because he was improving the key propagation mechanism.\r\n\r\nDesign: [Permissions](https://www.figma.com/file/17fc13UBFvInrLgNUKJJg5/Kuba%E2%8E%9CDesktop?type=design&node-id=2934-478959&t=8nkvY8DpjdyRPXsM-0)\r\n\r\nTasks:\r\n\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/10993\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/10995\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/10996\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/10997\r\n\r\nFor 0.14:\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/10998",

    "body": "Ah! Found it. We can disable the `Who holds` section and then that means \"everyone is allowed to...\". See here: https://www.figma.com/file/17fc13UBFvInrLgNUKJJg5/Kuba%E2%8E%9CDesktop?type=design&node-id=2934-478959&t=8nkvY8DpjdyRPXsM-0\r\n\r\nTo be honest, it's not clear in Figma, and even for the user, it's not super clear.\r\n\r\nAnyway, so that would be the way to create a read-only channel for all users.\r\n\r\nSo what I meant in the description is that if a channel is read-only for everyone, then we do NOT encrypt it. Even if we then have a \"read and write\" permission for, let's say admins, on that channel, it needs to stay UN-encrypted, since everyone in the community can see it anyway. Of course, in that case, only admins can post in it.",
