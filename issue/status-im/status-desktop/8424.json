If we need this for release builds then we'd need to purchases a dedicated MacOS machine that will do nothing most of the time other than build a desktop release once in a blue moon on an older OS version.\r\n\r\nConsidering almost nobody uses this unstable software other than internal contributors I see no value in this currently.\r\nOnce we have a stable release that actually is supposed to be targeting a wider audience then maybe this would make sense, but as it stands if it's only for internal use it seems like an unnecessary extra work and cost.",
