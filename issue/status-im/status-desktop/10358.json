    "description": "## Messaging & Communities team \r\n\r\n**1. Continue to fix bugs and stabilise chat and communities functionality as top priority**\r\n\r\n**2. Finish anything that wasn't completed in the previous 0.17 cycle**\r\n\r\n**3. Complete work on profile showcase**\r\n\r\n**4. Status Communities / Discord bridge**\r\n- Community admin screens to make it easier for a Community Owner to deploy a bridge (design required)\r\n\r\n**5.  IPFS service for community minted NFTs and other binary community assets**\r\n\r\n- In order for NFT tokens minted in our UI to be correctly displayed with all metadata on OpenSea, their assets need to be stored in IPFS (because IPFS is supported by OpenSea)\r\n\r\n- Will work something like this: IPFS pinning server is integrated into Status Desktop. When a community mints a NFT, the associated assets are IPFS pinned by the community control node.  The community control node then sends a 'user invisible message' to all other community members via Waku, and the Status Desktop installs of all community members then fetch the NFT assets and pin them as well.  This means that every member of a community that is running Status Desktop will always be 'IPFS pinning' all assets related to the community, so that as long as one community member that uses Status Desktop is online, the assets are guaranteed to be available via IPFS.\r\n\r\n- Use a similar scheme to the above could be used for other community assets (that are not related to token minting) in the future like: Community banner image, community icon, community description, etc...\r\n\r\n- Use a similar scheme to the above could be used for status user data in the future.  Status users pin assets related to their profile (banner image, avatar, showcase contents) using IPFS, and all of the user's mutual contacts also pin that user's profile data.  Must incorporate a setting so that users can opt-out of pinning their mutual contact's profile data.\r\n\r\n**6. Chat functionality enhancements**\r\n- Introduce @channel as a new type of global @ mention.  This @ mention only @ mention's everyone who has posted a message in a channel in the last 30 days \r\n- optional service to once a month auto-kick all members who haven't been online for between 30 and 60 days (e.g. auto-kick members whose profile information like Name, Avatar, etc... can no longer be fetched).  Design still required\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n## Wallet Team\r\n\r\n**1. Implement on WalletConnect UI and associated functionality**\r\n\r\n**2. Start work on total balance graphs for 'All accounts' and each individual account and all graph functionality**\r\n\r\n**2. Complete support for KeycardPro via USB**\r\n- Requires design\r\n- Support for ERC-4527 will be the next task in this workstream after KPro USB support is complete\r\n\r\n**4. Advanced transaction signing**\r\n\r\n**5. QR scanner**\r\n- Needed for private key transfer\r\n- Ethereum key QRs (send modal triggered)\r\n- User Share URL in a QR (opens user profile dialogue) \r\n- Community and Channel inside Community URL in QRs (takes user to Community or Channel in Community)\r\n\r\n**6. Database re-encryption flows**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

(as opposed to importing only the active communities and contacts that would end up being visible in the client)\r\n\r\nIf we actually need all the data, showing only the progress for the active communities and contacts only would be misleading as well. We could easily end up showing in the UI that the sync process is completed, but there's still lots of data to be imported.\r\n@benjthayer In this case, WDYT of showing the progress in percentage instead of count numbers?",
