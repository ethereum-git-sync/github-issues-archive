    "body": "One question: we know that SQLite can only process queries sequentially.  **If** after profiling we see that queues of db queries are sometimes forming (as a result of SQLite only being able to process queries sequentially), then it might be worth investigating the feasibility of adding support to status-go to (optionally) use a db that is capable of processing queries in parallel like PostgreSQL.  However if this is a non-issue then we wouldn't want to waste time looking into using postgres with Status Go.\r\n\r\nAnother question: is the DB a contributor to any perf. issues in the app, and if so what are these issues and how could they be mitigated?  e.g. would there be a perf. gain if we moved to having seperate DBs per app (e.g one for wallet, one for chat, etc..) or even per community (thanks @iurimatias for mentioning this). Or are there any other DB perf optimisations like improving indexes, etc.. that we should look into.\r\n\r\nBefore we start doing any DB optimisation, it's important to first understand what aspects of DB performance is contributing towards app perf issues today (if any).  Once we understand this, we can then look into what optimisations could be solutions to these defined issues.\r\n\r\nSo tldr; of this issue is: understand all the db perf bottlenecks we have in the app when it's being used in the context of dogfooding today.",
