  "body": "# Bug Report\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nWhen I paste the following text into chat, I cannot tag in @everyone. When I try to do this, it seems to work but as soon as I click send, it reverts back to @0x00001. Even trying to edit the message does not work.\r\n\r\nHey @everyone! Today I wanted to talk about the 2 processes which are going live on 25-July (Tuesday) and what type of things you can request using these processes.\r\nRequest Good or Services process - streamlines and automates all steps, from submitting the purchase request to getting “Okays” from all relevant parties. The “Request Goods/Services” should be used to request:\r\n- Software & Licences (new tools, apps, subscriptions, etc.)\r\n- Equipment (laptops, ledgers, mic and headphones, phones, yubikey)\r\n- Learning & development (courses, online conferences)\r\n- Consulting fees (consultants, freelancers)\r\n- Other fees (bounties)\r\nTo get more details about the roles and process steps, please check the page [Request Goods or Services](https://www.notion.so/Request-Goods-or-Services-9891dc90f4424a0ebd3407db1991c203?pvs=21). Also, stay tuned for the latest updates in Core Contributor Guide!\r\n\r\nRequest Travel process - streamlines and automates all steps, from submitting the travel request to getting “Okays” from all relevant parties. The process replaces approvals in the #travel-requests channel. CCs can still share their travel plans with folks in the #travel-requests channel, but the approval process will be happening through SpiffWorkflow. The “Request Travel” should be used by all CCs to request approval for an upcoming trip for Team Events, Conferences, Meetups, or All Hands.\r\n\r\nTo get more details about the roles and process steps, please check the page [Request Travel](https://www.notion.so/Request-Travel-06db3450784e4320adb425688d8dbe3f?pvs=21). Also, stay tuned for the latest updates in Core Contributor Guide, which we will be updating right before Go-Live!\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n<!-- example: step 1. do X step 2. do Y etc.. -->\r\n\r\n1. Paste the above text\r\n2. Go to everyone and retag in using @everyone\r\n3. Send the message\r\n4. FAIL - @everyone converts to @0x00001\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\nI can tag in @everyone\r\n\r\n#### Actual behavior\r\nOn send, message shows @0x00001\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n- Status desktop version: 0.12\r\n- Operating System: OSX 12.6\r\n\r\n",
