  "body": "# Bug Report\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nAs a TokenMaster, I can see pending requests to join. Once they were accepted by the Onwer, I can see the new members in the `All members` tab, but some of them still appear in the `Pending Requests` tab.\r\n\r\nThis **might** be because I tried to accept them and it failed. See https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/12902\r\nThe person still in the list is the one I tried to approve and it failed.\r\n\r\nHowever, I also see myself in the Pending Requests, which makes no sense.\r\n\r\nPending tab:\r\n![image](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/11926403/40042fa6-a234-4438-9a4d-d38b3e0e18b1)\r\n\r\nMembers tab (see that the two above are also in the members):\r\n![image](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/11926403/8163f247-3db9-4ab4-b4e9-e7ef8b187e0e)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create an on request community in Account A\r\n2. Invite Account B to community\r\n3. Join using Account B and approve using A\r\n5. A mints the Owner token and airdrops a TM token to B\r\n6. B is now a TM\r\n7. B can see himself in the Pending Requests :exclamation: \r\n8. C sends a request to join the community\r\n9. B sees the request. Optional step: B tries to accept and it fails\r\n10. A approves the request\r\n11. C is now a member of the community, but the request is still in the pending list :exclamation: \r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nOnce a member is accepted or rejected, he is no longer part of the pending list\r\nWe can never see ourselves in the pending list\r\n\r\n#### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nSometimes members stays in pending when approved and I could see myself in pending\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nTested in testnet mode\r\n\r\n- Status desktop version: 0.15.0 RC5\r\n- Operating System: Ubuntu 20\r\n\r\n",
