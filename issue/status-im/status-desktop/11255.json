Token permissions to enable control of community smart contracts**\r\n- Before a community founder can use any of the community token admin functionality, they first have to deploy Owner and Token Master contracts.\r\n- This work involves: new empty state screen for Mint and Airdrop tokens (before current empty state screen is revealed), new flow for deploying the community's Owner and Token Master contracts in a single step, a fixed uneditable permission giving anybody who holds the Token Master token admin rights for the community should be automatically created.\r\n- Only the holder of the single Owner token can access the Token Master airdrop, remote destruct, and view holders functions. Anybody who holds the Token Master token can access all token admin options, excluding those related to the Token Master token itself, as well as being and Admin of the community.\r\n- This will all be explained in more detail in the designs.\r\n\r\nBackend Epic: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11249\r\n\r\n**2. Updates to control node transfer and associated dialogues**\r\n- Remove ability for a Owner to leave a community on the computer that's running as that community's control node\r\n- Community Admin home screen cleanup (inc. adding at least one of the three graphs, whichever is easiest to implement).\r\n  - Graph issue: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11152  \r\n\r\n**3. Ability for user to select & manage accounts shared with each community control node**\r\n- This item is quite a bit of work\r\n- Touches Community settings, as well as all of the community join flows\r\n- Backend issues: \r\n  - Join API: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11154\r\n  - Edit API: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11153\r\n\r\n**4. Encryption for token gated channels that are inside Open (not token gated) communities**\r\n[#10998](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/10998)\r\n\r\n**5. Final screens and bits and bobs needed prior to public beta**\r\n- Modal that's shown every time after login, reminding user's that Status Desktop is in Beta [#11044](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11044)\r\n- The bug with 'requests to join' a community not constantly arriving, or sometimes arriving after a delay, must be fixed. [#8264](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/8264)\r\n- Anything that didn't get completed in 0.13 related to new share URL format\r\n- All the outstanding bugs and small items that got pushed into the 0.14 milestone.\r\n\r\n**6. Profile showcase backend**\r\n- The long-delayed profile showcase backend!  We have the UI on the desktop ready to go for this feature, and Mobile is going to need the backend for this feature as well, so let's try to get it done in 0.14 [#11081](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11081)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**--- Things that we SHOULD NOT work on during the 0.14 cycle ---**\r\n- Messaging and UI teams shouldn't work on perf. in 0.14 (but Wallet team should!)\r\n- Anything mutual contacts related, other than #10497 #10498 (hopefully this functionality working good enough now!)\r\n\r\n**--- Wallet Team ---**\r\n\r\n1. Finish any outstanding work related to Activity screens (top priority - aim to have complete by July 14th)\r\n\r\n2. Updated Wallet Settings screens UI inc. account syncing functionality  *Synced information should immediately be reflected in the UI after it is received (sometimes synced info is currently only displayed after the next app restart, this needs to be fixed)*\r\n\r\n3. Wallet performance and memory consumption optimisations\r\n\r\n4. Fix bugs, clean up loose ends (to get things in a good state before the work on the Mobile wallet starts)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

  "body": "There are a few changes that happened to the request membership flow of communities:\r\n\r\n1. Originally, when a community had permissions set up that users need to fulfill to become a member of the community, user nodes would reveal their wallet addresses to the owner node to proof ownership of the necessary requirements.\r\n2. Then, we've improved this mechanism by letting user nodes figure out on which networks (chainIDs) they own the needed funds and attach that information to the request to join. This then allows the owner/admin node only check on those networks instead all by default.\r\n3. Due to the complexity of possible scenarios when it comes to communities that change from non-permissioned to permissioned and member with revealed or no revealed addresses, we've decided that users now have to reveal their addresses regardless. In short, every request to join requires a user to attach wallet addresses (+ signatures to the request), even if the community doesn't have permissions set up (but might in the future)\r\n\r\n@osmaczko has now pointed out the following scenario he's observed that is most likely a bug:\r\n\r\n> 1) alice creates open community\r\n> 2) bob joins open community and reveals his addresses\r\n> 3) alice creates permissions to join which bob satisfies\r\n> 4) bob is removed from community and must request to join again with revealed addresses\r\n> At first glance, the issue is at point 2), in case there are no permissions for community, bob sends revealed addresses with empty array of chain IDs.\r\n> Or am I wrong and 4) is expected?\r\n\r\nThe important part here is **bob sends revealed addresses with empty array of chain IDs**.\r\n\r\nThis state should only happen if a) the community has permissions set up that need to be satisfied to join the community at the time the request to join was made and b) the user sending the request **does not** have the funds.\r\n\r\nThe result is that the revealed accounts don't provide chainIDs on which the requirements are satisfied, which is that empty list.\r\n\r\n**If however**, the community **didn't** have these permissions set up, meaning it's an open community as described in @osmaczko scenario above, then the default should always be the cartesian product of wallet addresse x all supported chain IDs.\r\nWe also have a utility function that does that: https://github.com/status-im/status-go/blob/develop/protocol/communities/manager.go#L4043-L4052\r\n",
