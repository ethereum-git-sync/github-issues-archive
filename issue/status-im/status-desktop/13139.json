    "body": "@richard-ramos \r\n\r\n> if using a local build, the DEBUG flag is always active, and switching it makes no difference\r\n\r\nFor local build we always set log level to `DEBUG`. Indeed, the switch won't affect anything.\r\nHere's the code that checks `isDebugEnabled` switch on startup:\r\nhttps://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/blob/a2aedb5c6a699c154382f75d9c5a7e6e641fa14c/src/app/boot/app_controller.nim#L451-L454\r\n\r\nWe could add `else: setLogLevel(chronicles.LogLevel.INFO)`, but using always using `DEBUG` for local build makes sense to me. Maybe we should change the behaviour of the switch in this case? Maybe even hide it?\r\n\r\n> The same happens in release version, except that the log level is always INFO and it's not possible to switch the DEBUG flag\r\n\r\nFor me it's the opposite (but also wrong) 😄 \r\nI run `make RELEASE=true -j10 run`. I still get debug output and `DEBUG` switch is always on!\r\n\r\n<img width=\"591\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/25482501/1a536251-b1a2-433f-93c7-40ddcd9b7072\">\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nI think we should reconsider the behaviour of this switch. Requirements would be nice 🙂 I'd be glad to give input.\r\n\r\n⚠️  But I don't think this is of any urgency. This switch is only used by devs and the behaviour can be controlled by env variables or CLI flags.\r\n\r\ncc @John-44 @iurimatias ",

    "body": "> > I am facing an issue in my laptop when i run the rc10 release of 0.15.0, i cannot enable DEBUG at all. If i enable debug from settings, i am asked to restart the app and when i restart the setting is set back to INFO.\r\n> > So, if i have to debug something while dogfooding it is not possible for me due to this limitation. Also when CCs start dogfooding and run into issues, we would want debug logs in order to debug the scenario. If DEBUG can't be enabled, then that would make it a challenge. So i think this atleast this requires to be addressed immediately .\r\n> \r\n> @chaitanyaprem Thanks for our input. I believe this should be fixed in master already: #12935 (the heading is different, but it's very related). Could you please give it a try with master branch?\r\n\r\nFaced the same issue with the build taken from the PR referenced. ",

    "body": "With regards to above conversation, currently testing in non-release, the the mode is always Debug. Below explains that the bug is not in status-go, but in the config/setup on the nim side.\r\n\r\nDiscovered that the bug is happening at start up where the last value set is overwritten for some reason by a DEBUG value, and it’s always set to DEBUG for logLevel. This result in the button always being set to Debug. So I am currently investigating why the value is always DEBUG at start up. Why can't we fetch the value in database and use that as start up value.\r\n\r\nThis DEBUG value comes from this code which always set the default value to DEBUG depending on the type of build currently used :\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/blob/2abfe0fa0cab36e7f850fbae4deb1965351380b8/src/env_cli_vars.nim#L10\r\n\r\nThe setting of the default log can be observed in this sequence, (I just added a few logs to observe what's happening) and we can see the DEBUG being set : \r\n\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nBG 2024-01-25 10:59:30.407-08:00 Account logged in                         \r\n topics=\"accounts-service\" tid=1272478 file=service.nim:694\r\n3 ---> GetNodeConfigFromDB\r\n4 ---> loadNodeConfig  INFO\r\n...\r\n---> inserting in node_config LogLevel:  DEBUG\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Actions \r\n\r\nBased on above anylsis, I believe there's no need to force the default value for the logs at boot from the config perspective.\r\n\r\nHere is the result : \r\n\r\n[Screencast from 2024-01-25 02:06:00 PM.webm](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/2589171/ca6f22c8-3502-49a9-9a5b-f03368781d74)\r\n",
