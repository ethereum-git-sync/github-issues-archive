    "body": "@alexandraB99 I wouldn't remove the whole function completely, as that would remove the formatting of all the other types (bold, italic, etc).\r\n\r\nI do  agree with Pascal though that the whole formatting is very complex. So if you feel like you can improve anything there, feel free to do so.\r\n\r\nBasically, how it works is that we do a regex (right now on the Nim side), to see if something was wrapped with a special character, `*` for italic, `**` for bold and  (\\`) for code. If the regex spots something that is wrapped, it returns the position in the string to replace that with the tags, `<code>` for example.\r\n\r\nIn this issue, it seems like the `code` regex might be misbehaving. You can check the regex on the Nim side in format_input.nim at line 58\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have other questions",
