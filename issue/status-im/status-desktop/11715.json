Token permissions to enable control of community smart contracts**\r\n- Before a community founder can use any of the community token admin functionality, they first have to deploy Owner and Token Master contracts.\r\n- This work involves: new empty state screen for Mint and Airdrop tokens (before current empty state screen is revealed), new flow for deploying the community's Owner and Token Master contracts in a single step, a fixed uneditable permission giving anybody who holds the Token Master token admin rights for the community should be automatically created.\r\n- Only the holder of the single Owner token can access the Token Master airdrop, remote destruct, and view holders functions. Anybody who holds the Token Master token can access all token admin options, excluding those related to the Token Master token itself, as well as being and Admin of the community.\r\n- This will all be explained in more detail in the designs.\r\n\r\nBackend Epic: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11249\r\n\r\n**2. Update Community Admin home screen inc control node transfer and associated dialogues**\r\n- Remove ability for a Owner to leave a community on the computer that's running as that community's control node\r\n- Community Admin home screen cleanup (inc. adding at least one of the three graphs, whichever is easiest to implement).\r\n  - Graph issue: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11152  \r\n  - Community overview: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11278\r\n\r\n**3. Ability for user to select & manage accounts shared with each community control node**\r\n- This item is quite a bit of work\r\n- Touches Community settings, as well as all of the community join flows\r\n- Backend issues: \r\n  - Join API: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11154\r\n  - Edit API: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11153\r\n\r\n**4. Encryption for token gated channels that are inside Open (not token gated) communities**\r\n[#10998](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/10998)\r\n\r\n**5. Final screens and bits and bobs needed prior to public beta**\r\n- Modal that's shown every time after login, reminding user's that Status Desktop is in Beta [#11044](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11044)\r\n- The bug with 'requests to join' a community not constantly arriving, or sometimes arriving after a delay, must be fixed. [#8264](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/8264)\r\n- Anything that didn't get completed in 0.13 related to new share URL format\r\n- All the outstanding bugs and small items that got pushed into the 0.14 milestone.\r\n\r\n\r\n**--- Things that we SHOULD NOT work on during the 0.14 cycle ---**\r\n- Messaging and UI teams shouldn't work on perf. in 0.14 (but Wallet team should!)\r\n- Anything big mutual contacts related, other than fixing small bugs we find like #10497 #10498 #11120 #11121  (hopefully this functionality working good enough now!)\r\n\r\n**--- Wallet Team ---**\r\n\r\n1. Finish any outstanding work related to Activity screens (top priority - aim to have complete by July 14th)\r\n\r\n2. Updated Wallet Settings screens UI inc. account syncing functionality  *Synced information should immediately be reflected in the UI after it is received (sometimes synced info is currently only displayed after the next app restart, this needs to be fixed)*\r\n\r\n3. Wallet performance and memory consumption optimisations\r\n\r\n4. Fix bugs, clean up loose ends (to get things in a good state before the work on the Mobile wallet starts)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

  "body": "In a network of Status nodes (desktop clients) that participate in the same community, we have a bunch of different nodes:\r\n\r\n- A single control node, this one owns the private key of the community\r\n- Multiple owners nodes (nodes that used to be control nodes, until they've removed the private key)\r\n- Multiple token master nodes (accounts with admin privileges + token distribution)\r\n- Multiple admin nodes (accounts with admin privileges)\r\n\r\nControl nodes, owners and token master can deploy, mint and airdrop tokens.\r\nTokens that have been created through community user interface will be added to 2 places:\r\n\r\n1. In the `CommunityDescription` which has a `communityTokensMetadata` field (this data is publicly available to everyone)\r\n2. In the accounts local database - here we store everything that goes into `communityTokensMetadata` + some additional information that is only interesting for owners/admins (this data is not publicly available and only lives in the account's database)\r\n\r\nBecause of the nature of 2) we need a way to distribute that additional information to other admins as well, so they'll see the same community token information in the community settings interface as the owner that deployed the token.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, we can't simply derive it from the community tokens metadata in the community description, because it's incomplete.\r\n\r\n### What we probably want to do\r\n\r\nIn order to share such information across privileged users, we probably need to introduce a new message type that is then encrypted using every privileged user's public key and send to those users accordingly.\r\n\r\nThere are various ways to go about this, however since I think there'll be more such data that we want to be shared across those users, it probably makes sense to introduce a generic message that can hold different kinds of payloads.\r\n\r\nFor example something like:\r\n\r\n```protobuf\r\nmessage CommunitySuperUserSyncMessage {\r\n  uint64 clock = 1;\r\n  EventType type = 2;\r\n  repeated CommunityCompleteTokenMetadata complete_token_metadata = 3;\r\n  // other types of payloads that need to be synced across admins\r\n  \r\n  enum EventType {\r\n    UNKNOWN = 0;\r\n    COMMUNITY_TOKEN_DEPLOYED =1;\r\n    COMMUNITY_TOKEN_REMOVED = 2;\r\n    ... // other types of data that need to be synced across admins\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, this message needs to be send to all privileged users via private message (so they can be encrypted accordingly). Receiving nodes then need to:\r\n\r\n1. Verify that the message was sent by a legitimate privileged user (and not some random account)\r\n2. Apply the changes provided in the payload and sync the local database\r\n\r\n^ This should keep admins in sync. \r\n\r\nIn addition, we might want to consider adding this shared data to the nodes Sync/Backup mechanism, so that when a privileged user recovers their account, they can reconstruct the known data.\r\n\r\nFeel free to discuss the exact details further on this issue.",
