  "body": "There's already a repo for Nim implementation of Status protocol here: https://github.com/status-im/nim-status\r\n\r\nThis was previously named status-nim to keep with status-go/status-go theme. However, a suggestion was made to use nim naming (a la nim-eth, nim-libp2p, nim-waku) but wasn't acted on yet, hence the name duplication.\r\n\r\nRight now it isn't clear to me what the purpose of this library is, but it seems to me that it is either:\r\n1. A duplicate repo\r\n2. Badly named\r\n\r\nIf it is 1 issues should be transferred to existing repo https://github.com/status-im/nim-status\r\n\r\nIf 2 it should be renamed to something more descriptive to show that it is a desktop client (e.g.)\r\n\r\nI took the liberty of renaming this -duplicate to avoid confusion while we sort this out, since no work is in progress here I hope that isn't too disruptive.",
