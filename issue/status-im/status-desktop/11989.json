  "body": "Following on from a discussion in Discord with @endulab a couple of edits have been made to the mint tokens flows (including the mint Owner/TokenMaster tokens flow) to reflect the fact that the network the user chooses to mint the Owner/TokenMaster tokens on determines (locks in) the network that will be used for all future mints for that community. (e.g. if the Owner token for Community A is minted on Optimism, the user will not be able to change this for future asset and collectible minting for Community A - the network used for minting subsequent assets and collectibles for that community will be locked to Optimism).\r\n\r\nSome small copy adjustments have been made to make this as clear as possible to the user.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n**1) Mint Owner token / TokenMaster token form**\r\n\r\nUnder `Select network` the copy has been adjusted:\r\nNew copy: `The network you select will be where all your community’s tokens reside. Once set, this setting can’t be changed and tokens can’t move to other networks.`\r\nOld copy: `The network on which these tokens will be minted.`\r\n\r\nThe copy below which previously resided directly above the `Mint` button has also now been removed as it is now duplicative of the aforementioned copy adjustment.\r\n\r\nREMOVED: `Make sure you’re happy with the blockchain network selected before minting these tokens as they can’t be moved to a different network later.`\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1499\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-08-23 at 07 17 09\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/110033914/9a5df4ed-40a7-425e-9048-07cb04f2498a\">\r\n\r\nFigma:\r\nhttps://www.figma.com/file/qHfFm7C9LwtXpfdbxssCK3/Kuba%E2%8E%9CDesktop---Communities?type=design&node-id=36893-638346&mode=design&t=d14xZmfB9nT3Cq4D-4\r\n(NB all Community related design flows have now been migrated to this new Figma file to free up space due to memory issues on the main Kuba file. All updates to Community flows will be made to this file and Community related flows will be deleted from the main Kuba file this week).\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n**2) Mint asset / collectible** \r\n\r\nGiven the network is locked for all subsequent minting for that community, the network dropdown on both the asset and collectible minting forms should be in the disabled state (lighter stroke to dropdown and removal of chevron):\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1558\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-08-23 at 07 22 20\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/110033914/acdd4c41-76c0-451f-8776-bf6d25dfeb5f\">\r\n\r\nCollectible minting:\r\nhttps://www.figma.com/file/qHfFm7C9LwtXpfdbxssCK3/Kuba%E2%8E%9CDesktop---Communities?type=design&node-id=29423-578511&mode=design&t=d14xZmfB9nT3Cq4D-4\r\n\r\nAsset minting:\r\nhttps://www.figma.com/file/qHfFm7C9LwtXpfdbxssCK3/Kuba%E2%8E%9CDesktop---Communities?type=design&node-id=29373-560486&mode=design&t=d14xZmfB9nT3Cq4D-4\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n**3) Additional simplification / clean-up of description field**\r\n\r\nWe have also enhanced the description field for assets and collectibles to ensure they are consistent. \r\n\r\nCollectible description field:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1247\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-08-23 at 07 46 47\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/110033914/d34e36b3-4e5e-45e5-8f6b-be2c5b52ff7d\">\r\n\r\n\r\nAsset description field:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1246\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-08-23 at 07 48 40\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/110033914/dbdf8e3d-1f02-4f83-9bad-a3b99ef1389a\">\r\n\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\ncc @noeliaSD @micieslak @endulab @John-44 ",
