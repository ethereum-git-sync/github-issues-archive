Tokenisation of community ownership**\r\n- Work needed already evaluated in spike.  Community and 'Channel in a Community' URLs don't need to be signed if this will present problems. Patryk to work on this as a continuation of the spike already done.\r\n- See priority 4 below, as this also has some implications for the tokenisation of community work.\r\n\r\n**3. Profile showcase backend**\r\n- The long-delayed profile showcase backend!  We have the UI on the desktop ready to go for this feature, and Mobile is going to need the backend for this feature as well, so let's try to get it done in 0.14 [#11081](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11081)\r\n\r\n**4. Community tokens visible in wallet when received by user who is not a member of that community**\r\n- Solution obvs. needs to be fully decenteralised and permissionless\r\n- Perhaps whenever a community token is A) sent from a Status Wallet to another user or B) airdropped by a community or C) retailed by a community, a M2M (invisible to the user) Waku message should be sent to the recipient's *ethereum address*?\r\n- This message could either: A) contain the metadata for the token B) tell the user that they have received token, and to check the metadata in either another Waku channel where Control Nodes periodically post Metadata OR check the metadata embedded in the token contract (embedding metadata in the token contract might be a better idea?).  \r\n- The token metadata stored in the token contract is signed by the Community's private key to ensure authenticity.  When the community's private key changes due to ownership of a community being transferred or due to the control node being moved, a transaction must be made to update this metadata so it is signed by the community's new private key.\r\n- See here for how a Waku message can be sent to and Ethereum address https://rfc.vac.dev/spec/20/\r\n\r\n**5. Discord history import into a single channel in an existing community**\r\n- Pay off any Discord history import service tech. debt first\r\n- Then build the import into a single channel functionality, designs for this are already complete\r\n\r\n**6. UI for community owner to enable manual Waku static shading for their community**\r\n- This will be off by default in 0.15\r\n- This UI is only for the Owner of a community (not TokenMasters or Admins)\r\n- Figma designs are here https://www.figma.com/file/qHfFm7C9LwtXpfdbxssCK3/Kuba%E2%8E%9CDesktop---Communities?type=design&node-id=37242%3A222352&mode=design&t=rw6q6NQYmiz3rSn2-1\r\n\r\n**7. Community chat functionality enhancements**\r\n- Ability to mark a token gated channel as 'hidden', only visible to community members with the requisite tokens\r\n\r\n**8. Refactor synchronisation of contacts**\r\n- To fix various contact request issues, is a large work item\r\n- Mishka and Igor to work on this?\r\n- https://github.com/status-im/status-go/issues/3720\r\n- https://github.com/status-im/status-go/issues/3803#issuecomment-1654588500\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**--- Wallet Team ---**\r\n\r\n1.

  "body": "Following on from a discussion in Discord with @endulab a couple of edits have been made to the mint tokens flows (including the mint Owner/TokenMaster tokens flow) to reflect the fact that the network the user chooses to mint the Owner/TokenMaster tokens on determines (locks in) the network that will be used for all future mints for that community. (e.g. if the Owner token for Community A is minted on Optimism, the user will not be able to change this for future asset and collectible minting for Community A - the network used for minting subsequent assets and collectibles for that community will be locked to Optimism).\r\n\r\nSome small copy adjustments have been made to make this as clear as possible to the user.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n**1) Mint Owner token / TokenMaster token form**\r\n\r\nUnder `Select network` the copy has been adjusted:\r\nNew copy: `The network you select will be where all your community’s tokens reside. Once set, this setting can’t be changed and tokens can’t move to other networks.`\r\nOld copy: `The network on which these tokens will be minted.`\r\n\r\nThe copy below which previously resided directly above the `Mint` button has also now been removed as it is now duplicative of the aforementioned copy adjustment.\r\n\r\nREMOVED: `Make sure you’re happy with the blockchain network selected before minting these tokens as they can’t be moved to a different network later.`\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1499\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-08-23 at 07 17 09\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/110033914/9a5df4ed-40a7-425e-9048-07cb04f2498a\">\r\n\r\nFigma:\r\nhttps://www.figma.com/file/qHfFm7C9LwtXpfdbxssCK3/Kuba%E2%8E%9CDesktop---Communities?type=design&node-id=36893-638346&mode=design&t=d14xZmfB9nT3Cq4D-4\r\n(NB all Community related design flows have now been migrated to this new Figma file to free up space due to memory issues on the main Kuba file. All updates to Community flows will be made to this file and Community related flows will be deleted from the main Kuba file this week).\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n**2) Mint asset / collectible** \r\n\r\nGiven the network is locked for all subsequent minting for that community, the network dropdown on both the asset and collectible minting forms should be in the disabled state (lighter stroke to dropdown and removal of chevron):\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1558\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-08-23 at 07 22 20\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/110033914/acdd4c41-76c0-451f-8776-bf6d25dfeb5f\">\r\n\r\nCollectible minting:\r\nhttps://www.figma.com/file/qHfFm7C9LwtXpfdbxssCK3/Kuba%E2%8E%9CDesktop---Communities?type=design&node-id=29423-578511&mode=design&t=d14xZmfB9nT3Cq4D-4\r\n\r\nAsset minting:\r\nhttps://www.figma.com/file/qHfFm7C9LwtXpfdbxssCK3/Kuba%E2%8E%9CDesktop---Communities?type=design&node-id=29373-560486&mode=design&t=d14xZmfB9nT3Cq4D-4\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n**3) Additional simplification / clean-up of description field**\r\n\r\nWe have also enhanced the description field for assets and collectibles to ensure they are consistent. \r\n\r\nCollectible description field:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1247\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-08-23 at 07 46 47\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/110033914/d34e36b3-4e5e-45e5-8f6b-be2c5b52ff7d\">\r\n\r\n\r\nAsset description field:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1246\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-08-23 at 07 48 40\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/110033914/dbdf8e3d-1f02-4f83-9bad-a3b99ef1389a\">\r\n\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\ncc @noeliaSD @micieslak @endulab @John-44 ",
