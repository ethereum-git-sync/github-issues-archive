    "description": "Priorities **in priority order** for the 0.12 milestone:  \r\n\r\n**1. Improve performance**\r\n- Focus on eliminating any UI freezes when the user clicks on something and the app does not display an immediate response.  Target: the app should ideally respond to all user input within 50ms, but let's start with identifying the longest UI freezes and trying to fix the worst UI freezes first.\r\n- Speed and responsiveness of switching between community channels, and 1on1 and ad-hoc group chats is particularly important, especially for channels and chats that contains a lot of history.  We should aim for about 250ms delay in the *worst* case if possible.  Having a lot of history in a channel should not slow channel switching down.\r\n- DB perf optimisations.  \r\n- Move things to async and off main thread\r\n- See Alex's great profiling work for possible tasks (Alex to continue focusing on perf. for this release cycle)\r\n- \"user facing performance in everyday app usage\" is the top priority, but any task that improves performance is worthwhile\r\n\r\n**2. Finish development of token based functionality from 0.11**\r\n- Optimise No. queries made by owner node when checking member tokens (Pascal)\r\n- Community encryption should automatically switch on/off depending on community permissions (issue #9942)\r\n- Implement the 'Admin' role (issue #10114)\r\n- Airdrop to community members (in addition to addresses)\r\n- Optimise gas required by collectable minting smart contracts (issue #9943, GravityBlast)\r\n--- After collectable minting gas optimisation is complete, start work on Asset minting contracts (GravityBlast)\r\n- Complete token remote destruct UI\r\n- Remove 'Community Permissions Settings', 'Community Tokens' and 'Discord Import Tool' feature flags (issue #10115)\r\n- Thoroughly test, and fix all bugs found. \r\n- Anything else related to Community level token permissions, collectable minting, airdropping, and remote destructing that didn't make it into 0.11\r\n\r\n**3. Finish implementing the ability for Community Owners and Admins to drag and drop channels and categories into different orders**\r\n\r\n**4. Finish anything related to the initial pairing process for syncing that wasn't completed in 0.11** (Igor)\r\n\r\n**5. Improve Mutual Contacts functionality to improve reliability and pay off tech debt** (Mishka)\r\n\r\n**6. Complete Community Directory Curation dApp integration inc. Featured functionality** (Patryk)\r\n \r\n**7. Backend for the Profile Showcase**\r\n\r\n**8. Identity Verification** (required for 'Profile Showcase')\r\n\r\n**9. Fix bugs, bugs and more bugs!**\r\n- Esp. find the cause of and fix the longstanding bug of some 'requests to join' not arriving for hours/days after they were sent!\r\n- Many 'fit and finish' bugs for the UI team\r\n\r\n**--- For the Wallet team ---**\r\n\r\n1. Continue feature development inc. kicking off development of the activity screens\r\n2. 'All accounts' section.  The ability to return all tokens owned by the user in all accounts (excluding watch only accounts) is also required for the Showcase functionality\r\n3. Widen scope of 'backup to waku' and 'syncing' so that all relevant Wallet user state is backed up and synced between devices\r\n4. Continue to ensure Wallet functionality is performant.\r\n5. Fix wallet bugs",

    "body": "Hey @alexandraB99 @jrainville I've created some designs for this which have been signed off by @John-44 \r\n\r\nTo echo mobile, we can use the grey dot to the right of any channel that has unread messages. If the unread messages contain a mention, the grey dot would be replaced with the blue notification badge. Both should be replaced with the mute icon if the channel is muted. \r\n\r\nThe grey unread messages marker dot should only be removed when the user has read all of the messages in that channel. Not simply by clicking on the channel as we have now. The unread messages dot and the accompanying semibold treatment for the channel label would only be removed if the user either manually scrolled to the latest message in the channel or used the 'jump to' latest message button as shown in the video below:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110033914/218825926-4d597a30-443d-4e7d-a460-c642b5f17c74.mov\r\n\r\nThe user should also be able to right-click the channel and select `Mark as Read` - this would have the same effect as viewing all messages.\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110033914/218831511-afe0b5cc-70c6-4d79-87bb-253c4c8f29d4.mov\r\n\r\nFigma designs:\r\nhttps://www.figma.com/file/Mr3rqxxgKJ2zMQ06UAKiWL/%F0%9F%92%AC-Chat%E2%8E%9CDesktop?node-id=21556%3A681150&t=umUsHzhThBLH3NTa-4\r\n\r\nIf whoever is developing this could set up a call with myself before implementing that would be great - just so we can chat through all of the interactions!\r\nThanks!",
