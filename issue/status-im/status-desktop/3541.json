  "body": "Who gets a green or orange dot and who is displayed in the 'Offline' seems a bit random.  See this screenshot:\r\n\r\n![2021-09-15 07_03_26-Status Desktop](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22846356/133380692-58db2be6-c5ba-4a0f-8895-f3bddb08fa86.png)\r\n\r\nIt's currently 07:04 in the morning UK time, and I see that Carl and Petty are (for example) currently marked with a green dot even though I would assume they aren't at their computers atm (given the current time), but Simon, Guy-Louis, Shivek and many others currently have a yellow/orange dot next to their name.  And even though I set my status to 'offline' in the status picker yesterday, this morning a green dot is still displayed next to my name.\r\n\r\n@iurimatias @richard-ramos mentioned that the current rules are supposed to be: >5.5 minutes since last broadcast = yellow (you're probably offline), >7 minutes offline\r\n\r\nA second issue is that it is difficult for people with common forms of colour blindness to distinguish between the green and yellow dots.  Also I'm not sure what value the current fine distinction between 'online' (green dot) and 'you're probably offline' (yellow dot) states provides to users.\r\n\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\nDesired resolution:\r\n\r\nNote : everything written below only pertains to the 'communities' functionality.  Public unmoderated group chats will be removed as soon as the communities functionality is ready, so any time we spend on specific functionality for public unmoderated group chats is time we've spent of functionality we are going to remove from the product.\r\n\r\n- add an \"Automatic\" option to the bottom left user state selector.  This state would be the default state for all new users, and when 'Automatic' is selected a user's state would be displayed to other users in the Communities Members bar as either Online or Offline following the automatic online/offline rules we have implemented (e.g. anybody who is >5.5 minutes since their last broadcast is shown in the \"Offline\" category with a grey dot next to their name, and anybody who is <5.5minutes since their last broadcast is shown in the \"Online\" category with a green dot next to their name). \r\n\r\n- A user could then optionally set their state to either \"Online\" or \"Offline\" manually, and then the state the user has manually selected will always be displayed as long as that user's instance of status desktop or mobile is running.  If a user has manually set their state as 'Online' and they stop running running any Status desktop or mobile instance, then their state will revert to \"Offline\" after 5.5 minutes until the next time they launch their instance of Status desktop or mobile.\r\n\r\n- remove the yellow dot 'you're probably offline' state\r\n\r\n- ensure that anybody who is \">5.5 minutes since last broadcast\" or who has manually selected the \"Offline\" state is shown in the \"Offline\" category with a *grey* dot next to their name.\r\n\r\n- ensure that anybody who is \"<5.5 minutes since last broadcast\" or who has manually selected the \"Online\" state AND who has their Status mobile or desktop instance running is shown in the \"Online\" category with a *green* dot next to their name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
