    "description": "Priorities **in priority order** for the 0.12 milestone:  \r\n\r\n**1. Improve performance**\r\n- Focus on eliminating any UI freezes when the user clicks on something and the app does not display an immediate response.  Target: the app should ideally respond to all user input within 50ms, but let's start with identifying the longest UI freezes and trying to fix the worst UI freezes first.\r\n- Speed and responsiveness of switching between community channels, and 1on1 and ad-hoc group chats is particularly important, especially for channels and chats that contains a lot of history.  We should aim for about 250ms delay in the *worst* case if possible.  Having a lot of history in a channel should not slow channel switching down.\r\n- DB perf optimisations.  \r\n- Move things to async and off main thread\r\n- See Alex's great profiling work for possible tasks (Alex to continue focusing on perf. for this release cycle)\r\n- \"user facing performance in everyday app usage\" is the top priority, but any task that improves performance is worthwhile\r\n\r\n**2. Finish development of token based functionality from 0.11**\r\n- Optimise No. queries made by owner node when checking member tokens (Pascal)\r\n- Community encryption should automatically switch on/off depending on community permissions (issue #9942)\r\n- Implement the 'Admin' role (issue #10114)\r\n- Airdrop to community members (in addition to addresses)\r\n- Optimise gas required by collectable minting smart contracts (issue #9943, GravityBlast)\r\n--- After collectable minting gas optimisation is complete, start work on Asset minting contracts (GravityBlast)\r\n- Complete token remote destruct UI\r\n- Remove 'Community Permissions Settings', 'Community Tokens' and 'Discord Import Tool' feature flags (issue #10115)\r\n- Thoroughly test, and fix all bugs found. \r\n- Anything else related to Community level token permissions, collectable minting, airdropping, and remote destructing that didn't make it into 0.11\r\n\r\n**3. Finish implementing the ability for Community Owners and Admins to drag and drop channels and categories into different orders**\r\n\r\n**4. Finish anything related to the initial pairing process for syncing that wasn't completed in 0.11** (Igor)\r\n\r\n**5. Improve Mutual Contacts functionality to improve reliability and pay off tech debt** (Mishka)\r\n\r\n**6. Complete Community Directory Curation dApp integration inc. Featured functionality** (Patryk)\r\n \r\n**7. Backend for the Profile Showcase**\r\n\r\n**8. Identity Verification** (required for 'Profile Showcase')\r\n\r\n**9. Fix bugs, bugs and more bugs!**\r\n- Esp. find the cause of and fix the longstanding bug of some 'requests to join' not arriving for hours/days after they were sent!\r\n- Many 'fit and finish' bugs for the UI team\r\n\r\n**--- For the Wallet team ---**\r\n\r\n1. Continue feature development inc. kicking off development of the activity screens\r\n2. 'All accounts' section.  The ability to return all tokens owned by the user in all accounts (excluding watch only accounts) is also required for the Showcase functionality\r\n3. Widen scope of 'backup to waku' and 'syncing' so that all relevant Wallet user state is backed up and synced between devices\r\n4. Continue to ensure Wallet functionality is performant.\r\n5. Fix wallet bugs",

  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nWe currently fetch \"transfer\" events for ERC20 and ERC721 contracts, which currently get shown as \"Send\" and \"Receive\" categories depending on which account is selected and the `To` and `From` addresses. `Transfer` events should be categorized according to the following criteria:\r\n- `Send`: When `From` address matches the corresponding account\r\n- `Receive`: When `To` address matches the corresponding account\r\n- `Buy`: A `Receive` transaction with the `From` address matching a known exchange\r\n- `Sell`: A `Send` transaction with the `To` address matching a known exchange\r\n- `Destroy`: A `Send` transaction with the `To` address `0x0`\r\n- `Swap` (Multi Tx): A `Send` transaction followed by a `Receive` transaction with the counterparty matching a known exchange. Both transaction happen on the same chain. Token type should be different.\r\n- `Bridge`  (Multi Tx): A `Send` transaction followed by a `Receive` transaction with the counterparty matching a known exchange. Both transactions occurring in different chains. Token type should be the same.\r\n\r\nWhich services do we want to support for matching known addresses?\r\n\r\nFor Multi Tx, do we have a reliable way of detecting the ones triggered from outside the app? If we do, assign a matching `MultiTransactionID`\r\n\r\nNot sure if it's convenient to store the \"subtype\" in the DB for more straightforward filtering, or if we want to do it \"on the fly\" to be able to upgrade the criteria with a new software version.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
