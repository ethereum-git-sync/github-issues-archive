  "body": "# Bug Report\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nIn 0.12 this issue was fixed. It would suppress contact requests for those people who are already contacts with you. However this issue is back in 0.13\r\n\r\nFYI - we are sending a contact request each time we send a msg from SpiffWorkflow. This is just how it need to happen as we cannot keep track of if you accepted the contact request or not in Spiff, so we simplified it and said we will just send a contact request followed by a msg each time. I was told by John this would be ok, since the app should suppress contact requests if you have already added them.\r\n\r\nBtw, we are using a Waku node to send this from SpiffWorkflow.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Login to Spiff and navigate to Set up Status App (Desktop) notifications process. This is simply a process which will send you a test notification in the Status Desktop App.\r\n2. You will see each msg with request for contact (see photo attached)\r\n\r\n#### Expected behaviour\r\nDon't show the contact request, if you have already added them as a contact\r\n\r\n#### Actual behaviour\r\nPlease add me to your contacts appears each time\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n- Status desktop version: 0.13\r\n- Operating System: Windows\r\n![image](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/104047049/82b8824c-b53d-4f3b-ba0b-0e1e4f604861)\r\n\r\n",
