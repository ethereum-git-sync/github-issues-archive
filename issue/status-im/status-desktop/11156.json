Token permissions to enable control of community smart contracts**\r\n- Before a community founder can use any of the community token admin functionality, they first have to deploy Owner and Token Master contracts.\r\n- This work involves: new empty state screen for Mint and Airdrop tokens (before current empty state screen is revealed), new flow for deploying the community's Owner and Token Master contracts in a single step, a fixed uneditable permission giving anybody who holds the Token Master token admin rights for the community should be automatically created.\r\n- Only the holder of the single Owner token can access the Token Master airdrop, remote destruct, and view holders functions. Anybody who holds the Token Master token can access all token admin options, excluding those related to the Token Master token itself, as well as being and Admin of the community.\r\n- This will all be explained in more detail in the designs.\r\n\r\n**2. Updates to control node transfer and associated dialogues**\r\n- Remove ability for a Owner to leave a community on the computer that's running as that community's control node\r\n- Community Admin home screen cleanup (inc. adding at least one of the three graphs, whichever is easiest to implement).\r\n  - Graph issue: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11152  \r\n\r\n**3. Ability for user to select & manage accounts shared with each community control node**\r\n- This item is quite a bit of work\r\n- Touches Community settings, as well as all of the community join flows\r\n- Backend issues: \r\n  - Join API: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11154\r\n  - Edit API: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11153\r\n\r\n**4. Encryption for token gated channels that are inside Open (not token gated) communities**\r\n[#10998](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/10998)\r\n\r\n**5. Final screens and bits and bobs needed prior to public beta**\r\n- Modal that's shown every time after login, reminding user's that Status Desktop is in Beta [#11044](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11044)\r\n- The bug with 'requests to join' a community not constantly arriving, or sometimes arriving after a delay, must be fixed. [#8264](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/8264)\r\n- Anything that didn't get completed in 0.13 related to new share URL format\r\n- All the outstanding bugs and small items that got pushed into the 0.14 milestone.\r\n\r\n**6. Profile showcase backend**\r\n- The long-delayed profile showcase backend!  We have the UI on the desktop ready to go for this feature, and Mobile is going to need the backend for this feature as well, so let's try to get it done in 0.14 [#11081](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11081)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**--- Things that we SHOULD NOT work on during the 0.14 cycle ---**\r\n- Messaging and UI teams shouldn't work on perf. in 0.14 (but Wallet team should!)\r\n- Anything mutual contacts related, other than #10497 #10498 (hopefully this functionality working good enough now!)\r\n\r\n**--- Wallet Team ---**\r\n\r\n1. Finish any outstanding work related to Activity screens (top priority - aim to have complete by July 14th)\r\n\r\n2. Updated Wallet Settings screens UI inc. account syncing functionality  *Synced information should immediately be reflected in the UI after it is received (sometimes synced info is currently only displayed after the next app restart, this needs to be fixed)*\r\n\r\n3. Wallet performance and memory consumption optimisations\r\n\r\n4. Fix bugs, clean up loose ends (to get things in a good state before the work on the Mobile wallet starts)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

  "body": "Once https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/pull/11134 lands there's a few more improvements we can make.\r\nOne of them being that we keep track in the database of what channels permissions where met.\r\n\r\nHere's how channel permissions currently works:\r\n\r\n1. There's two types of data: `CommunityTokenPermission`s (which live on the `CommunityDescription`) and `CheckChannelPermissionsResponse`\r\n2. The former tells the client what (channel) permissions exist on the community, however it does not know anything about whether a user satisfies any of them\r\n3. The latter is a response that clients receive from an additional call to `checkChannelPermissions()`. It will tell clients which of the known permissions are satisfied and, more specifically, which token requirements of each permission were satisfied\r\n4. This means, clients always have to perform an (async) call to status-go to figure out what permissions are satisfied\r\n\r\n^ The result of that is, when a client receives a new `CommunityDescription` with update token permissions, they'll be rendered right away but flagged as **not** satisfied. Right after that clients will do the check channel permissions check and once the call returns, the view is updated again.\r\n\r\nThis leads to a \"flash of unsatisfied permissions\".\r\n\r\nTo account for that, we should:\r\n\r\n1. Store whether view/view-and-post permissions for a given channel were met in the database, whenever a call to `checkChannelPermissions()` was done\r\n2. Retrieve that value as part of fetching channel groups when bootstrapping the app. That way, we'll know upfront what the last state was and will not see a \"flash of unsatisfied permissions\"\r\n\r\nThis however, will only fix the issue when bootstrapping the app. \r\nWhen new token permission data is received at runtime, we'll again run into the same UI issue.\r\n\r\nTo avoid that altogether, it's worth considering extending status-go's `handleCommunityDescription()` in which we check for token permission updates and if they exist, we perform an onchain check right away and put it into the response.\r\n\r\nClients then have the information they need right away. There's another issue about that here: https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/11157",
