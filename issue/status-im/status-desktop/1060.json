  "body": "Currently, styles are set by the `size` property, however we should be able to specify `size` as well as `style`, and they should be mutually exclusive.\r\n\r\nFor example, there is no way to be able to create a round button that looks like this\r\n![round button](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/551006230047358978/760346421156249662/unknown.png) with the correct hover states because the background and foreground colours are set automatically according the `size` given, and we do not have a hover state that covers this colour.\r\n\r\nWe should instead be able to set a style that tells the component how to style itself:\r\n```\r\nenum Style {\r\n    Primary,\r\n    Secondary,\r\n    Tertiary\r\n}\r\nenum Size {\r\n    Large,\r\n    Medium,\r\n    Small\r\n}\r\nproperty Style style: StatusRoundButton.Style.Primary\r\nproperty Size: StatusRoundButton: Size.Large\r\n```\r\nThe colours set out in the theme files would need to get a tertiary value as well, whereas currently they only have primary and secondary.\r\n\r\n### Example\r\nThe default styling of a \"large\" round button gets close to our target (above), but the hover states do not work. IMO, this styling would be a \"tertiary\" style, and the size would be \"large\". If we wanted to keep the tertiary style (colours) but change the size, we could keep the style as \"tertiary\", but change the size to \"medium\" or \"small\". ",
