I assume so, but tagging @John-44 to confirm.\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "> Also when you mentioned that it should load till there no more activity to load, does that mean if there are 100 transaction and we have loaded 25 for now, the user can scroll upto 75 more items? Does this mean we need to before hand how many total transactions are present for the particular address, afaik, I dont think that information is available to us from the go side.\r\n\r\n@Khushboo-dev-cpp what I mean is when when the user scrolls down past the end of the already fetched activity, we should display the skeletal loading state while we fetch say the next 25 transactions.  If the user then subsequently scrolls further down, we should again display the skeletal loading state while we fetch say the next 25 transactions.  etc, etc...   \r\n\r\nWe shouldn't attempt to fetch all of the transactions in one go, we should only fetch blocks of 25 transactions *in response to the user triggering a fetch* by scrolling down past the already fetched transactions.\r\n\r\nIf the user scrolls down past the already fetched transactions, and there are no more transaction that can be fetched (e.g. we request the next 25 transactions from the API, but only say 7 transactions are returned, because the user has reached the beginning of their transaction history) then we should display what @benjthayer has designed and is shown in his comment above.\r\n\r\nDoes that makes sense? \r\n",
