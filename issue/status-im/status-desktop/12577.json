If all members are kicked, would this screen be visible given all admins would also be kicked?\r\n\r\nIf admins aren't kicked via this process, my initial instinct was to suggest that we keep the users in the `All members` tab and just give them another treatment / label. They technically are still members from an Admin perspective given they will automatically rejoin as soon as the new owner node comes online. As an admin, I would be worried if my membership count went down to 0 during this interim period, so classing them as technically still members during this phase would be reassuring. I would also still want the ability to kick and ban users during this phase if possible so keeping them in the `All members` tab keeps this screen and the associated `Kick` and `Ban` controls consistent. \r\n\r\nWDYT?\r\n\r\ncc @John-44 ",
