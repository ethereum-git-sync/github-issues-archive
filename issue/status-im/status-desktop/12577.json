If all members are kicked, would this screen be visible given all admins would also be kicked?\r\n\r\nIf admins aren't kicked via this process, my initial instinct was to suggest that we keep the users in the `All members` tab and just give them another treatment / label. They technically are still members from an Admin perspective given they will automatically rejoin as soon as the new owner node comes online. As an admin, I would be worried if my membership count went down to 0 during this interim period, so classing them as technically still members during this phase would be reassuring. I would also still want the ability to kick and ban users during this phase if possible so keeping them in the `All members` tab keeps this screen and the associated `Kick` and `Ban` controls consistent. \r\n\r\nWDYT?\r\n\r\ncc @John-44 ",

And if permissions have changed, they would be kicked and not appear in the members list anyway.\r\n\r\nI'm just trying to think of the specific advantage to the owner of being able to differentiate between those members that have rejoined and those that haven't yet given it seems to be so automated and simply be a product of their online/offline status. \r\n\r\nIf we do want to amend the UI to flag which of the members are yet to re-share their addresses and rejoin we could do something minimal like the below but I think this is only needed if we can identify the core use case for the owner differentiating between the \"ghost\" members and those that have rejoined.

Unless the permissions changed, the user can auto rejoin by just going back online.\r\n\r\n> If we do want to amend the UI to flag which of the members are yet to re-share their addresses and rejoin we could do something minimal like the below but I think this is only needed if we can identify the core use case for the owner differentiating between the \"ghost\" members and those that have rejoined. Off the top of my head, I suppose it would be useful to know how many of my community I will actually reach with @everyone type messages etc?\r\n\r\nI guess so yes. We wanted something because the people are not actually members until they come back online, so even though the owner could see the members in the management UI, in the chat UI, you won't see anyone.\r\n\r\nKnowing who didn't join back can also be helpful in case something went wrong (lost message). That way, the owner can tell the user to leave the community and send a new request to join.",

    "body": "> How can we solve it - send old requests to join from an old owner to the new one and update only state (waiting for an auto-rejoin)\r\n\r\nIMO, asking the old owner for the request to join, even though most of the time it would return the right data, cannot be trusted, since the old owner could just go away forever at that point as well.\r\n\r\nSo asking the old owner just for the date joined seems like a strain on the network and more complexity on our side for a very small gain. I think it would simpler to just show an \"unknown date\" or  a symbol until we do get the data from the users back.",
