    "body": "I think it would be best to modify the design to accommodate the min 680px height scenario as opposed to scrolling the progress bars (sometimes the cutoff of content is in a place where there is no affordance for scrolling - i.e. no content is cut through - so the user might not see that some data has not been fetched if below the scroll point).\r\n\r\nWe have 2 options for accommodating the 680px size:\r\n1) We rejig the design so it is slightly more condensed - we use this more condensed design irrespective of app window height (it works for all window heights)\r\n2) We responsively scale the data fetch animation - as the user reduces the window height, we scale down the animation size.\r\n\r\nIt might come down to which is more straightforward from an implementation perspective?",

    "body": "@saledjenic that's a good point - reducing the number of categories will help with space for sure. The only thing we risk doing by grouping the data to more abstract categories is reducing the granularity of feedback to the user when types of data fail to fetch. The more detailed we can be on what couldn't be fetched, the more informed the user is on whether they wish to proceed without the missing data. \r\n\r\nFor the Wallet category for example, I'd be ok with losing my watch-only accounts but not my keypairs. So we would need some form of descriptive feedback anyway stipulating what has failed to be fetched within the broader category which in itself would take up room. ",
