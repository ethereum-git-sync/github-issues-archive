    "body": "Hi,\n\nHere are the list of steps to reproduce the issue along with the result. This is to account for any update on the source code that could have made since the ticket was created on June 6.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n0. I recompiled Status-desktop from the source\n1. I created a test account and kept the seed phrase\n2. I make clean from the source code, and deleted the Keys in Keystore\n3. I launched Status-desktop (using `make run`)\n4. `I don't have other device` -> `Enter seed phrase`\n5. I enter previously saved seed phrase\n\n### Result\n\n![Image](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/2589171/55c08467-677b-40e6-aa7a-5f46d1627961)\n\n### From code perspective : \n\nThis issue is similar to #10939 and was fixed by @noeliaSD with commit https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/commit/e36ace38b2383059c702d852a5dc63fd6ab5c7f7 just `3 weeks ago`\n\n### Further analysis\n\nI have also tried to reduce the window to its minimum, and the result is still consistent with expectations. \nNote : This picture shows the entire window.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/2589171/2bb7e773-9e0c-4adb-9a2d-f6ca60447012)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis is different from the posted screenshot by @0x-r4bbit where the gif, `fetching data...` and `list view` and `continue button`  block is not centered in the parent window.\n\n@0x-r4bbit @jrainville Any concerns closing this ticket based on evidence gathered above ?",
