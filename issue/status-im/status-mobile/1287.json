Sections below)\r\n*Summary*: Several Instabug users complained on many steps to be done for deleting a chat. They ask for some alternative way like forcetouch or long tap on the chat item or swipe gesture (that seems like not an option because tabs navigation already uses it). \r\n\r\nI would agree that deleting a chat might be quite frequent operation (we add chat for each opened DApp atm) and shorter set of steps would be better.\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n[comment]: # (Describe what you expected to happen.)\r\nless than 4 steps for a user on Chats screen to delete a chat\r\n#### Actual behavior\r\n[comment]: # (Describe what actually happened.)\r\n4 steps to delete a chat right now:\r\n- in Chats tap on 3 dots\r\n- tap on Edit Chats\r\n- tap on 3 dots next to the chat\r\n- tap on delete chat\r\n\r\n### Instabug \r\n* \"Deleting items by forcetouch/ swipe gestic would be nice\" https://dashboard.instabug.com/applications/status/beta/bugs/326\r\n* \"Here I really want to be able to swipe left on an individual chat to reveal a delete button. Many apps have this functionality included so I think many people do it by instinct.\" https://dashboard.instabug.com/applications/status/beta/bugs/197\r\n* \"need to be able to delete a chat thread easily once its up...\" https://dashboard.instabug.com/applications/status-10bb8cbc-15f6-44f0-8c7a-db478dc34d7d/beta/bugs/543\r\n* \"long press menus to delete chats\" https://dashboard.instabug.com/applications/status-10bb8cbc-15f6-44f0-8c7a-db478dc34d7d/beta/bugs/545\r\n* \"To manage the chat list, it should be manipulated by finger but not through the dots menu. For example, if I want to delete a chat item, what I am expected is tapping on the chat item a little longer than hitting and slipping left, then the delete button appears for deletion operation\" https://dashboard.instabug.com/applications/status/beta/bugs/364\r\n* \"I think it would be nice if we can have an easier way to delete a chat. Instead of going to the three dots at the top right and clicking on edit chat etc. It would be nice to either slide the specific chat we want to delete to the left and have the option there to delete, like the iPhone deletes text messages, or hold down the specific chat for a second and then having the option to delete pop up. Thanks. \" https://dashboard.instabug.com/applications/status/beta/bugs/509",
