If these permissions aren't necessary, you may be able to use alternative methods in your app and request fewer permissions. If they are, we recommend providing an explanation to users of why you need the permissions\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think we have this permission since times when it was possible to get your phone contacts. IT was removed long time ago and imo, there are no features that require READ_PROFILE permission. If it's true then READ_PROFILE should be removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
