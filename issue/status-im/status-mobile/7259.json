There are 4 cases.\n\n1) A user received an error message as below (Windows 7 32bit)\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41753422/51070342-8b9c7180-15f4-11e9-8c76-b0aba652445c.png)\n\nIt does not support 32 bit operating systems\n\n2) A user received an error message as below (Windows 10 64bit)\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41753422/51070172-a3262b00-15f1-11e9-8538-cd173e8b51f0.png)\n\nIt says 'Windows Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting. Running this app might put your PC at risk.' The only option that the user can choose it not to run this program.\n\nI found a similar case on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48946680/how-to-avoid-the-windows-defender-smartscreen-prevented-an-unrecognized-app-fro)\n\n3) Some users received an error message as below (Windows 10 64bit)\n\n\"We were not able to decrypt your data, you might need to create new account and erase your old data by tapping “Apply”. Clicking on “Cancel”, will try again\"\n\nThe users cannot make progress from this step.\n\n4) Some users clicked on the Status Desktop icon on Windows but it does not respond. They can find the program on 'Task manager' and the process is running although it shows nothing. (Windows 7 & 10)\n\n# Notes\nAll the cases have resulted from Windows.\n\n# Future Steps\nThe root cause should be figured out and fixed from the next version on.\n\n",

The SmartScreen dialog has a link which expands a section which allows you to run the application. There are two things we could do here to avoid the user having to deal with this dialog (as per Microsoft's [blog post](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ie/2010/10/13/stranger-danger-introducing-smartscreen-application-reputation/)) cc @rachelhamlin @jarradh:\r\n    - Digitally sign the app with an Authenticode signature;\r\n    - Apply for a Windows Logo.\r\n3. \r\n4. Are there any logs created in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Status`?",
