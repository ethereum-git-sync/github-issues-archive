  "body": "_Part of #9274 onboarding with Keycard epic (mark as checked there, when closing this issue)_\n\n- Suggesting new copy to help address the possible question the user might have:\n\n```\nConfirm the seed phrase\nWrite down word #3 below. Just to help you make sure you backed up the seed phrase down correctly\n```\n\n- Is it okay that it's possible to go back and see the seed phrase again? If not, it should be \"Cancel\" instead of the \"back\" icon;\n- The layout should be fixed according to Figma. The word is vertically and horizontally centered;\n- The keyboard should never disappear on this screen;\n- There should only be \"Next >\" in the toolbar, no \"< Back\";\n- The error message should be shown according to Figma. It should say \"Wrong word\" and select the word, to help users enter a different word without having to manually erase the incorrect one;\n- After the incorrect word is erased, the \"Wrong word\" error **should disappear**. This is especially important on small screens since there the error tooltip might overlap the subheading;\n\n<img width=\"1280\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-10-31 at 17 36 40\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3115606/67935541-04f96500-fc05-11e9-8dce-514445d4873e.png\">\n\n<img width=\"791\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-10-31 at 17 46 40\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3115606/67936258-6a9a2100-fc06-11e9-9195-258bcf90d355.png\">\n\n<img width=\"1174\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-10-31 at 17 46 06\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3115606/67936261-6d951180-fc06-11e9-8cd3-1b1fa1ebebf7.png\">\n\n\nFigma:\nBig screens: https://www.figma.com/file/dEIljL7UPbXgsZUA0Q4qlE5E/Onboarding?node-id=4540%3A11551\nSmall screens: https://www.figma.com/file/dEIljL7UPbXgsZUA0Q4qlE5E/Onboarding?node-id=5084%3A0",
