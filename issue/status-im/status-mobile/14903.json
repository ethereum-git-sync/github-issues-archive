(more [details](https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/pull/14783#discussion_r1084603578))\r\n2. Better transition between blurred bottom tabs & normal bottom tabs. Currently, we are changing to blurred bottom tabs when the shell has more than 6 cards. We should use animations and transitions with a scroll position (design input required)",
