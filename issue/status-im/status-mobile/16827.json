In that case, what should we show when one animation cycle is completed?\r\n\r\n## Problem \r\n\r\nThere's a frame that shouldn't be there at the end of the `key saving` animation, as you can see after the key has been grabbed by the end and goes inside the device the particles appear once again at the end of the animation, for a couple of frames.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/assets/122543089/d5728659-0b11-4289-995e-6662ca549684\r\n\r\nThe animation should end here:\r\n![IMG_0292](https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/assets/122543089/50423df8-1c05-499a-b02a-90247a92ce2b)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n- Status version: nightly 1/08\r\n- Operating System: iOS\r\n\r\n\r\n[comment]: # (Please, add logs/notes if necessary)\r\n\r\n",
