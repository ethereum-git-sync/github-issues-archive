    "body": "So after lots of trials, it seems the problem is in RNN. RNN is not able to handle SET opening animations in complex components on Android. \r\n\r\nThe opening animation does execute only when the screen has a very simple view, and no flatlist (in release mode only, and even so, it sometimes does not work). Having a FlatList, or a view inside a complex view causes the animation not to execute. The lightbox screen is a complex component and is using a flatlist.\r\n\r\nI will keep this issue open for now and mark it as blocked, maybe after upgrading RN version, things may improve on Android. Also, Reanimated v3 has a [new shared elements transitions feature](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/api/sharedElementTransitions/#:~:text=A%20Shared%20Element%20Transition%20allows,view%20with%20the%20same%20sharedTransitionTag%20.).",
