Run E2E for nightly on the devel CI by fetching nightly artifacts directly from DigitalOcean bucket.\r\n2. Run E2E for nightly on the release CI but implement some kind of global session locking mechanism.\r\n\r\nThe former is simpler, but does require extra logic to find the latest nightly build.\r\nThe latter is the more correct solution, but would require finding or developing some kind of locking API to use in both jobs.\r\nOne possibility would be to use [Consul API locking mechanism](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/dynamic-app-config/sessions) in some kind of script.",
