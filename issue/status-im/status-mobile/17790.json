Are changes to Community meta info like name and banner image correctly reflected in Status Mobile?  Etc, etc...\r\n\r\n- We need to get our quality bar to where we want it to be, and then keep tech. debt at a roughly fixed level as we build out any additional functionality.\r\n\r\n- Going forward, as much as is sensible, all new functionality should meet the higher quality bar we are aiming for before landing.\r\n\r\n**4.

Bug is not reproducible every time\r\n\r\n**Preconditions:** User A (Android) turns on push notifications\r\n\r\n**Steps:** \r\n\r\n1. User A opens 1-1 chat with User B\r\n2. User A closes the app\r\n3. User B sends mention/reply to User A in community channel\r\n4. User A taps on PN \r\n5. See if User A is redirected into community cahnnel\r\n\r\n**Actual result:** sometimes User A remains on 1-1 chat screen and is redirected to the channel. At the same time, the message in channel appears as read despite User A in fact has not opened the channel. \r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/assets/97245802/5ecbbb36-928a-4491-beb9-7dd446452a13\r\n\r\n[Status-debug-logs (76).zip](https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/files/13226198/Status-debug-logs.76.zip)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected result:** User A should be redirected to the right chat upon PN. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n- Status version: nightly \r\n- Operating System: Android\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

([reference](https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/blob/fb8a7d2d8e133d63077eb17b9caac10f9b779807/src/status_im2/contexts/chat/events.cljs#L219))\r\n\r\nStill, we have `(close-chat false)` in the `navigate-to-chat` event that should have closed the current 1-1 chat (even if the view is not destroyed).\r\nI didn't look much into the issue and am not sure why `current-chat-id` didn't update while navigating, still, the issue might be related to this.  We probably need to `pop-to-root` before navigating to community chat from notification.",
