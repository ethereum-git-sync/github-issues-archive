    "body": "I'm sorry to hear that @OmarBasem, but unfortunately I've never faced this problem to help much. I hate when my DX is affected by anything.\r\n\r\nBut, you could try some things to pinpoint the issue.\r\n\r\n- Since when has this problem started to happen? I'm assuming it's relatively new to happen every day for you (?). If that's the case, you can checkout older commits and see if you can identify when the problem first appeared (bisect) . But if the problem is sort of non-deterministic, this could take too long :/\r\n\r\n- Have you recently upgraded anything on your machine that could be related?\r\n\r\n- Another thing we can try is to upgrade shadow-cljs, which is quite old already. Assuming it could be related to shadow-cljs... There have been many fixes since our current version. Last week I upgraded shadow-cljs to a newer version in a local branch, but not new enough that I think would help fix your issue. Going on a tangent, I think shadow-cljs should be kept up-to-date, period, because Clojure is a very stable language, it's not like Webpack for instance.\r\n\r\n- The other thing is that, even though I use NixOS for full reproducibility, I sometimes had to restart my machine even after killing all processes, but it was rare and never happened for months already. The only reason I can think of is that restarting the machine is likely cleaning up caches (in temp files, etc).",
