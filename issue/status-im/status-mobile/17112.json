Sorry I am not able to get the whole context from the video, did you open composer while messages are scrolled to this position, or they auto-scrolled on keyboard opening?\r\n2. Is the issue consistently reproducible in your device? If this is the case I can create a PR and we can try a few fixes. wdyt?",
