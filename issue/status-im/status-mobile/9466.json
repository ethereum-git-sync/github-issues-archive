  "body": "As a user\r\nI want to maintain connectivity with at least a waku-node even if the one I am connected goes down\r\nSo that I can continue using the app if there are some technical issues\r\n\r\n### Assumptions\r\n* Waku nodes are used in the app\r\n* The client connects to a single waku-node\r\n\r\n### Problem\r\n\r\nBy connecting to a single node, the app would loose connectivity if that node is down. \r\n\r\nIn that case the app should connect to the next available node, ideally the closest based on ping times, after retrying for a reasonable amount of time.\r\n\r\nIn such cases, no data loss should occur (i.e messages that have been sent while the app was offline should be somehow retrieved).\r\n\r\nIf https://github.com/status-im/status-react/issues/9467 has already been implemented, the fastest node must be used.\r\n\r\n### Acceptance criteria\r\n\r\n* If connectivity with a waku-node is lost, the app should retry for a reasonable amount of time (tbd) and eventually connect to a different node if retry attempts fail\r\n* No data loss should occur after the app comes back online\r\n* (Optional) Use the closest node, measured on ping time, if https://github.com/status-im/status-react/issues/9467 is already implemented\r\n\r\nDepends on https://github.com/status-im/status-react/issues/9465",
