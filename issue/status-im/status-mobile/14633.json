    "body": "So the issue is with devices with notch and dimensions/window\r\n\r\n- With notch devices providing height only of the screen without a status bar included.\r\n- While without notch devices providing height with status bar included.\r\n\r\nSo first we have to detect if the device has a notch, and if it has we need to manually add status-bar height.\r\n\r\nBut the problem is how to detect the notch.\r\n1. [First way](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/23693#issuecomment-662860819) - According to official android [guidelines](https://m2.material.io/design/platform-guidance/android-bars.html#status-bar), a simple status bar (without a notch) should have a height of 24, so we can detect the status bar height and compare it with this. But for some reason, several android devices don't follow this. For example `Real me 1`\r\n2. [Another way](https://stackoverflow.com/a/56975058) is using the `react-native-device-info` library. But I am not sure, if even this library will be able to provide correct data because from some research of native java code on how to detect notch, they all are relying on 24 guidelines.\r\nBut I am currently not able to test this due to https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/issues/14651\r\n\r\nAnd even if this library will be able to detect notch correctly, we probably shouldn't use it. Because we had a problem with the library in the past while releasing fdroid releases (due to google dependency)\r\nhttps://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/issues/11809 https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/pull/13360",
