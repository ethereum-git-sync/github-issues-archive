Remove < and >)\r\n\r\n### User Story\r\n\r\nAs a user, I want messages to not vanish so that I can read them :).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n[comment]: # (Feature or Bug? i.e Type: Bug)\r\n*Type*: Bug\r\n\r\nEvery day I've been chatting a lot with Status Desktop Mac in 1-1 and public chats, but after quitting and re-opening the app I've seen many messages vanish.\r\n\r\nSometimes I still see the chat channel (eg #status-desktop) but messages are removed. Sometimes all but 1 message is removed, other times there are seemingly random messages removed.\r\n\r\nOther times the chat channel is gone too.\r\n\r\nSo far I haven't been able to notice a pattern.\r\n\r\nIt has happened both when I quit for the night, then install Status desktop in the morning.\r\nAlso happens when I quit for 20 minutes then re-open.\r\n\r\n5 other people have reported this on Slack.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE**:  This is also happening on mobile\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\nVisible message remain in the app.\r\n\r\n#### Actual behavior\r\nMessages vanish.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nI can't reliably repro. But try talking lots. Quitting. Then re-open the app.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n[comment]: # (Please do your best to fill this out.)\r\n* Status version: Nightlies for past few weeks\r\n[comment]: # (Android or iOS.)\r\n* Operating System: Mac + iOS + Android\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "@chadyj So far I have been unable to replicate the issue, but I created PR where suspected area of code (db handling) is done in synchronous way, which should help is investigate the issue, because:\r\n1. Normally, the db writing is done in async manner, so db writes don't slow down the rest of the applications (it remains responsive). With db writes done synchronously, instead of dropping them, the application would just slow down and become laggy, so that's something to test.\r\n2. Even if the above is not happening, doing write in synchronous way will provide better debugging info about failed writes/transactions.\r\n\r\nHere is the PR - https://github.com/status-im/status-react/pull/6195",

    "body": "We figured out that one of the major reason why chats and/or messages disappear (or re-appear like in https://github.com/status-im/status-react/issues/6114#issuecomment-427315414) is that after `transport.topic` error appears, which described in https://github.com/status-im/status-react/issues/5204, - app “stops” to keep further history. And once you re-login to account the history may look vanished.  \r\n\r\nFor example your account has only #status public channel with message history. Then account faced #5204 issue (which is the soft error pop-up) but you keep using the app: you join 5 more new chats and received 100 new messages #status public chat. \r\nOnce you re-login to the account (with app restart, or re-login with running app) - the only history contact will see is #status public channel without 100  new messages (received after transport.topic).\r\n\r\nIn order to reproduce from scratch:\r\n1) Open Status on Desktop app and create new account (Contact1)\r\n2) Join several public chats from `Selected for you` list bu the Contact1\r\n3) Remember recovery phrase of the Contact1\r\n4) Open Status on Device 2 and create new account (Contact2)\r\n5) Log out of Contact1 on Desktop app\r\n6) Recover Contact1 account of Device3\r\n7) Contact1(from Device3) adds Contact2 in contacts (e.g. via QR code scan) and sends a text message\r\n8) Contact2 navigates to 1-1 chat with Contact1 and taps 'Add to contacts'\r\n9) Contact2 sends several text messages to Contact1\r\n10) Contact1 logs in to the account from Desktop App (Note: Contact1 receives text messages from Contact2 from offline inbox after login)\r\n11) Contact1 (on Desktop App) taps 'Add to Contacts' Note: at this step the `transport.topic` error appears (described in the #5204)\r\n12) Contact1 joins one more public chat from Desktop app (e.g. #cryptokitties-co)\r\n13) Contact1 replies to Contact2 in 1-1 chat with the text message `Hello who are you?`\r\n14) Reopen the Desktop app Contact1 used and log in to account.\r\n\r\n**Actual result:** **There is no** #cryptokitties-co chat and `Hello who are you?` message added/sent in 12th and 13th step.\r\n\r\nContact1 keep using the app normally and all is OK(re-logins keeps the history), but there is a Contact2 in the list with persistent 'Add to Contacts' option. If you tap it again, #5204 bug **may not even fire up again** but all further history won't be kept on Desktop app. ",
