  "body": "**Context**\n\nWe have developed a 'request screen' feature which has two flavors\n**- one for payments authorized by the keycard to a destination adress**\nissue\nhttps://github.com/status-im/status-react/issues/9275 \nspec \nhttps://notes.status.im/mkFLHD6ORzmCTRYTdk13mA\n**- one to redeem assets from a smart contract to a destination adress**\nissue and sepc\nhttps://github.com/status-im/status-react/issues/10223\n\nWe have identified a new need for a dApp to get through a javascript call\n- an information from the card, meaning some data stored by the card itself. \nE.g In Teller dApp, the buyer who buys crypto, coudl tap his keycard on the seller phone, and with this tap provide the adress of the wallet where he wants to receive his funds. This wallet adress can be anything set-up by the user when setting up his keycard. \nFor more details (check 22/04/2020 notes) https://notes.status.im/CUhwfiqwRw64sjhww3q1rQ\n- the keycard cash public adress\nEven though this information can be obtained by the dApp by signing an arbitray information, and recovering the public key, this is somehow confusing for the user and longer. \n\n**Implementation**\n\nWe need to implement a new screen:\n- which is called by a javascript call \n- which returns two informations: the keycard cash public key , and an INFO field \n- which says to the user \"Please tap your card to provide your wallet adress\". We can add a note that explains that no signature is performed by the card in this operation\n\nWe need keycard applet to implement this feature\n\ncc @bitgamma @hesterbruikman @gravityblast @siphiuel",
