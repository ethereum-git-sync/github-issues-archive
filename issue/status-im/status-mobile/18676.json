  "body": "# Problem\r\n\r\nAt the moment, integration tests in `src/status_im/integration_test/` are not the easiest to write or read.\r\n\r\n- The tests rely on macros to abstract anything, because `day8.re-frame.test/wait-for` is a macro.\r\n- The tests read like JS pyramids of doom due to the need to indent the body passed to each waiting step.\r\n- The developer must remember to wait on `legacy.status-im.multiaccounts.logout.core/logout-method`. We had a case where we forgot about this and the developer wasted a long time trying to find the reason. This also increases the verbosity of each integration test.\r\n- Integration tests spit too much noise due to logs.\r\n- There's no README (e.g. in `src/status_im/integration_test/`) to explain what they are and how to write them.\r\n\r\n### Motivation for this issue\r\n\r\nReduce the effort to read & write integration tests. This will be more and more important as we write more integration tests, as we can see from all the issues opened to increase coverage through these tests. See https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22E%3AMobile+Integration+Tests%22.\r\n\r\ncc @J-Son89 ",
