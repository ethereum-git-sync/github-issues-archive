  "body": "# Problem\r\n\r\nUsing React Native Testing Library effectively is not simple. The developer has to take a few things in consideration and there are specific techniques regarding ClojureScript. \r\n\r\nRecently, after the latest RN upgrade, a few problems appeared, which forced us to disable tests, disrupting developer's workflows, but many of the failures could have been avoided if we wrote the tests in a more reliable way.\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\n- Document our lessons learned. PR https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/pull/18276 contains a few of them, but look further for other things.\r\n- Consider writing the docs in an open way, not as hard rules because there are multiple ways to write RNTL tests that might pass.",
