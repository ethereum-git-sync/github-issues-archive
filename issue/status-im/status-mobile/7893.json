Sections below)\n_Summary_: If Status app is not launched and you put your phone on keycard and does not move them: Status app is launched automatically and let's you to select into which account to sign in (I have 2 accounts). If keycard account is selected and user types correct PIN then screen \"Hold card to the back of your phone\" is shown despite the fact that card is already touches phone. I waited for ~3 minutes and it was still expecting the card. After user removes card and holds it again then he can sign in to the app successfully.\n\n#### Expected behavior\n[comment]: # (Describe what you expected to happen.)\nCard is detected\n\n#### Actual behavior\n[comment]: # (Describe what actually happened.)\nCard is not detected, so user needs to remove it and hold again\n\n### Reproduction\n[comment]: # (Describe how we can replicate the bug step by step.)\n\n* Kill Status app, so it's not running on background\n* put your phone on the card -> Status will launch automatically (do not move card or phone)\n* enter correct PIN\n* check what screen is shown \n\n### Additional Information\n[comment]: # (Please do your best to fill this out.)\n\n* Status version: 0.12.0 apk http://status-im-prs.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/StatusIm-190402-123212-80ef5d-pr.apk\n* Operating System: Android 9, Pixel XL\n\n#### Logs\nfull logcat:\n[allcard2.log](https://github.com/status-im/status-react/files/3039563/allcard2.log)\n\n",
