  "body": "cc @cammellos I am not sure on which side (Desktop or Mobile) this issue should be addressed. Tell please what do you think based on the description below. \r\n\r\n**Preconditions:** User M - mobile user, User D - desktop user\r\n\r\n**Steps**\r\n\r\n1. Users M and D are mutual contacts\r\n2. Initiate 1-1 chat between User M and User D\r\n3. By User M remove User D from contacts (or vice verse) in order users stop to be mutual contacts\r\n4. User D opens existing 1-1 chat with User M\r\n5. User D sends messages in 1-1 chat\r\n6. See if messages are delivered and received by User M\r\n\r\n**Actual result:** messages are delivered and received by User M. Overall, we currently have different UI behaviour between Mobile and Desktop in terms of input field  in 1-1 chat between non contacts: on mobile we disable chat input field in case if users are not mutual contacts so there is no possibility to send messages. On desktop, chat input field is enabled in 1-1 chat with non contact user and it is possible to send messages. But in case with chat between 2 desktop users who are not mutual - those messages are not delivered and received on recipient side. \r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97245802/220360860-d9b6b8a6-c609-4a4a-88b6-0e5f0da580d8.mp4\r\n\r\n[User_M.zip](https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/files/10793987/User_M.zip)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected result:** messages should not be delivered to User M as he is not mutual contact to User D **OR** from Desktop perspective it would be correct to disable input field in 1-1 chat with non contact. Fix on Desktop side looks like easier fix and in its turn will provide compliance between desktop and mobile UI for such case. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n- Status mobile version: release/1.21.x\r\n- Operating System: Android, iOS\r\n\r\n- Status Desktop version 0.10.0 https://ci.infra.status.im/job/status-desktop/job/release/job/release%252F0.10.x/10/\r\n\r\n\r\n[comment]: # (Please, add logs/notes if necessary)\r\n\r\n",
