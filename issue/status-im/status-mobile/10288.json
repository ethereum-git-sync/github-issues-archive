    "body": "@Serhy I just tested the Zerion Dapp in Metamask and the same behaviour happens. \r\n\r\nThe problem is with the Dapp itself, and not with Status. A Dapp should watch for account changes and then react accordingly. That's why Cryptokitty and Sablier don't have the issue.\r\n\r\nOne way to fix it inside Status would be to force refresh the Dapp when we switch accounts, but it is not something we should do. Metamask did do that before, but they stopped because it was bad UX to force a refresh. Here is how they recommend Dapps check the accounts: https://github.com/MetaMask/faq/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#ear-listening-for-selected-account-changes\r\n\r\nAlso, in Embark we handle the account changes for the Dapp, but Zerion doesn't use Embark, it uses Truffle.\r\n\r\nSo, IMO, we should move this issue to the Zerion repo: https://github.com/zeriontech/defi-sdk",
