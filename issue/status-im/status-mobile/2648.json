And message sent by others users on the chat will not reach the user whose name were not properly updated.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\n- User 1 opens Status using an iPhone (iOS)\r\n- User 2 opens Status using Samsung (Android)\r\n- As User 1, navigate to the \"Discover\" page and stay there.\r\n- As User 2, edit you profile then, edit and change your status and your name, save.\r\n- User 1 will see the new status and the new name on the discovery page, everything is correct.\r\n- As User 2, navigate to the \"Discover\" page and stay there.\r\n- As User 1, edit your profile then, edit and change your status and your name, save (see screenshot 1).\r\n- User 2 will see the new status however, the name has not been updated and the old one is still displayed (see screenshot 2).\r\n-  As User 2, on the \"Discover\" page, tap the \"Chat\" button displayed next to User 1 name on the Chat page, the User 1 previous status and name are still displayed on the chat.\r\n-  As User 1, select the chat with the new message on the \"Chat\" page, notice that on the User 2 update name is correctly displayed on the chat but User 2 previous status is still displayed.\r\n- As User 2 send a text to User 1 on the chat, User 1 will see the text.\r\n- As User 1 send a text to User 2 on the chat (reply to User 2 using the same chat), User 2 will not see the text.\r\n\r\n**Note:** \r\nScreenshot 4) shows User 2 screen and Screenshot 5) shows User 1 screen after exchanging messages. \r\nUser 2 sent \"Hello Test 0\" which User 1 received but, User 2 did not received \"Hello test 1\" sent by User 1. Later on, User 1 sent \"Hello test 2\" which User 2 received.\r\n\r\n1) \r\n![img_2043](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33925578/33688549-af187972-dad3-11e7-95d9-7ed4fee1d44b.PNG)\r\n\r\n2)\r\n![screenshot_20171206-214319](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33925578/33688590-dd2e3842-dad3-11e7-8c5d-95530aa1e450.png)\r\n\r\n3)\r\n![screenshot_20171206-220010](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33925578/33688626-f952a74c-dad3-11e7-97df-ac073045c8ac.png)\r\n\r\n4)\r\n![screenshot_20171206-222831](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33925578/33689368-15fb0be8-dad7-11e7-8f4c-e6dd6f3ed42c.png)\r\n\r\n5)\r\n<img width=\"320\" alt=\"file_001\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33925578/33690335-fc30bdbc-dada-11e7-82dd-7c92d8670226.png\">\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n* Status version: 0.9.12 (1557.321)\r\n\r\n* Operating System: Android, iOS",
