  "body": "# Bug Report\n\nUser have reported bad performance when chatting on private group chats.\n\n## Problem\n\nThis can be due to many factors:\n1) Private group chats are an extension of 1-to-1s, so in order to send a message you will have to send n messages, one for each member.\n2) Because of redundancy, the history is also transmitted with each message, increasing the cost of POW calculation.\n\n\n### Potential solutions\n1) Is harder to fix, a possible solution is to have a shared topic among members and collate messages there (similarly to server-side fan-out in the same way signal/whatsapp do). It can be further improved by encrypting the message with a single shared key and pairwise encrypt the encryption key.\n2) Is easier, we just have to only propagate history when we think it might not have been acknowledged, and we can do that only some times and opportunistically.",
