It's not even required to input any password.\r\nI think such feature should be secured with account authentication.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"565\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/assets/25482501/da130f81-3fd1-45bd-bbc0-0cbb6cd7a47e\">\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nAccount removal is only possible after authentication.\r\n\r\n#### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nAccount removal is possible without authentication.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\n1. Open Status\r\n2. Create an account, if you don't have any\r\n3. Click the meatball button next to an account\r\n4. A menu with \"Remove this account from device\" opens.\r\n",

Even if we hide account removal behind authentication, someone who has access to your device can always clear data of the app. (Account is gone)\r\n2. And by allowing users to remove accounts from his/her device without authentication, we are allowing him/her to get rid of accounts that are not accessible anymore. (Password forgotten/Owner of the particular account/profile is not available anymore)",
