  "body": "# Problem\n\nWhen pressing \"Pay to chat\" the user is asked to sign a transaction. However he can move forward and send the transaction even though his balance is insufficient, leading to a failed transaction.\n\nThe main problem is that the wallet is not managing failed erc20 token transaction very well, because they don't emit logs and may just appear as a regular transaction with 0 eth and some data.\n\n## Implementation\n\nIn the context of TTT we will first manage this issue with UI limitations, as it is done with the regular wallet flow for token transactions.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\nUser can't move forward with signing \"pay to chat\" transaction when he doesn't own enough SNT",
