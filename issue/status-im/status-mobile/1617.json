    "body": "After examining some options how to approach this, here is the recipe I propose to use:\r\n\r\n1. As a first step all event handlers needs to be pure, taking co-effects and returning effects, this is ongoing effort and we are steadily moving towards it\r\n\r\n2. Look out for events which are never called as result of \"outside\" actions as for example user input, network callback, jail callback, etc. Remove those events and incorporate their logic and return value into effects of event handlers from which they were called from.\r\n\r\n3. When we have events which are called both as an result of outside actions and from within another event handlers, don't register event handlers as an anonymous functions, define named functions instead. Then whenever such event was previously called from within another event handler, instead of dispatching the event (or rather signalling the dispatch via `:dispatch/dispatch-n` effect), call the plain function registered for the event and use it's return value in effects of the originally called event handler. \r\nTypical example of such events are `set-chat-input-text`, `set-chat-input-metadata` events.\r\nInstead of dispatching those events whenever some event handler needs to update current chat input, like this:\r\n```clj\r\n{:dispatch-n [[:set-chat-input-text \"blah\"]\r\n              [:set-chat-input-metadata nil]]}\r\n```\r\nWe will just call the functions to collect effects value:\r\n```\r\n(let [fx (-> db\r\n             (set-chat-input-text \"blah\")\r\n             (set-chat-input-metadata nil))])\r\n```\r\nProof of concept branch where I started with the work: https://github.com/status-im/status-react/tree/feature/shorter-event-chains-%231617 (unfortunately it's based on the still un-merged #1570 as pure handlers (point 1) are prerequisite for points 2 and 3)\r\n\r\nIn the beginning, this will of course \"only\" reduce number of events dispatched and won't magically fix any bugs, reduce accidental code complexity, or remove redundancy in business logic (as we can see in the screenshot above posted by @oskarth , sometimes user action leads to multiple events of the same type being issued, see the `set-chat-ui-props`event which is fired 3 (!) times when one particular chat is opened).\r\n\r\nBut I would argue that once steps 1-3 are in place, we are much better positioned for business logic refactoring, bugfixing and removing of duplicate actions, the reasons why:\r\n\r\n* You don't have to follow business logic being spread over chain of n-events, possible defined in multiple namespaces, instead you can look at (in ideal case) one handler where function composition defines business logic in one place, it's easy to jump to/from symbol (like function name) definitions in proper Clojure editor/IDE, and it's easy to test the composed handler function in repl, completely in isolation from running app, just inspecting returned effects, not really possible with event chains.\r\n\r\n* No need to pass arguments like `chat-id` or `account-id` between event handlers for sake of atomicity of user action, app-db lookup is sufficient.\r\n\r\nOpen questions:\r\n\r\n* We probably need some common standard for input/output format of handler functions. In my proof of concept branch,  I didn't do that and handler functions are minimal in the sense, that when only db is needed and returned, it's the only argument and it's returned unwrapped as it is, effect map is returned only when some particular handler function needs to return  more then `:db` effect, etc. \r\nCorrect composition of all handler functions (when used together in more complicated effect handler) is then solely responsibility of the calling effect handler.\r\nThis is probably not ideal and agreeing on some common interface (like always takes co-effects map and returns effects map) is better for less painful composition.\r\n\r\n* We will still have many cases where effect handler functions called in composition ends up doing very similar lookups (like looking up current chat id/input, etc.) which smells inefficiency and naturally screams for lifting up common lookups, etc. \r\nIf we will see that for example `:set-chat-input-text`, `:set-chat-input-metadata` and `set-chat-ui-props` are nine times out of ten called together, we can probably revisit the decision of having them (effect handler functions) declared separately and registered under separate dispatch keywords and instead define effect handler function `:set-chat-input` and parametrise for the rare cases when only ui-props/text/metadata need to be set.\r\n\r\nPlease provide feedback @rasom @flexsurfer @alwx @GustavoNunes  @oskarth @jeluard @yenda @retro @goranjovic",

    "body": "Historical insight from @rasom on slack:\r\n\r\n> So the reason why events like `:set-chat-input-text` were used previously is that we started implementation when effects/coeffects were not introduced, and we had three possible ways to write handlers \r\n> \r\n> 1) pure handlers which change db \r\n> 2) handlers with side effects which only dispatch other events \r\n> 3) handlers which change db and dispatch events\r\n> and as we didn’t want to have `3)` (imo it makes situation even worse) we used such events to move db changes outside impure handlers\r\n> \r\n> as we now have better options for handling side effects i don’t see any objections in elimination of `:set-chat-input-text`-like handlers",
