  "body": "## Bug Report\r\n\r\nWhen a user requests to join the community and it goes unattended, A \"Request hasn't been accepted\" notification is received in the Activity Center of the user. The unread dot of the notification overlaps with the timestamp.\r\n\r\n![Issue copy](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19339952/232018421-73327e0b-b8f9-4289-8bf7-7692aedddc00.png)\r\n\r\nIn [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/eDfxTa9IoaCMUy5cLTp0ys/Shell-for-Mobile?node-id=4537%3A515620&t=KbCqCLW3kNt9LXy0-1), The timestamp is **missing** in this notification type, and this needs to be discussed with the design team.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\n#### Precondition: User `A`  is an admin of a closed community. \r\n\r\n- User `A` shares community with user `B`\r\n- User `B` sends a \"Request to join the community\" \r\n- User `B` AC gets updated with a notification that he/she requested to join the community \r\n- User `A` receives a \"Join Request\" notification in AC and leaves the request unattended for 7 days \r\n- User `A` checks the \"Join Request\" notification in AC and it's removed (after 7 days)\r\n- User `B` opens the AC and sees that the \"Request hasn't been accepted\"\r\n\r\n### Possible Solution\r\nThe notification title can be a short one just as other notifications\r\n\r\n",
