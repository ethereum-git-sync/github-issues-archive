But the overall report is about *any* dupes consecutive or not, and that indeed is what I have been working on, and that is not fixed.\r\n\r\nMy approach was to leave history untouched and de-dupe in the :home-items subscription, thinking the problem is screen clutter so do the de-duping when preparing the screen elements. This has the advantage of otherwise preserving history. The fix is also straightforward: just toss (older) extras where the URL is the same. I have that code ready to go after I adjust it for the new browser structure.\r\n\r\nBut then we would have logic in browser.model de-duping consecutive visits unnecessarily, unless it serves some other purpose of which I am unaware. \r\n",

    "body": "Ok, one thing, @flexsurfer: the suggested approach of using the host as the browser-id is dead simple but a deep change that would, if I do it well, require me to track down all uses of the browser list and make sure I am not breaking anything. Or can someone such as yourself just direct me to do it that way? My thinking was, the stated problem is clutter, so de-clutter the screen. ie, Without altering the browser data being recorded or anything more invasive. Furthermore, it may develop that other kinds of de-cluttering are someday requested. Then we just expand the de-duping mechanism. If instead we figure out a way to de-dupe internally, future filtering will likely still need a last-second massaging of the data presented on the screen. Anyway...\r\n\r\nCan we safely settle on using the host as the browser-id, or should I track down all its usage?",

Since `goog.Uri` will thow an error on an input such as \"42\", I propose wrapping the above in a try-catch and simply returning nil on any invalid input, but then we need to alter the `:open-browser-in-url` event handler not to record/execute the open event. But then do we silently not navigate or alert the user to an internal failure? The alternative is to let the original exception go uncaught, or to throw a more scrutable error saying sth. like \"url-domain input url '42' is not a valid Uri\".  Then we still have the question of the user experience. Mind you, it may be that the new code can simply assume valid URLs will be found in the event url argument, in which case everything gets a lot simpler. Please advise. ps. I am guessing that the dependency on goog.Uri is OK since that is a guaranteed CLJS presence.",
