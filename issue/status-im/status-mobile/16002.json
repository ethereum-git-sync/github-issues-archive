Photo selector scrolled state does not match the designs: https://www.figma.com/file/wA8Epdki2OWa8Vr067PCNQ/Composer-for-Mobile?type=design&node-id=6376-372393&t=2auDEJpU1f8tQVGS-0\r\n2. Since the last updates to the bottom sheet screen, the opening animation is not as smooth as before, on iOS (videos below).\r\n3. Opening photo selector on iOS throws an error (screen shot below). Reproducible steps: open photo-selector, close it, open it again.\r\n4. Album selector does not close when pressing the top bar title, and throws a red screen error `undefined is not an object` (happens on iOS and Android)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnimation video before (the animation looks smooth and natural)\r\nhttps://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/assets/29354102/0046efe5-16dc-4d4c-bfb6-e97be61bf8f7\r\n\r\nAnimation video after (the animation is not slow, but the way the screen moves and then suddenly stops looks odd)\r\nhttps://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/assets/29354102/5e9714f1-04ac-47ad-af2c-8776268f9846\r\n\r\nError screen (point number 3)\r\n![unnamed (2)](https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/assets/29354102/9a899237-9851-49a6-85ee-2fc7004ccaea)\r\n",

    "body": " > interesting but for me videos look the opposite\r\n\r\n@flexsurfer You can try on iOS simulator to see the difference. Last commit before the change b1aec54e4ccb94e2c3272e9d8a63fa996c770540.\r\n\r\n> unable to replicate\r\n\r\nHappens in debug mode. For me it opens first time no problem, then second time this error happens. It doesn't happen everytime. Try a few times maybe.\r\n\r\n\r\n> is this album selector? what should happen when we press it ?\r\n\r\nWhen you press it on it should open album selector. When you press on it again while on album selector, it should go back to photo selector.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
