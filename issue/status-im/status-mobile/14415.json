  "body": "# Feature Issue\r\n\r\n### User Story\r\n\r\n>As a user,\r\n>I want easily see what requires my attention in the Activity Center,\r\n>So that I can promptly act on the most important notifications to me.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nNowadays, the new Activity Center is using the old Notification Center behavior for marking notifications as read. We should implement the new rules:\r\n\r\n1. With CTA (call to action) - should stay *unread* until the user acts on it.\r\n2. Without CTA - should loose *unread indicator* and go down the list after the user opens the AC or the same tab again.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior about ordering\r\n\r\nNotifications should be ordered by timestamp descending and ID descending. This is the current behavior in status-go. Unread notifications should not be grouped at the top because the user can use the read/unread toggle button to easily find which notifications require their attention.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior for non-CTA notifications\r\n\r\nNon-CTA notifications should be automatically marked as read if they’re visible on screen, according to the current active tab (which dictates which types of notifications are displayed). If the user is in the special All tab then notifications of any type should be taken in consideration. For example, if the user opens the Activity Center, unread notifications are displayed with blue dots, but once the user switches to a different tab or go to another screen, when they open the Activity Center in the same tab, non-CTA notifications that were unread won’t have the unread blue dot anymore and they’ll be marked as read in the local database.\r\n",

    "body": "Update (2023-01-19): After a new round of reviews about how should notifications be marked as read/unread, designers, PO and devs from mobile/desktop aligned the following:\r\n\r\n- Designers will soon update Figma with the most up-to-date specs so that developers can start the implementation work.\r\n- Developers will try to keep written specs about all things related to the AC, in order to complement the Figma specs.\r\n- All notifications will be marked as read by some user action, i.e. the concept of non-CTA notifications will become meaningless. For example, if the user was mentioned in a group chat, the user should see a unread notification in the AC, and pressing on it should open the chat and scroll to the mention. When the mention is visible on screen, then the notification will be marked as read.\r\n- Notifications should always be displayed chronologically. This is the current status-go behavior, so nothing to do here.\r\n- In both mobile and desktop apps, users should be able to do mass operations to mark notifications as read. This is missing in the new mobile design, but designers are already on top of this.\r\n- Eventually we want the Status app to allow users to mark messages, notifications and all sorts of things as unread as well. So giving the user full control of what's read/unread.\r\n- There's a new proposal to improve how the badge counter of the AC is displayed. Currently it only displays a blue icon or nothing, but this will change to: 1) When new notifications arrive -> blue icon on the bell. 2) When we open AC -> blue icon goes gray, 3) When we have all notifications marked as read - > hide icon.",
