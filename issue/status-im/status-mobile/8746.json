  "body": "# Problem\n\nInfura will soon enforce its new pricing plan. Free plans are allowed 100k requests per day. Retrieving the balance of a single account costs us 6k calls. Infura is also one of our Wall of Shame spots—centralized, third-party—and long term, we should displace it with a light client.\n\nShort term, we probably need to upgrade plans in advance of v1.\n\n## Implementation\n\nBefore we upgrade, let's gather a bit more data around our current Infura usage and investigate whether we can be more efficient about our API calls.\n\nLet's clarify:\n- Is 6k calls per account balance an estimate for one instance, or per account per day?\n- Is this using @yenda's implementation of wallet, post [improvements](https://discuss.status.im/t/wallet-improvement-log/1221)? \n- Can we estimate how many calls are needed in total per day per account, excluding for DApps? Which areas of the app, proportionately, cost us the most? _Roman might have been the person who set us up with Infura initially; not sure we actually have access to a dashboard._\n- What can we do to make the app more efficient in terms of Infura usage? \n\nNotes from janitors call:\n> - 6k can’t be right for one wallet draw. Is it per account per day? We need to investigate this more. I would expect aroudn 50 requests plus or minus for any tx detected.\n> - We could set up multiple Infura API keys and rotate them. We could seriously have one for DApps, and one for Status.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- Answers to the above questions in GH or [this doc](https://notes.status.im/xLZkbUztQQeDUPX_I7qRKg?edit)",
