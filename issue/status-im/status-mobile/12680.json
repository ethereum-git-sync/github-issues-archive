Add profile photo\r\n2. Add UserB to contacts and start 1-1 chat\r\n3. UserB adds UserA to contacts\r\n4. UserA: Settings > Privacy and security > `Show your PP to: None` (or delete UserB from contacts)\r\n5. UserB: check profile photo of UserA\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n- Status version: nightly 4/10\r\n- Operating System: Android, iOS\r\n\r\n\r\n[comment]: # (Please, add logs/notes if necessary)\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "One more example: user also won't see a photo of contacts if ha had restricted and changed settings after until contact will reset profile photo or send message to public chat\r\n\r\n**Steps**\r\n1) User1: has `Show profile photos to` - None, `Show profile photos of` - None\r\n2) User2: has `Show profile photos to` - Contacts, `Show profile photos of` - Contacts, set profile photo\r\n3) User1 adds User2 to contacts, User2 adds User1 to contacts. No photo is shown for User2 as expected.\r\n4) User1: changed settings to `Show profile photos to` - Everyone, `Show profile photos of` - Everyone\r\nIn that  case he will not see updates from User2 until (1) he posts smth in the public chat to which both are joined OR (2) he will change profile photos\r\n\r\n\r\n### To summarize how the feature works now:\r\n\r\n1.  No way to `hide` your profile photo for users, that have already seen it\r\n(but if you set it to `None` and then changed profile photo, no updates will be shown for your contacts)\r\n2. When changing setting `Show profile photos to`, `Show profile photos of` they will work for new users (which you have never interacted with), but for existing users (your contacts, for users that have seen your photo in pub chats / group chats, communities) there are 3 ways to update: \r\n       - (1) post smth to public chat, \r\n       - (2) updating this profile photo, \r\n       - (3) adding user to your contact (if you changed some of settings to `Contact`)\r\n**Until one of these actions no updates will be shown for existing contacts / in 1-1, group chats**\r\n\r\n\r\n@hesterbruikman it looks a bit complicated and I'm not sure how we can explain current limitations to users now and are we OK to release it like this in 1.17.\r\nNeed your opinion here.\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
