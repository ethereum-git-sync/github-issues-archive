  "body": "# Bug Report\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\n\r\nWhen I tap on a channel in iOS that has had a lot of activity since I was last there, the new messages pop-in continuously until I have received the latest message on my device. Sometimes this can take a long time if there was a lot of messages. While this is happening, my view is being dragged downward with the latest messages.\r\n\r\nIf I want to \"catch up\" with the conversation, I need to scroll back up and try to find where the point was where I last read. \r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI expect the new messages to not push my view continually down. I want to stay in the same spot that I was in before and then have the new messages fill in underneath my view. I can then scroll down as I read.\r\n\r\n#### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nAs new messages come in, in rapid succession, my view is continually pushed down. I need to drag up and up quickly in order to stay in the same spot that I was in before. Otherwise I \"drown\" in new messages.\r\n\r\n#### Notes\r\n\r\nThis may be related to a request for a \"jump to latest\" button. I can imagine a scenario in which someone does not care to be caught up to a long conversation but rather just wants to jump to the latest message after all the new messages load.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n?\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\n- Open Status after not checking it for 12-24 hours\r\n- Tap on the main Status channel quickly\r\n- See new messages flow in and push your view down\r\n- Try to figure out where your last read point was in the conversation by scrolling up\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n- Status version: 1.11\r\n- Operating System: iOS\r\n",
