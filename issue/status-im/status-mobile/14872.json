    "body": "@pavloburykh, @qoqobolo. Thanks for reporting this, it's indeed a problem. It seems what's happening here is what @smohamedjavid explained to me:\r\n\r\nThe unread indicator comes from a count in the backend DB that doesn't care about the types of notifications. All the query cares about is that there are unread and accepted notifications. The issue as Javid pointed out, is that not all types of notifications are currently implemented on the frontend, so that's likely why you are seeing the unread indicator appear, but no notification is actually rendered in the AC.\r\n\r\nFor performance reasons and due to other complexities, the count of notifications will always be fetched separately from what's currently visible to the user. So unless we do something about the root cause of this issue, this can and will probably happen again in the future (e.g. if we implement new types of notifications).\r\n\r\n#### Suggested solution\r\n\r\nWe can fix this by allowing the frontend to fetch only the count of notifications for specific types that are implemented to be visible in the AC. This will require a small change in `status-go`. cc @smohamedjavid We could change the status-go endpoint to accept a list of types.",
