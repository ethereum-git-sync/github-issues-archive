  "body": "# Feature Issue\r\n\r\n[comment]: # (Please replace ... with your information. Remove < and >)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAs a user, I believe that Status should not default the receiving Ethereum address to the same address that was used to register one's ENS username. Instead, it should always ask the receiving party which Status account they would like to use to accept the money.\r\n\r\nIf one wishes to send a crypo asset to a Status user, one normally has to request a receiving Ethereum address before such a transfer is possible. The user on the receiving end can **choose** the appropriate Status account for this transaction.\r\n\r\nFor example, one could have two separate Status accounts: one for the ENS username and one for personal transactions. It would be desirable that one could receive money from a family member without said transaction being publicly tied to one's chat identity.\r\n\r\nHowever, the current behavior of the Status application is as follows: if you wish to send someone a crypto asset, the receiving address will default to the Ethereum address that was used to register their ENS username (if they have one) rather than force the sending party to request a receiving Ethereum address.\r\n\r\nThis is not an issue if one does not have an ENS username, as in this case Status will always request which Ethereum address to use. If one so desires, they can compartmentalize their financial transactions into various different Status accounts to achieve a greater degree of privacy.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nOf course, I am not suggesting to hide the Ethereum address associated with the ENS username as doing so would be impossible. However, I wish to provide Status users with the ability to only receive money on accounts that are not associated with their chat username/identity.\r\n\r\nI believe that as a privacy-focused application, it should go without saying that your financial transactions should always be **separate** from your chat identity.",
