  "body": "***Type***: Bug\r\n\r\n***Summary***: In some cases progress bar runs infinitely on chat screens. \r\nCan reproduce, but it just happens from time to time. \r\nIt was noticed with Desktop MacOS app (in my case, but mobile affected as well) after Status was on background for ~10 mins then opened and navigated to any type of chat. The blue bar spinning for infinitely long until app restart or mailserver change. \r\nIn my case it happened when I was:\r\nConnected to mail-01.do-ams3.eth.beta (manually set this mailsever) -> put Status on background -> disable WiFi connection for ~7-10 mins -> enable WiFi -> wait 1 minute more -> open Status \r\n\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\nBlue progress bar disappears after contact connected to mailservers successfully and messages are fetched \r\n#### Actual behavior\r\nBlue progress bar spinning infinitely even contact connected to mailservers successfully and messages are fetched (these two items I confirm by joining to public chat and receiving messages history)\r\n\r\n![inf_blue-bar](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8749671/52948691-ba8bcd00-3382-11e9-8569-5d038cd66c9a.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\n- Open Status and confirm no progress bar is running  \r\n- Manually set connection to particular mailserver (in my case it was mail-01.do-ams3.eth.beta)\r\n- Put Status on background\r\n- Enable airplane mode\r\n- Wait 10 minutes\r\n- Disable airplane mode\r\n- Open Status and pay attention to blue progress bar\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n* Status version: Develop (`Desktop v0.9.0 (1da67672a)`)\r\n* Operating System: iOS, Android, MacOS\r\n\r\n#### Logs\r\n\r\n[Status.log](https://github.com/status-im/status-react/files/2879206/Status123.log)\r\n",
