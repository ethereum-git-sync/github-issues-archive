  "body": "# Feature Issue\r\n\r\nPresently, users encounter unread counters, badges, or notifications from open, non-token gated communities even prior to joining said communities.\r\n\r\n### User Story\r\n\r\nAs a user engaging with communities, I desire an automatic system for managing notifications according to my community membership. This way, I won't receive unread counters, badges, or notifications from open, non-token gated communities until I become a member (join such community).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nYou can find a related discussion [here](https://discord.com/channels/624634427930312714/842696205213368331/1197851976717848587)\r\n\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. **Given** I am not a member of an open non token-gated community,\r\n**When** the community is in Pending or Open status,\r\n**Then** :\r\n- I should not receive any notifications related to that community, including push notifications and notifications in the Activity Center.\r\n- I should not see any unread badges or counters for messages within that community.\r\n- I still should be able to see all the message history in community channels in view-only (spectacular) mode. \r\n\r\n2. **Given**  I become a member of an open non token-gated community,\r\n**When** the community status changes to Joined,\r\n**Then:** \r\n- I should automatically start receiving all notifications related to that community, including push notifications and notifications in the Activity Center\r\n- I should automatically see unread badges or counters for new messages within that community.\r\n",
