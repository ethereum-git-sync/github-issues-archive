  "body": "# Problem\nWe show spinners when sending a message for the purpose of guesstimating its sent status. The spinner persists as long as it wasn't received by a selected mailserver. Problem is, this can be misleading as recipients and other mailservers might already received your message in the meantime. This is followed by the 'Sent' label which in this configuration would have no further purpose.\nIt's better to not draw attention to a message status until it's actually needed and accurate, so we only keep the current 'Not sent' indicator and its behaviour. \n\n## Implementation\n\n\n* [ ] Remove message spinners :lollipop: \n* [ ] Remove 'Sent' confirmation label :heavy_check_mark: \n\n## Acceptance Criteria\nBoth points were addressed and tested.\n\n## Notes\nSeeing as I'm hardly the technical person to describe the finer details, cc @flexsurfer and @cammellos\n\n",
