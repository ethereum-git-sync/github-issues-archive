  "body": "The status-react repository has a lot of cruft. It takes roughly two pages worth of scrolling to even reach the beginning of the README. As part of a renewed effort to make our GitHub account & repos more palatable to newcomers and developers alike, we should make sure we don't leave unnecessary files laying around in our repo, particularly in the root folder.\r\n\r\nAfter a quick observation, I've identified the following:\r\n\r\n- The [VERSION](https://github.com/status-im/status-react/blob/develop/VERSION) file is out of date with the contents being `1.8.0`. However, everything seems to be working just fine in the v1.9 release â€“ which begs the question: do we even need this file? Can we remove it?\r\n- There are six different `.env` files in the root folder of the repository. Can we move this to a shared folder? Or perhaps move five of them to a shared folder while keeping the primary `.env` in the root folder?\r\n- The following files haven't been changed in 2-3 years: `supervisord.conf`, `.dockerignore`, `.buckconfig`, `.babelrc`, `.mailmap`, `.nycrc`, `.watchmanconfig`, `app.json`. Do we still need all of these? If not, let's remove the ones we can.\r\n- Should we even be storing a `.vscode` directory in our repo? This seems like a personal preference thing that varies from developer to developer. IMO, this type of folder should just go in the `.gitignore` and then anyone can add all preferences they like without committing it upstream.\r\n\r\nThe cruft is one problem among many:\r\n- Terribly outdated README\r\n- Broken testing/coverage badges in the README\r\n- Outdated documentation (after a quick look around I found some references to macOS *catalina* workarounds)\r\n- Outdated GitHub profile picture/description\r\n- Swarms are dead, so we should unpin that repository from the `status-im` account\r\n\r\nIdeally, we should get around to resolving all of these to give a better impression to our users & SNT holders. Cleaning the cruft felt like a good place to start.",
