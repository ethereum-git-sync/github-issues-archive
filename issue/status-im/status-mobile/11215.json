  "body": "# Feature Issue\n\nIn the Wallet History screen, add a button that lets a user cancel a pending transaction.  This feature should be implemented at the same time as related feature #11214 \n\n### User Story\n\nAs a user, I want to be able to cancel a pending transaction, so that A) if I've spotted an error with the transaction before it's included in a block I can cancel it and B) if the transaction is stuck and I want to cancel it instead of increasing it's gas.\n\n### Description\n\nSee design below.  Note that this screen is from the forthcoming wallet design refresh, the only UI change required by this issue is the addition of the 'Cancel' button underneath the pending transaction list item.  Requires #11214 to be implemented first, as this issue adds a 'pending' state to transactions in the history screen.\n\n![cancel transaction](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22846356/94023678-6773ca80-fdae-11ea-822d-c0ef15dfbd92.png)\n\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n\nTest case\n1. After making a token transfer from their wallet, the user is redirected to the History screen\n2. On the History screen the user can see that their transaction is pending because the list item representing the transaction has a 'pending' icon (as opposed to the 'sent' and 'received' arrow icons).\n3. User taps the 'Cancel' button.\n4. The transaction is canceled and the list item representing this transaction is removed from the list of transactions in the history screen.\n\n### Notes\n\n- This requires signing a transaction without using the user password, if that's not feasible at the moment for technical reason (i.e we don't store the user key in memory), having a sign dialog is fine, though not desirable. UPDATE: Judging by the code, the key is not stored in memory at any point https://github.com/status-im/status-go/blob/200273aa0ead9eef16bb5054d60a9edf73192f98/account/accounts.go#L120 , but whoever picks up this task please make sure that is the case.\n- For anyone picking this up, leave a comment on whether you feel you can do the keycard work as well, otherwise we'll have it out of scope.",

    "body": "This is a prerequisite for #11214, as if the transaction is sent already, only way \"canceling\" or \"editing\" it is to sent another one with higher Gas (which also means the user looses Gas when canceling the transaction). \r\n\r\nRe: skip the password prompt; we could cache the signing key for some time, which is required to edit a transaction that was already _sent_. @hesterbruikman suggested to schedule transactions, which I think is more reliable than sending competing transactions. Security wise, we could get away here with asking the user to enter the password, right before the transaction is finally and definitely sent. @cammellos  what is the status when a transaction is pending? Is it in the mempool of the app or infura node?\r\n\r\nThe core point however is if we want to cache the signing key in memory. I'd say no, especially not by default. But we could ask the user if they want to, but we have a sane default here. If something, I would go for a local scheduling queue where the user drafts a transaction and signs it right before it is sent. We can always weaken the security model later on.",

    "body": "> @hesterbruikman suggested to schedule transactions, which I think is more reliable than sending competing transactions. \r\n\r\nI am not quite sure that's a feasible option I believe once you sign a transaction it will be immediately broadcasted to the transaction pool, and only by sending a competing transaction you can cancel it. (We could discuss scheduling transactions but that's a different feature).\r\n\r\nJudging by the code, the key is not stored in memory at any point https://github.com/status-im/status-go/blob/200273aa0ead9eef16bb5054d60a9edf73192f98/account/accounts.go#L120 , but whoever picks up this task please make sure that is the case.\r\n\r\nSo first cut we will have to show the password prompt to the user.\r\nAs discussed with @johnlea-quiup this is not desirable UX, but we can go with this implementation for now and defer the decision to later on whether we want/how to improve this.",

Keycard is a bit more hassle, but tapping a card and entering a pin is still less friction than entering a strong (hopefully long and random) password.  This won't help users of phones without a biometric authentication mechanism, but Android phones started getting biometric authentication in 2011 and these days $150 USD phones include biometric authentication (see Moto E) so phones with biometric authentication should cover most folks even in developing countries soon.
