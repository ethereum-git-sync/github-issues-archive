That’s fine too\n3) then restart application\n4) Now `status-lib` starts listening to all topics again, and we receive the same `:new-group-chat` again\n5) And we create that chat again. That’s our problem.\n\nWe can keep chat in the db with some flag like `removed`. But the question here is how to handle the situation when the user really wants to be added to that chat again. As an option, we could check timestamp of the new “invitation” message, and if that message was sent after removing we could \"create\" chat again by changing that `removed` flag.\n",
