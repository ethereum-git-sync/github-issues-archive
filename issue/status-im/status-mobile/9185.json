  "body": "# Problem\n\nAs a user of the mobile app, I want message fetching to be very fast, so that I can quickly use Status to talk with people and don't get frustrated with a slow loading dialogue.\n\n**This is one of the first things a user notices, and empirically I see a lot of people frustrated by it**. It is related to the bandwidth issue (https://github.com/status-im/status-react/issues/9081) but is somewhat different, and a solution might only have partial overlap.\n\n## Details\n\n```\nApp version: 0.13.1 (2019080817)\nOS: ios\nNode version: v.0.25.0-beta.0\nMailserver: mail-03.gc-us-central1-a.eth.beta\n```\n\n```\nDevice: iPhone 10\nNetwork: 4G, 66 Mbps down, 27 Mbps up, latency 81ms unloaded 153ms unloaded, client in Fangyuan, TW (via Osaka, JP) (Results with Fast.com)\n\nTime since last checking Status: ~24h\nChannels: Public ~60, Private ~40\nChannels with +9 messages (~10-1000 on average? guessing): ~10\n```\n\nUsing Status mobile client I notice it takes ~29 seconds from foregrounding app for messages to stop appearing / loading to stop. The green \"connected\" appears after 7s, so **that's ~20s for the UI to come to a resting state**. Compared with Telegram, where it feels almost instantaneous (at least to get message counts), and if I go into a chat with 1000+ messages and go to the bottom it loads in ~2s (including images). See https://www.nngroup.com/articles/response-times-3-important-limits/\n\n## Implementation\n\n0. Replicate by hand and give possibly more controlled estimate\n\n1. Replicate this with v1 and through command line, i.e. by getting time to get to the equivalent rest state in UI but for e.g. mailservers\n\n2. Understand bottleneck and what design would be required to resolve the situation\n  - Understand to what extent this is BW bound, vs connection/latency issue\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\nSee above, as a user I definitely want it to be finished in <10s, and ideally on the order of 1-3s for UI to rest (see TG).\n\n## Notes\n\nSpecs:\n- https://github.com/status-im/specs/blob/master/status-whisper-usage-spec.md\n- https://github.com/status-im/specs/blob/master/status-whisper-mailserver-spec.md\n\nMailserver spec:\n- https://discuss.status.im/t/performance-of-mailservers/1215\n\nBandwidth related issue:\n- https://github.com/status-im/status-react/issues/9081\n\n## Future Steps\n\n-",

    "body": "@oskarth I think this should be replicated in the console client before becoming a status-react issue wdyt? At this point status-react has little to do with the efficiency of receiving historical messages. Moving filters and mailserver logic might help a tiny bit, but I suspect that most of the time is spent receiving 24h of messages matching your bloom filter. With smaller accounts it is much faster.",
