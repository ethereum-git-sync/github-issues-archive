  "body": "Currently, upgrade tests are fragile and each test is complex and contains a lot of checks.\r\nWould be nice to use a group approach to have separate checks for each test for better readability.\r\n\r\nAlso as this is a plan to remove support for public chat, better to replace initial data in tests from public chats to the community with the same data (possible to create one community with different channels, each channel for a different case)\r\nIt should increase the stability of this test.\r\n\r\nSo current test:\r\n- `test_unread_previews_public_chat_version_upgrade` better to split into separate tests:\r\n1) test_home_unread_indicator - check that unread indicator is preserved for different types of chats after upgrade\r\n2) test_profile_app_version_upgraded - check that version is upgraded in profile\r\n3) test_profile_contacts - check contacts are preserved (with ENS name, with nickname)\r\n4) test_profile_blocked - check blocked users are still there after upgrade\r\n5) test_one_to_one_chat_add_to_contact_indicator - check that user that is not added in contact, still has \"Add to contacts\" in 1-1 chat\r\n6)test_community_chat_images  - check that can see sent images in the community channel \r\n7) test_community_chat_markdown - check that can see sent messages with markdown in the community channel \r\n8) test_community_chat_reaction  - check that can see sent messages with reaction in the community channel \r\n9) test_community_chat_sticker -  check that can see sent stickers in the community channel \r\n10) test_community_chat_tag -  check that can see tag messages in the community channel \r\n11) test_community_pinned_message -  check that can see pinned messages in the community channel \r\n12) test_community_mention -  check that can see mentions in the community channel  and tap on them\r\n13) test_community_reply - check that can see replies in the community channel \r\n14)  test_community_audio - check that can see audio messages in the community channel \r\n\r\nIn order to do this:\r\n- this data should be generated manually (I use `views/dbs/chats` for storing template)\r\n- export.db replaced with new one\r\n- views/dbs/chats/data.py should be changed accordingly \r\n- new tests are written :) \r\n\r\nDoc how to eport/import db is here: https://notes.status.im/yJMuhPAGT5inXa9Zb4vMZw",
