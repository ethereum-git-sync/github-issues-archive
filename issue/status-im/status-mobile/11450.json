    "body": "Looking at TTL.\r\nEssentially the flow for sending messages is not really a good flow for bandwidth/cpu constrained devices.\r\n\r\nHow it works is:\r\n\r\n1) The message TTL/POW is calculated.\r\n2) The message is added to the pool of messages to be sent\r\n3) At interval of 300 ms messages are broadcasted to each peer concurrently, batched together\r\n\r\nThis is problematic for a few reasons:\r\n\r\n- Between 1 & 3 a lot of time be passed, especially if the PoW calculation was expensive, during that time the TTL clock is ticking\r\n- 3 is problematic because if you are on slow upload networks (home networks for example), and you try to upload messages concurrently, you end up with none of the messages making it in time to the other end.\r\n- Another issue is that messages generated on the device are mixed with messages received by the device. A priority queue that prioritizes messages based on the author should help.\r\n\r\nI have changed the code so that:\r\n1) Messages are not uploaded concurrently to all peers\r\n2) POW calculation is not done if messages are currently being uploaded (we want to really run the POW just in time)\r\n\r\nThat seems to have helped ( I am now able to send 3 images from my home network to my mobile device), though is not the best solution as it's not a solid solution, as it would require more code changes.\r\n\r\nThe way I would normally handle this is:\r\n\r\n1) Have a priority queue with messages ordered by Author->TTL\r\n2) Don't calculate TTL until you are ready to send to the first peer\r\n3) Don't send to multiple peers concurrently \r\n\r\nThis only makes sense for \"light\" nodes or nodes that are running from a home network etc, cluster nodes don't have this issues as 1) They don't calculate pow 2) They have good upload speeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
