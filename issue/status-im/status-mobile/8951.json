    "body": "@yenda, I've reproduced scenario and have a question about trying to solve.  You said above a \"bad fix\" would be to have status-react ask for balance once online connectivity is established.  In looking at re-frisk when in this scenario, it looks like the :error-unable-to-fetch-balance error is just never cleared from the wallet subscriptions, even though we're clearly connected (seeing new block events continuously).  As far as I can tell, the only place that error is ever cleared is in the \"update-balances\" function in wallet/core and is supposed to be triggered whenever network-status changes.  I need to do some more digging on the subscriptions around network-status and offline? but that seems like the likely culprit, in that somehow offline status isn't getting properly set.  Does that feel like a more likely route than something with status-go not correctly signaling new transactions that have an impact on balance?",

    "body": "@rachelhamlin @yenda I'm stuck on this one and wondering if I should pass it off to someone else.  As best I can tell, the issue lies mainly with the fact that the listener set to detect network changes under the net-info module is never firing off any events, and therefore is never updating the network-status subscription, which in turn means the update balances/prices events are never firing when you switch from offline to online.  I only see the `:status-im.network.net-info/network-info-changed` event firing on app start-up and not when I actually force a network change (i.e. go to airplane mode and then back on).  \r\nAny idea if this sounds like the right track?  I'm at a loss on next steps.  ",

It doesn't fix scenario 1 since the `:get-balances` effect is only called in 3 scenarios\r\n1) When the wallet is initialized by the `initialize-wallet` effect - this is what causes the first issue, since the device isn't connected so it can't retrieve the balance\r\n2) When status-go detects a new transfer, this is resolved by the bug fix noted above.\r\n3) When the `safe-account` effect is triggered, and this looks like it only happens when you generate/restore an account from a seedphrase or keycard so same out come as 1) above.\r\n\r\nI know you said it was a \"bad\" solution to have status-react call update-balance again but that seems like it's the only way to solve @churik's first issue given the above.  Any preference on how to solve for that?  Seems like we could add a subscription to the wallet screens (portfolio and account views) that call get-prices only if network-status == :online and there's a balance-update error set.  This solution is based on the assumption that the balance-update error mostly or always stems from a root cause of network connectivity issues.  Either that, or we could add a new error condition that is set if the update-balance fails while network-status is :offline and base the subscription purely on that.\r\n",

Since there aren't any transactions on the account that @churik described there, seems like it could be the same root issue where it's not updating the balance of the given account (maybe because there's a `:balance-update` error on the account).  I'll dig through `status-im.ethereum.core` and see if there's something I missed in my earlier review.",

That's why the account balance isn't updating since status-go only calls update-balances when it sees new transfers.  It's more or less a variation on Scenario 1 where the app starts in off-line status when you login and then there's no trigger for update-balances.  \r\nSo we resolved only the scenario where an account is offline when a new transfer is sent.  I think my general proposal (i.e. call update-balances if network-status goes from offline to online and we have an balance-update error) will still work.  All that to say, I think status-go is working fine with regard to this particular issue.  I'm going to work on where it makes sense to call update-balance again (thinking most likely from the portfolio view code) but still figuring out how to layer it in.",
