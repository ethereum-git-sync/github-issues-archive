  "body": "I've been working on Face ID/Touch ID/Fingerprint sign-in options in settings and ran into a few problems:\n\n1. Is it really \"SIgn-in\"? I mean, obviously you can not sign in on another device using your fingerprint, which means we are not offering you a \"fingerprint sign-in\". Most apps call this \"app lock\" which is something on top of sign-in/sign-out.\n\n2. \"Save password\" option. If the user has this turned on, there's no reason to enable biometric sign-in at all. Although this is true only if we assume that the goal of  \"biometric sign-in\" is to speed up the sign-in process, make it smooth. Because what can be smoother than not asking for anything at all?\n\nIn general, I have a feeling that we have not thought this through and it requires more discussion and research. What is the problem we're solving here? I understand that this feature is in high demand by our community, but maybe they are asking for something else actually? What if some of them want an \"app lock\" – a way to prevent strangers from opening the app when they got their phone. And others want transaction signing with a fingerprint. And others just did not notice that \"Save password\" option (or use an old Android build) and are just annoyed by entering the password each time they run the app? \n\nIf it was up to me, I'd suggest postponing this feature to have some more time for proper research.\n\nBut, anyway, to make it work now as a really simple app-lock, we can do this:\n\n**Settings**\n\"App lock with Face ID\" option in \"Privacy and security\". \n\n<img width=\"364\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-09-11 at 12 36 11\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3115606/64686089-c363fd80-d490-11e9-8009-ebd3adebc930.png\">\n\n**Save password feature**\nIf the user does not have the \"save password\" box checked they get asked for the password each time they run the app. If the  goal of \"biometric sign-in\" aka “app-lock” is making it easy yet secure to sign-in, it basically means that \"biometric sign-in\" is a security level ontop of \"save password\". (for those who choose that it’s better for them to instead of being asked for nothing, to be asked for biometric data to run the app) This means that to enable \"biometric sign-in\" the user should first check the \"save password\" box on the sign-in screen.\n\nSo if the user tries to turn the \"App-lock with Face ID\" toggle on, they will get this popup:\n\n<img width=\"1448\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-09-11 at 12 40 42\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3115606/64686462-6288f500-d491-11e9-8e91-2aa9a0ec43e8.png\">\n\nIf the \"save password\" box is checked, it just going to turn the app-lock on and inform that everything is okay. It's important to mention here when are we going to check for the face id/fingerprint (each time the user runs the app) since we don't have an option for the user to control that yet like some other apps do.\n\n<img width=\"1430\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-09-11 at 12 42 26\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3115606/64686701-beec1480-d491-11e9-9343-d98d67ecc8df.png\">\n\n**Sign-in screen**\nIf the app-lock is enabled, it checks for the biometric data on the sign-in screen. If the face/fingerprint is not recognized, the native \"Face not recognized\" alert is shown. But we still need to provide a re-try option for the users, this is why there's a face id/fingerprint icon in the password field for those who have the app-lock enabled.\n\n<img width=\"1610\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-09-11 at 12 48 04\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3115606/64687141-96184f00-d492-11e9-8631-d1dd0b0921a6.png\">\n\n**Save password again**\nIf the user has the app-lock enabled but tries to un-check the save password box, we need to tell them that by doing that, they disable the app lock.\n\n<img width=\"423\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-09-11 at 12 53 47\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3115606/64687461-37070a00-d493-11e9-9364-55027daae489.png\">\n\n**Onboarding screens**\nI’d remove the whole thing from onboarding since it has almost nothing to do with sign-in/sign-up. Biometric app-lock is a feature for those who don't want to **enter the password every time** but want an **extra layer of security on top of saving the password**.\nAlso, we want the user to first check the \"save password\" box to keep things consistent.\n\n> Note: Copy on all these screens may need some more work/discussion. Also, I'm not sure that \"App-lock\" is the best way to call this feature, I just think that \"sign in with Face/Touch ID” is wrong",

    "body": "Here's what I recall of the situation:\r\n\r\n**Problem:** Users want faster log-in. They like using biometrics in other apps. Also, typing your password in public is something of a security risk.\r\n\r\n`Save password` was implemented because it was a less costly means of attacking the same problem.\r\n\r\nThe first instance of biometrics being implemented in Status was within [this PR](https://github.com/status-im/status-react/pull/8127), and you're absolutely right, @andmironov, [this](https://github.com/status-im/status-react/issues/6573) was the only spec:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTo the bounty hunter:\r\n\r\n(1) Add a setting to require touch/face-id to sign-in (just like \"Browser privacy mode\")\r\n(2) Implement biometric protection to the saved password entry for iOS and for Android (you might use a 3rd party library for that).\r\n(3) This should be disabled by default.\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I'm glad we're having this discussion now. :) \r\n\r\nHere's how I envision it working:\r\n\r\n**Access points**\r\n- Option to use biometric login is presented during onboarding \r\n- ALT: @andmironov I like your suggestion for it NOT to be included in onboarding, though. Could the user authenticate it for the first time from the icons on the login screen?\r\n- It can also be toggled on or off from the profile\r\n\r\n**Happy path logic**\r\n- If biometric is enabled at any point, `Save password` is also enabled \r\n- When the user opens Status, it will check their face or fingerprint* and they will be logged in\r\n- If biometric is _not_ enabled, the user can still opt to `Save password` and that will work as usual\r\n\r\n*I am unclear about how this is chosen—does user get option to verify both face ID and fingerprint when toggling biometrics on? Is it device specific? The apps I use only check face ID.\r\n\r\n**Error logic**\r\n- Native error, user then has option to enter password or trigger the biometric again, as per the designs above\r\n\r\n@andmironov our happy path logic conflicts. I would not have `Save password` trigger biometric. But I would have biometric enable `Save password`. I think it's different, and that `Save password` should remain its own option (again based on my banking app). It also seems less complicated to develop this logic. WDYT?",

Everyone else has an \"app-lock\" which works independently from sign-in/sign-up. Although many other apps have \"biometric will work when you will use the app next time\" which is close to our situation. Except that to make it work we require an extra step from the user which ONLY the user is able to perform.\r\n\r\nSo in order to be honest and not cut any corners, I think it's better to ask to reopen the app and save the password since that is the only way to make the biometric work.\r\n\r\nI like it (and just to be clear, I 100% understand the weirdness of it) because it seems to be a more consistent and secure flow. \r\n\r\nIf we do it the way you suggest (logging-off the user automatically) the user will end up on the `sign in` screen with no indication of the fact that it's a step in \"enabling the biometric\" flow. \r\n\r\n\r\n",

Approach. Manual**\r\n-  I go to Settings;\r\n- Toggle the biometric thing;\r\n- I am asked to re-open the app, enter my password and turn the \"save password\" option on and come back. Because \"this is the way it works\";\r\n- I re-open the app, do the stuff;\r\n- I come back to settings and turn it on;\r\n\r\n**2. Approach**\r\n-  I go to Settings;\r\n- Toggle the biometric thing;\r\n- I am warned that I'm about to be logged off to enter my password and turn the \"save password\" option on and come back;\r\n- I'm logged off, I do the stuff;\r\n- _I still have to manually come back to settings and turn on biometric_\r\n\r\nWhat bothers me is that it's still a manual flow and we are automating just one step (logging off) and I would expect as a user to be guided after it which is not going to happen. So I'd prefer to stay in \"full manual mode\" but be consistent. I know that might make no sense :-)\r\n",
