In such case we should show something that indicates to the user that messages are not going to be sent. \r\n\r\nWe need input from @status-im/design-team on that as I haven't found related designs in Figma. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n- Status version: nightly \r\n- Operating System: Android, iOS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
