  "body": "I use Messenger apps many times/day. I love what your're doing on Ethereum. However,\r\n\r\nAs a user, I want to move Status.im to my 256GB storage card on my new s8+ so I can preserve as much internal storage space as possible for the future. Recently, I upgraded my phone from an s5 because it only had 16GB of internal storage.  I ran Status on that old phone and it did not perform well.  Internal storage was mostly full.  Most users already know that the internal storage on their 2 year old phone is filling up quickly.  Therefore users ought to have the ability to move Status.im to the SD card\r\n\r\nPlease give users the ability to move the app to the SD card.  I hope this is not in conflict with the egregious # of permissions required when previously the app was stored on external storage.",
