  "body": "### User Story\n\nAs a developer/user, I'd like to know which bootnodes are currently defined and used by the app and I'd like to specify my own bootnodes.\n\n### Description\n\n*Type*: Feature/Bug\n\n[comment]: # (Describe the feature you would like, or briefly summarise the bug and what you did, what you expected to happen, and what actually happens. Sections below)\n*Summary*: The current \"Bootnodes settings\" screen is useless because it does not give any information which bootnodes are used and adding a new bootnode does not suggest if it is used at all.\n\n#### Expected behavior\nWhen I open \"Bootnodes settings\" screen, I'd like to see the summary of enodes currently used as bootnodes. Also, if I add my own bootnodes, I'd like to see them in the summary as well. It should be possible to override default bootnodes completely as well.\n\n#### Actual behavior\nCurrently, I don't know which bootnodes are used. I can add my own bootnode but there is no confirmation if it's used.\n\n### Reproduction\n[comment]: # (Describe how we can replicate the bug step by step.)\n\n- Open Status\n- Go to Profile > Bootnodes\n- Add a custom bootnode\n\n### Solution\n[comment]: # (Please summarise the solution and provide a task list on what needs to be fixed.)\n*Summary*: \n- \"Bottnodes settings\" displays the current list of bootnodes from the config,\n- When I add a custom bootnode, I'd like to see a confirmation that it's being used,\n- I should be able to not only add a new bootnode but override existing ones (this is needed for people who don't want to advertise their nodes in the network because they use a private one for example).\n\n### Additional Information\n[comment]: # (Please do your best to fill this out.)\n* Status version: 0.9.29\n* Operating System: Android and iOS",
