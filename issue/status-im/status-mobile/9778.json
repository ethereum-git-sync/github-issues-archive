  "body": "# Problem\r\n\r\nStatus introduces a lot of new and unfamiliar terminology. \r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\nCreate a basic `Glossary` page under the Profile `Need help?` section.\r\n\r\n- `Frequently asked questions`\r\n- `Glossary`\r\n- `Submit a bug`\r\n- `Request a feature`\r\n\r\n## Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\nImplement a static text page with the following copy: \r\n\r\n**Account** - Your Status account, accessed by the seed phrase that you create or import during onboarding. A Status account can hold more than one Ethereum address, in addition to the one created during onboarding. We refer to these as additional accounts within the wallet.\r\n**Seed Phrase** - A set of friendly-to-read words, randomly selected from the BIP39 standard list and used to recover or access your Ethereum account on other wallets and devices. Also referred to as a “mnemonic phrase,” “recovery phrase” or “wallet backup” across the crypto ecosystem. Most crypto apps use this same standard to generate accounts.\r\n**Chat Key** - Messages on the Status chat protocol are sent and received using encryption keys. The public chat key is a string of characters you share with others so they can send you messages in Status.\r\n**Chat Name** - Three random words, derived algorithmically from your chat key and used as your default alias in chat. Chat names are completely unique; no other user can have the same three words.\r\n**ENS Name** - Custom alias for your chat key that you can register using the Ethereum Name Service. ENS names are decentralized usernames. \r\n**Wallet Key** - A 64 character hex address based on the Ethereum standard and beginning with 0x. Public-facing, your wallet key is shared with others when you want to receive funds. Also referred to as an “Ethereum address” or “wallet address.”\r\n**Peer** - A device connected to the Status chat network. Each user can represent one or more peers, depending on their number of devices.\r\n**Mailserver** - A node in the Status network that routes and stores messages, for up to 30 days.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\nFormatting is up to you. We don't have any precedence for a page like this. I'd probably suggest words are bolded, and that we use slightly higher paragraph spacing than normal to separate the entries. cc @errorists ",
