  "body": "`Part of #9264 keycard sign-in epic (mark as checked there, when closing this issue)`\r\n\r\nAfter 3 wrong passcode entry attempts, the key the user is trying to access should become \"Frozen\" which means that the user can no longer access it just with their passcode. To access a frozen key the user has to use either the pairing and PUK codes or the seed phrase.\r\n\r\nWhen the key is \"Frozen\" it is still listed in \"Your keys\" list but is grayed out.\r\nThe num pad is disabled. There's a \"Key frozen. Help\" Error on top of the num pad. \"Help\" opens a popup with a text which explains the situation. Here's the current version of it, it might change later:\r\n\r\n`If you forgot your passcode, you can access your key using your pairing and PUK codes or your seed phrase. If you’ve lost all of those, unfortunately, there’s no other way to access your key again`\r\n\r\nImage:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1271\" alt=\"fr3\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3115606/67836973-f0479f00-fb28-11e9-907d-ccaf6f2aad84.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\nFigma:\r\nhttps://www.figma.com/file/dEIljL7UPbXgsZUA0Q4qlE5E/Onboarding?node-id=4566%3A12\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Bonus** (Also mentioned in https://github.com/status-im/status-react/issues/9285)\r\nIt would be even cooler and a much better experience for the user if we add a more verbose warning when there's only one attempt left, with \"Help\" link in it to open a popup explaining what a \"Frozen key\" is. This could be the next iteration of this issue.\r\n\r\nImage:\r\n<img width=\"425\" alt=\"last-attempt\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3115606/67837499-26395300-fb2a-11e9-8243-948f942b9930.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n",
