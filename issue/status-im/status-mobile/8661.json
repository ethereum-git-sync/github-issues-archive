  "body": "Collection of issues found on WIP desktop-mobile #8630.\n\n```\nWindows 10\n15.6”\n1920x1080 (16:9)\n```\n\n* [ ] 1. When opening a new public channel via [+]-button, it's not added to left pane.\n* [ ] 2. Left pane content might need some scaling down, most channel names become unreadible and all start with Status\n* [ ] 3. Bottom nav icons might need some scaling up. They are tiny on desktop\n* [x] 4. [Select a chat to start messaging] should be grey (#939BA1) as it is a hint text, blue is reserved for buttons/links\n* [x] 5. Repositioning the cursor on the text entry box in chat is not responsive\n* [ ] 6. I thought on desktop UI the bttom nav was intended to be positioned at the bottom of the left pane. Spreading accross the whole bottom only on tablet sizes. @errorists can you confirm?\n* [ ] 7. [+]-button menu should come up as an overlay or have some shadow at the top\n* [ ] 8. Notifications probably needs to trigger an OS settings menu\n* [ ] 9. The icons on the Settings list items (i.e. [>] and [switch] are too far on the right. Especially in [Devices] the switch gets cut off.\n\n",

This is super weird.\r\n- [ ] When I choose to edit my profile pic / username, there's no visible indication on what's possible to edit.\r\n- [ ] '+' button's bottom sheet, there's an unnecessary large margin at the bottom\r\n- [ ] Bottom sheets, the translucent overlay placed below the sheet covering the screen is not visible. Ideally we should use popups like in the design, but if we decide to reuse the same bottom sheet component we should at least make it behave correctly.\r\n- [ ] Start new chat view, input field is missing its horizontal padding\r\n- [ ] the Knight Rider loading indicator we use, the one in the left pane navigation bar, it stutters and drops frames like crazy on an iMac Pro, I think it's safe to say it shouldn't be the case :(\r\n- [ ] an extension of the above, the overall UI performance feels super laggy.",
