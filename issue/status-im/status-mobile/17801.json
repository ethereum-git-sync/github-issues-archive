So it can be considered as test blocker. \r\n\r\nSometimes this bug is also reproducible manually.\r\n\r\n**Steps:** \r\n\r\n1. User A creates community which does not require admin manual approval. Use PR build to create community from mobile. \r\n2. User A sends community invite to User B\r\n3. User B sends Request to join the community\r\n4. Wait until community status is changed to Joined for User B\r\n5. User B opens community channel\r\n6. See if channel is fetched\r\n\r\n\r\n**Actual result:** sometimes channel is not fetched\r\n\r\n[logs (11).zip](https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/files/13068070/logs.11.zip)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/assets/97245802/162146e5-2e12-4589-ae82-7f0e1dc9a318\r\n\r\n**Expected result:** channel is fetched\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n- Status version: nightly \r\n- Operating System: Android, iOS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
