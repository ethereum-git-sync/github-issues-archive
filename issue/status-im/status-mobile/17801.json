Do you have any suggestions on how I might increase the likelihood of observing this issue?\r\n\r\nHey @mohsen-ghafouri! Thank you for looking at the issue. It is really hard to reproduce. \r\n\r\nBTW, are you creating community from mobile? As for now we have faced this issue in the flow when we are creating community from mobile PR builds (not from Desktop). Try to follow the steps below (though they do not guarantee reproduction) \r\n\r\n**Steps:** \r\n\r\n1. Create new mobile users A and B. \r\n2. Create 'open community' by User B\r\n3. User B shares community to User A \r\n4. Stay online by User B admin node\r\n5. User A opens shared community card from 1-1 chat\r\n6. User A sends community join request\r\n7. Wait until community status is changed to Joined for User A. \r\n8. User A opens community channel \r\n9. See if channel is fetched. \r\n\r\n**Actual result:** sometimes channel is not fetched after joining the community. But indeed, this issue is kind a random. It is hard to reproduce. ",

Could be because there are no messages.\r\n\r\nHowever from what I see when this re-frame event is dispatched `:chat.ui/load-more-messages-for-current-chat` \r\nThe UI updates and resolves the loading screen to an empty chat view.. This is what should have happened when the user visits the channel the first time as well.\r\n\r\nThis only happens when we log out and log back in and then open the community channel.\r\n\r\nThis event is dispatched inside `list-on-end-reached` here : https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/blob/develop/src/status_im2/contexts/chat/messages/list/view.cljs#L71-L84\r\n\r\nWhich passes a callback to update a few shared values in re-animated, I wonder if modifying this code will solve this issue.\r\n\r\n",
