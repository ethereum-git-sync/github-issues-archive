  "body": "# Feature Issue\r\n\r\nIssue #11136 introduced a warning for users to prevent funds being lost via the funds accidentally being sent to a smart contract, and issue #11209 updates the design of this warning.  However there are some smart contracts that a user can directly send funds to, the most common of these being smart contract wallets.  This issue introduces a whitelist of known smart contract wallets, so that users sending tokens to these addresses do not see the 'don't send funds to a smart contract' warning.\r\n\r\n### User Story\r\n\r\nAs a user, I want to send funds directly from by Status wallet to a GnosisSafe, MultiSigWallet or other smart contract based walled, without seeing a warning every time. \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nSee user story above.  Known smart contracts that are safe for the user to directly send funds to should be whitelisted so user's sending funds to these wallets don't see the 'don't send funds to a smart contract' warning ( issue #11136 ).\r\n\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\nUsers sending funds directly from their wallet to whitelisted smart contract wallets shouldn't see the 'don't send funds to a smart contract' warning.\r\n\r\nUsers sending funds to any smart contract address that is not on the whitelist should continue to see the 'don't send funds to a smart contract' warning.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nThis is a follow on to issue #11136\r\n\r\nThis should be tackled at the same time as issue #11209 \r\n",
