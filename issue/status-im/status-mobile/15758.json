    "body": "So the problem is actually from the keyboard height. \r\n\r\nKeyboard height before upgrade: `267`\r\nKeyboard-height after upgrade: `294`\r\n\r\nThe difference between these 2 values is `27` which is exactly the status-bar height on that device, which made me think it's an issue with window-height and status bar height. Not sure if it is somehow related to the status bar height or just a coincidence.",
