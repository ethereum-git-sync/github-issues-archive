Sections below)\r\n*Summary*: In discover, popular hashtags section shows most popular hashtags. So, card with hashtag \"X\" is shown first in the row if X is mentioned in more statuses than any other one. Next card is shown for the less amount of mentions in the statuses and so on. After user adds 9th hashtag - the sorting goes wrong, so cards are no longer sorted by the most number of mentions. \r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n[comment]: # (Describe what you expected to happen.)\r\n\r\n#### Actual behavior\r\n[comment]: # (Describe what actually happened.)\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n[comment]: # (Describe how we can replicate the bug step by step.)\r\nstart from 02:35 to see the wrong behaviour: https://app.testfairy.com/projects/4803590-status/builds/7225894/sessions/6/?accessToken=sTyPEDjlv/zNCg9ipmnbrlfiojU\r\n\r\nit also happens with 2 devices:\r\nAndroid (one that looks at hashtags): https://app.testfairy.com/projects/4803622-status/builds/7225736/sessions/4/?accessToken=CjdbVOFYINkC1FcUE4wHPs2N5qc\r\niOs (one that changes hashtags): https://app.testfairy.com/projects/4803590-status/builds/7225894/sessions/8/?accessToken=bnPq2NeZqJTsoX4sr39A7cHoEgQ\r\n\r\n- on device 1 add another device 2 as a contact, on device 2 add device 1 as a contact (in new 1-1 chat tap on Add a contact)\r\n- open Discover tab on device 2\r\n- all changes below do on device 1 and check how cards are shown in Discover under Popular hashtags on device 2\r\n- Open profile\r\n- Remove default status\r\n- type #1 and tap on username -> on device 2 check that Discover shows card with #1 as hashtag in top left corner of the card and (1) as count of statuses in top right corner of the card\r\n- type #2, so as result there is `#1 #2` in status and tap on username -> on device 2 check that Discover shows card with `#1 and (2) as count` and `#2 and (1) as count of statuses\r\n- add to status #3  and tap on username  -> `#1 #2 #3` and check how cards are displayed\r\n- add to status #4  and tap on username  -> `#1 #2 #3 #4` and check how cards are displayed\r\n- add to status #5 and tap on username  -> `#1 #2 #3 #4 #5` and check how cards are displayed\r\n- add to status #6 and tap on username  -> `#1 #2 #3 #4 #5 #6` and check how cards are displayed. On the first place in the row of card there is #1 with 6 mentions, than #2 with 5 mentions and so on to #6 with 1 mention\r\n- delete the statuses, type #7 and tap on username, so the status string is just `#7` - check that card is displayed at the very end with 1 mention\r\n- delete #7, type #8 and tap on username - check that card is displayed at the very end with 1 mention\r\n- now is the place where bug happen, so you might want to check how all 8 cards are displayed and that order is correct: #1 has 6 mentions, #2 has 5... Also pay attention to the content of the cards\r\n- delete #8, type #9 and tap on username - check the order of the cards and their content now\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n[comment]: # (Please do your best to fill this out.)\r\n* Status version: nightly build 96.
