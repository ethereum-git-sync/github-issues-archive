  "body": "_Acceptance criteria added 31/10/19. Issue ready for pick-up._ [RH]\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\nStatus suggests a list of featured(selected) public chats as below. It will be the first screen for newcomers who want to hang out with existing Status communities.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41753422/86476995-8bf97100-bd82-11ea-8bb5-9b5ff72eb066.jpeg\" height=\"400px\" alt=\"publc_chats\">\r\n\r\n### Problem\r\n\r\n1. Some languages with a number of speakers (e.g. French, German, Portuguese) don't have their own community channels on the suggested list.\r\n\r\n2. The list of featured public chats are not categorized and localized. \r\n\r\n3. Some popular topics such as sports, business, politics, or travel could be easier for the general public to engage in the communities but the featured topics don't include them.\r\n\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\nFor v1, update the hardcoded chat list: \r\n\r\n- #introductions\r\n- #chitchat\r\n- #status\r\n- #status-[device language if applicable]\r\n- #crypto \r\n- #tech\r\n- #music\r\n- #movies\r\n- #support\r\n\r\nDisplay an alternate #status-language channel only if the user has a device language set to Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Spanish, or Farsi. \r\n\r\n### Future Suggestions\r\n\r\nThe list of featured public chats could be categorized and include more general topics such as\r\n\r\nGeneral\r\n  - Introductions\r\n  - Politics\r\n  - Economy\r\n  - Business\r\n  - Travel\r\n  - Entertainment\r\n  - Sports\r\n  - World News\r\n  - Music\r\n  - Water cooler\r\n  - more general topics..\r\n\r\nLanguages\r\n  - English\r\n  - Spanish\r\n  - Portuguese\r\n  - German\r\n  - French\r\n -  Italian\r\n  - Dutch\r\n  - Russian\r\n  - Chinese\r\n  - Korean\r\n  - Japanese\r\n  - Farsi\r\n  - other major languages..\r\n \r\nDevelopers\r\n  - blockchain\r\n  - ethereum\r\n  - Web\r\n  - AI\r\n  - VR/AR\r\n  - frontend\r\n  - backend\r\n  - devops\r\n  - dapps\r\n  - cryptolife\r\n  - etc..\r\n\r\nStatus\r\n  - status\r\n  - status-core\r\n  - status-core-ui\r\n  - status-embark\r\n  - status-keycard\r\n  - status-nimbus\r\n  - status-marketing\r\n  - other Status public chats...\r\n\r\n[Design explorations](https://github.com/status-im/status-react/issues/8845#issuecomment-543589234)\r\n\r\nConsidering the mass adoption after V1 and better user experience, Status has to provide users with more public chats in a more organized and comprehensive manner.",

    "body": "@rachelhamlin Don’t you guys think it’s too early for that? Those will be dead chats with no activity, without the kind of UX in place yet necessary to facilitate meaningful interaction, especially compared to all of the other places available on the web to discuss things. There’s nothing more sad than scrolling an endless list of channels, decide on the one that interests you only to find it empty. But then again it's a bit chicken and egg problem, right? We can try and do that and see how's the activity like in those channels?\r\n\r\nWhat I’d suggest instead is to surface 10-15 most active chats, since those will be the ones our audience is most interested in. Ideally these should be picked and updated dynamically rather than a hardcoded list. This list shouldn’t include Status channels other than general imo.\r\n\r\nAs for the design, I’m working on a format that’s more welcoming and easier to understand you’re not really creating chats but rather choosing to listen to a particular hashtag others broadcast on. It's WIP since I actually wanted to base it on some feedback coming from V1\r\n\r\n<img width=\"375\" alt=\"Home Tab -_ Join Public Chat\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4932774/66732902-fc134000-ee5d-11e9-879e-f4e833e9cac0.png\">\r\n",
