  "body": "# Bug Report\r\n\r\nThere are three most obvious data delivery issues that don't have exact steps to reproduce but that we encounter quite often. \r\nAs discussed, describing them here for further investigation (cc @siphiuel )\r\nLogs and other details will be added as any of these are encountered.\r\n\r\n**1. Data loss on a synced device**\r\nMost often this can be observed in group chats (as described in https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/issues/16786 with more details) or in Status Community.\r\n\r\n**2. After background on iOS**\r\nSometimes we face the situation when data (messages/contact or membership requests/etc) stops being sent/received on iOS device after some time in background.\r\nTo start receiving/sending data again, you need to reopen the app and/or relogin.\r\n\r\n**3. Significant delivery delays in the late afternoon (for European users)**\r\nSometimes the delivery of messages/requests becomes especially long in the afternoon compared to the morning for time zones such as UTC+2, UTC +3.\r\n\r\n**4. Some particular kind of data stops being delivered for no apparent reason**\r\nFor example, you still can receive messages and contact requests, but stop getting approved to join the community.\r\nOr you can receive messages but can't receive contact requests.\r\nSometimes relogin works, sometimes it doesn't. \r\n\r\n#### _Note_\r\nSome of these scenarios may actually be the same thing. Unfortunately, it is not always possible to distinguish between a delay in delivery and a complete loss of data.",
