    "body": "Makes sense to me @Parveshdhull, though I'd share a couple things:\r\n\r\n `dispatch-n` is officially deprecated.\r\n\r\n>From v1.1.0 onwards, this effect is deprecated in favour of using :fx with multiple :dispatch tuples.\r\n>\r\n>-- https://day8.github.io/re-frame/api-builtin-effects/#dispatch-n\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, as far as I tested, `:fx` doesn't play well with the `rf/defn` + `rf/merge` pattern. The docs go a bit deeper here:\r\n\r\n>In fact, with v1.1.0 best practice changed to event handlers should only return two effects :db and :fx, in which case :db was always done first and then :fx, and within :fx the ordering is sequential.\r\n>\r\n>-- https://github.com/day8/re-frame/blob/master/docs/Effects.md#order-of-effects\r\n\r\nFrom my perspective, the whole pattern of treating events as functions is just complecting the code with no real benefit. `rf/defn` and `rf/merge` could be completely removed with no downside. There's a strong case to be made about removing this pattern, but I won't go into details here. But I digress, this is what we have and it's okayish ;)",
