  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\n*Type*: Bug|\r\n\r\n\r\n*Summary*: Having a group chat with several members (lets say 2 devices and Jarrad) I can remove Jarrad from group chat (as admin). Jarrad is shown as removed for admin device. On other device he is shown as member of group chat and I can send / request funds to/from him.\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\nIf user is removed from group chat - then group chat instance is updated for all participants. So all can see the member is removed and this member is no longer shown in chat participants or in suggestions\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Actual behavior\r\n1. I can see removed member on secondary device\r\n2. I can request funds from removed member\r\n3. I can send funds to removed member\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\n- Open Status\r\n- having 2 devices create a group chat (device 1, device 2, Jarrad)\r\n- as admin - remove jarrad\r\n- as non-admin check chat profile : Jarrad is present in group chat profile\r\n- as non-admin check chat suggestions for send/request: Jarrad is shown in suggestions\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n* Status version: 02/19/18 nightly 244\r\n* Operating System: Android, iOS",
