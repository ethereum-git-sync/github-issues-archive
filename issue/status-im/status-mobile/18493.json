I hit this bug a few times recently and it's very frustrating, I ended up just commenting out a schema to get something else done. I thought it was correlated with the recent RN upgrades as you and me recently talked in private. Maybe the RN upgrade exacerbated a problem that could already happen. At least that's what I believe at this point.\r\n\r\n> @ilmotta maybe something that needs to be fixed?\r\n\r\nI think so, these max call stack errors should never happen, even if the arguments passed to malli are considered invalid (such as nil). It's worth investigating, maybe someone already reported on the lib's repo, or the lib has upgrades already that could alleviate the problem (malli gets commits very frequently).",
