I hit this bug a few times recently and it's very frustrating, I ended up just commenting out a schema to get something else done. I thought it was correlated with the recent RN upgrades as you and me recently talked in private. Maybe the RN upgrade exacerbated a problem that could already happen. At least that's what I believe at this point.\r\n\r\n> @ilmotta maybe something that needs to be fixed?\r\n\r\nI think so, these max call stack errors should never happen, even if the arguments passed to malli are considered invalid (such as nil). It's worth investigating, maybe someone already reported on the lib's repo, or the lib has upgrades already that could alleviate the problem (malli gets commits very frequently).",

    "body": "Hey, coming back to this issue because this error is becoming a major blocker during my daily work. It's not caused by Malli or an infinite loop, although when Malli schemas fail the exception is thrown, but it's not the root cause.\r\n\r\nI could pinpoint the culprit commit, it's 761a7df06f5cfd55d9938dc6fd805ee5db11c989 (upgrade react-native to 0.72.5 (#17241)`.\r\n\r\nThe following error is triggered when we evaluate certain buffers in the REPL (e.g. `utils.money`), as well as when some Malli schemas fail. For example:\r\n\r\n1. Evaluate the entire `utils.money` buffer in a REPL. Many other namespaces are affected too.\r\n2. Or, call a malli schema with invalid args. One of the simplest, `utils.money/format`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nMaximum call stack size exceeded (native stack depth), js engine: hermes\r\n ERROR  REPL Invoke Exception [RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded (native stack depth)]\r\n```\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nIt does look like Hermes has a native call stack size that's too small for our use case. Rebuilding Hermes with an increased `MAX_NATIVE_CALL_FRAME_DEPTH` could be an option, or our only option.\r\n\r\nFrom Herme's source code:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/hermes/blob/c65d640e1710cf9717b2898c9a0f110e1385dc07/include/hermes/VM/Runtime.h#L941\r\n\r\nThis is the last commit in `develop` where Hermes was behaving well f155d95d920cf0d99a2e82aa1149954e83c37a4d\r\n\r\n@siddarthkay, would you have capacity to help investigate this problem soon(ish)? I'm really just asking because if this is not the best time for you, next week max I'll have to fully dig deeper in hopes of finding a solution. It's so bad that I disabled Malli entirely during development because it's what's blocking me the most.\r\n\r\n@yqrashawn, @clauxx, can you also reproduce the problem?\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "> It does look like Hermes has a native call stack size that's too small for our use case.

I'm really just asking because if this is not the best time for you, next week max I'll have to fully dig deeper in hopes of finding a solution. It's so bad that I disabled Malli entirely during development because it's what's blocking me the most.\r\n\r\nwow thanks for bringing this to my attention.\r\nbefore the 0.72.5 upgrade we actually would keep Hermes off for debug builds ( or development builds )\r\nref ->\r\nhttps://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/blob/f155d95d920cf0d99a2e82aa1149954e83c37a4d/android/app/build.gradle#L86\r\n\r\nSo it does seem like the problem you are facing is because Hermes is enabled.\r\nI'll also check out the `MAX_NATIVE_CALL_FRAME_DEPTH ` flag and how we can use it.\r\n\r\nanother interesting thing would be to wait for 0.73 upgrade to land ( which is just 1 short bug away and has a newer version of Hermes ) -> https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/pull/18563",
