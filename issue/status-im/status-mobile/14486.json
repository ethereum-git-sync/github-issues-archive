    "body": "Hi @du64, thank you for your suggestion.\r\n\r\nSwitcher tabs represent the app's state on a particular device and another device will have its separate state. For example, the order of the community card will depend on when and if that community is opened on that device.\r\nSo syncing is not beneficial for switcher cards.\r\nBut cards will be persisted across sessions so the app's state can be restored after restart (currently WIP).",
