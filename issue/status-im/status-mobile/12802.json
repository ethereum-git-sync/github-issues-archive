    "body": "@John-44 \r\nSo it depends whether that transaction was shown on etherscan as a pending transaction or it was confirmed already. \r\nAn outgoing transaction which is sent form the Status app will appear in the history as a pending transaction right after sending, but outgoing/incoming txs which are sent from somewhere else will appear (in the worst case) in 20 mins after being included (we have 20mins interval for checking recent history). Currently there are no simple means of watching pending txs via ethereum's RPC. \r\n\r\nIn other words, we have an issue only in case if we can't find an outgoing tx (which is sent from Status) right after sending it. Otherwise it is likely due to \"scanning\" interval. ",
