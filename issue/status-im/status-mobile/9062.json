Almost likely we want that account/phrase to be compatible with any other wallet/storage, so that shouldn't be a problem at all.\r\n\r\nBut we still have two problems with keycard's mnemonic:\r\n1. The phrase which we show during keycard setup can not be used for restoring account later. It is actually a mnemonic generated for `pairing`, [at least how I understood](https://github.com/status-im/react-native-status-keycard/blob/master/docs/usage.md#generate-mnemonic-phrase). Probably it can be used for restoring keycards setup somehow, but you definitely can't use this passphrase at MEW or other wallet.\r\n2. We can have two accounts with the same root key on a single device, one stored on keycard and another on device. This issue is covered here https://github.com/status-im/status-react/issues/8750\r\n\r\nSo I would just close this issue as it is a bit misleading already and create a new one for **1.** if it doesn't exist already.

    "body": "There were several problems yes !\r\n\r\n#9231 should solve the issue of creating a keycard account based on a seed entered by the user. This was a typo issue in the code that you fixed. It seems there are device specific issues that prevent  losing it now. \r\n\r\n#8750 tackles the issue of preventing to have  \"two accounts with the same root key on a single device, one stored on keycard and another on device\", because from a security perspective it makes no sense, and gives a false sense of security to the keycard account, since the same private key are actually on the phone in the other account. I added some comments in #8750 on the roadmap to make transitioning from on keycard account (KCA) to on-device account (ODA) KCA->ODA, ODA->KCA, KCA-> KCA, ODA->ODA.\r\n\r\nAs for the original problem from this issue, it now has several subparts caused by the same root cause or not. I'll close this one and open a new one (#9393) that shows the symptoms\r\n- when generating a new KCA, status provides a seed to the user that is not BIP39 compliant: it's not valid and can't be used in an other wallet \r\n- (might very well be a direct consequence of the previous one) if user generates a KCA and its seed, then tries to import an ODA with the same seed, it generates an account, but it's different than the KCA. Correct behaviour should be that it tries to generate an account, but fails because of security considerations (purpose of #8750). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
