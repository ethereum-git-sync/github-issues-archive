    "body": "> is community created on Desktop?\r\n\r\nYes @pavloburykh, same steps you outlined. I never create communities on mobile. But since @ibrkhalil mentioned flakiness, I was probably just lucky and thought the issue was already fixed.\r\n\r\nSince the last comment you guys shared here were at the end of September and I was lucky to not hit the bug, I thought we could close the issue. Thanks for re-testing @pavloburykh.\r\n\r\n> But yeah, I am going to fix this one too\r\n\r\nCool @ibrkhalil, thanks!",
