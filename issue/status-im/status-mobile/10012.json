  "body": "The number of passcode retries possible is a number held by the card. The card can for instance be used by several phones. \n\n**Current behaviour**\nwe show the number of attempt left at different places. Example: when signing transaction, when logging in (see screens below) before card is tapped. \nThe problem is that we are not sure what this number is before we tap the card to get this information from the card. \nMoreover we have optmized all flows to have only one tap.  Example when logging in we ask to the user his PIN, and then ask him to tap, we are not asking the user for a first tap to without PIN to know the number of remaining attempts. \n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11461437/74161468-48f60000-4c1f-11ea-95ab-29f5703450f8.png)\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11461437/74161496-51e6d180-4c1f-11ea-8627-dd7f91647ac5.png)\n\n\n**Solution**\nThe number of remaining attempts for the keycard should ONLY be shown when the user has made a wrong pin code. \n\n\nAs fgor the design it's been specified by @andmironov here https://github.com/status-im/status-react/issues/9347",
