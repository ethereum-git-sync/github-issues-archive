  "body": "# Problem\n\nCurrently, we have logic spread out across the code base that looks something like this:\n\n``` clojure\n            (when platform/ios?\n              {:passcodeFallback false\n               :fallbackLabel (or ios-fallback-label \"\")})\n            (when platform/android?\n```\n\nSince the check is being made at runtime, it means that all the resulting JavaScript is still getting included in the shipped bundle. That is wasteful, and also results in unnecessary compile-time errors that force us to mock objects that won't get used at run-time, just to satisfy the compiler.\n\n## Implementation\n\nEric suggested moving to using macros that rely on the `TARGET_OS` environment variable being set by Makefile/Nix, so that the check can be made in a .cljc hybrid file.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\nCode that is not meant for the target platform doesn't get compiled by ClojureScript compiler.",
