  "body": "# Feature Issue\n\nScope of this feature is to add a dedicated view to track token value across time, up-down % trends and perform all interactions for that token. This view would be accessed by tapping on a token in your wallet. \n_Outside of scope: it would also be presented when you 'mention' token in chat by prefixing it with `$` character (type `$snt` creates a link to this details view in a message)_\n\n### User Story\n\nAs a user I want to track the price of my tokens, or tokens I'm interested in. I want to know how their value changed across different time spans, how well they're performing and take all available actions from one place. I want this data to be shown on a graph I can interact and zoom on with.\n\n### Description\n\n**Design in Figma [here](https://www.figma.com/file/aS1ct66VQ6V0cio7vSqS8UoG/Chat?node-id=18652%3A552)**\n_work in progress, will be updated with all available interactions_\n\n<img width=\"379\" alt=\"Token Details View\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4932774/105730110-44108600-5f2e-11eb-9f0d-e5f087a90d84.png\">\n\n\n#### Scope:\n\n- Implement the design for this view\n- Include the graph visualisation, allow for scrubbing it horizontally to show the value for that particular position as long as it's pressed.\n- include a % change of value for chosen time period\n- allow to change the time period between: 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 1 year\n- show current balance in your wallet\n- place available interactions : send, buy (prerequisite: crypto onramp), swap (prerequisite native token swap integration), request\n- tapping on a token in your wallet list should open this view\n\nOut of scope:\n- at mentions of tokens in chat\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n\nThis view was implemented with all of the functionality, fetching is optimised and relatively fast, graph animates between state changes and can be scrubbed to show data for a given time on the X axis. \n\n### Notes\n\nDesigns are missing states for loading - scrubbing, I'm working on them and will edit this issue once finished.\n\nThanks! ðŸ™Œ",
