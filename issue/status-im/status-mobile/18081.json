First account in list?\n- What should happen when deselecting the *selected airdrop account* from the list of *shared accounts*?\n  - Does the airdrop address change to the next address in the selected list?\n- Does the UI / backend prevent deselection of a selected airdrop account?\n- What is the behaviour when the user selects an account derived from an imported private key, then joins the community with that private key account, then recovers their *Status Account* and doesnâ€™t still have access to the private key account when the user attempts to access the community?",
