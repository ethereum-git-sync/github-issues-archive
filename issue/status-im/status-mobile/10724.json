  "body": "# Problem\nAt present, the discoverability of subsequent pages in onboarding carousel is low, people often skip scrolling ahead because they aren't aware it's an option. There's very little affordance involved to help guide them. That's a problem, because they enter not knowing about the full possibilities of the product.\n\n## Implementation\n![Screen Recording (Safari)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4932774/83147586-2fa69000-a0f8-11ea-8896-dde6dc9f95bb.gif)\n\nSimple:\n\n* [ ] Add an autoscroll to the carousel that jumps to the next page after a time interval of 4 seconds\n* [ ] Add a progress indicator on the current page indicator, it should animate showing time remaining before the page jumps. This animation is noticeable and immediately tells that there's more out there.\n\n[Play with the prototype here](https://framer.cloud/gFtRj)\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\nFunctionality found in the prototype is implemented.\n\nthanks! ‚≠ê\n\n",
