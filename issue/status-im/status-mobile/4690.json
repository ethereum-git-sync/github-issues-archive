    "body": "Just curious about this unread message implementation as it seems to be the inverse of the originally proposed [issue](https://github.com/status-im/status-react/issues/4607).  In that example, the scroll position is maintained through sessions so that when a user returns to a chat they are in the same position/history as they were previously. The user can either scroll down and catch up, or simply tap the link and jump to the latest message. \r\n\r\nHowever in this design, it looks like the behavior is to always take the user to the latest message, thereby losing their scroll position. A user wanting to catch up will always have to scroll up and find their position or tap the button. Is this right?\r\n\r\nWe have had a lot of feedback that users do NOT want their chat/scroll position changed so they can easily follow along with threads without losing their place. \r\n\r\nSo my question is, is it better to remember the chat/message position and take users back to where they were before with an option to jump to newest, or the opposite where we always take users to the newest message, with an option to jump back to their previous position.\r\n\r\n@hesterbruikman @jpbowen Any thoughts?",

    "body": "my 0.02. With the chat scrolling behaviour, maintaining previous scroll position on re-entry and inviting users to either manually go through unread messages in their chronological order or ignore past them and scroll to the latest one, like @chadyj described, is the preferred method. I can't really back it up with any hard scientific data, rather it's just gut feeling and extrapolation on experiences with other messaging platforms. \r\nAs for those numbers @EugeOrtiz mentioned, in general, I've been talking with @hesterbruikman do we need to inform users about the specific amount of unread messages in our app. Is 9+ meaningful, is 6 less important than 40? I think those numbers can create anxiety and FOMO, and I'd love if we had an option in settings to dial that down to just circle notifications without any specific numbers inside.\r\n@dmitryn I think, yes, closing the 'Add to contacts' snackbar should be a permanent deal, it's an action a user took that he doesn't wish to see this, he may very well want to keep chatting with this person without adding him as a contact and be reminded about it every time.

Would also mention that context is key here in that as a user I prefer to scroll up to skim messages in a public channel to \"get the gist\" of what's happened versus picking up an important 1:1 chat where I want to pay attention to the details of the thread before responding and therefore want to continue from where I left off. \r\n\r\n@errorists On the indicator issue, these numbers vary in utility depending on channels / chats that I care about versus those that are not high priority and will likely remain in a permanent state of 9+.
