  "body": "# Status to become the go-to financial management app by combining Fiat and Crypto Money management tools! \r\n\r\n### User Story\r\n\r\nTrying to make Status the best app it can be.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n*Type*: Feature\r\n*Explanation*: It would be great to be able to manage all accounts, across platforms, using the Status app. Not only will users be able to check the amount of crypto in their wallet, they will also be able to actively invest in fiat and check fiat bank account transactions/values/etc. To do this, Status can connect to other financial apps and accounts using APIs. Partnerships with banks, such as Wells Fargo/Chase/US Bank/Bank of America; partnerships with investment platforms, such as Interactive brokers/RobinHood Investing/TD Ameritrade/Fidelity; credit card companies to check balances and pending charges, such as Citi/Chase/Amex/Various other credit cards; credit monitoring services, such as Credit Karma. \r\n\r\nConnecting to these various services will encourage users to stay on the platform longer, manage a greater amount of their finances from a central location, and will allow Status developers to better understand the customer journey and use meta data to improve the way the platform operates. In addition, providing a one-stop-app for finances can help with viral adoption of the Status app. Many people are moving towards crypto, but not all understand it completely. If Status could market themselves as an \"All Money\" management app, it may attract those who still want to perform significant fiat money management tasks as well as learn about/invest in cryptocurrencies (ALL from the SAME platform).  \r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nLike many money management tools, this will allow users to have a more holistic view/understanding of their finances. Greater feature/function integration will provide better services to users while the meta data from usage can be used to target advertisements, monetize partnerships between companies (i.e. incentivize Chase to allow cardholders to exchange points for cryptocurrency, thereby giving customers a better experience, potential new business partnerships between banks and crypto exchanges, and more traffic for a Status Wallet), and even create new business models from deeper integrated business logic.  \r\n\r\n",
