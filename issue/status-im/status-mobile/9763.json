  "body": "# Bug Report\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\nWhen ticking the box to `Don't ask for card to sign in`, a modal comes up to `Enable fingerprint`. When tapping `Cancel`, the checkbox remains ticked. However, it is possible to continue unlocking the Keycard multiaccount with passcode, while being required to still hold the Keycard to the phone.\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\nWhen the checkbox `Don't ask for card to sign in` is checked, the user is not required to hold the Keycard to the phone to unlock the Keycard multiaccount.\r\n\r\n#### Actual behavior\r\nWhen the checkbox `Don't ask for card to sign in` is checked, the user is required to hold the Keycard to the phone to unlock the Keycard multiaccount.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Notes\r\nNot sure if there's any reason we would require the user to hold their Keycard to the phone if they don't enable fingerprint. If this is required and passcode alone is never accepted, the solution would be to uncheck `Don't ask for card to sign in` when the user taps `Cancel` on the dialog to enable fingerprint.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\n- Open Status\r\n- Select Keycard multiaccount\r\n- Select checkbox `Don't ask for card to sign in` \r\n- Select Cancel on dialog to enable fingerprint\r\n- Enter passcode\r\n- App now asks to hold keycard to phone\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n[comment]: # (Please do your best to fill this out.)\r\n- Status version:\r\n\r\n- Operating System: Android\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Check. I think the issue was exacerbated by a bug that when having to hold the card once more, the card lost connection the `Get started` screen was shown. The only way to get back to the unlock screen was by going to `recover with Keycard`. In this flow, the app detected that there were already paired keys on the card and offered the option to `unlock`. This was the only way to get back to the unlock screen. \r\n\r\nDoes that sound like a familiar issue @churik ? It's separate, but made the check box behavior a lot more of a hassle because next to having to hold the card once more I ended up having to go through recovery.",

    "body": "Thanks for your comments on this @churik @andmironov. \r\n\r\nTo your question @andmironov I think there are 3 separate issues. Apologies for the confusion, the distinction is only now becoming clear to me. @guylouis can you also take a look please? As I think these might also need to be addressed in 3 separate GH issues.\r\n\r\n### Functionally\r\n- Enabling fingerprint works when killing the app, but is **reset when signing out**\r\nAfter checking box and enabling fingerprint, card needs to be held to phone right after ánd successive times after sign out. Not after restarting the app (??) Box is no longer checked and when checking it, the dialog to enable fingerprint is shown again (even though it is set in Settings to `Lock app with fingerprint`)\r\n\r\n- Checking `Don't ask for card to sign in` works when killing the app, but is **reset when signing out**\r\nThe state is reset when signing out. I sign in with the box checked. Then when I sign out, the box on the passcode/unlock screen is unchecked.\r\n\r\n### Non-functionally, in terms of UI\r\n- After checking box, regardless of whether you opt to enable biometrics or cancel, the UI shows the checked box `Don't ask for card to sign in`. Yet it is required to use the card once more. If the card needs to be held 'one last time', the UI needs to communicate this either as a hint by the checkbox or on the dialog asking to hold the keycard and that this is required one last time. \r\n",

ANd if yes, do we want to change our behaviour to save them (product question)\r\n- for the ui issue (being that it's unclear to the user he has to tap his card (keycard account) or enter his password (non keycard account) a last time) it's for keycard and non-keycard (with different screen of course). @andmironov do you already have an issue for this ?",
