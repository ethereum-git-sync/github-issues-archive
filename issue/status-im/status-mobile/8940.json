    "body": "whew, ok here goes nothing :)\r\n\r\n1. tapping <- back button, takes you to the previous screen in the current navigation stack. It is joined by the screen edge swipe, they are mutual and if the <- is present, you should be able to swipe. Unlike modal views (presented with an X instead of <-) where swipe back is not possible.\r\nYou should not be able to swipe when there is no back arrow meaning you can't go back to the previous screen in the navigation stack.\r\nIf it doesn't work as you expect it to it means someone botched up the navigation stack. A navigation stack is the linear sequence of screens you follow. it's like a powerpoint slide deck.\r\n\r\nIt's not a cancel action, but then again it would depend I guess on what you mean by cancel. It's like hitting the back button in your internet browser, if you loose data you had in that page then you might think of it as a cancel.\r\n\r\nNow the Android back button, I have no clue really as I don't use an Android phone 😁  By Google's definition it does the same thing as the in-app Back <-/X so it's a duplicate. On newer devices it's replaced with a edge swipe gesture just like iOS. There are areas like the browser where we could point the software button to go backward to the previous page rather than exiting the webview.\r\n\r\nIn any case, it should act as similar as humanly possible to any natively written app. All of the issues you point to sound like implementation errors when dealing with React Navigation i.e. wrongly linked screens.",

    "body": "Two things I'd like to add to what Maciej just said:\r\n\r\n1. At some places of the app in IOS there's a bug now, edge-swipe does not do the same as hitting the back button. So at least both of those actions should lead to the same result.\r\nCurrently, this happens when you go to \"Join public chat\" -> Choose a chat to join -> Go back. From here tapping \"<\" brings you to the \"Chat\" screen and edge-swiping brings you back to \"Join public chat\" screen.\r\n\r\n2. I think sometimes it's okay to break the sequence, especially if the \"previous\" screen is a part of a finished action. The above is a good example of that, I believe after the user has joined a public chat, both tapping \"<\" and edge-swiping should bring them back to \"Chats\" and skip the \"Join public chat\" screen. But this is a) arguable b) very context-dependant. So like I said above, both actions should at least do the same",
