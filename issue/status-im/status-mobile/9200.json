  "body": "**Hold card to the back of your phone to start screen**\n\n* We never mention that if you are already holding your Keycard to your phone you need to put it away and hold again for the connection to be established `Design work needed`; \n* We ask to maintain \"card to phone\" connection even though it's not necessary all the time. It's necessary only when we specifically ask for it and show the image `Design work needed` ;\n* No indication that the phone is \"looking for a card\". I suggest some animation + a hint \"try moving the card around the phone to find the best spot with the connection \" and a timeout \"No cards found, try again?\" `Design work needed` ;\n\n**Enter your pairing code screen**\n\n* There's no need to hold the card to your phone here, but it's never mentioned. I instinctively continue holding it and it becomes really frustrating to look for the pairing code and enter the code, while my phone is laying on the card on my desk `Design work needed` ;\n* I think we should mention how the pairing code looks (9 characters, letters, and digits) `Design work needed`;\n* The error says: \"Invalid pairing password\" event though everywhere else it's called \"Pairing code\" `Design work needed`;\n\n**Onboarding -> store on Keycard screen**\n\n* When trying to create an account and store it on a keycard, which has already been initiated and has an account on it, I see an error:\n  * \"**This card has already a multiaccount on it**\" – what's a multiaccount? we never mention it in the copy before. If the card only had a \"regular account\", would it be possible to proceed? `Design work needed`;\n  * \"**If you wish to change it**\" – I guess I wish to change it from a \"multiaccount\" to a \"regular account\" if that helps :-) `Design work needed`\n  * \"**If you want to import keycard multiaccount please use \"Add existing multiaccount**\" – there's no \"Add existing multiaccount\" button :-) where should I be looking for it? `Design work needed`\n* After \"Cancel\" is tapped the alert says \"Dangerous operation. We highly recommend to finish the setup in order to use the keycard\" which is misleading when i tap my old keycard and just wish to cancel the process and sign in. It leaves me with an impression i did something wrong (and maybe lost everything, since it said \"Dangerous\") `Design work needed`\n\n",
