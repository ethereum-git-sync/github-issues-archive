  "body": "**Problem** \r\nCurrently (v1.4) when a user onboards with keycard, he gets a PUK and a Pairing code. They both have very different function\r\n- PUK is here to reset the PIN if the user loses his PIN \r\n- Pairing code is here to pair a new phone to the card \r\n\r\nUsers have to write down these two parameters. \r\n\r\nSome early feedback from users of v1.4 lead us to think that users can swap PUK and Pairing because they don't understand what they are here for. Some users were reported to use their PUK as a pairing code, which doesn't work of course. \r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\nA solution would be \r\n- to remove showing PUK from onboarding\r\n- add a setting to check your PUK or change it\r\n\r\nThis could be done together with https://github.com/status-im/status-react/issues/10031\r\n\r\n",
