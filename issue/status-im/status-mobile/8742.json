    "body": "Sure. Firebase is only needed right now to interact with GCM (Google Cloud Messaging). AFAIR GCM is implemented in the Google Play Services, so of course not available on stripped-down devices that wouldn't include Google stuff. We use it to receive push notifications (in status-react cljs code) and to send push notifications (in status-go code, for no better reason than the fact that at the time, the API we needed was not exposed in the JS library we used, but was exposed in a Go library we could use. I don't think that's the case any longer, but that's a bit of a tangent).\r\nThe idea behind PNs v2 was to allow people to select their PN provider (so if they didn't want to rely on GCM, they could use an alternative open-source implementation, for instance). The advantage of using something like GCM instead of rolling our own is that if you have multiple apps handling PNs in a device, you only need to maintain one open socket, rather than having each app rolling their own, and GCM already has all the smarts implemented in order to handle e.g. power saving considerations.",

    "body": "> The advantage of using something like GCM instead of rolling our own is that if you have multiple apps handling PNs in a device, **you only need to maintain one open socket**, rather than having each app rolling their own, and **GCM already has all the smarts implemented in order to handle e.g. power saving considerations**.\r\n\r\n(Bolds mine.)\r\n\r\nWith all due respect for your work, isn't that just another way of saying \"the closed-source, data-collecting alternative from Google is working quite well, so we'll just use that\"?\r\n\r\nAnd isn't this...\r\n\r\n> removing Firebase is not an option, and we can only make a flavour of the App without it...\r\n\r\n...basically saying \"we'll make a version without the data-collecting component for the few who explicitly seek that, but we'll keep serving the rest of our users with the version that actively relies on exchanging data through Google\"?\r\n\r\nOf the [Status principles](https://status.im/about/), apart from principle IV (Privacy) that jakubgs mentioned in the opening comment, this also seem to go against the following ones:\r\n\r\n> **II Censorship Resistance**\r\n>\r\n> We enable free flow of information. No content is under surveillance. We abide by the cryptoeconomic design principle of censorship resistance. Even stronger, Status is an agnostic platform for information.\r\n\r\n> **VII Decentralization**\r\n>\r\n> We minimize centralization across both the software and the organization itself. In other words, we maximize the number of physical computers composing the network, and maximize the number of individuals who have control over the system(s) we are building.",

I think @jakubgs was referring to what can be done in the short term (v1 release) given the constraints we have (in terms of e.g. core contributors). As I mentioned above, there are plans to improve this (Push Notifications v2), where we allow users to select their PN provider, it's just a question of finding the time to implement the spec.",
