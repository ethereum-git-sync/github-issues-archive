  "body": "We'd like to start thinking of how Status users can program smart contracts on smartphones, coding directly in solidity is out of the question but a intuitive \"lego-like\" blocks that you can snap together to produce smart contracts would be a fantastic start.\n\nThe Google Blockly GUI seems like a great candidate but the GUI looks a little .. dated. \nIt would be great if we could reskin/reimagine what this would look like, in the Status look-and-feel.\n\nAn example of such an effort can be found here\nhttp://etherscripter.com/\n\nOur version should behave very similar to how Etherscripter does in terms of snapping on inputs and outputs, expanding their sizes to fit.\n\nPinch in/out to zoom in and out of the designer space\nTouch off blocks to pan around designer space\n\nAn example would be creating a multi-sig wallet or creating an escrow contract. Creating their own custom commands/requests inside Status.\n\nâ”†Issue is synchronized with this [Asana task](https://app.asana.com/0/193967741406403/193974073352370)\n",

I mean it should zoom in and out automatically in the right moment, auto-scroll left and right when drag and drop, and much more UX stuff we have to test and research and update and so on. \n\nIt feels like for this UI there's a tiny step between the \"wow, it's nice\" and \"why the hell should i use this, i'd better write code\"\n\n![ios_blocky](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3115606/19232894/175d7388-8eeb-11e6-883d-fa6a1d3fef0c.png)\n",
