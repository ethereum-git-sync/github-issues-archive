After the images are stopped being received by other members of the group chat, text messages (including in 1-1 chat) begin to be received with a delay (3-20 minutes).\n\n### Reproduction\nUser 1:\n\n* Create a group chat with User 2\n\nUser 2:\n\n* Join the group chat\n\nUser 1:\n\n* Send 5 images in a batch\n* Send 5 more images in a batch\n* Continue until message receiving stops\n\nUser 2:\n\n* Check how many images were received\n\n### Additional Information\n\n\n* Status version: develop with #11316 \n* Operating System: Android, iOS\n\n#### Logs\n[SENDER status_logs.zip](https://github.com/status-im/status-react/files/5465797/SENDER.status_logs.zip) iOS device\n\n[RECEIVER Status-debug-logs.zip](https://github.com/status-im/status-react/files/5465799/RECEIVER.Status-debug-logs.zip) Android device\n\ncc @Ferossgp @cammellos @hesterbruikman\n\n",
