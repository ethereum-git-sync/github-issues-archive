  "body": "# Problem\r\n\r\nWhen a notification in the Activity Center is marked as read or unread, all the unread counters are re-fetched from `status-go`. This causes unnecessary overhead.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nThere are two solutions that are better than the existing implementation:\r\n\r\n1. When a notification is marked from the UI as read/unread, we already know what the app db state should be and we can update the counters without communicating with status-go.\r\n2. When a notification is marked from the UI as read/unread, we just dispatch `:activity-center.notifications/fetch-unread-count-for-type`, passing the type of the current notification. This is much better than dispatching one event for each type, as is the case today. The downside is that this is slower than option 1.\r\n\r\nTo implement option 1, a reliable approach is to improve the function `update-notifications` in `status-im2.contexts.activity-center.events` to also return how many notifications were added/removed for each type of notification. Then from the result, we can easily update the unread counters in the app db. This has the added benefit of making sure that any state reconciliation from signals/etc will always update the counters, so less  surface for drifts between what's in the UI vs the counters.\r\n\r\n### What about the initial loading state?\r\n\r\nCurrently, when the app initializes, a re-frame dispatch happens to get unread counters for each type of notification. This is acceptable if it rarely happens, but ideally, we should change or add an endpoint in `status-go` that's capable of returning an unread count for each type of notification requested, all for a single RPC call.",
