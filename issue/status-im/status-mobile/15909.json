  "body": "# Problem\r\n\r\nDepends on https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/pull/15891\r\n\r\nWhen unfurling URLs, websites will reply with metadata saying where the website's thumbnail can be found (similarly but not quite the same for favicons). The problem is that most of the time, these assets are too high resolution & high quality for the purposes of link previews, and each preview has to be stored in a message at the protocol level.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nWe need to compress assets before sending them to clients and before storing them. For thumbnails we can attempt to always convert to JPEG (since we don't need transparency) and _heavily_ compress them. status-go already gives us support for JPEG compression.\r\n\r\nFor favicons it's a different story, since we need transparency to fulfill the [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/wA8Epdki2OWa8Vr067PCNQ/Composer-for-Mobile?type=design&node-id=8370-500969&t=QlvKXMgLhyP6j9iK-0). There are ways to reduce PNG file sizes, but we need to double-check what's offered in Go (or even C) to be usable in status-go.\r\n\r\nWe should probably also guarantee that assets have a max size (esp. after compression), and that link previews are always as lightweight as possible for clients.",
