    "body": "@cammellos I've checked — we actually don't send the notification twice but update the existing notification with `ActivityCenterMembershipStatusAccepted` status and send the update. And it's not very specific to this particular notification — we use the same mechanism for all the other notifications as well.\r\n\r\nThe case here is that you re-recieve the message when you log out and log in again because we fetch the messages on re-login and process them in `status-im.transport.message.core`. The potential fix is to update the notification again once it's received and processed by the client but it might break things when you use multiple clients simutaneously (let's say mobile and desktop)\r\n\r\nMy conclusion is that it doesn't actually need to be fixed to not overcomplicate the logic. First of all, it's a rare case — it's not like clients constantly log out and log in again (people usually stay logged in all the time) + it happens only sometimes when they do. I doubt it's `high-priority`, it's not even close to be a \"Critical bug\", I think it's not even a bug at all because that's how we designed the processing of received messages to work, and there is no fix needed.\r\n\r\ncc @churik ",
