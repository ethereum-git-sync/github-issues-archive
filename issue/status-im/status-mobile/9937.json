  "body": "As a user, I want to see a clearly visible feedback of my screen taps so that I know when a tap has been registered and when can I move out of it to dismiss my interaction. I want it to be delightful, responsive and accompanied by haptic feedback. \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nour touchables are boring üò¥, let's change that!\r\n\r\nThe scope of this issue is to add a custom touchable and use that as the default for all button, icons and list item components\r\n\r\nThe touchable responder should animate **On press** to a `scale of 0.9` and reduced `opacity to 0.6`. curve is `easeOut`, duration `120ms`\r\n**On release** it should animate back to it's previous state (scale 1.0, opacity 1.0). curve is `easeIn`, duration `200ms`. In addition it's accompanied by a `light` haptic feedback from the device. Haptic feedback respects user setting and can be turned off in system preferences.\r\n**On cancel** it behaves like release but is not accompanied by haptic feedback.\r\n\r\n![Screen Recording (Framer)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4932774/73288443-4b0d9700-41fb-11ea-929a-e6aa0948d897.gif)\r\n\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\nTouchable is implemented correctly, tested and optimised for performance and introduced throughout the app replacing touchableOpacity and Highlight in buttons, list items and icons.\r\n\r\n[Playground to test the intended animation ](https://framer.cloud/FGwKc)\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\nThis might rely on the use of React Native Reanimated (which is awesome!) and React-Native-Haptic-Feedback\r\nyou are awesome, thank you! üôè \r\n",
