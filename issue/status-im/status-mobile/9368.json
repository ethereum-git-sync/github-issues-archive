  "body": "_Part of #9274 onboarding with Keycard epic (mark as checked there, when closing this issue)_\n\n**Copy**\n- Headers should be changed to `Create a passcode` and `Confirm the passcode`;\n- At the bottom of both screens, the copy is changed to `You'll need the passcode to open Status and sign transactions`;\n\n**Navigation and errors**\n- On the `Create a passcode` screen there should be a 'Cancel' button instead of the \"back\" icon, which triggers a generic \"Are you sure\" prompt. If the user taps \"Store your key on Keycard\" they are redirected back to the \"Store your key on Keycard\" screen.\n- On the `Confirm the passcode` there's a \"back\" icon which brings the user back to the `Create a passcode`screen to re-enter the passcode;\n- If on the `Confirm the passcode` screen the user enters a passcode which does not match with the passcode they entered on the `Create a passcode` screen, an error \"Passcodes don’t match\" is shown for 2.2 seconds (see https://github.com/status-im/status-react/issues/9347 for detailed spec on how the error should flash and disappear, all the same, except that here there's no limited number of attempts and the error message is different). After the error disappears they stay on the `Confirm the passcode` screen. If the wish to go back and re-enter the passcode, they should use the \"Back\" icon;\n\n<img width=\"1612\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-10-31 at 14 04 23\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3115606/67923319-7676ea80-fbe8-11e9-86f4-4bd6a91ec5e2.png\">\n\n<img width=\"859\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-10-31 at 14 06 09\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3115606/67923321-7971db00-fbe8-11e9-9877-90eb9ee5bef0.png\">\n\n**Num pad**\n- Numbers should have an active state (See https://github.com/status-im/status-react/issues/9341);\n- The num pad should adopt to smaller screens (See https://github.com/status-im/status-react/issues/9353);\n\n<img width=\"801\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-10-31 at 15 49 24\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3115606/67928481-18e99a80-fbf6-11e9-9b80-e870582cf991.png\">\n\n<img width=\"1206\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-10-31 at 15 47 53\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3115606/67928487-1c7d2180-fbf6-11e9-92b7-bdb48f467315.png\">\n\n\nFigma:\nhttps://www.figma.com/file/dEIljL7UPbXgsZUA0Q4qlE5E/Onboarding?node-id=4540%3A11551",
