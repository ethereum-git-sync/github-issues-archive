    "body": "Infura does region block by IP address, I tried to use curl to try out Infura's endpoint through some proxies, but I couldn't get what error code is returned. It may not be an error code, perhaps the TCP connection is being closed without response. Either way, the app shouldn't crash because of an RPC call. Either status-go doesn't have the exception handling in-place or the error is being fumbled in the handoff between react and status-go. This would also make a great unit test, whatever the root cause turns out to be.",
