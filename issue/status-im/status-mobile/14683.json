  "body": "# Feature Issue\r\n\r\n#### Problem\r\n\r\nAs it stands nowadays, when a notification appears/disappears in the Activity Center, the UI is updated without any sort of animation. This can (and have) confused users who might think the notification \"disappeared\" (a bug), when in reality it was the lack of UI feedback that gave that impression.\r\n\r\n#### Solution\r\n\r\nBy animating the insertion/removal of notifications, we believe users will more easily understand the sorting order when notifications are inserted/removed and, in general, be less confused about real-time updates in reaction to signals sent from the backend.\r\n\r\n### Acceptance criteria\r\n\r\nThere's no definite design yet on how the list should be animated, so it's important to align with designers what would a reasonable animation be like.",

    "body": "I'm parking/closing this issue because I stumbled in a major bug in the Reanimated `FlatList` component, where the insertion/removal of items don't trigger the layout animation, which makes the entering/exiting of items rather clunky.\r\n\r\nThis is a known issue in Reanimated 2.3.x (https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated/issues/2737). I wonder if upgrading Reanimated would fix it, but that's easier said than done in the Status mobile codebase, where we have a lot of outdated libs.\r\n\r\nIn the videos below, you can see the *expected vs buggy* behavior with the FlatList. Both examples can be seen by running the code in the branch https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/tree/feature/add-basic-animations-to-notifications. I pushed a single commit with all explanations to help out a future investigation https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/commit/25bf309a8af690940ff9e9d820ee1cbf50327e44.\r\n\r\nNote that the same problem happens when using Reanimated `FlatList` or just React Native `FlatList`.\r\n\r\n### Correct layout animations without Reanimated `FlatList`\r\n\r\n[working-layout-animation.webm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46027/210663296-6e97d99b-e5fe-4341-9a39-f39318deedd5.webm)\r\n\r\n### Clunky, no layout animations on insertion/removal with Reanimated `FlatList`\r\n\r\n[no-animations-happen.webm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46027/210663319-eaa5dd53-664e-4621-97ed-f80601107d9d.webm)\r\n\r\n**cc** @briansztamfater, @Parveshdhull. I'm not sure if you're aware of this problem, so I'm copying you folks here. The bug I faced here can severely limit our ability to animate flatlists, so perhaps we should do something about it sooner rather than later.",
