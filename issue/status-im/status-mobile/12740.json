Remove < and >)\r\n\r\n### User Story\r\n\r\nAs a user, I want to have a dedicated place for notetaking on Status so that I can ditch other less secure alternatives and move more of my workflow into Status. \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI want to be able to take notes inside of a dedicated Status Community that I can share or export to markdown, and create channels that I can draw and sketch in.\r\n\r\nThis would be similar to Google Docs where you can invite others to add to your document and then merge or reject their changes.\r\n\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n* Must be end-to-end encrypted by default\r\n* Let users choose to keep it local or sync between devices\r\n* Export to Markdown and PDF would be nice\r\n* Drawing channels that can convert into an SVG would be nice",
