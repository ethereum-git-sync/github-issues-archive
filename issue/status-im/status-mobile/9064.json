  "body": "### User Story\n\nAs a User I don't want to deal with pair code and PUK code because I already have a card, a pin code and a seed phrase to deal with.\n\n### Description\n\nSince the app is setting both when creating the keycard account, both code could be replaced by something derived from the seed phrase (to be recoverable by elements I already know instead of new ones). I would suggest sha3 of seed phrase + keycard uuid (I think there is such a thing?) and then only take the first n chars (these code don't have to be that long)\n\nThis means that during account creating we could remove the pair and puk code screen entirely.\nDuring pairing on new device the user enters his seed phrase and account Status does the transformations to get the code and pair the card.\nDuring card unlocking (after multiple wrong PINs) user enters seed phrase and card is unlocked \n\n@andremedeiros @andremedeiros @guylouis @gravityblast @dmitryn @hesterbruikman @corpetty",

    "body": "From a security point of view, you'd be entering the seed on all your devices, so you are widening the attack window a lot. With the current solution, the attack window for the seed phrase (which the most valuable secret) exists only when you load a seed phrase on the card and that should happen once per seed phrase. With the proposed solution, the attack window is every time you pair a device or unblock the PIN. I cannot estimate real-life impact, but it is surely a compromise.\r\n\r\nFrom an implementation point of view, it means the client must change PUK/pairing code whenever a new passphrase is loaded. This does not break existing pairings, so it might not be too bad. It however means that it should reset PUK/pairing code to some sort of default if REMOVE KEY is used and hope no other software changes it, otherwise it becomes impossible to load a new key (unless we provide a pairing code prompt when autopairing fails).\r\n\r\nAnother complication might come from the fact that the PUK must be numeric. This is something we can change but it is a breaking change or the derived code from the seed phrase must be made a 12 digit number (should not be too difficult). The pairing code instead can be anything, it does not need to be alphabetic, it can even be sha3(seed + uuid) directly if it is not mean to be input.\r\n\r\nThis also makes it impossible to generate keys on card and then using the DUPLICATE KEY to make backups on spare card. I know we have not planned that yet, so it is not an immediate concern, but that would actually be the best way to go about getting rid of the seed phrase completely and thus closing the attack window at initialization and the weak spot of a paper backup.",

    "body": "@bitgamma I think it can still be solved in an elegant way for the user. There is two possible cases where the user would pair the keycard with a new device:\r\n- user has a new device, and still has the old one: we can have a flow that allows the old device to show a qr code of the pairing code and the new one to scan it, that way the user doesn't have to enter any seed phrase, with this flow the user would even avoid having to put his seedphrase in a new device for recovering a normal account. In that case the pairing code could be sha3 of the sha3 of the seedphrase, which the old devices knows, and the UUID of the card. \r\n- user lost the old device: user has to input his seedphrase (can't think of a trick for now), he needs it to encrypt the db on the new device anyway\r\n\r\n",

The reverse would be great for desktop onboarding as well. Although I imagine more complex as the old device somehow needs to know if the QR code of a new device can be trusted. For another time.\r\n\r\n> I cannot estimate real-life impact, but it is surely a compromise.\r\n\r\nI see this compromise totally dependent on the use case of Keycard. Meaning the use of Keycard as a _cold storage_ vs keycard as a _cash alternative_. For the scenario of a cash alternative, the amount of assets could be capped by only allowing a pre-configured amount (seems like this would need a contract to safeguard transferring larger amounts).\r\n\r\nIf the amount is capped, I'd love a solution in which seed phrase, PUK and pairing code aren't required at all. At maximum a passcode set by the user and a unique card ID to recognize a card. Lose the card, lose access; Same as cash. \r\n\r\nDreaming away here 🐭\r\n",

Version 2.3 of Keycard (unreleased) also includes a KeycardCash applet which has no authentication code at all (not even PIN and the keypair is generated automatically on card) and is meant to be used as a cash equivalent with payment terminals. The applet is parallel and separate from the main wallet applet so one could use only one applet or both at the same time but they never interfere",

    "body": "if we were to derive the pairing code and the PUK from the seed phrase it would mean we wouldn't be able to pair the card with any other app that doesn't take the same approach at pairing/PUK generation. For the PUK it is less sensitive as it is not supposed to be used too much. However we would need at least 3 words from the seed phrase to obtain the same number of combination as we have for the PUK now (it is a 12-digit number, whereas words are choosen from a list of 65535 elements).\r\n\r\nThis would also mean hiding the real PUK and pairing code from the user, so maybe we should at least add a function to the cli tool or something to calculate it from (part of) seed the phrase for advanced users.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I am afraid the simplicity advantage we gain during the onboarding will turn into a series confusing issue as soon as the Keycard ecosystem becomes any larger. I think the step of simplyfing the pairing code will already greatly improve the onboarding the experience since that is the longest credential.",
