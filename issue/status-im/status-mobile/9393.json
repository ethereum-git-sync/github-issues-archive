Procedure to reproduce described in #9062 \n\n@dmitryn @gravityblast @rasom",

    "body": "@guylouis before I fix this one, I want to clarify what was the reason for creation of mnemonic for `pairing` in the first place? \r\n\r\nThe problem is that \"the wrong mnemonic\" here is not a random bug, it was intentionally generated [as described here](https://github.com/status-im/react-native-status-keycard/blob/master/docs/usage.md#generate-mnemonic-phrase). As far as I understand this mnemonic should allow to restore `pairing`, not private key. But well it won't work as described [here](https://github.com/status-im/react-native-status-keycard/blob/master/docs/usage.md#generate-and-load-master-key), because this mnemonic does't represent master key... \r\n\r\nAnd thus the question is: do we still need to show this mnemonic for `pairing` to the user or this code should be removed at all from the application?

    "body": "@rasom to clarify: the mnemonic entered here should be used to represent the seed of the multiaccount, it is definitely the seed of the BIP32 account. \r\n\r\nFor now (v1), it is not used for anything related to the pairing of the card. After v1, we will think and design about how the pairing code of the card (which is today an independant value generated randomly and provided by the user) can be derived (with a derivation method to define) from this seed. The advanatge will be for th euser to not have to remember menmnonic + pairing code but only mnemonic. But this is not in the scope now. \r\n\r\nHope this helps. \r\n\r\n@gravityblast don't hesitate to jump in the discussion",
