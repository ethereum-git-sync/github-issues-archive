  "body": "### User Story\n\nAs a member of the Status community team, I need an easy means of distributing SNT to new users when the product launches. \n\nAs a user of Status, I want to seamlessly exchange funds with others without sacrificing my privacy.\n\n### Description\n\n*Summary*: As a result of [this RFC](https://github.com/status-im/team-core/issues/5) and the discussion in #9108, we've decided to support the transfer of tokens to new users (and between users) by re-enabling chat commands. \n\nWe'll facilitate the sharing of a wallet address from within the /send and /request flows, so that wallet information is exchanged in context of a user's intention to send/receive tokens,  and so as to limit the exposure of their wallets to the general public.\n\n[/request flow designs](https://www.figma.com/file/aS1ct66VQ6V0cio7vSqS8UoG/Chat?node-id=144%3A234)\n[/send flow designs](https://www.figma.com/file/aS1ct66VQ6V0cio7vSqS8UoG/Chat?node-id=144%3A234)\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n\n~All users see the `/send` and `/request` options in 1:1 chat with all other users.~\n**Update 11/11/19:** We are experimenting with the GUI drawer. Users will see `Send transaction` and `Receive transaction` buttons.\n~The chat command icon is updated (new arrow icon to right of sticker icon).~\nThe chat command icon will be changed to a `+`.\nPixel perfect design implementation.\n\n_Note:_ This implementation should **not affect the wallet flow** in any way.\n\nScenario 1: sending tokens\n- User A selects `Send transaction` and decides how many tokens they want to send to User B.\n- User B receives a request to share a wallet address with user A, who wants to to send them `50 SNT` (for example).\n- User A receives a system message notifying to say that they are awaiting wallet information from user B.\n- User B selects a wallet to share with user A. Or, user B rejects the wallet request. \n- If approved, user A can complete the transaction. User B receives the tokens.\n\nScenario 2: receiving tokens\n- User A selects `Receive transaction` and specifies how many tokens they want from user B.\n- User A chooses which wallet they would like to share with user B in order to receive the tokens.\n- User A sees a system message representing their request.\n- User B chooses which wallet to pay user A with and completes the transaction. \n\n### Notes\n\nThe specific user actions and mechanics of the exchange can be refined based on feedback from @yenda and @errorists.",
