  "body": "# Problem\nOne of the biggest problems we have is user activation. \n\nInfluencers: The influencers have to spend time explaining to their audience/followers how to join their public chats within Status. This creates friction and a relevant % of users likely donâ€™t bother doing it and drop off.\n\n### User story\n\n\n* [ ] As a new user invited to a public chat on Status (with or without a referral code), I want to join this public chat upon onboarding so I instantly have access to people who can help me navigate and discover the app\n* [ ] As Status core contributor (Marketing) I want to create a link for an influencer that directs users to a public chat, because they might drop off if they have to search for the chat\n* [ ] As a user joining Status I don't want for my IP address to be exposed without any action from my side that controls this\n* [ ] Add public chat to list view when passed through deep link (with/without referral code)\n* [ ] Show empty public chat view with option to join when user taps on public chat in list\n* [ ] Fetch history from history node only after user taps Join in public chat view\n\n## Implementation\n## Acceptance Criteria\n## Notes\n## Future Steps\n\n\n",
