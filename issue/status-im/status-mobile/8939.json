  "body": "PLACEHOLDER\n\n# Problem\n\nKeycard is only eligible for Android devices. \n\n> Until June this year it was impossible at quite low level for iOS to interconnect with a smartcard like ours. iOS enabled it then in beta. HOwever we have not started the swift SDK that will allow to integrate keyacrd with status. So:\n> - today only status android works with keycard\n> - we have some work to do to have status iOS to work with keycard\n> - the fact that it seems that your keycard works with iOS is because your iPhone might detect the keycard, but it actually can't do anything with it (at most it can pop up the app store on status for now)\n\n## Implementation\n\nHide any instance of keycard from iOS. For example, during onboarding, the user does not need an option for how to encrypt their key.\n\nhttps://www.figma.com/file/dEIljL7UPbXgsZUA0Q4qlE5E/Onboarding?node-id=927%3A15991\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\nRules for the future PR to be accepted.\n\n## Notes\n\nRandom notes to keep in mind while implementing it. Mostly about related issues and future plans and thoughts.\n\n## Future Steps\n\nSteps which should be taken after this issue has been resolved.",
