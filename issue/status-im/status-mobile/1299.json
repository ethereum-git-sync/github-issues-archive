  "body": "Hopefully this is self-explanatory - the suggestions area for the command stays visible on until `preview` returns, but everything is unresponsive. This hides any messages which may have been sent asynchronously by `status.sendMessage` before the function returns. The visibility of these messages is pretty key to letting the the user know that their command has been registered.\r\n\r\nIt would be cool to hide the suggestions area and keep the greyed-out input area as an indicator of \"loading\" or something.\r\n\r\nWill fill out the big issue template if you prefer, running low on time today.",
