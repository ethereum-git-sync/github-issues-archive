  "body": "### Identified Behavior\r\n\r\nSometimes view rendering is slow as main thread is occupied with heavy computations. As an example, account creation process is slow and laggy, message could appear in slow motion, etc.\r\n\r\n### Hypothesis\r\n\r\nUsing another JS thread to do heavy computations could free main JS thread to do UI related computations (subscriptions, hiccup rendering, react diffs, etc).\r\n\r\n### Assumptions\r\n\r\nMain JS thread responsible for UI rendering is sometimes occupied by other computations which prevents UI to be updated smoothly.\r\n\r\n### Metrics\r\n\r\nAs UI metric we could use https://github.com/status-im/status-react/issues/3111 to test against. Moving heavy computations to another thread should let UI render smooth during account creation.\r\n\r\n### Acceptance criteria\r\n\r\n- [ ] Spawning second JS thread works on both Android and iOS\r\n- [ ] App memory usage doesn't grow much and stay within accepted range (to be defined)\r\n- [ ] Ability to run any ClojureScript code on another thread.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\nAmong many libraries that implement RN threading capabilities , this library seems good to try for our needs https://github.com/joltup/react-native-threads\r\n\r\nAlso,  https://github.com/seantempesta/cljsrn-re-frame-workers could provide insights on how to use ClojureScript with RN threads (workers) library.\r\n",
