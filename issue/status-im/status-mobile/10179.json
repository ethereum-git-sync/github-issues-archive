  "body": "# Feature Issue\nCreate an invite link for group chats that can be used as a referral link\n\n### User Story\n\n- As a user I want to invite friends in my current group chat to join me on Status in a private group chat, because I want to continue our existing shared conversation there\n- As Status we want to onboard existing groups as they are more likely to stay compared to individuals being connected to one other user / not interested in public group chats\n- As a user who sent out a link I want to be part of the referral scheme using that link so that I can earn SNTs\n\nDeep linking throughout install only works on Android. on iOS recipients of an invite link will always need to reopen the link after installing the app.\n\n### Description\n##### User requirements\n- Admins can create a group chat link\n- Anyone can share the link once it's created by an admin\n- The admin who created the link gets notified to Approve/Reject\n_*Only admins as the link needs to include their pk in order for them to Approve joining_\n\n\n##### Flow\n- User B wants to invite someone, they tell user A\n- User A creates the invite link url (note that it will be long, includes a group chat ID, chat name, admin pk)\n- User B invites someone\n- User A sees a notification to approve\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n\n\n### Notes\nEffort estimate 3 weeks upon availability of designs",

    "body": "One potential implementation for this is, given the requirements described above:\r\n\r\nAn admin of the group will generate an invite link.\r\nThis link will include at least:\r\n\r\n1) The admin public key\r\n2) The group chat ID (not sure we need this, as it can be revealed at later stages)\r\n3) The group chat name at the time of invitation (might change after that)\r\n4) A unique identifier for the invitation\r\n\r\nIf the user has already status installed, it will be handled as a universal link (this would work both on IOS and Android).\r\nIf the user has not status installed, and installs it through this link, it will be handled on creating a new account. This option is only available on Android. IOS user won't be able to continue the flow.\r\n\r\nThis link will be shared in any way the admin wants, it can be posted in a group chat, one-to-one, or send through other means (whatsapp etc).\r\n\r\nOnce the receiving user has either installed the app (Android only), or clicked on it (if status was already installed, both Android IOS), it can be shown with an invitation to join the group chat (or can happen automatically, that's a question for UX and UI).\r\n\r\nIf confirmed, the user will send a protocol message to the admin. We have quite a lot of freedom on the format. The simplest would be a new protocol message, for example:\r\n\r\n``` protobuf\r\n    message GroupChatInvitation {\r\n     string chatId = 1; (not sure we need this)\r\n     string invitationID = 2;\r\n     string introductionMessage = 3;\r\n   }\r\n```\r\nMultiple options are possible, the concept is just that the sending user needs to communicate that it has responded to the invitation.\r\n\r\nThe signature of the sender can be used to identify the sending user, so does not have to be transmitted.\r\n\r\nOnce the admin receives this message, it will show some UI to allow the user to confirm or decline the whether the user can join the chat. \r\n\r\nMind that at this point no identity is verified, anyone who had access to the link could be the sender, therefore the admin should be invited to verify the identity through some means (i.e chatting with the user through status, or some other media).\r\n\r\nIf accepted, the admin would actually add the PK to the group chat, in the same way `add-members` currently work. \r\nThe invited user will receive the invitation, and automatically join the chat (or it could still be asked to join the chat, that's a UX decision), by responding with a `join-event` message type (this is just the normal flow).\r\n\r\nThis is a non-breaking change, so users invited will be seen as normal participants once the flow is completed.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer, this is just one of the potential implementations, and until the feature is fully fleshed out with UX/UI, implementation might have to be modified to reflect the changes.\r\n",

    "body": "@errorists thanks, very helpful.\r\n\r\nLooking at the designs, all the above still stands, a couple of things:\r\n\r\n1) Does anyone see the `Group membership request`? or only the creator of the link/admin? (others might see it \"read-only\"). For simplicity it'd be better if only the admin sees it, but both options can be worked on.\r\n\r\n2) In the group membership request, I think we should invite the user to verify the identity, as we don't know exactly who it might be (the only information we might have is their 3 random words name). Say something like `Chat with x` `Accept` `Decline`, or a warning or something.",

So could the person compose a short message that would be shown to the admin? You'd still be able to tap on their username to go their profile and `Send a message` to begin a new private chat if desired. It increases the complexity but we did a similar idea with Tribute to Talk to verify your identity and do an intro you'd attach a message.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"427\" alt=\"Screenshot 2020-05-28 at 15 01 01\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4932774/83144881-434ff780-a0f4-11ea-8d40-43bf37dec16e.png\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"427\" alt=\"Screenshot 2020-05-28 at 15 01 17\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4932774/83144898-48ad4200-a0f4-11ea-8e89-80dcdd68e487.png\">\r\n\r\n ",

All makes sense to me. @cammellos do you see more details required for anyone to start work on this issue, in addition to the designs on Figma?\r\n\r\nI imagine this also creates a new link type for status.im to handle, to be shown in a QR code and for status app QR code reader to handle. @errorists can you add these steps (between screen 4 and 5) of opening the link on Desktop and Mobile? \r\n\r\nSpam is a valid concern. I think there are options for future mitigations next to giving granular control now, e.g. staking to an associated smart contract account in order to send a membership request. Multiple chat keys would be an option here as well so you would stop listening with a chat key if you are completely overwhelmed. \r\n\r\n",

    "body": "I've changed the design a bit… well actually I started fresh following the discussion. For admins it now resides in a single view tucked inside group profiles so that chat history is clear of all those requests, it's also more prominent and they have options to control if a link is active or not. If desired I can add generating new links. All in all, I think it's more spam resistant, granular and obvious. \r\nOne thing I'm not sure, if an admin declined your request should you be able to retry, wdyt?",

I would also remove `System requirement` section (I would leave technical requirements always out of the issues), just the functional ones, unless there are some hard technical requirement (i.e the one about the URL, although you can translate it to a functional i.e As a user who sent out a link I want to be part of the referral scheme using that link so that I can earn SNTs or something).\r\nOtherwise looks ok",
