  "body": "### User Story\r\n\r\nAs a user, I want to enter the confirmation code once and get started right away. If I enter the code in the text field right away without clicking into the command menu (which has a notification for confirmation code), Console tells me it was a success but the notification remains. I have to confirm through the menu or the in-chat button in order for the notification to go away.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n[comment]: # (Feature or Bug? i.e Type: Bug)\r\n*Type*: Bug\r\n\r\n[comment]: # (Describe the feature you would like, or briefly summarise the bug and what you did, what you expected to happen, and what actually happens. Sections below)\r\n*Summary*: After the phone number is entered, Console appears to enter the default mode, a plain text entry box with no prompt. The user has a few choices: \r\n1. press blue in-chat notification, and enter code\r\n2. press blue command menu notification, and enter code\r\n3. begin typing code in text box\r\n\r\n1 and 2 work properly, but 3 does not clear the notification, making the user feel as if something went wrong. I feel that 3 should be replaced with an immediate prompt, i.e. rather than showing the user this screen:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"300\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-03-17 at 04 26 09\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/302945/24015348/9c78388a-0acb-11e7-8a87-fc9b931bb15d.png\">\r\n\r\nThis should be shown immediately:\r\n<img width=\"300\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-03-17 at 04 26 23\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/302945/24015403/b780865a-0acb-11e7-95bb-8ef9804bb3bf.png\">\r\n\r\nThis is the norm in other mms confirmations, usually the user cannot proceed or go elsewhere before the process is done. This also gives more consistency to the `?` and `/` notation for Requests and commands as well--if only the third time the user encounters a Request is a \"hidden\" request (i.e. she does not see the colored bar, and the request UI appears only *after* she has typed her confirmation number), this hinders intuitive learning.\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\nAfter the phone number is given, the user should immediately be taken to a Request UI. After confirmation-code is entered, the notification should disappear. \r\n\r\n#### Actual behavior\r\nThe user is left in a limbo state where several notifications exist on the screen, causing mild anxiety (remember the user does not yet know that the in-chat blue prompt and the command menu prompt point to the same thing) and if the user does the natural thing and inputs the confirm code into the text area, the notification does not disappear.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\n- Add new account\r\n- Add new phone number\r\n- Enter confirmation code in the text box without pressing on any notification or message\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n[comment]: # (Please summarise the solution and provide a task list on what needs to be fixed.)\r\n*Summary*: \r\n\r\n- [ ] Send user directly to Request UI after phone number entry\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n[comment]: # (Please do your best to fill this out.)\r\n* Status version: Commit 951b257\r\n[comment]: # (Android or iOS.)\r\n* Operating System: iOS\r\n\r\n#### Logs\r\n\r\n[comment]: # (if on Android please replicate bug whilst running adb logcat)\r\nN/A",
