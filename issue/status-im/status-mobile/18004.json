  "body": "# Bug Report\r\n\r\n## Problem \r\n[comment]: # (A problem description)\r\nCurrently if the user logs out (through settings) from their account that has biometrics enabled, they can't use biometrics to login again nor can they enable it from the settings. The enabling from the settings would come with Settings V2, but the user should still be able to use biometrics after they log out or switch accounts. ATM all biometry information is erased during logout (auth-method & password) from the keychain.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\nThe user can log-out and log in again using biometrics. I guess the user shouldn't be prompted with the biometrics check right after logging out, but when the app is opened again biometrics should be prompted.\r\n\r\n#### Actual behavior\r\nThe user can't log in with biometrics ever again after logging out\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\n1. Create account with biometrics\r\n2. Go to profile -> Log out -> Confirm\r\n3. Can only log in with password, even after closing the app and opening again\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n- Status version: nightly \r\n- Operating System: Android, iOS\r\n\r\n\r\n[comment]: # (Please, add logs/notes if necessary)\r\n\r\n",
