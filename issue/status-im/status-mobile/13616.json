One could use a workaround by sending an nft via opensea. Not ideal because Opensea is centralized. But Opensea doesn't work with Status anyway.\n\nIf you know another work around it'd be great please.\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n\nBeing able to select and send one or several NFTs own by Status wallet. Must work with keycard.\n",
