  "body": "As a user, I want to write blog posts and long-form updates on the timeline, and 300 characters is too few. \r\n\r\nI think removing the limit, or making it something like 2000 characters would be good.\r\n\r\nPart of the problem with Twitter is that you're confined to a limited amount of characters. Removing this limit would free up Status to be used for many creative things beyond short updates that people won't care about. Would be awesome to write full blog posts, share news articles, or even the entire Bee Movie script haha...\r\n\r\nIf anyone can tell me where the code for this limit is, I'll gladly increase it and submit a PR",
