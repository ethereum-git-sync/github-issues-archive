  "body": "Follow-up from #2749 \r\n\r\nAs a developer, I want the custom figwheel script to be more decoupled so that I can have more control when using my editor integrated with REPL. \r\n\r\nMy usual workflow is start nREPL once, then in Emacs CIDER  connect to nREPL to do whatever actions I need like firing up figwheel, CLJS REPL, etc. So I would have to avoid `lein figwheel-repl` because it doesn't create a nREPL session that allows me connect to it later via Emacs CIDER. Before using the custom figwheel script, I had no problem with starting nREPL with figwheel running altogether. Although it takes a bit longer for the start up time, once it's done loading, I can quickly connect or reconnect to CLJS REPL anytime I want. But after the switch now, I cannot easily start and stop CLJS REPL because it's bundled with `start-figwheel` now. The start up time is longer than one minute on my slow laptop, so I don't want the figwheel script to be run immediately with requiring the file. Sometimes I will have to restart figwheel by calling `(stop-figwheel)` then `(start-cljs-repl)`, but it fails with error `BindException Address already in use  sun.nio.ch.Net.bind0 (Net.java:-2)`. I would have to restart nREPL and everything. Last, I cannot pass the build IDs that I want to use when starting figwheel by function call directly.",
