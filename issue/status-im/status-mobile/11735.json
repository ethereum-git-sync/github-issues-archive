  "body": "# Bug Report\n\n## Problem\n\nWhen moving multiaccount keystore file to keycard with respective feature, - there is a different account restored from the same seed phrase which were used for multiaccount recovered on device keystorage.\nHowever on login screen I see \"correct\" account (public key), - after login in to it there is a different address and public key. For note: this \"different\" account is always the same on reproduction of Galaxy S20. It's like using another derivation path (it's not because I see it's same m/44'/60'/0'/0/0 in all cases for account setting\n\nNo issue on Android 11 (Google pixel 2), Android 8. So far it's Galaxy S20 and Galaxy S8.\n\nNOTE: it happens with only my own account. Reproduced on Galaxy S20 and Galaxy S8. But Galaxy J7 looks good with it (it's on Android 8)\nI checked another account on Galaxy S20 and they were ok. Also I tested this account on another device with the same build and it's all OK too (i.e. the same account recovered after moving keycard keystore storage)\n  \n#### Expected behavior\n\nThere is the same account when same seed phrase moved to keycard keystore file\n\n#### Actual behavior\n\nDifferent accounts when same seed phrase moved to keycard keystore file\n\n### Precondition \nEmpty keycard ready for use exists\n\n### Reproduction\n\n- Open Status and recover multiaccount\n- Log out of this account \n- Open login screen of this account\n- Tap three dots menu at the top-right\n- Select `Manage keys and storage` -> Move keystore file -> `Enter seed phrase`\n- Enter the same seed phrase (so use above)\n- Select `Keycard` -> `Confirm` -> `Move and reset`\n- Begin setup\n- Finish all keycard onboarding processes\n- Check address and public key whether it's different\n\n**Actual result:** (pay attention to username which is different)\n![ezgif com-gif-maker (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8749671/107533994-2b5bcd80-6bc8-11eb-9b8b-5da3c0bb44fc.gif)\n\n### Additional Information\n- Status version: release 1.11\n- Operating System: Android 11 (Galaxy S20), Android 9 (Galaxy S8) with specific account\n\n#### Logs\n\nFull device logcat starting from 'Move keystore file' keycard storage flow \n[Keycard_diff_accc.txt](https://github.com/status-im/status-react/files/5959203/Keycard_diff_accc.txt)",

    "body": "Hey @shivekkhurana as discussed on Discord I'm not really comfortable to share my account seed phrase for now :) \r\nI also tried several more different seed phrases and they behaved fine.\r\nAlso, I noticed one thing: \r\nOn the main Seed Phrase recovery view (`Open Status` -> `Access Existing keys` -> `Recover with seed phrase`) we trim seed phrase value when entered. So if there are whitespaces at the beginning or end or empty lines - we ignore and use only seed phrase value. \r\nHowever, when moving account to Keycard storage (`Account login` -> `...` -> `Manage keys and storage` -> `Enter seed phrase`) - there is no seed phrase trim function (in a case I recover seed phrase with whitespaces - it responds 'Seed doesn't match'.\r\n\r\nThis means to me we are using different module/view/function in last scenario than first. And maybe that can fix the original issue I have.\r\nCould you check the difference between above two seed phase recover views and try to alight seed phrase parsing (so that we have `Manage keys and storage`'s sedd phrase view behave the same to main account recovery flow seed phrase view).\r\nIn any case i'd say that's also and issue that we don't have seed phrase trimming when moving account to Keycard.",
