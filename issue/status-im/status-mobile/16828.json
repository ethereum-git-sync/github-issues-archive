  "body": "This issue refers to  [#16801](https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/pull/16801)\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\nDuring the implementation of the account-card component, the team noticed that the dashed border is not the same as Figma. For reference please check the Review 3 here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.figma.com/file/Tf5nfkYvpbnNCo4rKLK7lS/Feedback-for-Mobile?type=design&node-id=3356-276830&mode=design&t=4HgK5AwVqRGvZyxG-0\r\n\r\nThe goal of this issue is to achieve a custom SVG border that match exactly the design provided\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\nThe design should follow Figma. In the case of the card account component, the dashed border is applied to the type \"Add-Account\". Here's the Figma file:\r\nhttps://www.figma.com/file/WQZcp6S0EnzxdTL4taoKDv/Design-System-for-Mobile?type=design&node-id=19513-197699&mode=design&t=AyTZe7l184ev1VcK-0\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Actual behavior\r\nReact Native does not allow us to customize the dashed border as we need (e.g. space in between each dash), it's limited to :border-width and :border-color in that case.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\n1. Please navigate to \"Profile and Quo.2.0 Preview\" and locate the component under \"Wallet/account-card.\"\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n- Operating System: Android, iOS\r\n\r\nAlso, during the implementation of the account_card we came to this piece of code which can be used as an example to achieve what we need:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n(defn- add-account-view\r\n  [{:keys [on-press customization-color theme metrics?]}]\r\n  [rn/view {:style {:flex 1 :justify-content \"center\" :align-items \"center\"}}\r\n    [:> svg/Svg\r\n      {:height (if metrics? 88 68)\r\n       :width  161}\r\n      [:> svg/Path\r\n        {:d (if metrics? \r\n              \"M16,0 h129 a16,16 0 0 1 16,16 v56 a16,16 0 0 1 -16,16 h-129 a16,16 0 0 1 -16,-16 v-56 a16,16 0 0 1 16,-16\"\r\n              \"M16,0 h129 a16,16 0 0 1 16,16 v36 a16,16 0 0 1 -16,16 h-129 a16,16 0 0 1 -16,-16 v-36 a16,16 0 0 1 16,-16\")\r\n         :stroke (colors/theme-colors \"pink\" colors/white-opa-5 theme)\r\n         :strokeWidth \"1\"\r\n         :fill \"none\"\r\n         :strokeDasharray \"4\"}]]\r\n    [rn/view {:style {:position \"absolute\" :height (if metrics? 88 68) :justify-content \"center\" :align-items \"center\"}}\r\n      [button/button\r\n        {:type               :primary\r\n         :size               24\r\n         :icon               true\r\n         :accessibility-label :add-account\r\n         :on-press           on-press\r\n         :customization-color customization-color}\r\n        :i/add]]])\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n",
