    "body": "I have tried implementing the new chat header and animations, but there are a few problems with it.\r\n\r\nSo first of, I have implemented an `animated-header-list` component in `quo2.components.animated-header-flatlist.view` to be used from communites screen, messages screen and other screens that require this kind of [animation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29354102/222066615-b0afe03e-fe37-4b10-b4cb-0cd4f07071f3.mov).\r\n\r\nLater on, I realized this component won't work for the messages screen as we are using an inverted list. So I tried implementing another one customized for the messages screen, but there are still some issues:\r\n\r\n1. This [design](https://www.figma.com/file/7KIYbhoqNGAIFonE0w9TDz/Messages-for-Mobile?node-id=3720%3A549407&t=chDzAi6bq1490ECj-0) shows that the messages list starts from the top. This wouldn't be possible as we are using an inverted list for messages. It starts from the bottom and grows upwards.\r\n\r\n2. [Animations](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29354102/222066615-b0afe03e-fe37-4b10-b4cb-0cd4f07071f3.mov): Since we are using an inverted list, thus the header is actually the footer, animating the \"header\" that way may not be possible. To animate the header we need to know the starting and ending scroll position (for example: from 0 until the `header-height`). But since what we should actually animate is the footer, we need to precisely know the height of the content of the messages list, which is very dynamic (messages can be added, deleted, reactions can be added, deleted, and more).\r\n\r\n3. Another point, is when there is a chat with 100 messages, the FlatList component won't render all items at the same time, more will be rendered as the user scrolls up, and depending on the device, this can sometimes take a couple of seconds. So as we are scrolling up and about to reach the end of the list, are we going to start animating, or are there more messages to render?\r\n\r\nIf anybody wants to try with this issue feel free to do so. Otherwise if the above issues are valid then probably we would need some redesign.\r\n\r\ncc @cammellos @flexsurfer @status-im/mobile-devs ",

    "body": "@OmarBasem thanks for spotting this issues, this is definitely something that's good to catch early in the development stage.\r\n\r\nI think this looks like something that needs to be looked at by designers.\r\n\r\n1) Yes, that would be an exception on how we display messages, I believe whatsapp does something similar (empty chat starts at the top, and fill in top to bottom, until screen is filled), while discord puts the \"intro\" above the input in an empty chat. Given the limitations of FlatList, I take that it would be best to keep the discord behavior as you pointed out.\r\n\r\nRegarding 2/3, yes, this animation is only displayed when you reach the \"top\" of the chat, i.e you have no more messages to load, since you will rarely see this animation on a chat you use often (you will not be scrolling back to the beginning of history), but you might see it on a new chat, though only if we start from the first unread message, which we currently don't since that's problematic with flat list.\r\n\r\nI'd say that we should hold on for this one until the flat list replacement is ready, and we should probably accommodate something different for now (just keeping the static header seems like the best option for us)\r\n\r\nWhat do you think @pedro-et @John-44 ?",

    "body": "@OmarBasem yep, it's not — I saw that you made it work that way that it's literally a FlatList that contains another (reverted) FlatList as its element. I modified the component though — and I'm currently playing with animations and trying to make them work fine with a reverted FlatList as well. I think you might be right that it all might become problematic when there are a lot of messages in the list and when we need to scroll for a while before we reach the end — except this issue, I don't feel it's too hard to make it work right.\r\n\r\n@John-44 if you have any ideas about scrolling and that issue with messages being loaded once we scroll (which leads to problems with determining if the end of the list is truly the end), feel free to tell. The easiest solution might be to just not show the user details on top if the list is too long.",
