On top of that if one blocks a BrightID verified user for distasteful speech, the offending user cannot come back again and again to disturb the offended user.\r\n\r\n### For upcoming community feature:\r\nThis idea is premature at the time of writing - neither BrightID integration, nor Community feature is out yet.\r\n\r\nbut,\r\n\r\nCommunities could decide to use BrightID sybil-resistant feature to require members of the community to be BrightID verified.
