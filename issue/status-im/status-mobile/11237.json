  "body": "# Goal\n\nWe want a normal status user (on mobile) that has a multiaccount setup on his phone, and that purchases a brand new keycard, to be able to migrate this multiaccount to the keycard\n\n# Problem \n\nThis feature is not offered now. So the only thing the user can currently do his \n- go to his list of multiaccounts \n- try to import a new multiaccount \n- enter the same seed \n\n... and he gets a error message because this seed is already used by the current multiaccount \n\n# Solution \n\nWhat is for sure: \n- the user needs to select which multiaccount he wants to migrate \n- the user needs to enter his seed again, because the root of the multiaccount is not stored on the phone and needs to be stored on the card\n\nThe following need to be decided. \n- (design) where does the flow start ? \n      - logged into the multiaccount in the profile section \n      - or in the list of multiaccounts \n- (technical) can we keep the user's data (messages, accounts) ? \n- design, this will be a succession of screen with the following logic\n      - user chose a multiaccount \n      - he's been prompted about what he's going to do (move his keys to the keycard) and what he needs (a keycard with no secret stored)\n      - (enter his password again ?)\n      - asked to enter his seed again \n      - taken through keycard onboarding (he will get a PIN, PUK, Pairing code if the card is new)",

The scope of this issue is to only move a multiaccount, correct?\r\n\r\nA variation could be a use case where the user does not want to move all accounts, but only a high value account they already have in their multiaccount, e.g. m/44'/60'/0'/0'/1 only) to Keycard. I suspect we'd have no root to derive the chat key in this case. \r\n\r\n",

    "body": "- 1 & 2. - Currently covered. After a review with @johnlea-quiup decided to separate these two cases after all. So no single `Reset` flow, but a separate `Reset password` flow. Where `Reset password` is accessed through settings and `Change profile storage` is accessed through settings or adding the seed of an existing multiaccount.\r\n\r\n\r\n- 3 - Agree, in the UI this should be naturally handled when choosing Keycard storage and tapping an empty card; at least I don't foresee changes to the UI for this case, aside from removing the 'this account already exists' error message\r\n- 4 - This seems like an issue to 'overwrite or wipe Keycard'. I'm not sure if we have an issue documented for this. I think it should be handled separately and in the UI would appear as a `Delete my profile` option under `Privacy and Security` that is currently available for regular accounts\r\n\r\nA case I think should be included is:\r\n\r\n- 5 - Regular -> regular\r\nThe user has lost their password. They're locked out of their regular multiaccount and are trying to regain access to their HD wallet (not db) via seed phrase\r\n\r\nI'll make some more edits and set up a call to discuss",

Can be addressed in a separate issue\r\n\r\n![Sign in - entry to key management](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35233054/99075168-5038a880-25b9-11eb-9c65-a30e598d395e.png)\r\n\r\n- Updated navigation based on design discussions. \r\n     - Designs show native Android behavior, always a `⟵` button top left; no use of Cancel.\r\n     - `⟵` closes Key management\r\n     - `< Previous` goes one step back in Key management\r\n",
