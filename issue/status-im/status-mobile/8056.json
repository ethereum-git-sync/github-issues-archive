    "body": "So current proposal is that when contract is stopped on old client we should:\r\n- block input when not whitelisted? by contact\r\n- show red warning and label on tribute to talk settings (cf figma https://www.figma.com/file/aS1ct66VQ6V0cio7vSqS8UoG/Chat?node-id=4671%3A6)\r\n\r\n@errorists the problem with your figma design for the chat is that you assume we can know that tribute to talk is enabled, the thing is that when the contract is stopped, meaning tribute to talk works in a way that doesn't work with the contract anymore, we can't know so basically we have to show this screen for any of your contacts that has not whitelisted you (meaning you paid or he paid tribute in the past, or that he sent you a contact request).",
