    "body": "@hesterbruikman\r\nI'm working on this bounty and have created the [UI (code pushed to my forked branch)](https://github.com/status-im/status-react/compare/develop...shivekkhurana:shivekkhurana/history-nodes-ui). It:\r\n- Adds new element for disabling mail server\r\n- Converts the Auto selection checkbox to switch\r\n- Filters the servers that are visible depending on auto selection state\r\n\r\nI now need to handle the disable history, which I'm guessing is an API call. Is there any documentation where I can check the API spec? Or any sample code that's already in place? \r\n\r\nThanks \r\n\r\n@errorists \r\nThe new UI looks polished, but there are two issues I faced:\r\n- ~Server selection UI uses radio buttons on the right, but in the current UI radio buttons are on the left . Are you hoping for a global change where radio buttons show up on the right?~ I found an implementation of radio buttons on right side. Will make changes to the UI. \r\n- The Automatic Selection Switch was designed with bold title. However the component available doesn't allow for that (I might be wrong here). I have taken the liberty to adjust the designs, however this is not final and I'm open to implement changes if you suggest:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2020-09-12 at 2 20 48 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1925158/92991742-8dbe7e00-f503-11ea-9e8e-fe046b918e64.png)\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2020-09-12 at 2 20 59 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1925158/92991705-5c45b280-f503-11ea-8af3-093ab1fce8ee.png)\r\n ",

    "body": "Hi @shivekkhurana \r\nthanks for looking at this issue.\r\n\r\n> What is the difference between wakuext_ and shhext_ calls?\r\nThe difference between `wakuext_` and `shhext_` is based on whether you have `waku` or `whisper` enabled.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of this task you probably don't need to call `updateMailservers`, it is only used once you are connected to one and signal to `status-go` that we want to receive message confirmations (I can elaborate on it, but you don't need to be worried about this in this task) from those mailservers.\r\n\r\nEssentially you need to make sure that `connect-to-mailserver` ( https://github.com/status-im/status-react/blob/32cb09c9c68497ce152216067d2e00309baef686/src/status_im/mailserver/core.cljs#L221 ) is never called (or better, is called but noops), if the user has not enabled mailservers.\r\nOnce you do that, it might show some \"connecting...\" dialog as the app expects to be connected to a mailserver, and that's something that should not be shown if the user has not enabled mailservers.\r\n\r\n\r\n> Also, having seen the API, does anyone thinks that renaming to \"Mailserver\" to \"History Nodes\" will create confusion or is everyone okay with incremental renaming?\r\nThis is a hotly debated topic :) I don't have a strong opinion myself, I defer to UX on the call cc @hesterbruikman @errorists \r\n\r\nThis also will require some changes on status-go, as the setting needs to be persisted, I can help you out with that (of course you are free to work on it if you wish), for now you can pick a variable name and just update the re-frame db (similarly to what we do with `syncing-on-mobile-network?` for example).\r\n\r\nHope this is helpful, and ask any question, we're happy to help (you can ping us on discord as well if you want to have a quick chat).",
