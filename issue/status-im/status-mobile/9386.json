  "body": "_Part of #9277 Access a key with Keycard epic (mark as checked there, when closing this issue)_\n\nCurrently, the screen layout is implemented with several bugs.\n\n- The error message should be shown according to Figma. \n- In the current build, the \"wrong passcode\" error message is sometimes shown even if no pairing code has been entered (for instance, when canceling the process, and starting again);\n- The error message should be shown according to Figma. \n- The error message say \"Wrong code\" and select the pairing code, to help users enter a different pairing code without having to manually erase the incorrect one;\n- The layout should be fixed according to Figma. The pairing code is vertically and horizontally centered;\n- The keyboard should never disappear on this screen;\n- There should only be \"Next >\" in the toolbar, no \"< Back\";\n\n- After the incorrect pairing code is erased, the \"Wrong code\" error should disappear. This is especially important on small screens since there the error tooltip might overlap the subheading;\n- On smaller screens, the layout should be similar to seed phrase confirmation in onboarding, see https://github.com/status-im/status-react/issues/9370 for detailed specification;\n\nImage\n<img width=\"1256\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-11-04 at 14 01 36\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3115606/68102027-cf59c200-ff0b-11e9-8f30-27253097d6c0.png\">\n\nFigma: https://www.figma.com/file/dEIljL7UPbXgsZUA0Q4qlE5E/Onboarding?node-id=4540%3A11552",
