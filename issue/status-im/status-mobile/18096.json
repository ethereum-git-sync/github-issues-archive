  "body": "# Bug Report\r\n\r\n\r\n## Problem \r\nNow I can reproduce this issue with only one account which is added as a contact. Probably that's because that account was created on the old version of Status desktop. However this issue is reproducible in each build\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\nDeleted contact is not restored\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Actual behavior\r\nDeleted contact is restored - userDesktop is listed in contacts tab\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\n1. On the first device restore this account: `process fence december tourist trim follow pepper level useless oblige tank defy`, let's call them userDesktop\r\n2. On the second device create a new user, userA\r\n3. UserA adds userDesktop as a contact and userDesktop accepts this contact request\r\n4. UserA performs backup (Profile -> Sync Settings -> Backup Settings -> Perform Backup)\r\n5. UserA removes userDesktop from contacts\r\n6. UserA performs backup once again\r\n7. Remove all the data from the second device and restore userA's account\r\n8. Check contacts list\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n- Status version: nightly \r\n- Operating System: Android, iOS\r\n- The user who should be added as a contact was created on this desktop version: \r\n<img width=\"235\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-12-06 at 15 20 00\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/assets/29711298/cb174bb0-4351-437e-890d-c020aa50b7c8\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Logs\r\n[mobile_user_geth.log.zip](https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/files/13587476/mobile_user_geth.log.zip)\r\n[mobile_user_logcat.log.zip](https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/files/13587478/mobile_user_logcat.log.zip)\r\n\r\n",
