We documented each one of these issues in private gists for the sake of confidentiality (non-disclosure).\r\n\r\nCan you please let us know whether we can share these gists with you? We are eager to evaluate the perception of developers (e.g. severity of these warnings) and improve Status - a Mobile Ethereum Operating System's security, and the quality of the reports of static analysis tools.\r\n\r\n(*) https://github.com/CROSSINGTUD/CryptoAnalysis",
