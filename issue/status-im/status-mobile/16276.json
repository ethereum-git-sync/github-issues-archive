    "body": "Thank @Parveshdhull, seems that was because of i18n which we now use in quo2. I guess we were figuring out what would be best at the time.\r\nAnyway it's a cleaner separation of concerns with the UI aspect for components in quo2. Also these should be created as multiple individual components as seen in the designs and not one large component for all cases. I guess the basic styling structure can be shared across them 👍 ",
