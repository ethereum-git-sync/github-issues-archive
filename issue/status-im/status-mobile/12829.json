  "body": "# Bug Report\r\n\r\n## Problem \r\nSender keeps sending group invites at the interval of 10-30 seconds even after declining\r\nActually in develop it only sends twice, because re-invites yet not supported. But full behavior can be seen in https://github.com/status-im/status-react/pull/12814#issuecomment-971703276\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17097240/142255139-93632e2b-95d3-4e52-8699-29cc955f5999.mp4\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\nThere are two ways to reproduce this issue:\r\n### 1st - In PR (https://github.com/status-im/status-react/pull/12814)\r\nAs this PR supports group re-invites, it can easily reproduce this behavior. It is a little difficult to reproduce in develop\r\nSteps: https://github.com/status-im/status-react/pull/12814#issuecomment-971703276\r\n### 2nd - In Develop\r\nBy default in the develop it is not reproducible, we need to follow these steps\r\n1. clone status-react and modify status-go with this (`Correctly process confirmations` commit)\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"_comment\": \"THIS SHOULD NOT BE EDITED BY HAND.\",\r\n    \"_comment\": \"Instead use: scripts/update-status-go.sh <rev>\",\r\n    \"owner\": \"status-im\",\r\n    \"repo\": \"status-go\",\r\n    \"version\": \"develop\",\r\n    \"commit-sha1\": \"1b9bc4450c8a6382c4ec9243cc800d70eb3c7fdd\",\r\n    \"src-sha256\": \"1cgvasfg6arsdn0vwlncl02wicxpklcvwmw62zc61gwdv6dmfcjr\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n2. create debug app - User A\r\n3. User - B can be anyone status, status-PR, etc.\r\n4. Add both as mutual contacts\r\n5. Send group invite from User A to User B\r\n6. It will be shown on the home screen of User B as both are mutual contacts. Decline invite\r\n7. In 30 seconds or less, a new invite will be shown in the activity center notification of User B.\r\n(further invites will not be shown in the develop as old activity center notification with that chat id is not deleted from SQL table)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n- Status version: develop\r\n- Operating System: Android, iOS\r\n",
