  "body": "### User Story\r\n\r\nAs a user, I want to login with phone biometric sensor so I don't have to type my long very secure password everytime. Also we can have additional security features to catch bad actors and protect accounts from bruteforce.\r\n\r\nThe main thing would be biometric, but I also added some ideas I've seen from other password managers.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n*Type*: Feature\r\n*Summary*: Many phones biometry scans to get rid off passwords. My \"old\" bank can be logged in with my finger scan. To add this feature to status probably we would need an account manager that works outside geth. \r\nAFAIK private app data is secured by phone operational system, and in non rooted phones this data is safe. Who knows if Apple and Google have backdoors? But if it does than geth passwords would be also compromised?\r\nI think biometry support would be nice feature for future, but can it be done using geth account manager? \r\nMaybe we could have an additional account manager that would accept different types of password, and advanced options like: \r\n- biometric support\r\n- destroy accounts data on bruteforce. \r\n- increasing delay on incorrect auth \r\n- screenshot on frontal camera with GPS data of many wrong password attempt stored and send to owner. \r\n- auto-send transaction on too many wrong password attempts (like remove self owner from a multisig or send funds to cold storage)\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\nConfigurable biometric scan so I can pass my finger and it shows available accounts (if just one, login automatically).\r\nIf I pass too many time finger and is wrong, I need to type password.
