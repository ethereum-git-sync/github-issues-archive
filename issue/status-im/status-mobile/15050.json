This means that the media server is available and functional after re-login.\r\n\r\n-when the app is restarted, the media server is also restarted.\r\nI am currently trying to isolate the root cause of this issue by generating PR builds and testing them on my devices.\r\n\r\nThanks to @cammellos and @Samyoul for helping with debugging.\r\nstatus go branch : https://github.com/status-im/status-go/commits/debug/media-server\r\nstatus mobile PR(for builds only) : https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/pull/15061\r\n\r\nWill log more workflows and hypothesis in this issue below.\r\n",
