  "body": "# Problem\r\n\r\nWhen user logs out quickly after login it seems like a lot of things that should be happening after login keep happening after logout.\r\nThe most visible result of that is that if the user types his password in the login screen oftentimes he gets logged in without tapping `log in`.\r\nI have also experience blank screen, crashes and error displayed related to `app-db` being `nil`\r\n\r\n# Implementation\r\n\r\nMake sure delayed events after login aren't affecting the app after quick logout\r\n\r\n# Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\nSuccessions of quick logins and logout shouldn't trigger any of the problems mentioned above\r\n\r\n# Notes\r\n\r\nThe cause of the auto-login seems to be the `node.ready` signal from status-go that callback `accounts.login/login`. The condition being that a password is present in the db (hence the need for the user to type his password but not tapping login). The guard here is insufficient.\r\n\r\n# Future Steps\r\n\r\nThis issue raises again the problem of delayed events that shouldn't happen off-session. If the fix includes a general solution to avoid this class of bug that would be great.",
