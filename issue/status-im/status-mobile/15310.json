Close profile\r\n\r\nMore details on the behavior:\r\n\r\nAt first, UI is completely frozen except for the bottom tabs, but if you click on the wallet tab and then go back to the home screen and tap on the profile many times, the keyboard will open.\r\nAlso, after that, you can click on any button on the community or chat screen (i.e. `Discover` or tabs `Joined`, `Pending`, etc.), after which the BROWSER will open, and after that UI starts working normally again.\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67952253/234538331-914e79f6-b822-4357-9f0d-a06e01016529.mp4",
