  "body": "# Problem\r\n\r\nWe recently merged a PR that mistakenly disabled integration tests due to larger refactors. They have been re-enabled by the merged PR https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/pull/17900.\r\n\r\nRight now the wallet integration tests in `status-im2.integration-test.wallet-test` are failing and were skipped temporarily by 17900 to get it merged. \r\n\r\n## Root cause\r\n\r\nMy best guess is that commit https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/commit/45df308dd0d0e2b3945a70f514dcf5fc5f596abe broke the wallet integration tests because it was merged before I re-enabled integration tests in `develop`.\r\n\r\n## Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\nFix, or re-implement (if they don't make sense anymore) the existing wallet integration tests. Not required as an acceptance criteria, but consider using this issue as an opportunity to improve them.",
