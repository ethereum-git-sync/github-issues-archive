  "body": "# Feature Issue\r\n\r\n### User Story\r\n\r\nAs a user I want to have full information about ENS names. \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThere are some places where ENS names are supported. Such as to make a payment, you can enter an ENS name. However, after the ENS name is resolved it is discarded, leaving only the address. \r\n\r\nThis can be confusing, specially for users unaware of what is ENS. \r\nAlso, it might hide information, as when scanned from QRCode in form of ERC681. \r\n\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\nWhenever an ENS name is entered and resolves some value, the ENS name should be kept being displayed, alongside a representation of the resolved value (e.g. Identicon, Three Word Name).\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nConsider that in future it might be supported as well reversal ENS names, so entering an address could also resolve an ENS name, and not only, but an ENS name could resolve an address that reverse-resolve another ENS name. \r\n\r\nReverse resolution is not implemented yet, but any designs should take in account of that feature, that is exclusive for `address` data type, as probably it will be implemented at some point. \r\n",

    "body": "We need design input on how that information is displayed. From my perspective, any field that accepts `address` type should, by default, resolve ENS name and reverse resolve addresses. \r\n\r\nThe component itself also should be able to handle multiple data, that is:\r\n1. user input: can be an ENS name, or address; \r\n2. the resulting address: always an address type; \r\n3. reverse resolved name: usually null, but sometime an ENS name, that can, or not, be the same as the user input).\r\n\r\nAlso the error state, which happens when input is invalid. \r\n\r\nSomething useful would be to have `identicons` and feature to copy each of the individual data stored on it, when available. \r\n\r\n@errorists What do you think? Can we define an universal field for `ethereum addresses`?  \r\n\r\nExample of such field, in React.js https://github.com/status-im/multisig-dapp/blob/master/app/components/EthAddress.jsx\r\nRunning on the multisig dapp https://status-im.github.io/multisig-dapp/",
