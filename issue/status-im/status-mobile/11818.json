  "body": "# Problem\r\n\r\nThe translation process is a bit rocky at this, as it's not well connected to the development process, which means that we always scramble last moment to add translations. \r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\n1) When sending a PR, we should check that `en.json` has new keys. If that's the case, merging the PR should be blocked unless screenshots are attached. We should provide a way for devs to override this behavior. @jinhojang6 should be tagged in the PR automatically.\r\n2) Once the PR is merged, screenshots and new translations should be uploaded to github.\r\n\r\nAs a bonus, we could have a mode in the app where translation keys are shown aside the actual translation, but that's not necessarily in scope for this.",
