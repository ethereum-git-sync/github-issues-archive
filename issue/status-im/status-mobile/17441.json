  "body": "# Problem\r\n\r\nThere are multiple functions spread all over the codebase with one single purpose: get a profile picture to display. They achieve this goal differently though, and that might lead to bugs or inconsistencies. \r\n\r\nThe one that is used the most is `status-im.contact.core/displayed-photo` and this is how it looks:\r\n```\r\n(defn displayed-photo\r\n  [{:keys [images]}]\r\n  (or (:large images)\r\n      (:thumbnail images)\r\n      (first images)))\r\n```\r\nHere is another one:\r\n```\r\n(defn community-avatar\r\n  [community]\r\n  (let [images (:images community)]\r\n    (when images\r\n      {:uri (:uri (or (:thumbnail images)\r\n                      (:large images)\r\n                      (first images)))})))\r\n```\r\n\r\nNot to say that there are multiple occurencies when just a `:thumbnail` is being used, or we simply iterate over all the images. In other words, it's a mess.\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\nThere shouldn't be a function like `displayed-photo` at all, or at least it shouldn't be exposed and used directly by a client. Everything dedicated to logic on how we display image should be placed in a quo component called `user-avatar` â€” instead of taking an abstract `profile-picture` and a bunch of names it should take a `contact` and deal with how this contact's profile picture should be displayed.\r\n\r\n## Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n- `status-im.contact.core` namespace is removed\r\n- `status-im2.subs.shell/community-avatar` function is removed\r\n- `status-im.ui.screens.chat.photos/photo` is replaced by `quo/user-avatar`\r\n- `:chats/photo-path` sub is removed as well",
