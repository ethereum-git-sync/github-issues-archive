  "body": "_Part of #9264 keycard sign in epic (mark as checked there, when closing this issue)_\n_Replacing https://github.com/status-im/status-react/issues/8180 with this new issue_\n\nThe user should be able to choose not to be asked for the Keycard to sign in all the time. This should be done using the same way currently \"Save password\" feature works, for non-keycard keys in Status.\n\n- The should be a checkbox during sign in. I suggest it to be called. `Don’t ask for the card all the time` with a description below `If you don't want to be asked to tap the card each time you open Status`;\n- If the user checks that checkbox, we should ask to enable biometric sign in for additional security;\n- On iOS \"biometric check\" might be Face ID or Touch ID depending on the device. On Android afaik it's only possible to use fingerprint;\n- This `Don’t ask for the card all the time`  checkbox should be disabled during device-to-card interaction process;\n- There should be a way to disable and re-enable biometric sign in in the settings;\n- If the `Don’t ask for the card all the time` feature is enabled as well as the biometric sign in, the sign in should happen with a biometric check. If it fails, the user should be offered to sign in using the passcode + Keycard tap;\n- If the user unchecks the checkbox, when the biometric has been enabled before, we should show a popup and warn that it will be disabled now;\n- The num pad should have an additional key (Face ID or fingerprint icon)\n- This should work on small screens as well, see https://github.com/status-im/status-react/issues/9353 for additional specifications;\n\n**Checkbox + Enable biometric**\n\n<img width=\"1238\" alt=\"rm1\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3115606/67843114-52f36780-fb36-11e9-8374-83f6db0edcd0.png\">\n\n**SIgn in when biometric is enabled**\n\n<img width=\"1349\" alt=\"rm2\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3115606/67843123-571f8500-fb36-11e9-8970-d11657435b87.png\">\n\n**Disbaling `Don’t ask for the card all the time`**\n\n<img width=\"809\" alt=\"rm3\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3115606/67843126-5b4ba280-fb36-11e9-9f76-de2231239712.png\">\n\nFigma:\nAll the flows are described here, see flows number 6 and 7\nhttps://www.figma.com/file/dEIljL7UPbXgsZUA0Q4qlE5E/Onboarding?node-id=4566%3A12",

Currently we can neither decrypt user's database nor start listening for incoming messages without keycard, so I don't think that it actually makes sense to be able to log into the app without using the keycard. We can store PIN if user doesn't want to enter it, but card will still be needed.\r\n\r\n",
