If so should you send them using the shared secret or pk until the request is confirmed? etc).\r\nI think relying on a message to be delivered to allow communication is something we should avoid if possible, until we know for a fact that whisper/mailserver is reliably sending sending/delivering messages, which given the nature of the protocol might never happen.",
