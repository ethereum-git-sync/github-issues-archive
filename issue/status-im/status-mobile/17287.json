  "body": "# Problem\r\n\r\n`status-mobile` mostly uses the default clj-kondo settings, but we never actually reviewed them to take advantage of other linters or adapted the configuration of the existing ones for our particular needs.\r\n\r\nNow that we configured clj-kondo default fail level to *error* (the default is *warning*), `make lint` doesn't fail anymore on warnings. This gives us the flexibility of being able to enable linters as warnings and gradually fix them. But it also means we need to explicitly raise the levels of the ones we want to cause an error on the CI.\r\n\r\nSome suggestions:\r\n\r\n- Check all linters that are `:off` (there are 24+) and see if any should be enabled to warn/error.\r\n- Review the default settings of each linter and see if we should be more strict or more flexible.\r\n\r\n## Expectations from this issue\r\n\r\n- Linter changes can cause a cascade of refactors, therefore, your goal in this issue is to simply identify and **briefly document the changes we may want to apply, not actually write the code**.\r\n- An alternative to the documentation is to change `.clj-kondo/config.edn`, but leave the settings that would cause breakage commented out, this can be beneficial for others to do the actual work in the future. This can be the best output because then others can review a PR and agree on the suggested changes.\r\n- You may want to enable new linters as warnings, but be aware this can cause an explosion of warnings. It's highly recommended we enable linters one at a time and promptly work on fixing the warnings.\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\n\r\nList of all linters: https://github.com/clj-kondo/clj-kondo/blob/master/doc/linters.md, but keep in mind not all of them are available for us because we're currently using an old version `v2022.10.05`. Check out the correct tag in `clj-kondo` to see the correct documentation.\r\n",
