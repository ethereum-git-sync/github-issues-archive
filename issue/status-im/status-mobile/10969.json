    "body": "> i don't know who is the designer, so i i ask @hesterbruikman and @errorists :) could we also add an icon for imported accounts, similar to watch only? \r\n\r\nGood question @flexsurfer ! It sparked quite the conversation within the design team on how and where to best distinguish different types of accounts and whether they are imported and on a different 'recovery tree'; Also differentiating Keycard for StatusPay. \r\n\r\n@johnlea-quiup has the best overview by now I believe, but it'll take some time to translate to the UI.\r\n\r\n> also many users complain that after creating an account it's not obvious that you need to scroll to reach \"add new account\", so they think its possible to create only one account, so probably we could add \"add account\" item in meu as well ? thanks\r\n\r\nThis is a recurring issue; people get a shock of accounts not visible upon recovery. I strongly feel the solution here is in path scanning on import. Fall out of scope last year, designs [here](https://www.figma.com/file/XUehMnhyD1FGcWzvGz6SXqvh/Wallet?node-id=7353%3A36859). The user shouldn't have to manually add accounts that were derived from the seed",
