  "body": "Working on some updates on the transaction overview modal, I found out that there are some use-cases we are missing.\n\n**Contract interaction**\n\nAt this point, we have just regular **transactions** and **message signing** with a password. What is missing is the **contract interaction** type. It's different because sometimes it does not require sending any funds, but just the network fee (found that use-case in our Teller Network DApp)\n\n<img width=\"1075\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-09-04 at 16 02 20\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3115606/64257107-6ebf0080-cf2d-11e9-9fbb-05b0daccd353.png\">\n\n**Signature request**\n\nIt's important to have a special type of overview for signature requests, because they behave very similar to contract interactions, but do not require any funds to be spent (even no network fee, which is explicitly mentioned in the modal sub-header). It's important to show the account name and the network name if it's not _Mainnet_ as well.\n\nAlso, it's important to separate the overview from signing not only for consistency reasons, but also to make it possible to sign messages with not only the password but with all the signing options we will provide soon.\n\n<img width=\"725\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-09-04 at 16 00 28\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3115606/64256966-243d8400-cf2d-11e9-9a30-99a285f7cc31.png\">\n\n~FIGMA https://www.figma.com/file/XUehMnhyD1FGcWzvGz6SXqvh/Mobile-wallet?node-id=3864%3A33253",

    "body": "Thanks for your input @yenda!\r\n\r\n>support other signing methods in the signing flow (keycard and not only password)\r\n\r\nLet me provide some context for this one. For regular transactions at the moment the flow consists of 3 steps: **Overview** -> **Signing process** -> **Transaction status**.\r\n\r\nSigning with password:\r\n\r\n![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3115606/64542535-694a2780-d32c-11e9-8d05-750ab9a3d89a.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nSigning with Keycard. Here the signing process has two steps of its own:\r\n\r\n![2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3115606/64542567-76671680-d32c-11e9-89c1-15cdf8b2a817.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nSo as you can see, the transaction overview is separated from transaction signing in the UI to make it possible to have any transaction signing method work, for example, this is how sending 10 SNT and signing that transaction with Ledger could look like:\r\n\r\n![3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3115606/64542602-82eb6f00-d32c-11e9-8b55-919e8cfd81b4.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe problem with signature requests is that there was no \"overview\" step so the overview has not been separated from the signing process. This is how the current design of a signature request looks like:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"237\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-09-09 at 17 52 39\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3115606/64541499-a3b2c500-d32a-11e9-91d7-012ac87ff1d8.png\">\r\n\r\nAs you can see,  there's no \"overview\". Besides the fact, that it does not show the user's account name, it's pretty hard to make additional signing options work here since the flow is different.\r\n\r\nWhat I suggest **signing a message with a password** should look like is:\r\n\r\n![4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3115606/64542624-8e3e9a80-d32c-11e9-8093-c046acc3629e.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nAs you can see, here the overview is separated from the signing process, which makes it work and behave just like a regular transaction. This allows us to add any signing options with ease. And it's also a better UX since the structure is the same: Overview -> Signing -> Status.",

    "body": "I agree that this issue is contains multiple elements: transaction signing, message signing, multiple keystore types.\r\nI think that this are both \"two interaction types\" with dapps, because some Dapps use only contract calls, and others uses also ethereum signed messages.\r\n\r\nThere are two types of interactions from \"keystore\":\r\n1. ethereum signed transactions: contract interactions (which would be a transaction with destination and data) or even sending ether to other externally owned account (which would be a transaction with destination and no data)\r\n2. ethereum signed messages: are very like the above, but can sign any message (not only transactions).\r\n\r\nFor 1. I really liked the proposed design by andmirnov with <Show more details> feature for displaying the data being signed by user (important to security).\r\nFor 2. we need the support of EIP191 (and the warning when using unsafe/legacy method)\r\n\r\nThe keystore being used could be any supported, I'd expect an abstraction layer handling the different types of keystores (password,fingerprint,keycard,nano ledger,etc), such as a plugin system, and then each keystore need to implement its own UI for 1. and 2.\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\nRegarding your question, @yenda, yes, the data being signed must be meaningful for the user, and depending in the contract can lead to consequences. How the user can know what they are signing in the ethereum signed message? There should be some better way, that's EIP191.\r\n\r\nIn current v1 we don't even display transaction data, which has the same problem (fixed by the new UI in this issue). For transaction data, we can also discuss how the method will be \"interpreted\" by the UI, but seems like there is shameful solution of using a server from 4byte.directory, which is great as temporary solution, but later try using swarm to lookup the contract metadata, which contains the ABI of contract.
