Sections below)\n_Summary_: If another user shares a URL with me (maybe from a 3rd party app #4605), it would be great if I could see the summary of the content of the URL so I have a quick idea of what it's about.\n\n#### Expected behavior\n[comment]: # (Describe what you expected to happen.)\n\n1. User receives URL\n1. App recognizes URL and uses an unfurlingeloper-blog/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-unfurling-but-were-afraid-to-ask-or-how-to-make-your-e64b4bb9254) library to generate an image (or HTML) content that represents the summary of the URL.\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/138074/40887892-b768e0f4-674f-11e8-9fe4-4a3324814a23.png)\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n\n\n* [ ] Links starting with `http://` or `https://` are unfurled on the receiving client side only for the URLs in the whitelist if enabled\n* [ ] Performance is not noticeably negatively impacted by the new functionality\n* [ ] The whitelist includes https://github.com\n\n### Security implications\nWe have to think about the security implications if we do this on the client side (will it be acceptable to access a random URL which might leak metadata about us?)\n\n",

    "body": "@vkjr @errorists great flow, would like to have fine grained trust/preview settings in a messenger app personally \r\n\r\nThe security/privacy trade off here is weird and complicated. On a high level, previews trade privacy (cause metadata) for security (cause stupid phishing/click jacking is harder). \r\n- Generating the preview and sanitizing on a server is what telegram/twitter does. It's strange, breaks e2e encryption, is centralized... \r\n- Generating the preview on the senders side and rendering only on the receivers side\r\n    - for the sender, this increases privacy but lowers security, as the sender controls the preview generation for a link. Whatsapp does that, and if someone plays around with the preview, [things get nasty](https://www.perimeterx.com/resources/blog/2020/perimeterx-researcher-finds-vulnerability-in-whatsapp/): \r\n    - for the receiver, privacy is not really affected, as the sender generates the preview probably who has already visited the site to get the link \r\n- Generating the preview on the receivers side\r\n    - Trades receiver privacy for security, as above attack is more complicated\r\n    - remains a can of worms, as an attacker gets us to render whatever there is on their site when sending a link. One could target whatever code we use to generate the preview on the receiver side. In absence of solid CSP rules, we should default to not render previews as in the above flow. We give up receiver privacy when a receiver generates the preview, but the above attack is more complicated if the attacker has to craft a site that targets the receiver renderer. \r\n\r\n@vkjr I would totally not make a switch that renders previews for all senders. Instead, I'd add to the above text that opening or rendering links from untrusted/unknown sources poses a security risk. The policy to whitelist previews only for specific domains is great. ",
