Note if user's client is aware that this address is shared with them via showcase, more metadata can be displayed.\r\n\r\nif a WalletConnect QR is scanned --> user enters WalletConnect connect flow\r\n\r\nif a user scanner a QR that is non of the above --> an error should be displayed\r\n```\r\n\r\nCommunities scanning will work like this:\r\n<img width=\"420\" alt=\"Screenshot_2023-11-29_at_00 49 21\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/assets/22799766/e0138876-b3b1-4223-9088-3188c5ac48c7\">\r\n\r\nIf this feature grows too large on initial implementation it is fine to notify and only handle 2/3 differrent types of QR codes provided the underlying code easily allows for extending the other features which we can then add in follow up issues.",
