  "body": "Blocked by #11117 \n\n# Feature Issue\nAdd local notifications for mentions on Android\n\n### User Story\n- As a user I want to receive a local notification when someone mentions me\n- As a user I want to enable/disable receiving notifications for mentions (add notification settings to Notification preferences)\n- As a user I want to be able to enable/disable showing message sender and content in the notification\n- As a user I want to see message sender and content in the notification by default \n- As a user I want to open the relevant chat where someone mentioned me when I tap on the mention notification\ne.g. \n```\nTeenage Mutant Turtle mentioned you\nHey @maciej\n```\n- As a user I want to tap on the local notification to go to the mention inside the chat where the mention was placed\n\n### Description\n\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n- When user is mentioned and has local notifications on Android enabled, mention notification appears when the app is closed\n- User can disable `Show @mentions` in Notification preferences on Android\n- When `Show @mentions is disabled, local notifications are no longer received\n- User can `Hide message content and sender` in Notification preferences on Android\n- When hide content and sender is disabled, notification shows `Someone mentioned you`\n- When tapping on mention notification, app is opened, after log in, chat is opened where user was mentioned\n\n### Notes\n- This feature is blocked by #11117 However, if demand is high upon releasing mentions, effort needs to be reviewed to compare implementing #11117 along with this issue or implementing this issue standalone in the current Java implementation\n- Future issue is to enable push notifications for mentions (and other) on Android",
