My mom would then be able to send an identity challenge to the thief if she thinks something is fishy, and, at least in theory, she would be able to avoid sharing unwanted secrets with the thief.\r\n\r\nI know the above scenario is super edge case for some people, but not here in Brazil. I think there are many other scenarios to justify this feature, **but having said all this, I think the vast majority of users won't care or even know what identity verification even is**.",

The user will be able to mark other users as untrustworthy in the identity verification flow, which is kind of a categorization that the Status app can take advantage of in the future.
