Prepare PR for F-droid build (instruction TBD)\r\n\r\nInstructions are already in place: https://github.com/status-im/status-react/blob/develop/doc/FDROID.md\r\n\r\n### Before publishing\r\n\r\n> 3. Update Draft with release on https://github.com/status-im/status-react/releases (Jakub)\r\n\r\nNot sure what that means. The releases are created automatically by Jenkins. It overwrites them every time the build runs until they stop being drafts. The only thing necessary is to add the link to the post about the release and publish the release.\r\n\r\n### At time of publishing\r\n\r\n> 1. Add release to DO store and update site (Jakub - requires credentials to upload)\r\n\r\nMost of this can be done beforehand, like uploading the builds and pushing the change to https://dev.status.im/ before the final push to prod https://status.im/.\r\n\r\n> 4. validate draft release on github release page https://github.com/status-im/status-react/releases (Jakub)\r\n\r\nThe release can be given the link to the post about it only after marketing pushes it. Other than that everything else should be already in place at the time of publishing.\r\n\r\n>5. update https://github.com/status-im/status-react/blob/develop/RELEASES.md with release notes (make PR based on 1.2. step)\r\n\r\nI think that's quite backward. With this process if someone goes to the release tag, for example:\r\nhttps://github.com/status-im/status-react/tree/1.14.0\r\n\r\nAnd they look inside of the `RELEASES.md` file:\r\nhttps://github.com/status-im/status-react/blob/1.14.0/RELEASES.md\r\n\r\nThey will find no notes related to `1.14.0`, which is just bad. I think the contents of that file should be actively curated as we make changes to the repo. Or rather, the process should be:\r\n\r\n1. Developers make changes in PRs and also always update `CHANGELOG.md` with notable app changes\r\n2. When creating the `release/*` branch the `RELEASES.md` file should be updated based on `CHANGELOG.md`\r\n3. The `develop` branch should also receive changes from `release/*` branch `RELEASES.md` file\r\n\r\nWhat do you think @cammellos ? Would it make sense to maintain a `CHANGELOG.md`?",

    "body": "@jakubgs thank you for reviewing!\r\nUpdated umbrella issue. \r\nAs for `CHANGELOG.md` - agree it would be nice to use, I used this issue just to describe the process as it is, step by step. And ofc it will be changed with improving release process.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs for place to store it - I suggest to make a template here: https://github.com/status-im/status-react/tree/develop/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE and create this issue with every release (will be maintained with person, who will be responsible for current release + me or smbd from test team)\r\n\r\nWDYT?\r\n",
