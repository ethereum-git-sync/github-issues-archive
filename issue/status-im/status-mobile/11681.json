  "body": "# [wallet] Reduce the number of RPC request by inactive users\r\n\r\nSignificant part of our users is more insterested in chat functionality than in wallet, and that means we don't really need to watch their addresses for incoming/outgoing transfers unless we spotted that those users have some activity related to the wallet.\r\n\r\n## How it works currently:\r\n- We check transfers history every 20 mins \r\n\r\n## How it could work:\r\n- When account doesn't have transactions in history we do not check recent transfers unless there is some activity which might lead to new transfers (e.g. user sent transfer request, user shared address, user pulled to refresh tx history). Even if that happened we only schedule check in N minutes (20 currently) and then if we there are no new transactions we stop waching.\r\n- If the last transaction happened 5-7 day ago we can switch to 1h interval instead of 20 minutres. If there was no transfers during past 32 days we can stop watching recent transfers at all.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat would save us shitload of requests but it is hard to estimate how many exactly :)",
