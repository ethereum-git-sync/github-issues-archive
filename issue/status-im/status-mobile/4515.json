  "body": "### User Story\r\n\r\nAs a user I want to have possibility to select tokens I have a positive balance for. Like there is a list of 100 tokens and it is difficult for me to remember how many tokens I bought and which of them especially when I am playing with the app. So if I want to see tokens with positive balance the only way to do this is to go to wallet - send - tap asset.  But i want to have a possibility to sort this out with Wallet - manage assets. \r\n\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\nWhen I want to manage assets I want a feature that allows me to display only assets I have a value > than 0 so I can sort it out quickly.\r\n\r\n#### Actual behavior\r\nIf I want to see tokens with + balance the only way to do this is to go to wallet - send -asset. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n* Status version: nightly may 29\r\n* Operating System: Android, iOS",
