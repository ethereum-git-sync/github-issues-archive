On iOS (testflight version), it's set to 100%.  is this intentional? I can't really work around it, unless there's a reliable way to get the zoom from webkit, which I think you're not supposed to do even if you can?\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n[comment]: # (Describe what you expected to happen.)\r\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/KyleMit/5PFak/ should be the same across iOS and Android\r\n\r\n#### Actual behavior\r\n[comment]: # (Describe what actually happened.)\r\nAndroid webview is zoomed in 200%+\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n[comment]: # (Describe how we can replicate the bug step by step.)\r\n\r\n- Open Status\r\n- browse to http://jsfiddle.net/KyleMit/5PFak/\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n[comment]: # (Please do your best to fill this out.)\r\n* Status version: 0.9.3\r\n[comment]: # (Android or iOS.)\r\n* Operating System: Android",
