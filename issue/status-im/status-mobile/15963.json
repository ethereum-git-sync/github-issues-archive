  "body": "# Problem\r\n\r\nThe last commit of the re-frame library we use is from Mar 7, 2020, version `0.12`, more than 3 years ago. It's working _decently_, so why upgrade?\r\n\r\nre-frame is very stable, but it introduced improvements in 2020 that we're dearly missing. Whatever is in double-quotes below is verbatim text extracted from re-frame's changelog.\r\n\r\n- There are some fixes of course, and very few breaking changes!\r\n- \"Supports `:fx`, which allows for effects to be ordered.\" Mike Thompson explains in more detail the goals and importance of introducing `:fx` https://github.com/day8/re-frame/issues/639#issuecomment-680500053\r\n  - \"You can include the same kind of effect multiple times (eg `:dispatch`) which means there is no longer any need for special effects like `:dispatch-n`. Indeed, all *-n style effects are now redundant. This feature is a stepping stone towards making it easier to create an event handler which is a composition of other functions\". See any similarities with our custom `utils.re-frame/defn` macro and `utils.re-frame/merge` function?\r\n- \"re-frame now guarantees that a :db effect, if present, will be actioned before any other sibling effects.\"\r\n- Support global interceptors. Among other things, useful for logging, global error handlers and inspecting events with a REPL.\r\n- \"Add a new interceptor called unwrap. It decreases the amount of destructuring necessary in an event handler where the event is structured as a 2-vector of [event-id payload-map].\" Great to be added as a global interceptor.\r\n- Syntactic sugar for trivial reg-sub declarations (see https://github.com/day8/re-frame/pull/634)\r\n\r\n## And then?\r\n\r\nOnce re-frame is upgraded, I would like to tackle the re-implementation of `rf/defn` and `rf/merge` to take advantage of `:fx`, and do it in a way that's as compatible as possible with our existing guidelines.\r\n\r\nNotably, I think it would be possible to come up with a solution that's fully lintable by clj-kondo. Right now we need to code without almost any linter help in event handlers, and this is a cost we should not be paying since every little piece of the puzzle is in our hands. Last time I checked, changing clj-kondo to lint `rf/defn` as `defn` correctly found more than 200 warnings. Not to count the cost of refactoring tools that don't work with our current solution.\r\n\r\n## Limitations?\r\n\r\nDo we have any library blocking us from upgrading? cc @flexsurfer, @cammellos, @ulisesmac ",
