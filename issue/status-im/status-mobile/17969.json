Remove < and >)\nMore details to follow.\n\n### User Story\n\n- As a user\n    - When I join a community\n- I want to see the community rules\n- So I don’t get kicked out\n\n![image](https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/assets/5999878/4c1e5f8c-e829-43ff-88b3-9a6c7d19b3d1)\n\n### Description\n\nSummary: This feature focuses on ensuring that users are immediately aware of a community's rules upon joining. When a user joins a community, they should be presented with the community rules in a clear and accessible manner. This initiative is aimed at promoting awareness and understanding of the community guidelines, thereby reducing the likelihood of rule violations and potential removal from the community.\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n- Follow Figma\n- As soon as a user joins a community, the community rules should be prominently displayed.\n\n\n### Technical tasks\n\n- [ ] Create a skeleton behind a toggle so that other devs can start working in parallel\n- [ ] Add community rules view, out of scope: selection of accounts, out of scope: slider if not implemented, a button is fine\n\n\n### Questions\n\nDo rules support markdown? \n\n",
