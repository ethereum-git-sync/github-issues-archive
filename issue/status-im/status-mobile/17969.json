When a user joins a community, they should be presented with the community rules in a clear and accessible manner. This initiative is aimed at promoting awareness and understanding of the community guidelines, thereby reducing the likelihood of rule violations and potential removal from the community.\r\n\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n- Follow Figma\r\n- As soon as a user joins a community, the community rules should be prominently displayed.\r\n",
