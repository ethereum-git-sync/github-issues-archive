I hadn't opened it all day, nor had I received any messages, so this is somewhat unexpected. My battery life has also been much worse ever since I installed Status.\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nStatus should not use very much CPU in the background when nothing is happening.\r\n\r\n#### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nStatus is doing something in the background when the app is not open and no messages are being received that uses a lot of CPU and reduces battery life.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\n- Install Status and run Status on Android\r\n- Use an app like BetterBatteryStats to check how much CPU it is using\r\n- Observe high background CPU usage with no activity\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n- Status version: 1.12.1 (F-Droid)\r\n- Operating System: Android 9 (LineageOS 16)",

    "body": "Yes, default settings. Though I do have it syncing with 1 other device (my desktop). Use mobile data is set to off, though this doesn't really matter in my case since I don't have a data plan and only ever use Wi-Fi.\n\nUse Status nodes is set to enabled. Does this have much of an impact on battery life? I assumed this would only matter when you start Status and fetch old messages. In any case, I don't want to lose messages that were sent when my phone was off or not connected to Wi-Fi.\n\nAlso, I don't think that the built-in Android battery usage estimate is very accurate in this case. Android usually claims that Status only used 3% battery or so after a day, but the real impact seems to be much larger, as shown by BetterBatteryStats and the huge reduction in battery life after installing the app. I think most of the impact comes from preventing the device from entering Deep Sleep. I didn't take a screenshot of this before, but BetterBatteryStats also records the percentage of time spent in different CPU states. The time spent in Deep Sleep as opposed to 650Mhz or 1Ghz seemed to greatly decrease after I installed Status.",
