  "body": "# Problem\r\n\r\nWe render all messages available in a chat, which can slow the UI. \r\n\r\nOne idea is to offload any messages that aren't in the view. If user scrolls back, they can be re-rendered.\r\n\r\nTagging with `v1 release` as this came up in light of some spam tests in dogfooding chat yesterday. But not a hard blocker.\r\n\r\nAndrey's comment:\r\n> morning team, one more thing with spam and with lots of messages from history, all UI getting slow, because we render all messages, but we have a limit of 20 messages to render, and we should keep it when we receive new messages , only user can change this limit by scrolling\r\n\r\nAndrea:\r\n> should we not just offload messages that are not in the view?\r\nif the user scrolls back to present, we offload older messages that are not in the view (with some margin for faster scrolling)\r\nsimilarly if we receive a message that is old (from mailserver), and not in the view, we don't display it",
