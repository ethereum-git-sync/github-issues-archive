Yes, you are correct.

Thank you for helping to find the exact steps!\r\n\r\n### Steps:\r\n1. Create an account (don't set image during onboarding)\r\n2. Perform backup (or use existing user using seed phrase: catch salt eternal clever admit border mirror claw distance bring dwarf zebra)\r\n3. Set image for avatar\r\n4. Remove current account\r\n5. Recover current account\r\n6. Set image during onboarding\r\n7. Check the image showing after onboarding\r\n\r\n### Actual result:\r\nThe image is not fetched after onboarding\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
