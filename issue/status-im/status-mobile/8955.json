    "body": "interesting! :)\r\n\r\nI handeled it differently in #8912 so far\r\n- I made it so that `text` accessory is no longer than 62% of device width. To be precise, I did this\r\n```clojure\r\n(defn accessory-text [width last]\r\n  {:color       colors/gray\r\n   :max-width   (if last (* @width 0.62) (* @width 0.55))\r\n   :line-height 22})\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn that way, I kept it simple, for now.\r\n\r\nRationale is that in the nesting structure in the implementation, it is made such that column containing `title` (includes `title-prefix`, `title-accessory`, `subtitle`, `subtitle accessory`) is supposed to be the `primary` content - the king/queen if you will. Two columns on its side(icon/accessories) are supposed to be `secondary/accessorial/peripheral` if you will. So, `title` has `flex 1` and is supposed to eat up majority of space, which it does on most cases.\r\n\r\nA long accessory taking over the king/queen :) is in that perspective, a misbehavior :)\r\n\r\nWhat I propose is, if there is a long content which wants to be aligned towards accssories, we put it in title. The `black title` goes in `title-prefix`. This facility exists already. We even have `title-color-override` to make it gray instead of default black. What would be needed is conditional 16px left margin on title, and `title alignment` prop. That would achieve the intent of the spec.\r\n\r\nAlso, `title-elipsize-mode`, because `title` has `tail` by default.\r\n\r\nNote: `list-item` as it is implemented does NOT use any `absolute positioning`, `negative margin`, only one case of `transform translateY`(for chat-list unread count badge), `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink` and `flex-basis`. In my opinion, it is best to stay away from those as much as possible.",

    "body": "thanks for commenting @bitsikka I appreciate your in-depth thoughts on this! I like what you're suggesting even if it doesn't match the semantic use of defined props to achieve this goal :) I don't want us to split hair over such a detail, the important bit is to truncate the accessory in the middle (since this way there's less chance the truncation will make recognising the selected choice among multiple others difficult) and block the text accessory from pushing pass this 62% threshold you suggest, so it doesn't force overflow on titles like on the attached screenshots.",
