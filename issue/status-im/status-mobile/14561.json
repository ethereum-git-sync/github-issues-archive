  "body": "# Problem\r\n\r\nFor achieving the desired effect on infinite rings animation we need to chain some animations. Currently we use a `setTimeout` with a timeout value equal to the previous animation duration, but ideally we would want to use `withSequence` method from Reanimated2 (or Reanimated3 if we eventually upgrade React Native and therefore the Reanimated library). This issue is to research how to implement it and refactor that part of the code to use withSequence.\r\n\r\nPR where the code was introduced is #14170 \r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\nOn `record_audio.cljs` quo2 component, replace setTimeout with a sequence of animations using withSequence\r\n\r\n## Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\nRefactor correctly using `withSequence` and don't break the animation :)\r\n",
