    "body": "Notes from [8/5/2018 call](https://notes.status.im/035Hrq-DS7uj7VRbwzxkKA?edit): \r\n\r\n- Keeping signing phrase, not using emoji guard.\r\n- Overview screen can not be edited by the user in first iteration.\r\n- `Cancel` brings user back to the screen where Tx was initiated: from wallet, to the input fields. From DApp, to the screen that launched Tx. From chat, back to chat.\r\n- Confirmation pop-up appears over Tx launch screen (e.g. DApp).\r\n- Token amount can display as `N/A` if the Tx is only for gas.\r\n- New `Data` field will contain other information from the Tx, such as a TtT setting amount. For non-Status contracts, this data will not be human readable. Requires more effort. Power users appreciate seeing it. For Status contracts, we could make the data readable.\r\n- Not using `Wallet` field until we have multi-account.\r\n- Not using the `DApp` field in first iteration. In future, could pull the URL from the browser if Tx was launched there.\r\n- Not including conversion rates in first iteration. In future, must decide how many decimal points to show.\r\n- Passcode / pincode / Keycard sign are all required. First iteration can probably get away with passcode only, as pincode/Keycard are not in production yet.\r\n- QA is concerned about overflow on certain lines, e.g. if translated to different language or long network fee.\r\n\r\nDesign changes needed\r\n- A way to see full recipient address, either in a dedicated field or on a long press.\r\n- Error state in place of confirmation screen, to be used if Tx fails because user does not have enough ETH/token\r\n- Info button/tool tip with copy explaining what signing phrase does\r\n- Slight variation of overview screen required for signing messages that don't have on-chain Tx (e.g. logging in): \"Signing message\" vs. \"Signing transaction\" and only the recipient and signing phrase fields are necessary.\r\n",
