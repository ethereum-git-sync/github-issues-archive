Send command (no token support) (upgrade to API, support for deep linking), so we have disabled `send request` button when currency is set to STT due to this reason\r\n\r\n2. Can't see the token history , this is the problem @goranjovic was trying to resolve however etherscan API blocks us to implement that. \r\n\r\n3. Request disabled for tokens (upgrade to API)\r\n\r\nThose things above are 3 major things that were not achieved however the scope may be reduced as we may hide group chats for MVP ( I am still not sure about that).\r\n\r\n  ",
