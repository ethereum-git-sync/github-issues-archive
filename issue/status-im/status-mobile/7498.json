Remove < and >)\n\n### User Story\n\nAs a user, creator of group chat, I want to be notified that my messages, sent  before accepting invitation to group chat won't be received by user after joining chat.\n\n### Description\n\n*Type*: Bug\n\n*Summary*: when create a group chat you can send  messages that not will be received after joining other users to group chat. So messages between `*User B* has been invited ` and between `*User B* has been joined` will be never received by User B, which is not clear for chat creator.\n\n#### Expected behavior\n`User A` is notified that notifications sent before accepting invitation will be missed by `User B` \n\n#### Actual behavior\nmessages can't be received by `User B` \n\n### Reproduction\n\n- `User A`: Open Status\n- `User A`: add `User B` to contacts\n- `User A`: start a group chat chat with `User B` \n- `User A`: send several messages to group chat\n- `User B`: accept invitation\n\n\n### Additional Information\n[comment]: # (Please do your best to fill this out.)\n* Status version: nightly 13/02/2014\n* Operating System: all\n\n@hesterbruikman  please, take a look when you have a time. What is the best solution for user-chat creator in this case?",

    "body": "Let's not close it yet for now, do the first round of UI updates Gheorghe is working on now, test that PR and get a feel if it's an issue.
