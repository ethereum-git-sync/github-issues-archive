Identify obstacles for F-Droid Inclusion\r\n1. Create issues and prioritize them\r\n1. Submit proposal to be included\r\n\r\n4 (possibly orthogonal/enhancement): Reproducible builds\r\n\r\n## Original issue\r\nJust fyi, I opened an issues on f-droid to ask for inclusion of status (https://gitlab.com/fdroid/rfp/issues/121). I assume this is fine as this in the Todo/on the Readme anyway. (under 'Give me Binaries') This is subject anyway to their system being fine with Gradle and no external/proprietary libraries/jars being included or other issues that would go against their inclusion policy (https://f-droid.org/wiki/page/Inclusion_Policy).",

This is a challenge but it's definitely needed in order to be a trust-minimized OS. Here's the most recent state of deterministic builds: https://github.com/status-im/swarms/blob/master/ideas/282-deterministic-builds.md (though AFAIK not much has happened lately).\r\n\r\nPinging @jakubgs @mandrigin @corpetty @Graeme-Code about this for most recent state.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Looking at https://gitlab.com/fdroid/rfp/issues/121 I don't see determinstic build as requirement, so it might be a slightly orthogonal problem. Scanning inclusion criteria briefly, there might be some stuff re use of Firebase for push notifications (though we explicitly removed analytics package from this). \r\n\r\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/11767950?s=400&v=4\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div><img src=\"https://assets-cdn.github.com/favicon.ico\" height=\"14\"> GitHub</div><div><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/status-im/swarms\">status-im/swarms</a></strong></div><div>Swarm Home.
