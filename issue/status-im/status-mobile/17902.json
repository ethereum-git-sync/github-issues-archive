  "body": "As an example let's take the case when token gated community has set one permission: user should hold 1 STT to become a member.\r\n\r\n**Preconditions:** Mobile user possesses the required amount of 1 STT\r\n\r\n**Steps:**\r\n\r\n1. Admin shares community to Mobile user\r\n2. Mobile user joins the community\r\n3. Mobile user performs transaction so he does not possess the required 1 STT amount anymore\r\n4. See if Mobile user has been kicked from token gated community\r\n\r\n**Actual result:** Mobile user remains community member. He can send and receive messages in the community despite he does not meet permission requirements anymore.\r\n\r\nI have also checked the case when permissions are changed by admin and in this case user is successfully being kicked if he does not meet the new requirements. \r\n\r\n**Expected result:** Mobile user should be kicked out of token gated community as he does not meet permission requirements anymore.\r\n\r\n[mobile_user_logs.zip](https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/files/13350730/mobile_user_logs.zip)\r\n<img width=\"1277\" alt=\"Status Desktop 2023-11-14 16-48-48\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/assets/97245802/614e0444-8fb8-42c3-8f27-e3ebccff3182\">\r\n\r\n![photo_2023-11-14 17 26 33](https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/assets/97245802/4ea3cdc3-45b7-483b-99a8-f5db8875aa0e)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/assets/97245802/10282141-2cb3-4e05-baae-ccd9dcc1d284\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n- Status version: nightly \r\n- Operating System: Android, iOS\r\n\r\n\r\n[comment]: # (Please, add logs/notes if necessary)\r\n\r\n",
