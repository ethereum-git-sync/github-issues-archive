However @cammellos pointed out that this wasn't technically possible at this time, because it would result in too much load being placed on Waku.  This will of course stop being an issue when we have Codex :-)\r\n\r\n@cammellos if this is possible to do from a technical point of view, we would love to add this feature.  ",
