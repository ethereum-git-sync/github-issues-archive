To enhance the user experience we should implement an optimized logic for the counter incrementation.\r\n\r\nThe suggested behavior is as follows: When a 1-1 chat message is sent, the counter will be incremented by 1. However, if another message is sent within 2 minutes of the previous message, the counter will not be incremented, and the 2-minute window will reset. Only when no further messages are received within the subsequent 2 minutes after the most recent message, the counter will increment again upon sending a subsequent message.\r\n\r\nBy implementing this logic, the counter will accurately reflect the number of distinct messaging events rather than incrementing for each individual message sent within a short time frame. This optimization will provide a more meaningful representation of chat activity while avoiding unnecessary counter increments and reducing visual clutter.\r\n",
