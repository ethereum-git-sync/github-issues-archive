    "body": "This came up during Devcon drinks.\r\n\r\n> Sending of funds to a list of contacts from the wallet\r\n\r\n@jacqueswww and @gravityblast had some thoughts on how this can easily be achieved, essentially it amounts to signing (in the general cryptographic sense, not with eth) the transaction (all cryptographic key requirements are already met). We can also easily default to the first \"hot\" wallet (and later extend to being able to rotate the use of this), which then leads to \"tipping wallets\" (kudos etc), where you don't need to sign transactions for small amounts, something that the multiaccounts spec enable AFAIK.\r\n\r\nThis is a primary use case of Status - to send funds to contacts - so if we can do this in a simple way for v1 that'd be very useful.\r\n\r\nEDIT: To enable this a user can just include a hot tipping address in the contact request, for example",

I think I might have simple suggestion to solve this:\r\n- The client (of the receiver) maintains the list of shared addresses already.\r\n- Additionally the the client of the sender maintains a list of shared addresses for contacts, that was already received.\r\n- Every sending of a transaction to contact should follow the request contact's shared address protocol, but as part of the protocol one adds \"existing_address\" which contains the address I have for contact being sent to. \r\n- If the address differs follow normal approval process, as shown as the designs.\r\n- If the address is the same one can just send an Acknowledgement, this can be automatic.\r\n\r\nHaving this flow, allows the requesting option to only occurs when the addresses you have for a contact differs.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "I absolutely love the designs @errorists.\r\n \r\n@yenda if you're content to own this one, I'd like to hear your reaction to the UI. \r\n\r\nThis is a bigger item than I realized - and thus I want to recommend considering a leaner MVP for v1. Per @oskarth's suggestion, we could simply use the main hot wallet (the default) and leave the choice to select one to a future version. \r\n\r\nI would certainly suggest we leave out the option to change the shared address, for now. You _might_ want the option to revoke, but once an address is known, it's known.\r\n\r\nThese are the stories we have in the designs, as I can see:\r\n\r\nPROFILE \r\n- User A elects to share wallet with User B. User A chooses which wallet to share.\r\n- User A requests User B to share wallet with User A. \r\n- User A awaits wallet sharing from User B (pending state).\r\n\r\nCHAT\r\n- User B receives a request to share wallet from User A. \r\n- User B approves and chooses which wallet to share. User A is notified.\r\n- User B declines. User A is notified. \r\n\r\nThat's a pretty decent scope..!\r\n\r\nFor a simpler alternative: could we use the command UI to enable User A to send their default wallet info, or to request User B's default wallet info, and contain the whole interaction there @errorists ? It might even be trivial to include the option to select a wallet at that point, using this bottom sheet + logic we implemented for DApps.\r\n\r\nWe want to bring back the command UI for SNT distribution in the #welcome chat anyway, so just thinking about what's most efficient and how we can optimize for time/effort from here to v1 :) ",

At Devcon someone demoed it with much excitement and I didn't dare tell him that he'd better not update if he wants to keep that feature.\r\n\r\nAs I also supported leaving it out of V1 in favor of having the basics of Onboarding, Keycard and multiple key management in place (next to the many issues we found with the CLI), I totally understand the low priority, but I think we need to be prepared for some fallout as people might be caught by surprise of no longer having their favorite feature.\r\n\r\n[UPDATE: this would still require sharing a default wallet address, probably not the best idea]\r\n**An alternative (not sure if we already have it) is to forego proof of ownership for V1 altogether and bring back the CLI in development mode only.** Marking it as experimental, un-audited feature.\r\n\r\n\r\nFindings from testing the GUI commands variation ([Aug 2018](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10qb5jRXwRT9lYkxrn8Ui5Bov_JRuf1WBaPqSXd0ZAtY/edit#slide=id.g3f411e60e9_0_85)) \r\n> 6.1 People can successfully complete transactions using the new chat command design\r\nAll participants were able to complete a transaction using the Command designs.

    "body": "Jumping in here to give my 0.02c\r\n\r\nFrom a marketing and community perspective, removing chat commands and any sort of ability to send tokens via chat is a pretty big issue.  To Hesters point, this is one of the favorite features of many people. Not only does it provide a really cool way to onborad new users into Status, it also depicts the power of Status and the cohesive ecosystem we have created inside of a single app. \r\n\r\nIt is kind of the \"magic of Status\" if you will, while we build out other features. \r\n\r\nAlso - marketing and community teams have plans to incentivize new people into Status with some SNT sent directly in chat. Once again, it provides such an \"aha\" moment for new users. We are running paid campaigns with partners in which we will invite them to join a public channel, introduce themselves, and then someone from our team will send them some tokens via the command.\r\n\r\nEven if it is not a great UX (I agree with that), it is more important for us to be able to onboard new people seamlessly with some SNT than it is for them to be able to navigate this feature for their own use with friends (selfishly speaking)\r\n\r\nFinally, we really need to get SNT into the users wallet so they can explore the app further (stickers, ENS name, Dapp curation, etc). Sending direct via chat command is a sure fire way for the marketing team to do this. \r\n\r\nPlease, please, pretty please, do not remove chat command for v1",

Are you on board with that @yenda?\r\n\r\n_And_ re-enable chat commands in production. Either exactly as they are, or perhaps with an MVP improvement, such as an icon update to increase discoverability. Do you want to suggest something for that @errorists?\r\n\r\nThe scope of this issue is then 1) the technical task for proof of ownership; 2) UI for proof of ownership. Dev team please let me know if you think we should split it.",
