  "body": "# Problem\r\nBoth iOS and Android Status app currently includes the ability to grab screenshots. On Android this ability is disabled by default, but an option is provided to enable. On iOS there is no setting to enable/disable screenshots (only 'Hide previews' when moving between apps).\r\n\r\nThere is always the option to grab another phone or a Nightly or Develop build. However, the option to enable screenshots on Android and the ability to grab screenshots on iOS increases the threat for message senders.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n- Design input needed to prompt a dialog when a screenshot is attempted\r\n- iOS needs further investigation. Supposedly blocking screenshots is not possible on iOS. An alternative could be to detect, warn and possibly hide the screen the user is attempting to take a screenshot of. \r\n\r\n## Acceptance Criteria\r\n- Screenshots and recordings are disabled on Android Play store/App store release\r\n- No option is provided in settings to enable Screenshots (and/or recordings) on Android Play store/App store release\r\n\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\nScreenshots should be possible in PR and Nightly builds for development purposes. See #11323 \r\n\r\n",

The action of tapping to enter the chat with USER A would automatically switch the screenshot state for USER B from enabled > disabled.\n4. Exiting the chat would revert the change.\n\nThe action to change state should only effect users who have manually enabled screenshots.  \n\n2b. For group chats, ~~if any one member has screenshots disabled, screenshots are disabled for all users when the conversation is in the foreground. ~~\n\nFor group and community chats, the admin should set this.\n\nBasically, tapping to open the chat would \"set screenshot toggle to off\" (if previously on).\nBacking out of the chat would revert to previous manually set setting. \n\nCheers\nüçª ",
