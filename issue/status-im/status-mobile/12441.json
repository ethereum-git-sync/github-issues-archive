This isn't what you would expect compared to any other chat application.\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n* `Enter` sends the messages\r\n* `Shift+Enter` adds new line\r\n\r\n#### Actual behavior\r\n* `Enter` adds new line\r\n* `Shift+Enter` adds new line\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n- Status version: Release `1.15.0` \r\n- Operating System: Android",

    "body": "I tried to introduce some quick fix for this issue, but no luck.\r\n\r\nWe can detect that virtual keyboard is not used by subscribing to `keyboardWillShow`/`keyboardWillHide` and then change input's `blurOnSubmit=true` and set handler for `onSubmitEditing`. \r\nIt would even look like a fix until you will actually try to add a newline by pressing something like shift+enter. There is no way to say that shift was pressed using RN's api, so it would just submit the input. Also input will be blurred.\r\n\r\nTo fix it we would need to use some lib for `shift` pressing detection and also find a workaround to focus input after submitting it. ",
