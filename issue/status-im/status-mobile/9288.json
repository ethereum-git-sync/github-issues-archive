  "body": "# Problem\r\nWe use a 'snackbar' (i.e. notification bar) to indicate the client's connectivity status. On spotty networks the snackbar changes states every few milliseconds and makes the app appear glitchy (i.e. bar is visually perceived as 'flicker').\r\n\r\nThe bar has the following states:\r\n\r\n- Connecting\r\n- Offline\r\n- Connected\r\n\r\nThe snackbar is used in combination with the blue 'nightrider' when connected that indicates 'fetching messages'. When the green connection bar appears, it is sometimes shown at the same time as the fetching messages bar.\r\n\r\nClick each button in this prototype to view the behavior: https://framer.cloud/MsLgV/\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\nThe best solution to remove the glitchy appearance is still to be specified, but it [mostly has to do with](https://github.com/status-im/status-react/issues/9288#issuecomment-557576337): \r\n\r\n• adding delays when we consider a change of state permanent,\r\n• being more lax and forgiving\r\n• smoothing the animation so it doesn't drop frames,\r\n• forcing the state to be persistent for at least ~1000ms so it doesn't blink,\r\n• only saying that you're Online after being Offline for a prolonged period, not every time we wake the app.\r\n\r\n#### Other ideas\r\n- Seperate the logic of when the client is considered 'connected' from the immediate display of the snackbar. E.g. if the connection remains for ca. 1000ms show snackbar\r\n- Introduce an 'Unstable network' state or stay offline if connection is lost more than x times within a given period.\r\n- Introduce dependency between blue nightrider and snackbar to ensure they do not appear at the same time. \r\n- We may want to change the definition of connectivity. \r\n\r\n## Acceptance Criteria\r\nThe basic requirement of this issue is UI smoothing.\r\n\r\nWhen on a spotty network, the snackbar showing connectivity status shouldn't change as frequently as it does now, but still inform users of whether or not they are able to send and receive messages.\r\n\r\nPlease force an uninterrupted display of a state for 1000ms.\r\n\r\nSnackbar and nightrider never appear at the same time. Snackbar takes precedence over nightrider. User will only see the nightrider if definitively _online_ and collecting messages.\r\n\r\nPlease also prevent the snackbar from displaying each time the user wakes the app from background. It's gratuitous, unless the app is having trouble connecting and remains _offline_ for some reasonable amount of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\nFeel free to propose additional solutions, we're not sure on the best approach here.\r\n\r\n## Future Steps\r\nTest on spotty network\r\nConsider reintroducing the snackbar to the Wallet depending on latest loading state indicators (https://github.com/status-im/status-react/issues/8443#issuecomment-539045418)\r\n",

    "body": "Yes, I meant this is for a sensible engineer person to do a sensible implementation of the snackbar.\r\nI can't prescribe the exact formula for that, but it mostly has to do with: \r\n• adding delays when we consider a change of state permanent, \r\n• being more lax and forgiving\r\n• smoothing the animation so it doesn't drop frames, \r\n• forcing the state to be persistent for at least ~1000ms so it doesn't blink,\r\n• only saying that you're Online after being Offline for a prolonged period, not every time we wake the app.\r\n\r\nYes, the Knight Rider is meant to be shown when chat data is being loaded and should be used solo. \r\nCorrect, snackbar should take precedence as it is a prerequisite to be online for the Knight Rider to appear.\r\nKnight Rider shouldn't drop frames, I know easier said than do :) \r\n\r\n@rachelhamlin I think the appearance in these mockups matches the one we have currently?\r\n\r\nThis might require multiple attempts to nail the exact behaviour, that's fine! 🙏 ",
