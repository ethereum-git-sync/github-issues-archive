  "body": "Relates to recovery #8687\r\n\r\n**Problem** \r\n\r\nA user can now recover a multiaccount on the phone or on a keycard.\r\n\r\nFor a given phone, a user can be in a situation where:\r\n- he has a multiaccount stored on keycard \r\n- then he tries to recover the same multiaccount on the phone \r\n\r\nand the other way around: \r\n- he has a multiaccount stored on phone \r\n- then he tries to recover the same multiaccount on keycard\r\n\r\nThis situation does not make sense from a usage and security point of view. It defeats the purpose of Keycard. \r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\n\r\nAt recovery stage, prevent the user to recover a multiaccount already in his list. \r\n\r\n**Next step**\r\n\r\nDesign error messages and/or indication we want to provide to the user\r\n\r\nThe simplest thing to do is to just prevent it\r\n\r\nWe can also explain to the user what's going on and guide him through next steps depending on its intent:\r\n- if he had a keycard based multiaccount and wants to manage it without keycard, he must first reset his keycard multiaccount which is part of the settings for a keycard multiaccount. This deletes the multiaccount. https://github.com/status-im/status-react/pull/7937\r\n- if he has a non-keycard based multiaccount. The user could either delete his multiaccount (does it exist in the UI ?) or use a \"Migrate to Keycard\" feature for non-Keycard multiaccount (it does not exist yet - but is in our backlog) \r\n\r\nQuestion: can a user delete his non keycard multiaccount ?\r\n\r\ncc @hesterbruikman @asemiankevich @dmitryn \r\n",

    "body": "When it comes to implementation it looks like this indeed relies on the option to Remove a non-keycard multiaccount which as @dmitryn added we don't support yet. Could this be an item for the Keycard backlog?\r\n\r\nLike the idea of what we can offer when we detect a multiaccount is being recovered that already exists. We probably want to **communicate the account already exists** and **offer to change storage**. \r\n\r\nI imagine this situation can occur in the following use cases:\r\n- user mixed up seed phrases and actually didn't want to 'duplicate' the account (I sure have more than enough lying around....)\r\n- user actually wants to select storage (in which case we probably want to offer this through the Account info screen and have recovery be a second entry point https://www.figma.com/file/XUehMnhyD1FGcWzvGz6SXqvh/Mobile-wallet?node-id=2559%3A33433\r\n- user wants to use the account with Keycard, but also wants to sign transactions with passcode alone. I can totally see this need becoming a thing once Keycard can be used at a POS and with Apple Card introducing this pay with/without card concept. \r\n\r\nI understand the last use case is what we want to prevent because it defeates the security of Keycard. Still, I would say we probably want to look for ways to accommodate, e.g. by allowing the the account on both Phone and Keycard, With transactions on the phone having a transaction limit.",

    "body": "@hesterbruikman @guylouis @dmitryn @corpetty \r\n> i. if the multiaccount on the phone is a keycard one than display \"You can't recover this key since it's already on this phone. If you want to use this key without a Keycard then first remove it in Keycard>Settings>Reset, and then recover it\"\r\n\r\nWhat if user forgot password or lost their card and still wants to use the app? I would suggest that we show an option to restore account but with removing all sensitive data (like chat history, contacts) if we consider that this data is sensitive. If user knows mnemonic they have control over acc anyway. **Prohibition of recovering here doesn't really make sense as user still can re-install app and recover account without keycard.** It will be inconvenient and annoying, but still doable. \r\n\r\nAlso there are at least four different scenarios related to this \"recover existing account\" thing, lets say keycard is KCA and on-device account is ODA, we have:\r\n- KCA -> KCA\r\n- KCA -> ODA\r\n- ODA -> KCA\r\n- ODA -> ODA\r\n\r\nIn each case it might be acceptable to allow the user to restore the existing account, although it is still a question if we can give access to accountэы data stored on the device. I think that it has to be removed before restoring, but probably I'm missing something.\r\n\r\n\r\n## The way how it works currently:\r\n1. KCA -> KCA\r\n- right after restoring acc the list of chats is empty (even if it wasn't :) )\r\n- after re-login with a new keycard with restored acc the user can see the chats list with all history and stuff **(i can’t check if the old card is still working fine with that acc, because i have only one card already)**\r\n\r\nSo my concern here is that we actually allow user to use a different card and get access to all data already existing on the device, when he hasn't provided neither old card nor password used before with this account. @yenda mentioned on discord that this is not an issue, but I'm not convinced yet. Though even if providing access to data is fine, we have to fix broken state after restoring, because everything works as expected only after-re-login.\r\n\r\n2. KCA -> ODA\r\n- we create a separate account **definitely an issue**\r\n\r\nimo we can allow this if user lost access to their card, but we need to make sure that no extra data I leaked.\r\n\r\n3.  ODA -> KCA\r\nBasically same as **2.**. We also can propose user to move account to keycard (when such option will be implemented), but user would need to enter their password before doing this. \r\n\r\n4. ODA -> ODA\r\n- we open account with broken state\r\n- when user logins next time they need to enter the old password. A new one is not applied in any way.\r\n\r\nAgain, if user really wants to restore their acc, we should allow this (here it literally means changing password). But, no old password - no data.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "My suggestion on what we need now (v1) and a way forward:\r\n\r\n**NOW (v1)** the goal is to limit at the maximum the amount of work, while preserving our principles\r\n- we need to be able to remove a account from a keycard (it's a user right to control his secrets since he owns them, if he wants to delete it from this piece of hardware we have to allow him). I suggest that when the user does that, we remove the account on the phone too. Anyway, unless the user has a copy of its keycard, he cannot access it anymore. This issue is listed here #9229 \r\n- there is no way to remove a ODA \r\n\r\nso it gives:\r\nKCA->KCA: a user has lost his keycard and wants to create and wants to use his account again with a new keycard. The only thing he can do is to delete status, and start fresh with another card with his mnemonic\r\nODA->ODA: a user has lost his password on a ODA and wants to use his account. Not possible or the user needs to delete status totally and start fresh\r\nKCA->ODA: a user is using a keycard but is fed-up and wants to use his account without keycard. User resets his keycard (needs #9229 to be implemented) and imports a new account with its mnemonic. Here there is no security issue since the previous account is deleted. \r\nODA->KCA: a user has a ODA buuys a keycard and wants to use his account with keycard. Not possible or user needs to delete status totally and start fresh\r\n\r\n**AFTER V1**\r\nWe need UX team onboard to design the experience\r\n\r\nA simple experience would be:m\r\nKCA->KCA if user loses his card, he should be able to remove his account, and import it again from the mnemonic\r\nODA->ODA if user loses his ODA password, he could remove his ODA and import it again with the mnemonic. His data history could be retrieved if we implement database persistence. OR we need to implement a feature to recover a lost password of an ODA with the mnemonic. \r\nKCA-> ODA same as now\r\nODA->KCA we can design an experience to the user to help him migrate his ODA to a keycard. This is issue #7134 (post v1)",
