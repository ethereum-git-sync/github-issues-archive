    "body": "Hi @churik are we sure we want that behaviour (user avatar always at the very beginning of the chat history) ?\r\nAs the current user status is displayed in the user avatar and the current user status is something which can be changed and user would want to communicate that to other, it would be very hard for him to actually do that in chat with let's say 1000 old messages - nobody would see the user avatar and his/her actual status unless scrolling to the very top of the conversation, quite impractical.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion the whole idea of displaying User avatar + status as a normal message in stream with all others is wrong - we would ideally want that information to be always available to the user when he is typing/scrolling/looking at the chat, so it should be pinned to one place, but let's have @andmironov have a final word about that :)\r\n",

    "body": "@andmironov the question is more about the situation when we have many messages in chat (message history spans several days). We can then do some choices:\r\n1. (Current behavior) Always pin user message (with his/her photo & current status) to the last message group (current day messages) - this makes sense from the usability view, as whenever recipient wants to look-up current status (expression of mood) of the sender, he just needs to scroll over today's messages and he/she can see it. On the other hand, it's quite disrupting from the visual point of view and feels weird.  \r\n2. Always pin the user message to the oldest message group in the chat, so it's effectively always the first message in the chat - it doesn't look that weird, but in any longer conversation (say conversation spanning multiple weeks/months), the ability to look-up status of the sender is virtually lost for the recipient - he/she would have to scroll to the very first message in the chat to see it, not fun.\r\n3. Get rid of the user message with photo and chat altogether and find some other place where to show sender status so it's always pinned on the screen no matter how the recipient scroll through the messages - user name & photo are already displayed in the status bar, so we just need to find some place for the user status :)",
