    "body": "> Should all the links to `join.status.im` be replaced with `status.app`? If yes then there is this one: #16821\r\n\r\n@alwx there is much more than simply changing the domain needed to support the new link format. I recommend speaking to @felicio from the web team who designed the new link format and also recommended reviewing the specification for the new link format. The link format is for three types of URLs: link to user, link to a community, link to a channel inside a community.\r\n\r\nDesktop team should have already implemented backend to support new link format in status-go, speak to @jrainville for more details.\r\n\r\nThe old link format should be removed for everywhere, any time a user copies or shares a link to a user, community or channel they should be sharing the new link format. Any input field that accepts a user or community public key should also accept a new format URL.\r\n\r\ncc @siddarthkay",

The User, Community, and Channel web preview pages using the status.app domain are all working as well, again currently behind basic authentication. Contact Web team to get the credentials so you can test. Replacing the old share URLs in the mobile app with the new status.app share URLs (that user a new very different link format) is a high priority item.",
