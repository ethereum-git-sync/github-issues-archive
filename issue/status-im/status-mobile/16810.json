Fix bugs, both functional and UX fit-and-finish defects.**  \r\n\r\n- Great progress during 1.25 on fixing UX fit-and-finish defects :-)  Let's aim to close all issue tagged \"E:Design Feedback 1.24\" by the end of this cycle.\r\n\r\n- Test all Communities functionality using the Public Test Community that will feature all types of token gating that Iuri is going to set up.  \r\n\r\n- Test how Status Mobile responds to community admin changes are made in Status Desktop e.g. when a channel is added or deleted or renamed, is the correctly reflected in Status Mobile?  Are changes to Community meta info like name and banner image correctly reflected in Status Mobile?  Etc, etc...\r\n\r\n- We need to get our quality bar to where we want it to be, and then keep tech. debt at a roughly fixed level as we build out any additional functionality.\r\n\r\n- Going forward, as much as is sensible, all new functionality should meet the higher quality bar we are aiming for before landing.\r\n\r\n**4.

If yes then there is this one: #16821\r\n\r\n@alwx there is much more than simply changing the domain needed to support the new link format. I recommend speaking to @felicio from the web team who designed the new link format and also recommended reviewing the specification for the new link format. The link format is for three types of URLs: link to user, link to a community, link to a channel inside a community.\r\n\r\nDesktop team should have already implemented backend to support new link format in status-go, speak to @jrainville for more details.\r\n\r\nThe old link format should be removed for everywhere, any time a user copies or shares a link to a user, community or channel they should be sharing the new link format. Any input field that accepts a user or community public key should also accept a new format URL.\r\n\r\ncc @siddarthkay",

    "body": "> @John-44 it literally updates to `status.app` everywhere so that `status.im` is no longer used throughout the app. I guess that's exactly what's needed.\r\n\r\n@alwx no, there is a lot lot more to it than just changing the domain.  See my comment from two weeks ago here https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/issues/16810#issuecomment-1659210831\r\n\r\nAlso the new URLs that are generated after your PR need to be tested! As mentioned in my message here https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/issues/16810#issuecomment-1676454610 you need to ask the web team for the basic authentication credentials so that you can test that the URLs being generated work correctly with the new web onboarding pages they have built.  Testing with the new web pages would have shown that just changing the domain from status.im to status.app doesn't work.  \r\n\r\nYou also really need to organize a call with @felicio from the web team so he can talk you through the new URL format specification.  Folks from desktop team can help, but @felicio designed the new URL format so he is the best person to give you a first overview.  @felicio has also written a specification somewhere, but I can't find a link to it.\r\n\r\nNote that the new 'Status share URL format' applies to three different types of links:\r\n\r\n- Links to Status Users\r\n\r\n- Links to Status Communities\r\n\r\n- Links to a specific channel inside a Status Community.\r\n\r\nAll of these need to be updated to the new format as part of this work item.\r\n\r\nEnsuring that all input fields that accept User chat keys and/or Community pub keys *also* accept the new format URLs is also part of this work item (as previously mentioned here https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/issues/16810#issuecomment-1659210831 )\r\n\r\nThanks!
