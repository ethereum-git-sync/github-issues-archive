SectionList actually uses FlatList under the hood to create sections. We need to modify the data and render method to create sections ourselves. Or better, we can make a reusable gesture section list component that uses the same API as SectionList.\r\n3. Hmm..\r\n4. Can you elaborate?\r\n5. That would be great\r\n6.

    "body": "@flexsurfer to fix the issues 1, 3 and 4, the backdrop component would have to be separated from the `bottom-sheet-screen` component. It would have to be displayed as an overlay on top of the current content, then the modal screen opens. I tried using `show-overlay` from RNN, but it seems it will render the backdrop on top of everything. I tried to play with the z-index but it did not work. So probably the backdrop would have to be displayed as an overlay in another way.",
