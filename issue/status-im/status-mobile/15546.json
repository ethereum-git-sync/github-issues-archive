SectionList actually uses FlatList under the hood to create sections. We need to modify the data and render method to create sections ourselves. Or better, we can make a reusable gesture section list component that uses the same API as SectionList.\r\n3. Hmm..\r\n4. Can you elaborate?\r\n5. That would be great\r\n6. Not sure what is this referring to",
