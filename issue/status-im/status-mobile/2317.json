Remove < and >)\r\n\r\n### User Story\r\n\r\nAs a user (status recipient in Discover)  I only want to receive the most recent and accurate statuses from my contacts and other participants in the network.\r\nAs a user (status author) I want to be able to overwrite my current status at any time by creating a new one that will replace it in all nodes it eventually reaches.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n[comment]: # (Feature or Bug? i.e Type: Bug)\r\n*Type*: Bug\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n1. User A writes a status S1 with a hashtag \r\n2. His contacts and and their contacts see S1 in Discover\r\n3. User A writes another status S2 - also with a hashtag\r\n4. All of his contacts and their contacts eventually see S2, but don't see S1 any more\r\n\r\n#### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n1. User A writes a status S1 with a hashtag \r\n2. His contacts and and their contacts see S1 in Discover\r\n3. User A writes another status S2 - also with a hashtag\r\n4. All of his contacts and their contacts eventually see S2, but also see S1 in Discover\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n[comment]: # (Please summarise the solution and provide a task list on what needs to be fixed.)\r\n*Summary*:  Basically, whenever any account receives a new status from a user, that status should be saved in the discoveries, but any previous statuses from the same user should be removed.\r\n\r\n* Status version: ...\r\n[comment]: # (Android or iOS.)\r\n* Operating System: both\r\n",
