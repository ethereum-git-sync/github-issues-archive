  "body": "[comment]: # (Please replace ... with your information. Remove < and >)\r\n\r\n### User Story\r\n\r\nAs a developper, I want to the app-db to only keep the necessary keys when switching from one account to another, preventing bugs such as https://github.com/status-im/status-react/issues/1778 easily. \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n*Type*: Bug\r\n\r\n\r\n*Summary*: ...\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\nThe app-db should be empty when switching accounts except for a whitelist of fields. \r\n\r\n#### Actual behavior\r\nThe current behavior is \"failing open\" as opposed to \"failing closed\", keys added in account A to app-db will be included in the account B app-db when switching, as opposed to being excluded by default.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n[comment]: # (Please summarise the solution and provide a task list on what needs to be fixed.)\r\n*Summary*: \r\n\r\nThe current flow of event when switching account is the following:\r\n- `[:open-login]` event is called\r\n- `[:navigate-to :login]` event is called\r\n- `[:loggin account]` is dispatched when user selects account with login fx\r\n- `[:login-handler]` is dispatched by login fx which calls change-account fx (switching the realm db)\r\n- `[:change-account-handler]` is dispatched by change-account fx and dispatches `[:set-current-account]` and `[:initialize-account]`\r\n- `[:intialize-account-db]` is dispatched by `[:initialize-account]` among many other events\r\n\r\nThe problem is that initialize-account takes the current db and assoc/dissoc some fields to it instead of using a `fresh` app-db and initializing it. This would probably imply some changes in the ordering of events as the realm db needs to be part of the initialized db.\r\n\r\nThere is already a initialize-db event which is called when initializing the app or creating a new account.",
