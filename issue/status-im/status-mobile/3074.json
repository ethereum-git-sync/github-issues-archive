  "body": "This bounty has 2 requirements:\r\n\r\n1. `./merge-external-pr.sh REPO_URL BRANCH` doesn't work (it seems like it is trying to do the push on the upstream repository). Passing in only the number of the PR does, so clean up the script to only expect that single argument so it is clearer for everyone.\r\n\r\n2. Combine the `merge-pr.sh` and `merge-external-pr.sh` scripts, based primarily on the `external` one as it is better and clearer. This requires keeping the same checks for making sure that PRs from external contributors are verified signed by core team members and that PRs from core team members themselves are correctly signed by the developer in question. \r\n\r\nWe are having issues checking that PRs from core team members are squashed to single commits, see [here](https://github.com/status-im/status-react/issues/3075) for ref - so make sure the same check currently working for external PRs works for ones from core team members.\r\n\r\nThe desired interface is thus: `./scripts/merge-pr.sh <PR-ID>`, which should work regardless of where the PR is hosted or if it is signed or not.\r\n\r\n",

Thanks in advance for review/comments :)\r\n\r\nI am making the following assumption in this PR:\r\n - This script will only be run by core devs who have been allowed access to external forks using the `maintainer_can_modify` ('allow edits from maintainers') rule when enabled. If this isn't the case, under which circumstances will devs without write access to upstream use this script?\r\n\r\nI think I need the following clarifications to know if this is working as intended:\r\n - It seems like merge-pr.sh handles just a subset of the cases that merge-external-pr.sh, so I don't need to borrow any functionality from it. Is that right?\r\n - I was not able to reproduce the issue of the script asking core members to squash pull requests with single commits. Was this comment referring to the behavior of the original merge-pr.sh?\r\n - Given that I don't have write access to upstream, I have no way of testing that this works all the way through. Is there a way of working around this that I haven't thought of?\r\n\r\nThanks again!",

    "body": "Hi, thanks for taking the time to work on this issue !\r\n\r\n> It seems like merge-pr.sh handles just a subset of the cases that merge-external-pr.sh, so I don't need to borrow any functionality from it. Is that right?\r\n\r\nYes, `merge-pr.sh` is used to merge core contributors PR and is mostly a simpler version of `merge-external-pr.sh`.\r\n\r\n> I was not able to reproduce the issue of the script asking core members to squash pull requests with single commits. Was this comment referring to the behavior of the original merge-pr.sh?\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean by original ? I had this issue with the latest version of merge-pr.sh\r\n\r\n> Given that I don't have write access to upstream, I have no way of testing that this works all the way through. Is there a way of working around this that I haven't thought of ?\r\n\r\nYou can create a dummy repo to try it out on your account. We will also merge this PR with it",

    "body": "@yenda Thanks for clearing those up. By 'original' I meant the latest version of merge-pr.sh, so I think we're on the same page there. I have run it on a dummy repo: `https://github.com/sebastiandelgado/status-react-dummy` by modifying the script to use:\r\n```\r\n  : ${OWNER:=sebastiandelgado}\r\n  : ${REPO:=status-react-dummy}\r\n```\r\nIt worked as expected!\r\n\r\nI did find a typo on line 83 where `$PR_LOCAL_BRANCH` is spelt as `$PR_LOCAL_BRACNCH` so I updated that but it did not change the expected outcome of the script in my tests (only PRs with a single commit were mergeable)\r\n\r\n@andytudhope The requirement as I understood it was that the PR should work regardless of whether or not the original PR was signed by whoever wrote the code in the first place. The script does sign the the commit with the core contributors signature every time. I could have phrased that better!\r\n\r\nI'm pushing the typo fix to the branch. If it looks good to you and I'll squash it so its ready to merge.",
