  "body": "This issue is non-actionnable and a description of how 'require approval' communities work and can be used. \r\n\r\nThis will be closed when all main shareholders have acknowledge they are fine with this behaviour for phase 1 and 2. @guylouis to collect any feedbacks about this. \r\n\r\nPhase 3 will see a revamp of the mechanisms to be a member of a community (will introduce tokenization)\r\n\r\n- **ADMIN**\r\n  - can create communities and channels\r\n- **MEMBERS**\r\n  - can see communities they are a member of (in the list of communities)\r\n  - can not see communities they are not a member of (in the list of communities)\r\n  - can write in all channels of the community they are a member of\r\n- **INVITATION TO A COMMUNITY**\r\n    - Only the admin can invite someone to a community: \r\n            - this person needs to be part of his contacts (this is just a UI matter, not a protocol one)\r\n            - this person is automatically added as a member of the community, without asking him if he wants it or not \r\n            - this person receives  chat message with a description of the community and a button to ~~open~~ join the community \r\n            - this person can then accept to join or not, if he joins he'll see the community, if not he won't see it in his UI\r\n- **SHARING A COMMUNITY**\r\n  - Anyone can share a community\r\n  - Sharing feature is embedded in the UI for admins and for members\r\n  - Sharing is similar to sharing the link to the description of the community, the description shows a a widget with the description of the community and number of members\r\n    - For ‘require approval’ community, when someone sees the description of the community, and if he’s not a member, he’s prompted if he wants to require access\r\n            - If he does ask for access\r\n                - The admin and only the admin can approve/refuse the membership\r\n                - If he does accept, the user becomes a member\r\n                - If he does not, the user does not become a member\r\n- **SHARING A COMMUNITY (with link)**\r\n  - Each ‘require approval' community has a link (#12131)\r\n  - This link can be sent through status chat and unfurls as the community description widget (#12132)\r\n  - The behaviour is then the same as above\r\n  - Also this link is a deeplink to Status, so if it’s opened though the system browser it opens status and opens a specific screen that shows the community widget (#12133)\r\n\r\n",
