    "body": "After hours of debugging the cause of this crash on Android, it seems to be coming from Reanimated. Particularly from [that file](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated/blob/main/android/src/reactNativeVersionPatch/nativeHierarchyManager/62/com/swmansion/reanimated/layoutReanimation/ReanimatedNativeHierarchyManager.java).\r\n\r\nThere is an open issue in reanimated for someone facing this same problem and is using very similar RN and reanimated versions to what we are using: https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated/issues/3080\r\n\r\nThe file above has changed considerably between versions 2.3.0 (what we are using) and the latest reanimated version (3.0.2). There is a good chance that this error can be fixed by upgrading RN and Reanimated versions.\r\n\r\n\r\n@pavloburykh would you mind excluding this issue from RC2, as upgrading the library versions is not feasible right now",
