  "body": "Note:\r\n\r\n   It's not obvious that you use !browse and the web2 URL of a testnet contract to hit a contract.  I assumed that you had to use the \"contacts\" function.\r\n\r\nTo Reproduce:\r\n\r\n    Open the contact list.\r\n    The word Dapps appears on the upper left above the console and wallet entries\r\n    Click on the plus sign to add a new contact.  You are asked for a Public Key.\r\n    Try entering valid addresses of contracts. (that's actually what I thought I was supposed to do)\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\n    None of the valid ethereum addresses you enter cause the check-mark go active, so you can't add an address.  Later I did find a way to visit a Dapp, but there was some poking around and asking involved.  I'm actually still not sure if there is more than one way to get to a Dapp interface.\r\n  \r\nExpected Result:\r\n\r\n    If this is where we add Dapp addresses, then we would expect to see some text that would indicate that.\r\n    If this is not where we add contacts for Dapps or individuals by ethereum address, then some other indication should be made in the UI.\r\n\r\nEnvironment:\r\n\r\n    im.status.ethereum-49c604.apk\r\n    I'm using a nexus 6 running Android 6.0.1 at security patch level: 5 Nov 2016\r\n    And I'm using google project fi as my provider.\r\n",
