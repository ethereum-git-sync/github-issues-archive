  "body": "### User Story\n\nAs a user I want feedback when I'm entering a ENS username, when it's looking up my public key and when it's resolved correctly, even on a slower connection. \n\n### Description\n\nThe scope of this issue is \n‚Ä¢ Add a dedicated 'Start' button next to the input with three states: disabled (greyed out), pending (greyed out with spinner), ready (blue). this is the same button that's used in ENS name registry.\n‚Ä¢ We show the disabled state whenever you can't proceed forward, correct state when a correct contact code or ENS username is entered, pending when it's resolving the chat key.\n‚Ä¢ Change the position of the QR Code button to be placed in the right side of Top Bar. Change the icon to the QR Code to be consistent with wallet.\n‚Ä¢ Change the subtitle informing of invalid entry to `User not found`\n‚Ä¢ The container in which this subtitle is shown should always be visible, 16px high, so that the subtitle when shown, doesn't push the contact list downward.\n‚Ä¢ Match the subtitle style with Figma, it's `font size: 13, font weight: 500, line height: 16, black'\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n\nAll of the above points were implemented and are correct with this [Figma design here ](https://www.figma.com/file/aS1ct66VQ6V0cio7vSqS8UoG/Chat?node-id=7957%3A169)\n\n### Notes\n\nWhen in doubt with chat key resolution, please get in touch with @flexsurfer for help\nthanks! üôè",
