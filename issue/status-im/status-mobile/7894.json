  "body": "Type of issue: UX\n\nAfter a successful reset of the card:\n- the user is kept logged in his account\n- the account still exists on the phone and to log in the user is asked to enter a password \n\nProblem: \n- it's confusing for the user to be kept login in his account since he deleted his unique way to login his account (note: except if he has several keycard with the same hd wallet)\n- the user has no way to login again in his account since he does not know the password that is asked of him after card deletion \n\nSuggested solution: \n- after successful reset of a card, the user should be logged out of his account, the account removed from the mobile app\n-  the warning message should become 'This operation will reset your card to its initial state, and delete your private keys.  Your account will be removed from this phone.\"",
