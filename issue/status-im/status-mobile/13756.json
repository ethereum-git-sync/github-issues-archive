    "body": "As recently discussed the design team is okay with the edges not being circular but all they want is the ability to place a logo in the centre of the QR code which helps with identifying what the QR code is generated for.\r\n\r\nThis can be achieved by overlapping the desired logo on top of the generated QR.\r\n\r\nI now need to experiment with the QR code's Error Correction Level (ref : https://github.com/soldair/node-qrcode#error-correction-level) and the QR code's capacity (ref : https://github.com/soldair/node-qrcode#qr-code-capacity) to ensure there is no information loss.\r\n\r\nEssentially what happens when there are logos present inside QR codes it corrupts the information to some level and the above values must be adjusted to make sure no information is lost when reading the QR code :) ",
