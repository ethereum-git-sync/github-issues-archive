  "body": "# Feature/bug\r\n\r\nIn the Community Home screen, where communities are listed, we should display community items in all possible/valid states, such as when there are mentions, when they're muted, etc.\r\n\r\nRecently, the Design System component `quo/community-list-item` (see [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/WQZcp6S0EnzxdTL4taoKDv/Design-System-for-Mobile?type=design&node-id=8917-153680&mode=design&t=Ak7qDKUdT9wHhqSF-0)) has been rewritten to support all possible variations. Now it's a matter of using this component in the actual screens. This newly updated component is also being used in the Discover Communities screen.\r\n\r\nAs much as this issue can be seen as a feature, it's also about fixing what can be seen as UI bugs because we're not using the correct DS component, we're using `quo2.components.community.community-list-view/communities-membership-list-item`, but this is incorrect.\r\n\r\n### Acceptance criteria\r\n\r\n- Use the expected DS component.\r\n- Cover all possible community states and translate them to the props expected by `quo/community-list-item`. This is the critical implementation of this issue. If in doubt, always double-check with designers.\r\n- Get the final implementation reviewed by QAs and designers.\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\n\r\n- Communities Home screen - https://www.figma.com/file/h9wo4GipgZURbqqr1vShFN/Communities-for-Mobile?type=design&node-id=5040-188714&mode=design&t=Xtkp4UmYJ0BPIfJX-0\r\n- Design System - List items - Community component https://www.figma.com/file/WQZcp6S0EnzxdTL4taoKDv/Design-System-for-Mobile?type=design&node-id=8917-153680&mode=design&t=Ak7qDKUdT9wHhqSF-0",
