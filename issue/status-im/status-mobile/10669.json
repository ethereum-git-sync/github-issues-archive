  "body": "### User Story\n\nAs a user I want to be able to compose and send audio messages in chat instead of having to type it with keyboard. I want message recipients to be able to play back my audio messages.\n\n### Description\n\nThe scope of this issue is to add a new message type of an `Audio Message` to our chat and the interface to record one.\n\nWe should cap the maximum length of an audio message to something reasonable and test what's the best compression / payload to send the message with. These don't have to be high quality, a 128kb/s bitrate is already better than what you get on a phone. I assume we're reusing the same Waku logic as we did for images.\n\n The UI:\n\n- we add a new button, placed on the last position for starting a new audio message\n- when tapped we show a brief hint that to start recording you need to press and hold it\n\n![tooltip](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4932774/82183519-6bff1280-98e6-11ea-882e-e096e51ca10f.gif)\n\n- when press and held, we animate in the recording UI, it's composed of two parts: one that has the audio waveform with controls for playback and cancelling and the duration in seconds. The other for pausing / continuing recording (we record only when the button is pressed) and sending the message.\n\n![recording](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4932774/82183779-d87a1180-98e6-11ea-9cd6-190ad2b14ea5.gif)\n- ideally you should be able to scrub the waveform to position the play head when not recording, that can be followed up as a nice to have in a separate issue\n- tapping outside the recording toolbar, dismisses the recording\n- sending the message renders the audio message on the chat thread as expected. inside the message, we place a waveform, a control to play/pause and a time indicator.\n\n![sending](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4932774/82184134-65bd6600-98e7-11ea-98f3-918b86e6ec83.gif)\n\n\nPrototype üëâ https://framer.cloud/mnwpw\n_Figma design üëâ [here](https://www.figma.com/file/aS1ct66VQ6V0cio7vSqS8UoG/Chat?node-id=9856%3A1578)\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n\nYou can send and play back audio messages in chats\n\n### Notes\n\nThanks! üôå",

    "body": "Welcome back @tbenr! \r\n\r\nas @flexsurfer said, we just implemented images, we have quite a lot of freedom in the format.\r\n\r\nYou can pass to status-go a filepath for example, and we can take care of the conversion, if necessary, for images we send the binary and we convert on base64 on receiving the message. \r\n\r\nI had a quick look at how to implement it, the main challenge to me looked like that unlike images, we can't play a sound inline (could not find a react native library for it). i.e\r\n\r\n```<audio controls src=\"data:audio/ogg;base64...```\r\n\r\nThat's convenient for us as audio file needs to be stored in the database encrypted, and ideally we don't save them ever on the filesystem unencrypted. \r\n\r\nIf that's not feasible, then the best we can probably do is to store them on play and remove them as soon as finished playing (I have seen some libraries doing that), but we also likely need to take extra care in cleaning things up.\r\n\r\nWe probably don't need multipart for this, we can play with the audio quality (maximum size we can send is probably 800KB, but I would have to try this to make sure) and length to ensure we don't exceed the file limit. @errorists did some exploratory work already.\r\n\r\nIf we see that we have to generate larger files, we can think about multipart, but the feature won't really have to change as it will be transparent to status-react (multipart will be handled at a lower level), hopefully that won't be the case.\r\n\r\nI can take care of the status-go bits, but of course you are welcome to work on both if you wish to do so.",

Android needs to be implemented as well but i think MediaPlayer with MediaDataSource should do the trick (need to try as well)\r\n\r\n2. it is possible to get metering data while recording (react-native-sound-level) (tested, i also pushed a PR related to android). So sort of dynamic representation could be done, but it wont the actual waveform. What we get here is max db on since last poll. if we configure a 10hz polling we can have an acceptable representation. This drive us to 3.\r\n\r\n3. we could encode simple metering data taken during recording and send it along with the  audio. It will be complex(?) but you don't need to load and analyze the entire audio to get a waveform. The alternative is to use metering only while recording and render waveform (for both sender and receiver) when message is sent\\received. But representation while recording will be different to the representation of the actual sent message.\r\n\r\nanother alternative is to delegate player and representation to a webview with injected wavesurfer.js (https://wavesurfer-js.org/) (LOL?) which, btw, supports inline base64 audio too.\r\n\r\nignoring webview, I think i can prepare a react-native module which does what we need, if maintaining our own module is a viable solution, but waveform representation complicates things quite a bit. To get a real representation we need to decode it (which is how https://github.com/juananime/react-native-audiowaveform works) ",

    "body": "I would consider splitting this in 2 tasks to be honest.\r\n\r\nWhile I agree with @errorists and I think he makes a fair point that often when we split tasks the second part never gets done, in this case it looks to me that most of the complexity will be the waveform, which is not going to provide the most benefit to the user (although it does look pretty neat), and we might delay the release of this for this.\r\n\r\nWhat about, something like, we start working on the simple version first, and then once that's done we re-evaluate if we still want to keep working on the waveform or release as it is? In that way we can start sorting out any eventual issue with the protocol etc? At least I would focus on the waveform last, to clear out room for testing etc.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I am ok with anything, that's my 2p.\r\n",
