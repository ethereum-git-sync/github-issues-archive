    "body": "@qoqobolo After looking more into this issue, I see that there is actually no problem. It looks on iOS and Android the same, and has the same height on both as in the designs. The difference in the white bottom area is due to the difference in bottom insets (safe area) on iOS and Android. To clarify more the below screenshots shows the composer itself colored in grey, and below it is the bottom insets. This bottom inset would be different from device to device. Devices that have more curve on their edges would have more bottom padding. iPhones usually have more curve than Android devices, therefore their safe area at the bottom is bigger. A device with a smaller curve would have a smaller safe area (so even on iPhones with physical button like iPhone SE it wouldn't have that extra white padding). Below also are screenshots showing the composer when the keyboard is open and the composer is away from that safe area -- the bottom padding is identical.\r\n\r\n- Screenshot from the designs. The dotted rectangle is the composer itself. Below it is the safe area, which is different from device to device, and is not directly part of the design of the component.\r\n<img width=\"817\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-05-16 at 11 48 26\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/assets/29354102/a5bec737-2500-4df7-9e6f-ac96b493c1c3\">\r\n\r\n- composer on iOS when keyboard is closed\r\n![unnamed (1)](https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/assets/29354102/fa45af50-d740-4ab3-88f0-5a6fa94fb564)\r\n\r\n- composer on Android when keyboard is closed\r\n![Screenshot_20230516_110659_Status Debug](https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/assets/29354102/84c60b29-b464-4640-8f7b-2d49ebf4e3f7)\r\n\r\n- composer on iOS when keyboard is open\r\n![unnamed](https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/assets/29354102/119dfe23-84dc-4659-a0e5-28229aefaa0f)\r\n\r\n- composer on Android when keyboard is open\r\n![Screenshot_20230516_110637_Status Debug](https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/assets/29354102/8d503c47-2302-47c2-8af5-8841f8852d53)\r\n",

    "body": "@OmarBasem yeah, I am aware of what causes the \"issue\", I mentioned it on Discord, also Andrey commented on the original issue [here](https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/issues/15346#issuecomment-1468565298) (we may have picked the wrong word for the safe area though).\r\n\r\nAnd you're actually right, my point was that it just doesn't look pretty in comparison with iOS :) Because, as already mentioned, it has that safe area, thanks to which the composer looks more proportionate on iOS devices.\r\n\r\nAnd that's why Andrey and I thought that it could be fixed, and he added some additional padding for Android, which later was removed after the introduction of the new composer.\r\n\r\nHowever, you also have a good point about iPhone SE which has a physical button, the composer really looks the same on it.\r\n\r\nSo I suggest not focusing on this, within 1.23, and closing the issue. In the meantime, I'll ask what the designers think about this, and maybe we'll come back to this question later.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking into this carefully and for the detailed explanation! 🙏",
