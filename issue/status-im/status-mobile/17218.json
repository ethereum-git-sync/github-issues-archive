Select which accounts to share with each Community's control node**\r\n- Designs should be ready for review and dev feedback by 18th September\r\n\r\n**3. Fix bugs, both functional and UX fit-and-finish defects.**  \r\n\r\n- Great progress during 1.25 on fixing UX fit-and-finish defects :-)  Let's aim to close all issue tagged \"E:Design Feedback 1.24\" by the end of this cycle.\r\n\r\n- Test all Communities functionality using the Public Test Community that will feature all types of token gating that Iuri is going to set up.  \r\n\r\n- Test how Status Mobile responds to community admin changes are made in Status Desktop e.g. when a channel is added or deleted or renamed, is the correctly reflected in Status Mobile?  Are changes to Community meta info like name and banner image correctly reflected in Status Mobile?  Etc, etc...\r\n\r\n- We need to get our quality bar to where we want it to be, and then keep tech. debt at a roughly fixed level as we build out any additional functionality.\r\n\r\n- Going forward, as much as is sensible, all new functionality should meet the higher quality bar we are aiming for before landing.\r\n\r\n**4. Fix any remaining issues related to syncing with Desktop**\r\n\r\n**5. Implement the OOBE light/dark theme selector screen**\r\n- Only if the design for this is ready in time, otherwise it's ok if this happens next cycle\r\n\r\n**--- Things that should NOT be worked on this cycle ---**\r\n\r\n- We shouldn't start anything in Settings or Profile related\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\n**Mobile Wallet dev team priority:**\r\n\r\n- Continue building out Mobile wallet MVP\r\n",

In the steps, I have given exams with which exact channel names, the current issue is reproducible\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n1. Create the channel in the community using the Desktop with the following names:\r\n - max_channel_length_wdddd\r\n - A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-I-2-Kddd\r\n \r\n2. Share the current community with a mobile user [Android]\r\n3. Open the channels\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nThree dots are shown instead of the channel name in the opened channel\r\n![image](https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/assets/52490791/bfb95740-6eae-422a-9d63-82371006b7af)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nThe channel name is shown into the opened channel\r\n\r\n### ENV:\r\n- Status version: nightly \r\n- Operating System: Android\r\n\r\n\r\n",
