Wallet - Profile - Home tab)\n\n### Additional Information (10th of May 2018 develop build stats)\n\n\n* Status version: Develop 942c703b / Release 0.9.18\n* Operating System: Android and iOS\n\nTF logs and video for Scenario 1 above (user uses Galaxy Note 4 and receives 500 messages in public chat after log in) - app was unresponsive for ~30 seconds: 00:20 - 01:00 -> https://app.testfairy.com/projects/4803622-status/builds/8262301/sessions/41/?accessToken=IrdTLg4OeDBoTd0J0SugtsBoBug\n\nTF logs and video for Scenario 2 above (user uses Galaxy Note 4, opens the app from the background and receives 200 messages.

Yes, app lags when I receive offline messages but it's noticeable on not really powerful devices and in the most cases when a contact joins public chat like #status with a large history that is fetched on last 7 days.\r\n\r\n+ we aware user by 'Fetching messages...' label messages fetch that something is going on, so contact does not experience \"unknown\" lags. \r\n\r\nNo, not a Beta blocker but something we still need to address and optimise.",

Neither after going back online from offline state nor when both devices are online and exchange messages in public chat (however user with nightly build receives messages from user with #9230th PR build)\r\nFrom the good news - there are no any lags for original issue :) - behavior is same to when all chats are empty ",
