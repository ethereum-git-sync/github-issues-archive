  "body": "# Problem\n\nI can't remember my signing phrase since it is just three words I confuse with other stuff.\n\n# Implementation\n\nUse Emoji guard to distinguish signing phrase from other passphrases.\n\n# Acceptance Criteria\n\n- Emoji guard implemented\n- Graceful upgrade/behavior for existing accounts\n- Security sanity check\n\n# Notes\n\nSee https://github.com/status-im/status-react/pull/5824\n\nThis was discussed in Janitors. While I agree with the blocking in this PR at that time, I do think it'd be a step up to get it into the app. Especially as there doesn't seem to be any concrete suggestions for better solutions.\n\ncc @yenda (kudos for initial PR!) @jarradh @hesterbruikman \n\n# Future Steps\n\nDo more UX research on better solutions when resources are available.",
