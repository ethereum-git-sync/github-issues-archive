  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\n*Type*: Bug\r\n\r\n*Summary*: Admin creates new group, adds 2 members and sends 2 welcome messages to the group chat. Both of new members do not run app. After 6-11 hours they launch app:\r\n1. Member1 (launched app at 11:25) gets new group shown in Chats but without any welcome messages. If wait for 1 hour - welcome messages are not delivered.\r\n2. Member2 (launched app later, at 11:27) has no new groups shown in Chats. Waited for 1 hour with app running on foreground, phone unlocked, relaunched app after waiting for 1 hour - no new group.\r\n3. If admin sends new message (when both members are using the app) then only member1 gets this message.\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n1. Both new members can see new group added to Chats when they run the app.\r\n2. Both new members receive welcome messages sent by admin when group was created and later\r\n \r\n#### Actual behavior\r\n1. Only member1 (who runs app first) gets new Group in the Chats list. Member2 who runs app after this does not get any new Group.\r\n2. Both users do not get welcome messages\r\n3. If admin sends new message then only member1 gets it. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\nAs admin\r\n- Open Status\r\n- Create new group chat with 2 members (both should not run the app when group is created)\r\n- Send 2 messages to the group, like \"Welcome\" and \"this is my group created on [time]\"\r\n- Wait for 10 hours, both members should not run app during the wait period\r\n- As member1: after 10 hours run app. Check that there is new Group shown in the Chats and if it contains any messages. Wait for 1-2 minutes\r\n- As member2: run app after member1. Wait for 5-10 minutes to see if any new group is shown in Chats\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n* Status version: 0.9.9\r\n* Operating System: \r\nReal device (member1) Samsung Galaxy S6, Android 6.0.1\r\nReal device  (member2) iPhone 6s, iOS 10.2.1\r\nReal device (admin) iPhone 7plus, iOS 10.3.2",
