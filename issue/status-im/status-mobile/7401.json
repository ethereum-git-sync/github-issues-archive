  "body": "# Problem\r\n\r\nInitially it was possible to have a 1:1 chat with a user without sharing personal contact information like name and profile picture.\r\nIt looks like it's not possible anymore, because contact informations are sent automatically to the other user when opening a 1:1 chat.\r\n\r\n# Example\r\n\r\n1 - Alice writes a messages in a public chat\r\n2 - Bob sends a message to the same public chat\r\n3 - Alice cannot see Bob's real name; she can see the 3 random words.\r\n4 - Bob clicks on Alice's profile and then on \"Send message\". 1:1 chat opens (without actually sending messages).\r\n5 - At this point Alice can see Bob's real name, because profile informations have been sent at point 4, without any action from Bob. Bob didn't have to click on \"Add to contacts\"\r\n\r\nAs we discussed in Status, we changed this behaviour some months ago, but I'm not sure if it has been decided from a UX point of view, and if we want to keep it.\r\n\r\nIs there any other reason for this? Maybe related to push notification?",
