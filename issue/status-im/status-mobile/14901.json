  "body": "# Problem\r\n\r\nUsers can't clean up notifications in the Activity Center.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\n- The user should be able to swipe left to \"remove\" a notification from the Activity Center. In `status-go` terms, the user will `dismiss` the notification. On the backend, the notification should be dismissed and marked as read simultaneously. Dismissed notifications are automatically ignored in the client, so the UI should update accordingly without further changes to the app db.\r\n- When the user wants to dismiss a notification that requires some action, like a contact request, the text should dynamically reflect what the negative action is. Dismissing is only for read/unread notifications and dismissing an unread notification without CTA marks them as read automatically (this is probably done in status-go already, but better check). The designs are on the way with more examples, so better check with the Design team first.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46027/214668385-c7c372cb-a572-460e-90a7-c0918fc48676.png\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46027/214668585-f68fd361-6871-4d18-8e0d-81f20a373f5a.mp4\r\n\r\n",

It makes sense you found `Issue 1` because I haven't tested flows with push notifications. Next time I'll try to include them in my manual tests.\r\n\r\nI agree with your suggestion, it would greatly help if we can live with this bug in `develop` while I fix it in a separate PR.\r\n\r\n",
