  "body": "**Description** \nIt is currently possible to create two accounts that have the same mnemonic (hence the same seed) one with keycard, one without keycard. \n\n**Problem**\nThis is a security problem and totally defeats the purpose of keycard. The problem is that it gives a false sense of security to the user\n- that uses keycard to keep his private keys offline, in a cold storage\n- while they are still stored on the phone \n\n**Reproduction** \n-  create a keycard account: generate a key > select storage: keycard. At this stage write down the mnemonic.\n- create a non-keycard account with the same seed: access key > enter seed phrase \n\nreproduced in #9062 \n\n**Solution**\nwhenever a new status account (keycard or non-keycard) is created we must make sure that there is no existing account with the same seed on the phone (keycard or non-keycard)\n\n\ncc @rachelhamlin @corpetty @rasom",

    "body": "@guylouis \r\nWe have two ways to restore account at the moment:\r\n1. by entering mnemonic\r\n2. by pairing a keycard with existing acc on it\r\n \r\nThe problem with the second case is that we have to pair a card with a device before we can get master key address and check that this multiaccount already exists. We disabled the option to unpair card https://github.com/status-im/status-react/issues/9227 , and so the question is: do we want to propose user to unpair card in this case, or we just show them that account can't be restored and keep one extra slot occupied? \r\n\r\n ",
