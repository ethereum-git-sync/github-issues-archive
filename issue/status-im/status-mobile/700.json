  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nThe transaction confirmation dialog uses a sliding cards style interface to stack multiple transactions together. Even advanced users are likely to ignore the content of these transaction boxes, seeing them as paranoia spot checks rather than standard confirmation dialogs.\r\n\r\nThis problematic situation is compounded with a bug that registers multiple transactions when only one transaction was intended by accidentally tapping a command submit button more than once before the transaction confirmation dialog presents itself. The card style interface obscures the fact that multiple transactions were accidentally added. In the case of `send` commands, this will repeatedly send the given amount of ether for every accidental tap beyond the first tap.\r\n\r\n## Reproduction\r\n\r\n[iOS]\r\n\r\n1. Begin a chat session with a user.\r\n2. Activate the `send` command to bring up the numpad interface.\r\n3. Input a value of `1`\r\n4. Quickly and deliberately tap the submit button 3 times then wait.\r\n5. Confirm the action to complete the command.\r\n\r\n## Observation\r\n\r\n1. The transaction confirmation dialog obscures the presence of 3 pending transactions because of the card style interface.\r\n2. When the command fires, 3 distinct `send` actions will appear in chat.\r\n3. An attempt to send `1` ether results in sending `3` ether.\r\n\r\n## Expectation\r\n\r\nYou know. ðŸ˜œ",

Clarifying this just in case it got lost from renaming the issue.\r\n\r\nTapping a command submit action, to invoke the transaction confirmation, should only register the first tap instead of queuing a transaction per tap while the confirmation loads. I shouldn't have combined that issue with my thoughts on how the transaction confirmation exacerbates the problem.",
