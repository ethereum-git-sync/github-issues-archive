Yes, it is still reproducible but this bug is kinda an edge case. See some more detailed reproduction steps below (point 3 is imporant)\r\n\r\n**Steps:** \r\n\r\n1. User A located on the chats list screen\r\n2. User B sends album to User A\r\n3. **User A enters chat with User B right after he sees notification about new message BUT before album is fully received on his side.** \r\n4. User A starts opening and swiping those album images that were partially loaded\r\n5. Observe the result\r\n\r\n**Actual result:** at some point album appears to be separated preventing from interacting with other app elements. See updated video below, maybe from this video it will be more clear how to reproduce the bug. \r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/assets/97245802/8a2027fa-4510-495c-9987-9a02655a6a1a\r\n\r\n\r\n",
