  "body": "### User Story\r\n\r\nAs a developer and user of our platform, I want to have a separate design for routes when using test networks, specifically for Goerli (and Sepolia in the future). This will ensure that the UI accurately reflects the network being used and provides a clear distinction between mainnet and testnet environments.\r\n\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n- Testnet Banner: When a testnet (Goerli or Sepolia) is used, a testnet banner should be prominently displayed at the top of the UI. This banner should be visually distinct from the mainnet UI to avoid any confusion.\r\n- Network-Specific Icons and Names: The UI should dynamically change to display the names and icons of the testnet being used. This includes replacing mainnet names and icons with their testnet counterparts.\r\n- Testnet Token Display: Fees and other financial information should be shown in the relevant testnet tokens, clearly differentiating them from mainnet tokens.\r\n- Compatibility Across Flows: The testnet design changes should be implemented consistently across all existing flows (Optimism, Mainnet, Arbitrum, etc.), ensuring a uniform user experience.\r\n- Easy Toggle Between Networks: Users should be able to easily switch between testnet and mainnet, with the UI automatically updating to reflect the selected network.\r\n\r\nTalk with Design team for any question or concern",
