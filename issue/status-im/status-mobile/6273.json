    "body": "Those are not \"4300 releases\", those are \"release points\", and this is apparently a GitHub feature:\r\nhttps://github.community/t5/How-to-use-Git-and-GitHub/Tag-without-release/td-p/6255\r\n>each tag creates a release point but does not actually create a release. Releases themselves are created when you add release notes to a tag. However, as you noted, tags that don't have a release associated with them do still show up on the releases tab, albeit in a very different style. I can see how this could be confusing.\r\n\r\nWe create a lot of `build-[0-9]` tags like `build-8943` because we use them to track build numbers that are using when adding metadata to iOS/Android releases. The script that does that is [`scripts/build_no.sh`](https://github.com/status-im/status-react/blob/develop/scripts/build_no.sh). Those have to be tracket in a global way and using Git tags was the simplest way. We could possibly replace that method with something else and remove all those tags, and in effect remove all those \"release points\", but that's gonna be a bit of work.\r\n\r\nI'll have to figure out a reliable way of tracking build number globally without using Git.\n\n<blockquote><div><strong><a href=\"https://github.community/t5/How-to-use-Git-and-GitHub/Tag-without-release/m-p/6255#M2054\">Tag without release</a></strong></div><div>For our projects, we are using tags which seem to create releases associated with every tag.
