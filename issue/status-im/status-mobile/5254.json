    "body": "This is not an easy problem to address, considering how much work goes into making a solution that is reliable and at the same time, battery and network topology-friendly. This is one of the reasons why the [Push Notifications v2 swarm](https://github.com/status-im/ideas/tree/master/ideas/086-push-notif-v2) still does not address it directly, merely taking the opportunity to allow for future extensibility in terms of PN providers. As a result, I haven't yet done much work to explore possible solutions, but here are some alternatives to GCM that I'm aware of (any additions to this list are welcome):\r\n- [Pushy](https://pushy.me) based on MQTT seems interesting, but is a paid and centralized solution;\r\n- [XMPP](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0357.html), see discussion in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1243066/does-android-support-near-real-time-push-notification/5695867#5695867. This would require further investigation, ideally we'd find a good open source library, but we might need to integrate the server component on the incentivized mailserver to act as the intermediary.\r\n\r\n@GustavMarwin as you rightly mention, it is possible to have a persistent notification to keep the application alive and allow polling, although it is less efficient for every app to do this in parallel, rather than grouping all those needs into something like GCM and having a single TCP connection serving everyone. Nonetheless, it could serve as a first stepping stone towards a more mature and resource-friendly solution.\r\n\r\nThe way we plan to allow for extensibility of PN providers in PN v2 is by relying on [gorush](https://github.com/appleboy/gorush) and contributing to the project an additional PN platform (currently supports GCM and APN).\r\n\r\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/stackoverflow/img/apple-touch-icon@2.png?v=73d79a89bded\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div>Stack Overflow</div><div><strong><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1243066/does-android-support-near-real-time-push-notification/5695867\">Does Android support near real time push notification?</a></strong></div><div>I recently learned about the ability of iPhone apps to receive nearly instantaneous notifications to apps notifications to apps.\r\n\r\nThis is provided in the form of push notifications, a bespoke proto...</div></blockquote>",

But most importantly Signal has some major issues when used without those Google services, issues where a fix exist but the lead maintainer is ignoring those for an unknown reason [1].

Wikipedia and google in general are silent about his education but he calls himself a cryptographer or researcher. One could be tricked he is mathematician or software engineer. Maybe he simply does not understand what do you talk about? He knows something as a self taught person in one particular branch but university education gives not only education but also a 360 degrees way of thinking. Maybe he is stubborn because he is uneducated.\r\n\r\nfor example Bruce Schneier's CV : (Wikipedia)\r\n\"Bruce Schneier is the son of Martin Schneier, a Brooklyn Supreme Court judge. He grew up in Flatbush, attending P.S. 139 and Hunter High School.[6] After receiving a physics bachelor's degree from the University of Rochester in 1984,[7] he went to American University in Washington, D.C. and got his master's degree in computer science in 1988.[8] He was awarded an honorary Ph.D from the University of Westminster in London, England in November 2011. The award was made by the Department of Electronics and Computer Science in recognition of Schneier's 'hard work and contribution to industry and public life'.\"",
