  "body": "[comment]: # (Please replace ... with your information. Remove < and >)\n\n### User Story\nAs a user, I want to see the number of unread messages in a chat so that I can continue my chats where I left them and track my progress in catching up with new messages.\n\n### Description\n[comment]: # (Feature or Bug? i.e Type: Bug)\n_Type_: Feature\n\n[comment]: # (Describe the feature you would like, or briefly summarise the bug and what you did, what you expected to happen, and what actually happens. Sections below)\n_Summary_: We need a visible way to indicate and track the number of unread messages left in a chat, and if desired, skip past them and mark all messages as read.\n\n#### Expected behavior\nUser has an X number of unread messages in a chat. After opening the chat, we present a small badge to the bottom right with a counter of unread messages left. The chat is opened in the position before any new unread messages, where you last left it.\nScrolling downward should update the counter as the user scrolls past the unread messages, marking them as read. Tapping on the counter should scroll down to the last unread message and mark everything as read. When there are no unread messages left, we dismiss the counter.\n\n### Solution\nYou can follow the intended design in this prototype https://framer.cloud/taJfZ\nMobile designs are here in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/aS1ct66VQ6V0cio7vSqS8UoG/Chat?node-id=568%3A0)\nDesktop designs [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/MRYBI5axcTwL4Ft8xAYhFOfy/Desktop-Chat?node-id=20%3A154)\n\nSome things to be aware of, please enclose the badge in a touchable that's slightly larger than the button itself, adding a 12px padding inside the touchable or a margin outside the button. The text inside the badge should be right aligned. The SVG for the icon can be exported directly from Figma, it's called `scrollBottomIcon`, lmk if you need help or further directions.\n\n<blockquote>![](https://framer.cloud/taJfZ/2/framer/social-1200x630.png)<div><strong>[Scroll - Unread](https://framer.cloud/taJfZ)</strong></div><div>This project was made with Framer, a design tool for turning original concepts into working prototypes.</div></blockquote>",

    "body": "> @bitsikka btw did you notice that I changed the read status it is just a boolean for each message now which simplifies things a bit\r\n\r\n@yenda It helps, thanks! I was somewhat aware of it due to having worked on #4158 **New messages counter is shown for already seen messages**. I am also aware of whole bunch of apis (including chat) moving soon from clojure to go mainly for performance.\r\n\r\nI do diligently try to be up-to-date on all new development by watching all/most new PRs/issues, and rebasing - I have https://github.com/notifications as a pinned tab that I check multiple times a day :p sometimes to a detriment of getting distracted. I like that there are lots of improvements all the time including developer experience.\r\n\r\nIn the process I have noticed only minor changes in the code base that affects this feature so far.\r\n\r\nWhile I am pursuing leads on various approaches to various parts of this feature, I still do not have a coherent/solid approach I have settled on yet.\r\n\r\nBut, it feels like I'm getting there and that is exciting. I still love this feature, and would love to do justice to it by doing whatever it takes; while keeping in sync with the overall direction the app is fast evolving; and while giving best performance; and being as timely as possible.",

    "body": "I am making progress on this in the sense that I now have a clearer idea about approaching different aspects of the solution to this issue. Since it is no use writing code without having more-or-less a clear plan, so far I have not written a whole bunch of code, except experiments, disabling old behaviors, and visible ui part of the code.\r\n\r\nstill rough ideas I have had (this is like the answer to the question in gitcoin about \"how will you approach?\" for which I said \"I don't know\" before :p )\r\n\r\n1) use [`viewabilityConfig`](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/0.59/flatlist#viewabilityconfig) and [`onViewableItemsChanged`](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/0.59/flatlist#onviewableitemschanged) properties of flat-list for updating unread count. Turns out those props are perfect for that.\r\n2) use [`getItemLayout`](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/0.59/flatlist#getitemlayout) for the kind of flexibility(see 3) in scrolling we need.\r\n\r\n    Problem with this is that `getItemLayout` works best with items of fixed height; but, items in our flat-list are made up of various types of messages of varying height.\r\n\r\n    Even then, I think the height of messages are/can-be-made to be deterministic. So, we can calculate and store the height of each message as it get added to local db. We can use https://github.com/aMarCruz/react-native-text-size or something like that for algorithm to calculate message height for `getItemLayout`.\r\n\r\n   This seems quite complicated, but seems worth checking it out.\r\n\r\n3) use [`initialScrollIndex`](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/0.59/flatlist#initialscrollindex) to start chat scrolled at particular index \"remembered\", instead of starting at the top with the first item. Needs `getItemLayout` to have been implemented.\r\n4) maybe optional/non-critical, use the undocumented prop (iOS only) [`maintainVisibleContentPosition`]( https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/65184ec) to keep view from scrolling jankily when new messages arrive and current scroll position is not at the bottom/present.\r\n\r\n    maybe implement this for Android natively taking cues from iOS implementation.\r\n\r\n    perhaps it may also be, that this may allow insights to attain scroll flexibility efficiently without having to implement `getItemLayout`.\r\n\r\n@errorists @hesterbruikman There is also an issue I am foreseeing now in design/ux. Scroll to bottom button with unread messages counter design assumes that there will only be new present/future messages added to the bottom of the messages list. But, due to \"gaps\" loading feature, there can also be unread messages towards the top of the list. In this case the `arrow-down` icon and scrolling only to bottom when pressed can be confusing.\r\n\r\nI have thought about maybe having `arrow-down` and scroll-to-bottom on press **primarily**; and then once the messages in the present have all been seen, if there are still unseen messages in the past, have the `arrow-up` icon and scroll to top, to mark all messages as seen.\r\n\r\nI don't know what the best approach to ux for this is, but, I do have more pressing issues atop to tackle for now.\r\n\r\ncc @yenda @rachelhamlin",

    "body": "Update:\r\n\r\nFor 1) it turns out `onViewableItemsChanged` does not quite register some gaps of items if user scrolls really fast. It skips gaps of items that ought to be marked as seen. But, it looks like we can detect the gaps by using `onScrollBeginDrag` and `onMomentumScrollEnd` props to capture min/max index and diff the range with the set of ids registered by `onViewableItemsChanged`.\r\n\r\nThere are also performance issues in updating app-db/realm-db frequently in marking items as seen as frequently in the new behavior than how it was in the old behavior. So, will have to optimize somehow using deferring/batching/using-component-or-screen-local-state techniques.",

    "body": "I have had a look at this, and come up with some technical issues that are not so straightforward to solve:\r\n\r\nWe load the oldest unread message from status-go, and also we load the next 20 messages. We can't load all the messages as that would choke the UI if there are many.\r\n\r\nThat means that we need to have pagination on both sides now.\r\n\r\nThis is problematic as FlatList will autoscroll on prepending messages (we use an inversed flat list) https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/25239 \r\n\r\nWhich means that as you add a new page, it will automatically scroll to the new messages.\r\n\r\nIn IOS we can use an undocumented feature `maintainVisibleContentPosition` which solves the issue, but is not available on android.\r\n\r\nWhat I tried is to \"scroll back\" to the current position after messages are rendered, that works but gives a fairly unpleasant UX (you see messages being scrolled down, and then it jumps back to the original position).\r\n\r\nDiscord managed to get it working properly (it can be seen in their app), but they are using their own List implementation https://blog.discordapp.com/how-discord-achieves-native-ios-performance-with-react-native-390c84dcd502 , which they say they will open source eventually, but no news on that front for a while.\r\n\r\nI will look a bit further into whether is possible to have the same behavior on android, but will time box it and there are many unknowns.",
