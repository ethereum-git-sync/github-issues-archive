    "body": "I agree with all of these points, for example we encounter the address vs public key thing quite often. Which stems from us wanting to use the same keypair in both Whisper & the Blockchain, something I'm not willing to compromise on, but we definitely need.\r\n\r\nOne thing we could do here is only rely on public key for Status and let the wallet display address, which would be cleaner, but there is the issue of people sharing a public key with other mobile wallets, if we don't implement the shortened public key then maybe other wallets will through error with such a long string.\r\n\r\nIn any case we hope to hide alot of this once we have a better path forward with usernames and identity #669 ",
