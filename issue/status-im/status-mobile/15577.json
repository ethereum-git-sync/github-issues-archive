  "body": "# Problem\r\n\r\nFor creating mask effect/holes, we overlap components inside the hole-view.\r\n\r\nThis component should be static, if it is dynamic like getting an update with reanimated or some reagent atom then those updates don't work in Android.\r\n\r\nCurrently, we have a [way around](https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/blob/c5de05432436798a87a205edc91082d8e4f07161/src/quo2/components/navigation/bottom_nav_tab.cljs#L62) for cases with reagent updates. We can just pass a param `key` to the hole key and update that with the help of a reagent atom, which will force rerender hole-view and child components.\r\n\r\nBut this is not an optimal solution because rerendering degrades the performance and shouldn't be used for fast response time components like [bottom tabs](https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/blob/c5de05432436798a87a205edc91082d8e4f07161/src/quo2/components/navigation/bottom_nav_tab.cljs#L52).\r\n\r\nAlthough re-rendering with the help of key param works almost in all cases, for some reason it didn't update the view which was using fast-image instead of the react-native image component.\r\n\r\n**UPD:** Fast-image itself [usage](https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/blob/c80992b6bf48a8bd2aed91be67dd6b7574a8fa6b/src/react_native/fast_image.cljs#L15) reagent atom to dynamically update view when image is loaded, that's why it don't work inside hole-view. Because even if we rerender fast-image view, initial state is still loading and we update image after that\r\n\r\nWe should look into this library to figure out why behaviour is different in android and ios, and fix issue: https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/pull/15561#issuecomment-1494063367\r\n**UPD**: fixed create profile issue in https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/pull/16001",
