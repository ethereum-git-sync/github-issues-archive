  "body": "According to the `LICENSE.md` in the repository, the app is licensed under Mozilla Public License 2.0.\r\n\r\nHowever, on launching the app, I am presented with a consent screen demanding that I agree to the \"Terms of Use\", which says, among other things:\r\n\r\n> You agree to use the Status app in a way that doesn't harm or violate the rights of Status, Status app users, or others in any way.\r\n\r\nI do not agree to this!  In fact, I reserve all rights granted to me under the MPL, including the right to use the software in ways that the copyright owner does not agree with.\r\n\r\nIf this is indeed a condition of the software license agreement, then Status is not free software / open source, as such usage restrictions make software nonfree.\r\n\r\nThe Terms of Use should be removed from the mobile app, as the app is software and the only terms of use for the software are the software license agreement.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the Terms of Use govern the use of APIs or services provided by Status Research & Development GmbH in Switzerland, this should be made much more clear, as the messaging around the brand suggests that I am using only public/decentralized/***permissionless*** APIs (such as the Ethereum blockchain) and that it has no reason to phone home.\r\n\r\nIf it does indeed use **permissioned services** provided by Status Research & Development GmbH, I don't want to be a user.  I want local free software, not an account on some centralized service provider that tells me how I can and can't use the service.  That's a ***permissioned** system, as evidenced by the restrictive demands made of me in the \"Terms of Use\".\r\n\r\nIf it does not, then it's only the **software** license that applies to the app, and that's the MPL2, and the whole \"Terms of Use\" thing is a confusing red herring.",
