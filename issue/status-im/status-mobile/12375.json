  "body": "# Feature Issue\r\n\r\nThe scope of this issue is allowing community admins to select any emoji and combine it with one of 20 preset colours to personalise each channel in a community. We will no longer be using the global Community Colour value, it should be deprecated and removed from codebase and interface.\r\n\r\n### User Story\r\n\r\nAs a Community Owner I want to personalise channels with icons to make them easily recognisable, personalise them and strengthen their meaning. As a Community members I want channels to have individual images attached so at a glance I can tell them apart, easily navigate to my favourite channels and add personality.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n[Figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/aS1ct66VQ6V0cio7vSqS8UoG/Chat?node-id=21402%3A99840)\r\n\r\n<img width=\"300\" alt=\"New Channel-1\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4932774/126995905-6320dcda-48a4-44b3-8233-a4b0d45ea67c.png\">\r\n<img width=\"300\" alt=\"New Channel-3\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4932774/126995917-742d4be2-630d-4177-83f0-01b7f7609a24.png\">\r\n<img width=\"300\" alt=\"New Channel\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4932774/126995926-70c6d9c6-cb56-44d7-8dd0-624c83edaa9b.png\">\r\n\r\nInclude the interface for adding an emoji and colour combination to each newly created channel. By default we pick randomly from the list. When tapped on the thumbnail, we present a UI with a grid of colours, and an emoji picker. The picker found in design is for reference, I'm happy to discuss alternatives based on availability of RN packages. Once selected, the channel thumbnail with its attached emoji and colour is used everywhere. Emojis scale to match the size of the thumbnail proportionally: so for a 40pt round thumbnail, the emoji font-size is 28, for 120 that's a 84 etc.\r\n\r\n----\r\n**The list of colours:**\r\n\r\n`red`:`F5A3A3`\r\n`pink`:`F5A3BF`\r\n`magenta`:`E9A3F5`\r\n`purple`:`C0A3F5`\r\n`indigo`:`A3B0F5`\r\n`blue`:`A3C2F5`\r\n`cyan`:`A3DCF5`\r\n`teal`:`A3ECF5`\r\n`mint`:`A3F5E2`\r\n`green`:`A3F5BA`\r\n`moss`:`CFF5A3`\r\n`lemon`:`EEF5A3`\r\n`yellow`:`F5F5A3`\r\n`honey`:`F5E4A3`\r\n`orange`:`F5D7A3`\r\n`peach`:`F5B6A3`\r\n`brown`:`E0C2B8`\r\n`grey`:`CCCCCC`\r\n`dove`:`DAE2E7`\r\n`white`:`FFFFFF`\r\n\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\nAbove requirements are met, design and outlined functionality is implemented and community colours are removed \r\n\r\nThanks üôè \r\n",
