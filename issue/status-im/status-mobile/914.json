  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\n[comment]: # (Feature or Bug? i.e Type: Bug)\r\n*Type*: Bug\r\n\r\n[comment]: # (Describe the feature you would like, or briefly summarise the bug and what you did, what you expected to happen, and what actually happens. Sections below)\r\n*Summary*: In Android 7.0 there is[ split-screen mode](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/multi-window.html) when app uses half of the screen. It looks like it's not taken into account and there are several issues. We can disable multi-window support and enable it when all issues will be fixed (if it takes much time) \r\n\r\nIssues:\r\nScreencast issues 1-2: https://www.screencast.com/t/eo5NVIfByX\r\n1. Currently, scrollbars in Chats, Discover, Contacts and Profile screens are hiding if scroll to the bottom, so user can't see the of the content.\r\n![splitscreen](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6584810/24084009/9750acc0-0ce2-11e7-889b-5c1f53569f01.png)\r\n2.  Profile screen lost \"Switch users\" link if switch from split screen back to full screen mode\r\n![no switch users](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6584810/24084793/5d8dacc2-0cf1-11e7-8e98-97394434634e.png)\r\n3. If app is using bottom half of the screen then it's not possible to scroll to Password field on Login screen. Screencast issue 3: https://www.screencast.com/t/dL6m3bHt\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n[comment]: # (Describe what you expected to happen.)\r\n1. In split-screen mode user can scroll all the lists and see all content (from top to bottom). \r\n2. After switching between modes all ui controls are available \r\n3. All fields are accessible and user can scroll to them. \r\n#### Actual behavior\r\n[comment]: # (Describe what actually happened.)\r\n1. In split-screen mode: when user scrolls to the bottom then scrollbar is hiding and top part of the list is shown. Can't scroll to the bottom part. \r\n2.  Link \"Switch users\" and text \"Shake your phone...\" disappear after switching between split screen to fill screen mode \r\n3. It's not possible to scroll to Password field on Login screen if app takes bottom half of the screen \r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n[comment]: # (Describe how we can replicate the bug step by step.)\r\n\r\nIssue#1\r\n- Open Status and login\r\n- Tap on Recent app/Intents button on your device. In Galaxy S7 it's button on the left\r\n- Tap on  double rectangle button. As a result, app is shown in split screen mode\r\n- Tap on Contacts\r\n- Scroll to the end of the list to see Jarred's contact \r\n\r\nIssue#2\r\n- Open Status and login\r\n- Tap on Recent app/Intents button on your device. In Galaxy S7 it's button on the left\r\n- Tap on  double rectangle button. As a result, app is shown in split screen mode\r\n- Open user Profile\r\n- Close user Profile\r\n- Switch to full screen mode by dragging app border down\r\n- Open Profile\r\n\r\nIssue#3\r\n- Open any app, e.g. Gmail and switch it it split-screen mode to take top part of the screen\r\n- Open Status\r\n- Tap on any username\r\n- Scroll to Password field\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n[comment]: # (Please summarise the solution and provide a task list on what needs to be fixed.)\r\n*Summary*: \r\n\r\n- [ ] If fixing all issues takes lots of time then disable multi window support\r\n- [ ] Fix issues \r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n[comment]: # (Please do your best to fill this out.)\r\n* Status version: 0.9.4\r\n* Operating System: Android \r\n",
