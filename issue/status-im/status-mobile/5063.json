  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\n*Type*: Bug\r\n\r\n*Summary*: We have a PR https://github.com/status-im/status-react/pull/5044 that introduces localization of `/send` and `/request` messages based on user preferences. So if I set up my wallet in EURO all the transaction messages will be shown in the currency I have selected.\r\n\r\nThe issue it the following: when i send a request to a person in EUR ( i have my wallet in EUR) - the recipient of the request will see the request incoming in EUR even he has configured his wallet to be shown in AED.\r\n- this is confusing from a user point of view, for example, I could not be aware of what RUR currency is for\r\n- this is a potential security breach because it allows understanding where the request is coming from\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n- Fiat value of send and request are being calculated on recipient side so they always will be shown in the currency user selected for himself\r\n- Sender still see his requests and sends in his preferred currency as well \r\n\r\n#### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n- requests are coming in the currency they were sent from no matter which currency the recipient of the request is using\r\n- respond to such requests are shown in currency of the sender, so I have wallet in EUR and respong to AED request - the respond (actual send) will be shown for me in EUR as well as for recipient who wants AEDs. \r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\n- Open wallet and configure it to use any non default currency on device 1\r\n- Open wallet and configure it to use any non default currency on device 2\r\n- Send a /request from device 1 to device 2\r\n- Respond to this request from device 2 to device 1\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28752642/42319958-4da5e8c6-805c-11e8-9647-d359cb1f72c7.png)\r\n",
