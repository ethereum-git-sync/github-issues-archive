    "body": "@Francesca-G @churik \r\nOn point 2: of this issue, its a bit unclear to me which figma would be the right to work this on this comment in the link below https://www.figma.com/file/Tf5nfkYvpbnNCo4rKLK7lS?node-id=3674:338290&mode=design#510729314\r\n\r\nIt appears some figma designs do not really respect the top margin pointed out in the design review for join communities. Could you check the following links. Some designs have the top margin and other dont really have it\r\nhttps://www.figma.com/file/h9wo4GipgZURbqqr1vShFN/Communities-for-Mobile?type=design&node-id=1733%3A125697&mode=design&t=mxl8QDEdGZOxIC67-1\r\n\r\nhttps://www.figma.com/file/h9wo4GipgZURbqqr1vShFN/Communities-for-Mobile?type=design&node-id=13521%3A714912&mode=design&t=mxl8QDEdGZOxIC67-1\r\n\r\n1. It seems to me the maximum height for the bottom sheet showing the community rules is correctly implemented as it is now and the top margin is determined by how much the content of the bottom sheet is. More content on the bottom sheet less top margin and less content has a bigger top margin.\r\n\r\nI seek your clarification if i may have misunderstood this. Thanks",
