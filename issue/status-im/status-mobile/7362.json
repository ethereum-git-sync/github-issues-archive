  "body": "Sometimes in a private group chat messages are missing from a particular peer.\n\nWe don't have exact steps to replicate, but one description is:\n\nCreate group chat on A, with B and C.\n\nA sends a message to B, B is able to receive it, but when replying A won't see their response.\n\nWe haven't been able to replicate and have access to logs, so please add `geth.log` in your comment.\n\nThe most likely explanation is that it is due to multiple devices present (re-installing etc), as the encryption is device-to-device, and the system has not picked up the devices correctly.\n\nThere's currently a mechanism to handle such cases, but is not toggled on yet, also https://github.com/status-im/status-react/pull/7342 will help keeping this information up to date. \n\n\nUpdate:\n\n1) One issue was due to the fact that certain nightly were publishing on a separate topic, that has been disabled for now, so it should not impact it anymore.\n2) Another issue reported is that if you join on device A, and device B is offline, some of the messages that are sent before B receives the join notification are lost (can be retrieved from the mailserver, but they might already be in the dedup cache)",
