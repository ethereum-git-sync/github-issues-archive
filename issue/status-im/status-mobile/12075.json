  "body": "# Feature Issue\n\nNotifications are a privacy concern for leaked information. \n\n### Description\n\nAndroid (not sure about iOS) notifications are logged in the os. This could include sensitive information from messages that can be accessed by rogue apps. \n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n\nI would like a setting that would allow the user to change notification setting between displaying \n\nA) full name and message (current behavior)\nB) name only + message field replaced with \"new message\"\nC) alert only (no name + no message, just \"new message\")\n\nAlso related (haven't opened an issue) but would like a feature to \"attempt to prevent keyboard from learning. \"incognito keyboard\" something like that. Basically tells the keyboard not to learn from what is being typed - similar (the same?) to a password field \n\nThank you\n",
