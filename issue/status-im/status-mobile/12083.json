  "body": "**Problem:** when a user onboard with a keycard he needs to remember PIN, PUK, Pairing code, and seed. That's too much information and makes the process difficult and confusing for approval\n\n**Solution studied:** we have dismissed the idea to derive puk and pairing from the seed, mostly for security reasons. See the issue here: https://github.com/status-im/status-react/issues/9064\n\n**Solution selected:** we will remove puk and pairing from the onboarding, and allow the user to get these informations in the keycard settings. We also need to allow a user to factory reset his card when he doesn't have his PUK and needs it, because he's blocked. Or when he needs his pairing code and he's blocked (e.g lost phone).\n\n**Description of the solution:**\nhttps://notes.status.im/puk-and-pairing-removal%20from%20onboarding?view\n\n**Sequential steps:**\n- [x] factory reset on keycard onboarding 1st screen \n    - PR https://github.com/status-im/status-react/pull/12055\n- [x] factory reset on login screen from a keycard multiaccount \n- [x] add copy to all screens where the user is blocked when he doesn't know his PUK saying \"you don't know your PUK? learn how to factory reset your card here\", redirecting to the flow to factory reset\n- [x] add copy to all screens where the user is blocked when he doesn't know his Pairing code saying \"you don't know your Pairing code? learn how to proceed here\", redirecting to the flow to factory reset\n- [x] remove PUK and Pairing from onboarding\n\n",
