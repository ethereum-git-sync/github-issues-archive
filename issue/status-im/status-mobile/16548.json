This is not a sync QR code`\r\n- `Oops! This sync QR code has expired`\r\n- `Oops! This sync QR code has been used before`\r\n- `Oops! Devices are not in the same network`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe errors need a little tweaking to be feasible.\r\n\r\n- `Oops! This is not a sync QR code` > `Oops! This is not a VALID sync QR code`\r\n  - This distinction is important because the application only has a concept of validity, the underlying data in the QR either validates or it doesn't validate. The distinction between something that **IS** a sync / pairing QR code or not, is a much harder thing for a computer to do.\r\n- `Oops! Devices are not in the same network` > `Oops! Cannot find your other device, are you sure you are on the same network?`\r\n  - This is something that we can't know, because the OS network interface will not allow us access to the network ID in many mobile phone contexts.\r\n- `Oops! This sync QR code has expired`\r\n  - A pairing session has a concept of expiry, but the connection parameters and `ConnectionString` do not. This is something that could be introduced but it requires additional work. At the moment an attempt to access an expired connection is the same as attempting to access a device that is not available on the network.\r\n  - This functionality will need to be introduced at the start of a mobile and desktop release cycle because it will introduce a breaking change with older versions.\r\n  - See https://github.com/status-im/status-go/issues/3759\r\n- `Oops! This sync QR code has been used before`\r\n  - This is not something that we can know currently.\r\n  - I'd argue that the long term concept of `Used before` shouldn't be known. We don't need to be stateful here, the QR code either works or doesn't work. The focus should be on idempotence of the pairing function. So multiple concurrent calls with the same QR will only execute once\r\n  - See https://github.com/status-im/status-go/pull/3750\r\n  \r\n`Oops! This sync QR code has been used before` is something that we can know in the context of the current application session. So while the app is running but not after the application has closed. We can / should have temporary knowledge of the QR codes scanned. But this needs to be rolled into making local pairing functions idempotent, which they aren't strictly at the moment, but can be, though will require additional work.",

This sync QR code has been used before` error, but sync does not actually happen (and the user gets stuck on the `Syncing devices...` screen). \r\n\r\nPlease correct me if I misunderstood the logic behind this scenario (when two users scan the same QR code) or missed something in the discussions.",
