This is not a sync QR code`\r\n- `Oops! This sync QR code has expired`\r\n- `Oops! This sync QR code has been used before`\r\n- `Oops! Devices are not in the same network`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe errors need a little tweaking to be feasible.\r\n\r\n- `Oops! This is not a sync QR code` > `Oops! This is not a VALID sync QR code`\r\n  - This distinction is important because the application only has a concept of validity, the underlying data in the QR either validates or it doesn't validate. The distinction between something that **IS** a sync / pairing QR code or not, is a much harder thing for a computer to do.\r\n- `Oops! Devices are not in the same network` > `Oops! Cannot find your other device, are you sure you are on the same network?`\r\n  - This is something that we can't know, because the OS network interface will not allow us access to the network ID in many mobile phone contexts.\r\n- `Oops! This sync QR code has expired`\r\n  - A pairing session has a concept of expiry, but the connection parameters and `ConnectionString` do not. This is something that could be introduced but it requires additional work. At the moment an attempt to access an expired connection is the same as attempting to access a device that is not available on the network.\r\n  - This functionality will need to be introduced at the start of a mobile and desktop release cycle because it will introduce a breaking change with older versions.\r\n  - See https://github.com/status-im/status-go/issues/3759\r\n- `Oops! This sync QR code has been used before`\r\n  - This is not something that we can know currently.\r\n  - I'd argue that the long term concept of `Used before` shouldn't be known. We don't need to be stateful here, the QR code either works or doesn't work. The focus should be on idempotence of the pairing function. So multiple concurrent calls with the same QR will only execute once\r\n  - See https://github.com/status-im/status-go/pull/3750\r\n  \r\n`Oops! This sync QR code has been used before` is something that we can know in the context of the current application session. So while the app is running but not after the application has closed. We can / should have temporary knowledge of the QR codes scanned. But this needs to be rolled into making local pairing functions idempotent, which they aren't strictly at the moment, but can be, though will require additional work.",

This sync QR code has been used before` error, but sync does not actually happen (and the user gets stuck on the `Syncing devices...` screen). \r\n\r\nPlease correct me if I misunderstood the logic behind this scenario (when two users scan the same QR code) or missed something in the discussions.",

    "body": "OH!\r\n\r\n> `User_C` Scan the same sync QR code\r\n\r\nI'm such an idiot! 🙈 Ok, so I've implemented a fix for the following scenario:\r\n\r\n- `Device A` creates a QR code\r\n- `Device B` scans the QR code\r\n- `Device B` scans the same QR code again\r\n- `Device B` shows error that the QR code has already been used.\r\n\r\nI don't know why I thought that would fix this issue. So, I can implement a fix for when `Device C`, `Device D` etc scan a QR code that has been previously used.\r\n\r\nWe do have code that prevents the access of a QR code after it has been used previously by returning an https error, but I need to investigate why that error causes the application to hang.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe `status-go` `geth.log` is normal.\r\nThe error below, from `Status.log`, is interesting. Looks like the UI is not handling the error returned by `status-go`: \r\n\r\n```\r\nINFO [status-im.signals.core:32] - local pairing signal received {:event {:type \"connection-success\", :action 1}}\r\nINFO [status-im2.contexts.syncing.events:70] - Initiated local pairing {:response \"{\\\"error\\\":\\\"[client] status not ok when getting challenge, received '403 Forbidden'\\\"}\", :event :syncing/input-connection-string-for-bootstrapping}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`[client] status not ok when getting challenge, received '403 Forbidden'` this error means that `Device A` refused to accept the connection from `Device C`. If another device receives a `403` when getting a challenge, this means that `Device A` has locked the QR code session.\r\n\r\nFYI, the reason we don't give more informative errors from `Device A` is because `Device A` is hosting a local but publicly local server. This means that attackers and legitimate actors both have access to the local paring endpoints, meaning that any error we return from these endpoints should be addressed to an attacker. Meaning we need to be as vague as possible while at the same time giving legitimate actors some level of information (which is achieved via context).",
