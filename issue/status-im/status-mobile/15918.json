  "body": "# Problem\r\n\r\nDepends on https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/pull/15891\r\n\r\nURL unfurling has no perfect solution, no single library that will magically do the trick, because every website can or cannot provide metadata about its URL, and there's no guarantee about the quality of the data. And every app out there has an opinion about how much unfurled data should be presented to users.\r\n\r\nSee this comment https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/pull/15891#issuecomment-1551664287 from @pavloburykh with examples of URLs that didn't unfurl.\r\n\r\n@pavloburykh also reported in comment https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/pull/15891#issuecomment-1552899794 that Giphy links are not delivered to the receiver. This could be a completely separate issue, but maybe it can be resolved while adding full support for Giphy in this issue.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nEven though there's no bullet proof way of unfurling URLs, we want to efficiently unfurl the most common websites. [oEmbed](https://oembed.com/) is a protocol supported by many known websites, like YouTube.\r\n\r\nCurrently, we extract metadata using only the OpenGraph protocol, but it is a LOT less efficient, since the entire website's HTML must be downloaded, parsed and metadata extracted from `og:*` tags. oEmbed data, on the other hand, is provided as a separate endpoint that returns a minimal JSON.\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\nThe majority of the work should live in status-go because on the client side we don't currently differentiate what type of data was unfurled.",
