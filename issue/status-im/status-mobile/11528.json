    "body": "FYI: @Ferossgp, @flexsurfer, @ulisesmac, we don't need to put energy into fixing the lint problems related to the macro because I'm pretty sure the macro will be removed/deprecated in the not so distant future.\r\n\r\nA long time ago I experimented with migrating away from the `rf/defn` and `rf/merge` combo and use the functional and conventional approach offered by re-frame, i.e. `reg-event-fx` and the `:fx` effect. Here's the branch if you want to take a look https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/tree/experiment/stop-using-rf-defn-and-rf-merge.\r\n\r\nI just need to find the time to come back to this topic and open a smaller PR to showcase the differences and benefits. It's more interesting than it looks, but I can't explain now :)",
