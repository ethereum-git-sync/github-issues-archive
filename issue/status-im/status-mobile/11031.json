  "body": "# Bug Report\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\n\r\nWhen user opens the Sticker/Image panel view while scrolling in chat view is not finished (and while keyboard is opened) - then Sticker/Image panel won't open from this moment, blinking each time user taps sticker/image icon. \r\nAll \"fixed\" after re-navigation to chat view (From chat view -> main Chats view -> again back to chat view) \r\n\r\nNo issue on iOS (just to note, - on iOS, unlike to Android there is no jumping experience when switching between keyboard/sticker(image) panels. So maybe we recalculate on Android based on view height which falls into false var when scrolling taking place) \r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nSticker/image panel is opened while scrolling in chat view is not finished and can still be opened after\r\n\r\n#### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n![2020_08_04_14_42_32_trim](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8749671/89291118-9b5e2980-d662-11ea-9ce7-6df9f3da02ee.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\n- Open Status and create new account\r\n- Open any chat with lot of messages (or join any chat and post several 30-lines large messages so you are able to scroll the chat view)\r\n- Put cursor in message input so keyboard appears\r\n- Scroll the chat view and while it scrolls - tap sticker/image icon to open respective panel\r\n- Try to open Sticker/Image panel after scrolling of chat view is finished\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n- Status version: release 1.5 / develop\r\n- Operating System: Android only ",
