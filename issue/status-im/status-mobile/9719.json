  "body": "# Problem\r\n\r\nAfter owning an ENS name for one year, you are allowed to release it. We don't currently support this in our UI, but it can be done through Etherscan.\r\n\r\nHowever, the UI does not respond when a person does so.\r\n\r\nI released my name rachel.stateofus.eth. I can still see the name on my profile afterward, and set it to display in chat. \r\n\r\nWhen I attempt to re-register the name, the UI says that it is connected to my chat key, and thus I am blocked doing so.\r\n\r\nThough it doesn't actually work. Clicking into details about my name showed `Transaction processing` (the release Tx was already complete at this point), and in chat my 3 word name was displayed.\r\n\r\nWhen I attempted to register it from another wallet, I found I had the option to do so.\r\n\r\nPer @3esmit:\r\n\r\n> Releasing does not remove the data defined in the resolver, because users can change the resolver - but we can add that if needed\r\n\r\n![IMG_6404](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15470435/71280775-31d71800-232a-11ea-9b5e-666b66145a21.PNG)\r\n_Profile with released ENS name_\r\n\r\n![IMG_6405](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15470435/71280797-3c91ad00-232a-11ea-881a-242605d7adee.PNG)\r\n_Options for released ENS name_\r\n\r\n![IMG_6401](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15470435/71280809-45827e80-232a-11ea-8f71-02f3377ecb28.PNG)\r\n_Clicking into detail on released ENS name_\r\n\r\n![IMG_6406](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15470435/71280820-4ca98c80-232a-11ea-8f9b-068a3c6092e3.PNG)\r\n_Attempting to re-register released ENS name_\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\nWhen a user releases their ENS name, the UI should acknowledge it:\r\n\r\n- Listen for the release event. Again per @3esmit - `can subscribe to the indexed topic about the namehash (not the label)`\r\n- Make the name inactive or remove from profile entirely\r\n- Ensure that user can not set it as their display\r\n- Do not display name in profile any more\r\n- Clear cache that is preventing me from re-registering the name \r\n\r\n## Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\nWhen a 1+ year old name is released, it no longer shows up in the user's profile but can be re-registered if available.",

    "body": "@rachelhamlin @3esmit Starting to dig into this a bit more and I'm still trying to make sure I understand current state of how ENS names are released before thinking about the best way to move forward.  Is current state just a hard-coded message on the details page saying that the name can't be released until 5/20/20 and then a \"pending\" message if the ENS name doesn't resolve when the user tries to navigate to the ENS view with the app?",

    "body": "I think the issue here is handling cases where the Status App thinks a name is correctly registred and associated, but the user from outside Status App changed something, such as released the ENS Name, changed the resolver, changed the chat pub key... \r\n\r\nThis also open two cases, the change is done in other devices and: \r\na. the status is closed\r\nb. the status is open\r\n\r\nFor a. this detection would be done by reading the state after login, and comparing if the pubkey changed. if not, just subscribe the events for b. case.\r\n \r\nHere is an example in a pseudo programming language:\r\n```python\r\ncheckName:\r\n  if user.ensName != null: \r\n    resolver = ensregistry.methods.resolver(namehash(user.ensName)).call()\r\n    pubkey = resolver.methods.pubkey(namehash(user.ensName)).call()\r\n    if pubkey != user.chatKey:\r\n      delete user.ensName\r\n      this.warnUserAboutNameRemoved()\r\n    else:\r\n      ensregistry.events.NewResolver(namehash(user.ensName)).subscribe(this.checkName)\r\n      resolver.events.PubkeyChanged(namehash(user.ensName)).subscribe(this.checkName)\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou dont need to make the function in this format, for example, this could be far improved for using less calls from state (as they cost resources as internet or cpu), in case of new resolver everything needs to be checked, but in case pubkey changed, it just needs to delete. \r\nAlso you should consider that resovler can return address 0, and this means that no pubkey can be resolved.\r\nYou also need to consider that method .pubkey might not be available, as the resolver can be set by user to any address they want. \r\n\r\n@rachelhamlin needs to tell us what should be done in UI side for warning user, if need any warning to start (perhaps can be silent). \r\n\r\nYou can see the ENS contracts here https://github.com/status-im/ens-usernames/tree/master/contracts/ens \r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the release feature becomes implemented in Status, it would also benefit from this already subscribed events.

    "body": "That all makes sense then.  Here's my thought on how to approach.\r\n\r\n1) At every login, check to see if there is a ENS name cached in the app db. If so, try to resolve it and the pubkey per your approach above. If it doesn't resolve, prompt the user with an error scenario regarding their ENS Name and remove it from local storage.\r\n\r\n2) Add a new feature in the UI that allows a user to release their ENS name if the statutory year has passed.  When this happens, disassociate the ENS name in the app once the release transaction is processed on the blockchain.\r\n\r\nThoughts? ",
