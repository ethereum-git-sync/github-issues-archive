They have derived and used one or more accounts beyond the first leaf. These accounts are not shown upon recovery, nor is the user informed that they need to manually generate the accounts again in order for them to be visible in the wallet\n* User receives tokens on an account that are not included in their asset list yet. The tokens received will not be visible, nor is the user informed that they need to manually add the token through `manage assets` in order for them to be visible in the wallet\n_A related issue is that the user is required to restart the app to ensure tokens are visible after manually adding them. See issue #10786 _\n\n## User story\n\n\n1. As a user I want to see 'active' accounts (i.e. accounts that I've used for transactions) that I have derived from my master keypair, when I recover my keys in **onboarding** (i.e. multiaccount) so that I feel reassured everything is still there\n1.
