  "body": "# Problem\r\n\r\nFollow-up for #17224\r\n\r\nThe `react-selector` component lacks the `Use Case` property from the Design System. Also, the component is located under `reactions`, when it should be under `selectors` and split the `react-selector` and `add-react-selector` components into separate files.\r\n\r\nEDIT: As [agreed](https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/issues/17245#issuecomment-1714155657), also adding the `react` component to quo2, which currently is embedded within the chat context.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Wrap the `status-im2.contexts.quo-preview.selectors.reactions` component with the preview container, as it was [missed during migration](https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/pull/17224#issuecomment-1715344635). Also rename it according to the design system (`reactions-selector`).\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\n@Francesca-G we have two different components here: `react` and `add-react` (the one with the +). Should they go into separate previews under `selectors` or keep them in the same preview?\r\n\r\n Also, what is the difference between the `React` and `React selector` components?\r\n\r\n",
