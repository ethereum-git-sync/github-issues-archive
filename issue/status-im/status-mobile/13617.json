As a user, I want dapp permissions to be automatically revoked every 30 days\n\n\n### Description\n\nCurrently it takes 2 tap per dApp to revoke the permissions which is cumbersome.\nI'd like a way to easily revoke multiple dApps permissions at once.\n\nMy aim is to do a regular clean up so US #3 would also fix my problem.\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n\n\n### Notes\n\n\n",
