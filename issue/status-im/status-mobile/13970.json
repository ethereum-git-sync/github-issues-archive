If so, how many times?\r\n- It's not clear what exactly are the conditions for a contact request to fail. Consider evaluating these conditions before anything else.\r\n",

I only very lightly captured what I saw on Figma, but the issue has always been very open-ended ;)\r\n\r\nGiven that the app's behavior is open for interpretation, I believe you'll need to talk to designers to understand what exactly we're trying to accomplish from the user's perspective. After that, it should be easier for you to define the technical specs + implementation plan.\r\n\r\nYou'll probably need to update this issue, because I think it's outdated or even incorrect.",
