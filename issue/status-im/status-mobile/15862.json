I don't use hot reload in the sense of reloading on every file save, so that's why I thought this issue was just mine and never bothered reporting.

I could go back to this dev flow, but since then I use a smartphone as the second device. Never more than 2.\r\n\r\n> I use 2 devices, while most other people use 1 device and do not face many of those DX issues i am facing\r\n\r\nThat's probably it, you and me are doing some things that other contributors aren't, so we pay the DX price, that's how it is. If we want to solve some of the problems we're reporting, I guess we'll need to fix them ourselves or adapt our flows somehow (which sucks).\r\n\r\nOne of the best things we can do when raising these issues is report exactly how to reproduce, whenever possible. If others can't reproduce and they don't have the problem, then... we end up where we are.\r\n\r\nMy comment is not very optimistic, sorry about that. Don't listen to me ;)",
