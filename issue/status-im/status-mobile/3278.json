  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\n*Type*: Bug\r\n\r\n*Summary*: When user is removed from a group chat by the chat's admin he doesn't receive message about he was deleted. If the user is in the chat at the moment the chat's name is changed to Unknown. If he is not in the chat the chat is just removed from the list. User receives messages about he was deleted and invited if he added to the group chat again\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\nRemoved user receives message '< chat admin username> removed you from group chat'. Group chat stays in the chat list and it's name is not changed\r\n\r\n#### Actual behavior\r\nIf the user is in the chat no message about removing is received, chat's name changed to Unknown.\r\n![a](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29711298/36032046-5fda65ae-0db5-11e8-897c-c800c63722ae.jpg)\r\n \r\nIf the user is on another view the group chat is just removed from the list.\r\nWhen removed user is added again to this chat he receives message '< chat admin username> removed you from group chat' and '< chat admin username> invited < public key>'.\r\n![b](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29711298/36032050-67026d04-0db5-11e8-956a-795bec0e8c31.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n- Open Status on two devices\r\n- Add user B to the contacts of the user A \r\n- As user B open the chat with user A and add him to contacts\r\n- As user A create group chat or open existing one and add user B to this group chat\r\n- As user B open joined group chat\r\n- As user A delete user B from the group chat\r\n- As user A add user B to mentioned group chat again \r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n* Status version: nightly build 0.9.10-660-g748b0fcf+\r\n* Operating System: \r\nReal device OnePlus 5, Android 8.0.0\r\nReal device iPhone X",
