If this works then I think it's a reasonable middle ground for the RC. But if both of them decline the CR (`A->B` and `B->A`), then they're out of luck.\r\n\r\nI think the ideal solution should somehow empower the user to decide if they want to re-accept CRs from anybody.

And in future we can improve the flow, basing on designers solution which will be provided for this case. \r\n\r\nBut current behaviour does not correspond to what we expect and should be improved. As I have mentioned [above](https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/issues/14798#issuecomment-1406335278):\r\n\r\n> 3. User B sends CR to User A - **as a result, User A does not receive any CR notifications but User B automatically appears in contact list of User A. User B in his turn is unable to send messages to User A, message input is blocked as CR is pending. User A does not appear in contact list for User B.\r\n\r\nYou can observe this behaviour on video which I have attached to comment above. \r\n\r\n\r\n",

But do we want to implement such flow for RC-1 or this will be done in future releases and for now we are good with [flow](https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/issues/14798#issuecomment-1406384153) described by @ilmotta ?\r\n\r\nBoth apply I believe, on RC, the only way to recover will be the flow described by @ilmotta , while eventually we'll add the screen that @John-44 mentioned, but won't make the cut for RC.",

User A send CR to User B\r\n2. User B declines User's A CR\r\n3. User B sends CR to User A\r\n\r\n**Actual result:** Users A and B become mutual contacts, but unwanted CR notification appears for User A.\r\n\r\n**Expected result:** we don't need to show CR notification for User A, as in this case Users already become mutual contacts and there is not need to accept it by User A. \r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97245802/215090962-9bcd1fb3-7e87-4e13-bcbd-2c9dcab13dec.mp4\r\n\r\n\r\n@cammellos I can log it in https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/pull/14878 or we can handle it separately.

In case if User A declines CR of User B, User B is still able to spam User A with contact requests by removing and re-adding User A to contacts using profile page (see video below). \r\n\r\n2. In case if User A who initially declined User's B CR sends CR to User B -  users will become mutual contacts, as expected. What is still unexpected - is this Unneeded CR that will be received by User B. We have discussed it here https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/issues/14798#issuecomment-1406469426 and agreed to fix it separately. We really might want to fix this issue for RC-1 as it causes additional unexpected behavior in case if User B declines User's A CR: User A will be removed from User's B contact list, but User B will remain as a contact for User A. \r\n\r\nIn this video you can observe cases which are described above. \r\nBased on that we need to decide if current behaviour is acceptable for rc-1\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97245802/215843363-93fbcce2-40be-45c5-ab03-bd13b5557823.mp4\r\n\r\n[USER_A.zip](https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/files/10549440/USER_A.zip)\r\n[USER_B.zip](https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/files/10549441/USER_B.zip)\r\n\r\n",
