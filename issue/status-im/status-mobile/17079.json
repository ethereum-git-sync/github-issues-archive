Not sure If I am missing something, but using the above steps I am not able to reproduce the issue.\r\n\r\nHi @Parveshdhull, unfortunately, we don't have exact steps to reproduce this issue. In my experience and during e2e tests, the \"jump to\" functionality becomes unresponsive after the app has been in the background for a certain amount of time. \r\n\r\nInitially, it took only around 1 minute to trigger this issue, but now I am not able to reproduce it either with such steps. It seems the issue can occur even without enabling the background.\r\n\r\nIn this case, as on record, it reproduced when a user taps the \"jump to\" button after receiving several messages from another user, even without backround enabling. However, even these steps are not consistently exact, seems like this issue occurs randomly\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/assets/52490791/c13b7057-f732-4171-97ab-a80eed1a0c92\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProbably logcat logs can help:\r\n[android_logcat.txt](https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/files/12409053/android_logcat.txt)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
