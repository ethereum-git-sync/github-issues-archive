  "body": "Reset card flow works perfectly well if keycard remains tapped during the whole flow which is \nstep 1-  ask the user to tap \nstep 2- show a warning screen\nstep 3- ask the pin\n\nIf the user does not keep his card hold on to the phone the following can happen\n- user is asked to tap his card (step 1)\n- user taps but removes the card \n- user is prompted the warning screen (step 2)\n- user clicks next\n- user is asked to tap again\n- user taps an remove the card\n- user is asked for his PIN (step 3)\n- user is not asked to tap again\n- \"wrong PIN\" message is shown\n\nProblem: the user believes he cannot proceed because of wrong PIN, and has tapped three times whereas he could have tapped only once\n\nPossible solution:\n- implement the flow like this\n1 - show the warning screen \n2 - ask the pin \n3 - ask the user to tap \n- change error message from \"wrong PIN\" to \"connection was lost\"",
