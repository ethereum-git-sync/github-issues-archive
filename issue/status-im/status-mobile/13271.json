  "body": "# Feature Issue\r\n\r\nWe need an emoji keyboard for creating thumbnails for the community channel. And for that, we are using the [fork](https://github.com/status-im/rn-emoji-keyboard) of [rn-emoji-keyboard](https://github.com/status-im/rn-emoji-keyboard), and modified it as per our design requirements. It will be great if we can implement this in the Clojure script instead of using this dependency.\r\n\r\nImplementation should be mostly straightforward. We need to populate the flat list with emojis and filter them when searched, etc.\r\n\r\n**Original Designs:** https://github.com/status-im/status-react/issues/12375\r\n\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\nEmoji keyboard should be implemented as a standalone component in the Clojure script, which we can embed in other screens if needed.\r\n",
