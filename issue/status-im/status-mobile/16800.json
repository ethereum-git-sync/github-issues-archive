  "body": "# Bug Report\r\n\r\n\r\n## Problem \r\n\r\nThis issue reproduces in different ways depending on the direction of interaction between clients (mobile<>mobile, desktop<>mobile, etc.). All 4 scenarios and their associated issues will be described below.\r\n\r\n**Main case:** UserA receives a reply to their message with an image from UserB. \r\n\r\n### 1. Desktop > Mobile\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n1. Mobile user and Desktop user: join a community\r\n2. Mobile: send a message in the channel and open the home community screen\r\n3. Desktop: send a reply to the message with an image\r\n4. Mobile: keep an eye on the unread indicator on the community and AC\r\n**Actual result:** no message, no unread indicator on the community, no notification in AC\r\n5. Mobile: send the app to background, reopen the app\r\n6. Mobile: check the notifications\r\n**Actual result:** the number of unread messages is displayed on the community/channel; but still no notification in AC (reopening the app doesn't help)\r\n\r\nAlso, sometimes Desktop user needs to send another message in order for the reply to be received by Mobile.\r\n\r\n**Expected result:** the reply is delivered to the Mobile user without sending another message and sending the app to background; notification in AC is received.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Mobile logs\r\n\r\nAfter background\r\n[geth.log](https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/files/12184708/geth.log)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/assets/67952253/852779b4-36c1-476d-9e50-cfe98416d0ab\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### 2. Desktop > Desktop\r\n\r\nThe steps are the same: Desktop1 sends a reply with an image to Desktop2\r\n\r\n**Actual result:** \r\n- No notification in AC \r\n- Loading skeleton is shown in the channel until reopening the desktop app (you canâ€™t see any history)\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/assets/67952253/85914245-3be0-4587-8b99-b13cbf4ff1cb\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### 3. Mobile > Desktop\r\n\r\n1. Mobile user sends a reply with an image to Desktop user\r\n2. Desktop users checks AC when the notification is received\r\n\r\n**Actual result:** the notification comes to AC, but the image is not displayed there\r\n**Expected behavior:** can see the image in the notification\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1263\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-07-27 at 11 25 15\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/assets/67952253/46bc7d6f-d1bc-4115-ad49-79236e4dceb4\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### 4. Mobile (UserA) > Mobile (UserB)\r\n\r\nMobile1 sends a reply with an image to Mobile2\r\n\r\n\r\n<img width=\"301\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-07-27 at 13 58 22\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/assets/67952253/f1ad2fac-cf8a-4613-bb45-1387bcc8a0fc\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n- Status version: Mobile: nightly 27/07, Desktop: master 26/07 https://ci.infra.status.im/job/status-desktop/job/master/2722/\r\n- Operating System: Android, iOS, macOS Ventura 13.4\r\n\r\n\r\n[comment]: # (Please, add logs/notes if necessary)\r\n\r\n",
