  "body": "# Feature Issue\n\n[comment]: # (Please replace ... with your information. Remove < and >)\n\n### User Story\n\nAs a user of both Status and Tomochain, I would love to see these two great projects combined in a way that will allow others in both communities to interact on a single platform which is Status.\n\n### Description\n\n[comment]: # (Describe the feature you would like and include designs and Figma links if available.)\n[comment]: # (Describe the use cases the implementation should cover. E.g. New users, existing users, public chat, group chat, etc)\n*Summary*: ... Already, I have gone in and I see that it is possible to incorporate the native Tomochain Token onto status. Everything works perfectly it is just the fact that a custom Tomochain(TOMO) RPC is needed and also some minor UI revisions relating to the TOMO ticker and price feed. \n\n\n\n### Notes\n\nTomoChain information:\n\nRPC URL: https://rpc.tomochain.com\nChain/ Network ID: 88\nNetwork Name: TomoChain\nTicker/Symbol: TOMO\nExplorer Information: https://scan.tomochain.com\n\n\n[comment]: # (For the developer who will implement. Include planning poker estimates, guidance, etc.)",
