This pr to remove the feature flag can then be used for QA and Design to ensure everything is feature complete and this issue can be closed.\r\n\r\nIt is unclear from the designs whether the transaction Progress Page will change depending whether it is a bridging transaction or not, please align with design to see.\r\nhttps://www.figma.com/file/HKncH4wnDwZDAhc4AryK8Y/Wallet-for-Mobile?type=design&node-id=2416-492967&mode=design&t=RuyhufmiW7Y5H6pU-4\r\n",
