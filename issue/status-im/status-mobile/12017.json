Is essentially an hash ratchet, which gives you PFS, but not so good post-compromise security.\r\n\r\nOther options could be available.\r\n\r\nThe UI might have to be aligned as part of this task (we currently allow users to \"follow\" invitation only communities, but this might have to be revisited).",
