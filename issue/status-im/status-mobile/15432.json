  "body": "Currently, there is a major flaw in the composer implementation. The composer is implemented in a way to grow under the content. In the [designs](https://www.figma.com/file/wA8Epdki2OWa8Vr067PCNQ/Composer-for-Mobile?node-id=3079-279284&t=BCk5hgKBYGoMpipk-0) and in this [video](https://vimeo.com/727812151) it is showing that it should grow over the content. Growing the composer under the content and not over it negates the whole point of our composer being a \"bottom sheet\".\r\n\r\nIn addition, the composer's code has many randomly defined numbers which is hard to know what do they mean. Trying to clean it up is going to be more difficult and may create more mess. Also, the composer is currently using code from different places (status-im1, status-im2).\r\n\r\nLastly, there are a few other problems, UI bugs, and missing details with the composer, and trying to trace them would be tedious.",
