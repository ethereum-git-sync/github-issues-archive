  "body": "_Part of #9274 onboarding with Keycard epic (mark as checked there, when closing this issue)_\n\nThere are two pieces of copy that might be better: The subtitle and the \"About key storage\" section. \n\n**The problems I see in the subtitle:**\n\n* `Your key is stored locally` – Is that correct when it comes to Keycard;\n– `There is no copy` – Why should there be? Is that addressing something the user wants to know?;\n\nI suggest this piece of text should address **why this screen exists**, **why is there a choice** and what is the correct choice? Also, we never mention **what is a Keycard** and how to get one.\n\nI suggest something like:\n`Your key belongs to you and you get to choose how to store it. Storing it on your device is secure, but it’s even more secure to use a Keycard`\n\n**The problems I see in the \"About key storage\" section:**\n– \"Status will never access your private key\" we did not mention term \"private\" before;\n– \"Be sure to backup your Seed phrase\" – We did not offer the seed phrase yet so the user might be confused they missed it;\n\nI suggest this piece of text should explain in more detail **what a key is**, **how is it stored**, mention **security enclaves** and not mention the seed phrase just yet, or say that the user will be offered to save it later.\n\ncc @corpetty @hesterbruikman \n\nFor now, i suggest to come up wit ha better copy and update it.\nI suggest also that this screen should be slightly changed in the future iterations to:\n\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3115606/67847877-93ef7a00-fb3e-11e9-9367-8efd6aefc41a.png)",
