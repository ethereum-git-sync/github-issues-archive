  "body": "# Bug Report\n\n## Problem\n\nIssue came from user report: \nAt one point it may happen that user able to login to some of accounts without entering the password \nbut just tapping upon multiaccount item on 'Your keys' view. \nIt may be connected to navigation or the way we sort accounts on 'Your keys' screen after curtain (9 items in user case, 10 in my case) number of accounts created.\nSee steps to reproduce\n\n#### Expected behavior\n\nIf I am on `Your keys` view - there is no way I can loginn to any account without just entering password (but the actual root cause of this particular issue might be different - like account sorting on \"Your keys\" view after 9+ accounts created in Status) \n#### Actual behavior\n\nCan login to acccount via just tap it's item from the list of 'Your keys' view.\n\n![123213d](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8749671/80105744-a8f31600-8581-11ea-8d6b-723c32319e0c.gif)\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\n1)  Open Status\n2) Create new account -> Close Status -> Tap `<` back at top-left button\n3) Repeat 2nd item 7 times more\n**Actual result:** You should end up having 8 accounts. Notice that each time when you open Status after account creating accounts sorted in order they were created (latest create is the first in list on `Your keys` and the very first acc is at the bottom)\n\n4) Create one more account.\n**Actual result:** You should end up having 9 accounts. However, that last account created is not the  \nfirst one in `You keys` \n5) Login to the second account from the top of the `Your keys` screen with `Save password` option\n6) Close Status\n7) Open Status\n**Actual result != Expected result:** You appear on the login view of the account which was (and keep staying) very first in the list we had in 4th step\n8) Tap `<` back button to navigate to list of accounts (`Your keys` screen)\n9) Tap upon the account you logged in in the 5th item\n**Actual result:** You logged into this account right away. Appear on Chats view.\n10)_(Optional to show issue further)_ If you login with `Save password` option (or FaceID or TouchID) into any but first account (basically repeat 5th-8th steps for third-fourth.... accs) you will be able to log in to this account just via tap. If you login to the first account then as expected (until forced LogOut) you will autologin to this account after Open-Close Status)\n\n\n### Additional Information\n- Status version: Release1.3/Develop\n- Operating System: Android and iOS",
