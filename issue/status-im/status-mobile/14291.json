    "body": "hi @pavloburykh thank you for testing my pr #14018 \r\n\r\nI am aware that some of the issue you have found with the PR are not implemented as is on the designs. The intention with the current implementation on the #14018 is to address some on the issues on the community screen while still keeping the PR small to be well reviewed.\r\n\r\nFollowing our discusion with the design team, some of the things addressed in the PR have been scoped out. Just to mention some of those captured in this issue\r\n\r\n**ISSUE 5 & ISSUE 6**\r\n\r\nThese two issues have been scroped out and are to be implemented on post MVP.\r\n\r\n**ISSUE 4**\r\n\r\nThe white screen splashes is not specific to this PR. Its caused by our implementation of navigation and is expected to happen. I wouldnt say its a bug at this point. cc @Parveshdhull \r\n\r\n\r\n**ISSUE 2**\r\n\r\nThe discover card images are placeholders. The final implementation would be probably be different. Since using images would mean that they will be included in the release we decided to used react native view component instead of images to achieve the same design layout as images are not that much necessary in this case.\r\n\r\nAs for the communities empty state placeholder  case, its not that much necessary to add the design as this is just at the moment an illustration and is not to be implemented by the dev team as i understand from @pedro-et  \r\n\r\n**THING OF CONCERN**\r\n\r\n**ISSUE 1**\r\n\r\nI would prefer to add communities scroll behaviours in a separate PR just so that I can avoid #14018 becoming such a large PR. The scrolling behaviours would include include global scroll behaviours which would make the PR large.\r\n\r\n**ISSUE 2**\r\n\r\nI will add the accessabilty id as you have highlighted.\r\n\r\nThank you @pavloburykh \r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "> hi @jo-mut Thank you for pinging me. I can take a look into Issue 4 once the PR is merged.\r\n\r\nHi @jo-mut  I checked issue 4 and it doesn't look related to navigation.\r\nAs navigation is working fine with less number of communities.\r\nIt is most probably a performance issue, which caused this delay and white screen (on some devices and black on others) with 4+ communities. I guess we need to optimize these community cards.",
