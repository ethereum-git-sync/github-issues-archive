    "body": "@ReneeAB thanks for the bug report! Can you please rephrase this step and maybe split it into smaller steps: `Slide the \"Fee\" bar from right to left several time very fast the click on the blue arrow button to send several times (this is what I did the first time see screenshot 1) )`? I guess this is the key to reproduce the bug but I can't get it on my device, so would really appreciate if you can check for typos. Recording a video would be also very helpful (with \"show touches\" set to on). \r\n\r\nAs another option, maybe you can install one of the nightly builds where we have extra logging enabled, so if app is using Wifi then video (1 picture per 1 second) and logcat will be sent to us. Just use this build http://artifacts.status.im:8081/artifactory/nightlies-local/im.status.ethereum-a68f06.apk and comment if issue can be reproduced. If yes then specify date-time-minutes when app was launched, country and device model so we can find your session. Thanks in advance!",
