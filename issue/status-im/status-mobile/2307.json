  "body": "Currently the persistent layer of the application is using Realm https://github.com/realm/realm-js. \r\n\r\nRealm has the following advantages:\r\n- fine grained queries updated in real time\r\n- fine grained updates and delete of properties\r\n- a story for migrations\r\n- fast\r\n\r\nHowever when using in from cljs world the following problems arise:\r\n- every interaction with realm requires conversions, some of them being not trivial (e.g realm works with typed objects which cannot be directly converted with js->clj, sometimes the app expects keywordized map sometimes not so there is no generic way to convert, lists are returned as maps with list indexes as keys which needs to be converted afterward for inner lists of properties...). This makes realm not so fast in our case and gives lots of room for errors and performance issues in the future.\r\n- we can't use live-updated queries because of how the current persistence layer is set up and even if this is changed it is hard to tell how it will work out since we still need the conversions\r\n- realm has its own schemas and our specs need to be twisted to forbid keys which is against the concepts of specs\r\n- there is no tests of this persistent layer and I am not sure how to make tests for realm-js since until now that aspect has been avoided by overwritting events that touch realm in the tests.\r\n\r\nOn top of that the persistence layer is called in various ways which adds complexity when reasoning about the application flow.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to rethink our persistence layer in a way that is testable and has clear implications in the code.\r\n\r\nFirst we will need:\r\n- to swap the persistance layer to something simpler (asyncStorage for instance, suggestions are welcome) and define a minimal interface with it\r\n- to refactor the code by using effects for read and writes systematically, and preferring reads from app-db over the persistence layer when possible.\r\n- to write regression and performance tests",
