Remove < and >)\r\n\r\n### User Story\r\n\r\nAs a user, I want to get my signing phrase even after the initial onboarding, in the following scenarios:\r\n\r\n- I forgot my signing phrase\r\n- I upgraded my app, the new phrase was generated automatically in db migration and I don't know what it is.\r\n- I recovered my account on a different device and a new signing phrase has been generated for me and I don't know what it is.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n*Type*: Feature\r\n\r\nCurrent suggestion is to use Console contact:\r\n\r\nAnother way to look at it, is Console is just another contact, why can't he send a new message to old users saying \"Hey in this update you now have a signing phrase, it is XYZ. The idea of Console was to be like your \"Settings\" but in a conversation interface He's like Windows \"Paperclip\" only less annoying (hopefully)\r\n\r\nFollowing the paperclip idea, we can have Console chat up user and say something like: \"You just recovered your account. To keep it safe we generated a new signing phrase, here it is, write it down, keep it safe etc.\r\n\r\nhttp://139.162.61.252/index.php/Anti-phishing_signing_phrase_feature_discussion",
