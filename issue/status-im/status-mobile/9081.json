  "body": "# Problem\r\n\r\nAs a user with a limited data plan, I want the bandwidth usage to be substantially lower, so that I can use Status on 3G/4G with a limited data plan.\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n```\r\nApp version: 0.13.1 (2019080817)\r\nOS: ios\r\nNode version: v.0.25.0-beta.0\r\nMailserver: mail-03.gc-us-central1-a.eth.beta\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing iOS, current period under Cellular data says the following for similar apps:\r\n- Status 14.8 GB\r\n- Telegram 1.8 GB\r\n- Line 884 MB\r\n- Fastmail 210 MB\r\n- Signal 203 MB\r\n\r\nNote that all apps outside of Status have attachments and images in them.\r\n\r\nTo calibrate for usage, here are the corresponding numbers for Screentime the last 7 days:\r\n- Telegram 2h 29m\r\n- Status 1h 18m\r\n- Line 1h 8m\r\n- Fastmail 27m\r\n- Signal 11m\r\n\r\nNote that in Line and Signal I'm not in any public channels, but in Telegram I'm in several that are a lot more noisy than Status.\r\n\r\n**Comparing to Telegram, Line and Signal, this means we currently consume 10-20x more bandwidth, *without* attachments. As a user, this is an unacceptable user experience.**\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\nAs a somewhat representative user, but with a limited data plan I care more about this than cover traffic/metadata protection.\r\n\r\n## Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\nBandwidth usage reduced 10-20x so that it is within a factor or three of comparable apps, like Telegram, Line and Signal.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\nIn light of the current financial situation, timeline, and growing the core app user base, it might be the case that we partition the problem in two:\r\n\r\na) Continue long-term 'fundamental' research in conjunction with other projects to develop a better alternative (Block.Science/Swarm/Nym/libp2p)\r\nb) bandaid to help with adoption and traction of Status the app, w/o as strong metadata/decentralization guarantees, a la Infura-for-chat (basically what we have already with mailserver)\r\n\r\nSide note: I also searched for 'bandwidth' in open issues and couldn't find a relevant one, which is a bit surprising given that it's a very common user complaint, anecdotally. User feedback not making its way into concrete problem descriptions? cc @rachelhamlin @hesterbruikman \r\n\r\n## Future Steps\r\n\r\nReplace Whisper.",

Perhaps cause it is too intimidating? Or they give feedback in other forums and then there's a lack of follow up? Something re community link missing here, not quite sure what. cc @jonathanbarker @j-zerah FYI.\r\n\r\n> What kind of sacrifice are we willing to make here?

Both client will be dockerized and run through docker-compose, at the end of the tests metrics for each container can be collected with docker stats.\r\n\r\nWe can probably easily get it in the test suite (status-protocol-go), the only dependencies would be docker/compose and golang, it's would take some more time to make it a red/green test (it's more of a benchmark), as well as we don't have isolated network conditions for now, so it also depends on the overall traffic of the network, but we can take that into account when measuring.",

You could just have it as an option and have some UI element that notes what kind of public channel it is.\r\n\r\nThe issue is not due to public chats I believe ( we have high usage even without joining any public chat from the previous bandwidth tests ), it's mainly due to discovery topics, as you  receive messages not sent to you, while in public chat is the chance is lower (there's a chance that your bloom filter matches some other topic, but it's probably not huge), so unless we completely bypass whisper not sure we can optimize those much, but worth having a look.",

For example, I remember some benchmark saying we spend 20% of traffic on Infura, which seems insane but makes sense given lack of transaction indexing (?). This means it is might become the bottleneck with Waku mode in place, which would hint at using attacking the indexing problem, e.g. with something algorithmic like @yenda was working on, or indexing a la thegraph that @bgits suggested",

    "body": "According to [Network Metrics](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/runmetrics/#network-metrics) section of Docker docs:\r\n\r\n>__Network metrics are not exposed directly by control groups.__ There is a good explanation for that: network interfaces exist within the context of network namespaces. The kernel could probably accumulate metrics about packets and bytes sent and received by a group of processes, but those metrics wouldn’t be very useful. You want per-interface metrics (because traffic happening on the local `lo` interface doesn’t really count). But since processes in a single `cgroup` can belong to multiple network namespaces, those metrics would be harder to interpret: multiple network namespaces means multiple `lo` interfaces, potentially multiple `eth0` interfaces, etc.; so this is why there is no easy way to gather network metrics with control groups.\r\n\r\nSo as an alternative they propose creating IP Tables rules:\r\n\r\n>IPtables (or rather, the netfilter framework for which iptables is just an interface) can do some serious accounting.\r\n>For instance, you can setup a rule to account for the outbound HTTP traffic on a web server:\r\n>```\r\n>$ iptables -I OUTPUT -p tcp --sport 80\r\n>```\r\n>There is no -j or -g flag, so the rule just counts matched packets and goes to the following rule.\r\n>\r\n>Later, you can check the values of the counters, with:\r\n>```\r\n>$ iptables -nxvL OUTPUT\r\n>```\r\n\r\nWhich can be an issue since access to IP Tables requires `root` priviledges.",

Assuming that `$CID` is ID of a container we want:\r\n```\r\nTASKS=/sys/fs/cgroup/devices/docker/$CID/tasks\r\nPID=$(head -n 1 $TASKS)\r\nmkdir -p /var/run/netns\r\nln -sf /proc/$PID/ns/net /var/run/netns/$CID\r\nip netns exec $CID netstat -i\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich should get use output like this:\r\n```\r\nadmin@mail-01.do-ams3.eth.test:~ % sudo ip netns exec $CID netstat -i \r\nKernel Interface table\r\nIface      MTU    RX-OK RX-ERR RX-DRP RX-OVR    TX-OK TX-ERR TX-DRP TX-OVR Flg\r\neth0      1500   365190      0      0 0        305317      0      0      0 BMRU\r\nlo       65536        0      0      0 0             0      0      0      0 LRU\r\n```\r\nWhich gives us things like:\r\n\r\n* `(RX|TX)-OK` - Packets received/sent correctly.\r\n* `(RX|TX)-ERR` - Packets received/sent but with incorrect checksum.\r\n* `(RX|TX)-DRP` - Packets dropped because of full buffer.\r\n* `(RX|TX)-OVR` - Packets dropped due to exceeding TTL or other timing reason.\r\n\r\nNow, packets are nice and all but we don't know their sizes, so that doesn't give us actual bandwidth.",
