    "body": "True, that was my first PR for status. The root cause of the issue is the fact, that we have to create new 1-1 chat whenever we receive new chat message from contact X, even if chat with contact X was already deleted before - the reason is that we can't know if upon deleting some chat, we don't want to ever receive message from deleted contact in the future.\r\nIf that would be relaxed (it's ok to never receive message from contact whose 1-1 chat was deleted), it would be very simple, we would just flag the chat as deleted and check incoming message against it.",
