  "body": "### User Story\r\n\r\nAs a developer, I want Pull requests on Github to reflect things that have a possibility of being merged, and branches to show branches that might be of use at some point.\r\n\r\nIdeally this would also include an issue cleanup, but this seems like a significantly larger endeavour and might be something @annadanchenko  and @sla-shi have more ideas about (wontfix labeling etc).\r\n\r\nI have appended a list of specific suggestions. I suggest we first come to agreement on what to delete in this thread, then actualize it.\r\n\r\n### Suggestion\r\n\r\n### 1. Close all PRs older than 30 days\r\n- https://github.com/status-im/status-react/pull/822\r\n- https://github.com/status-im/status-react/pull/841\r\n- https://github.com/status-im/status-react/pull/1183\r\n- https://github.com/status-im/status-react/pull/1188\r\n- https://github.com/status-im/status-react/pull/1198\r\n- https://github.com/status-im/status-react/pull/1269\r\n- https://github.com/status-im/status-react/pull/1465\r\n\r\nThese are likely to be out of date (rebasing, contributor gone), and forces us to keep up some velocity w.r.t old PRs. Worst case: contributor reopens PR under a new name.\r\n\r\n### 2. Delete all merged and closed branched\r\n\r\nAll the ones that have been merged are already in our repo history, so they serve no purpose.\r\nhttps://github.com/status-im/status-react/branches/all\r\n\r\n### 3. Delete all stale branches that aren't release branches\r\n\r\nThis one I'm not 100% certain on, but all branches except the release ones seems to serve no purpose. Perhaps even the release branches if we use tags now?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/status-im/status-react/branches/stale\r\n\r\n- [x] 1. Close all PRs older than 30 days\r\n- [x] 2. Delete all merged and closed branched\r\n- [x] 3. Delete all stale branches that aren't release branches\r\n",
