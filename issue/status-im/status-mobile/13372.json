For example:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2212681/169018067-57716cf0-f4c0-4968-809e-9fdb8a3ecc45.png)\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/status-im/status-react/pull/13369\r\n* https://github.com/status-im/status-react/pull/13337\r\n* https://github.com/status-im/status-react/pull/13321\r\n\r\nThis appears to be some kind of timing issue, that is triggered when the PR branch is rebased and force pushed:\r\nhttps://github.com/status-im/gh-rebase-fix-test/blob/150eedcafd346a46aa70fc3d13e90bcdf33e4c72/merge-pr.sh#L128-L132\r\n\r\nAs seen in the screenshot, it appears the PR is closed before the force-push takes effect. One major issue with this is that the commits and the diffs disappear from the PR, making it useless for documenting history of changes.",

Amend the PR's head branch (locally)\r\n>3. Merge the PR's head branch (locally) into the base branch.\r\n>4. Push the base branch and the head branch.\r\n>5. Depending on the order in which you do step \"4\", you get different outcomes:\r\n>\r\n>* If you push the base branch first, then head branch, the PR will be marked as closed.\r\n>* If you push the head branch first, then the base branch, the PR will be marked as merged.\r\n>* If you push both base and head branches in the same invocation of git push (ie. with --all or similar), then one of the above cases will apply, depending on the lexicographical sort order of the two ref names.\r\n>\r\n>Ideally, the outcomes should be the same regardless of the push order i.e PR marked as merged. We have had a few reports of this bug and our engineers are already working fo fix. It's very useful for us to have more data points, so thank you for submitting this report!\r\n\r\nBut their description is wrong. They say that:\r\n\r\n>* __If you push the base branch first, then head branch, the PR will be marked as closed.__\r\n\r\nBut our case is clearly:\r\n\r\n>* __If you push the head branch first, then the base branch, the PR will be marked as merged.__\r\n\r\nExcept we get a PR becoming \"closed\".
