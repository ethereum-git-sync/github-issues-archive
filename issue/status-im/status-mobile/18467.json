In this way, we will be able to remove the other 2 shared values.\r\n\r\n**transformOrigin**: https://reactnative.dev/docs/next/transforms#transform-origin\r\n\r\n**Current Code**: https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/blob/4eff9cc39cda0c33ca4a53ae9079d58345258d8f/src/status_im/contexts/chat/messenger/messages/list/view.cljs#L114C3-L114C3\r\n\r\n**Depends on**: https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/issues/18291",

    "body": "**Further Notes:**\r\n\r\nWhen keyboard is closed, screen/content suddenly falls(I think we can't control that, its default behaviour), and we only receive keyboard closed event after that.\r\nBut as in the scrolled state we had smaller avatar, after falling avatar will be in smaller state until we change it back to big avatar.\r\nFor some devices this transition will be fast enough(especially ios), so we will not notice. But for some slower device this sudden transition will be very clear.\r\nI am not sure what is expected behaviour, so I animated this transition as we can see in the end of video.\r\n\r\n\r\n`on-layout` -> `(reanimated/animate distance-from-list-top ...`\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/assets/17097240/421fec23-044f-4300-8d5f-fc164a9944af\r\n\r\n",
