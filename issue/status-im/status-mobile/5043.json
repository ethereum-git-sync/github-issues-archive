    "body": "What we could do is create an exception that if you swipe a cell that is partially covered by a FAB, the FAB would move its position 1:1 along with the cell (animate it on a X axis). But a better alternative would be to change the swipe mechanism so that instead of tapping the uncovered button to delete, you'd only have to swipe for a set minimum distance: after you'd swiped for say 60 points we'd register the delete action. It's popular among apps I use and allows for faster triage of unwanted chats/dapps, if hard to explain I can create a prototype for this behaviour. What you think @andmironov ?",

    "body": "@errorists I like the long-press interaction more than swipe to delete. Here is my reasoning:\r\n\r\n1. In the near future, we may want to consider swiping between Home, Wallet and Profile tabs on Android. If so, swipe to delete may interfere with swiping between tabs\r\n2. Long-press can display menu with additional options like \"Mark as read\" or \"Pin to the top\". It's a good place to display them. Telegram does it and it does not have swipe gesture.\r\n3. We've seen some bug reports about our swipe to delete gesture. E.g. that it brakes UI when swiped to the left and then back to the right\r\n4. If we go with swipe to delete, I'd ask for additional confirmation (show a modal). Alternatively, show a status bar with a revert button\r\n\r\ncc @andmironov ",

    "body": "@lukaszfryc All good points! \r\n\r\n1. I've considered this heavily, but in the context of having separate tabs inside the Home screen, for example swiping between Chats, Group Chats and Dapps.\r\n2. Technically we could allow for additional actions inside the swipe gesture, exposing different buttons by swiping from left and right. Depending on how often you access those actions, gestures might be more convenient, but that's not saying either is worse, just more appropriate for different actions.\r\n3. Agree there, our current implementation is lacking. It doesn't follow the finger properly, it's jerky in movement and buggy, when dragged past its bounds a white rectangle would slowly cover the text. That would be my main reason to go with a menu, unless we can make the swipe gesture nicely designed and implemented we shouldn't be introducing them at all.\r\n4. Agree, I've already updated it with an alert prompt after feedback but a snackbar with Undo button would be even nicer.\r\n",

    "body": "> 1. I've considered this heavily, but in the context of having separate tabs inside the Home screen, for example swiping between Chats, Group Chats and Dapps.\r\n\r\nGood idea. It's how Facebook Messenger works. And, because of that, the app uses long press instead of swipe to delete a chat. \r\n\r\n> 2. Technically we could allow for additional actions inside the swipe gesture, exposing different buttons by swiping from left and right. Depending on how often you access those actions, gestures might be more convenient, but that's not saying either is worse, just more appropriate for different actions.\r\n\r\nSwipe gesture maybe a bit more convenient if you have lot of items to remove. But only a little since you need to confirm each action anyway (delete dialog). If you want to remove many chats or dapps quickly, I'd consider some bulk action (option to select many items). But, it's not needed now.\r\n \r\n> 4. Agree, I've already updated it with an alert prompt after feedback but a snackbar with Undo button would be even nicer.\r\n\r\nI'd keep it simple now and use dialog. We already show it when you want to remove a chat while being on the chat screen. You click chat menu, press delete and confirm in the dialog.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n@errorists summing up, do you think we should remove swipe to delete and go with long press? Can we have opinion of other designers, @andmironov?",
