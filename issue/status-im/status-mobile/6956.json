  "body": "# Problem\r\n\r\nWhenever we make changes to the way message-ids are generated it creates upgradability issues. It happens again in latest release with message responses https://github.com/status-im/status-react/issues/6903#issuecomment-443127013\r\n\r\n# Implementation\r\n\r\nWe need to pass the message-ids with the message to avoid that in the future. These are the problems I think should be taken into consideration:\r\n- pk of the sender and chat-id might be prefixed to the message-id locally to avoid forged message-id overwriting previous messages\r\n- chat-id needs to be consistent so the previous point might just move the problem there\r\n\r\n# Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n- message-id is speced and easily reproducible in other implementations of the communication protocol\r\n- message-id is passed in messages with reasonable guarantees that it cannot be used to overwrite previous messages (ignoring existing ids can be considered but this will open up to MIT attacks if we don't prefix pk, an attacker could silent someone in a public chat by overwritting all their messages for a broad part of the network if they have better connectivity)\r\n\r\n",
