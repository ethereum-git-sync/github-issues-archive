  "body": "_Part of #9264 keycard sign in epic (mark as checked there, when closing this issue)_\n\nAfter 3 wrong passcode entry attempts, the key the user is trying to access should become \"Frozen\" which means that the user can no longer access it just with their passcode. To access a frozen key the user has to use either the pairing and PUK codes or the seed phrase.\n\nWhen the key is \"Frozen\" it is still listed in \"Your keys\" list but is grayed out.\nThe num pad is disabled. There's a \"Key frozen. Help\" Error on top of the num pad. \"Help\" opens a popup with a text which explains the situation. Here's the current version of it, it might change later:\n\n`If you forgot your passcode, you can access your key using your pairing and PUK codes or your seed phrase. If you’ve lost all of those, unfortunately, there’s no other way to access your key again`\n\nImage:\n\n<img width=\"1271\" alt=\"fr3\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3115606/67836973-f0479f00-fb28-11e9-907d-ccaf6f2aad84.png\">\n\n\nFigma:\nhttps://www.figma.com/file/dEIljL7UPbXgsZUA0Q4qlE5E/Onboarding?node-id=4566%3A12\n\n---\n\n**Bonus** (Also mentioned in https://github.com/status-im/status-react/issues/9285)\nIt would be even cooler and a much better experience for the user if we add a more verbose warning when there's only one attempt left, with \"Help\" link in it to open a popup explaining what a \"Frozen key\" is. This could be the next iteration of this issue.\n\nImage:\n<img width=\"425\" alt=\"last-attempt\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3115606/67837499-26395300-fb2a-11e9-8243-948f942b9930.png\">",

A geek could remove the applet and start everything from scratch but no through status. A regular status user should be let known that his card is bricked and he can't use it anymore at all. \r\n\r\n@andmironov ",

In case they are traveling, for example, and can't access their means of recovery.\r\n\r\nthe number of attempts remaining can not be stored on the phone (simply because a card can be used by several phones), and this number of attempts is an info held by the card. For all interactions with one tap only (most of them are) we thus can't tell to the user in advance how many attempts he has left. It's actually super similar to how you use a debit card with ATM. You are (I have never been :) !) warned by the ATM about how many attempts I have left. However when the user makes a wrong PIN, we wan to warn him and tell him how many he has left. Detailed here https://github.com/status-im/status-react/issues/9347\r\n\r\n> Even if keycard is more analogous to a debit card, 3 attempts sounds a little restrictive, given that the user has to enter seed phrase or PUK code again to recover.\r\n\r\nThe setting to 3 max attempts is hardcoded for now in the applet, and the applet is installed at the factory. We could switch it to 6 in a new applet suite easily. Or make it a parameter of the initialization command. This second approach would be more elegant.
