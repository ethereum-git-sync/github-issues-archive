Complete building any Communities functionality that's in the MVP Communities designs and not yet built**  \r\n\r\n**4. Work on any outstanding ad-hoc group chat functionality as per the MVP spec**  \r\n\r\n- Test with Status Desktop to ensure mobile and desktop interop in all aspects of ad-hoc group chat functionality.\r\n\r\n\r\n**--- Things that should NOT be worked on this cycle ---**\r\n\r\n- We shouldn't start anything in Settings or Profile related, with the exception of Wallet setting that the Mobile Wallet team may work on.",
