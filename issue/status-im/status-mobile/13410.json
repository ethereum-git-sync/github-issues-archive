  "body": "### User Story\r\n\r\nAs a user, I want to be able to accept/decline CR directly from existing 1-1 chat so that I don't have to do it by opening AC or sending a counter CR from exiting chat (in case if I have enabled CR in Settings). \r\n\r\n# Feature Issue\r\n**Case 1:**  both Users enabled CR. Users are not contacts. There is an existing 1-1 chat between users in chat list. \r\n\r\n**Steps:** \r\n1) User 1 send CR to User 2\r\n2) User 2 opens existing 1-1 chat\r\n3) User 2 wants to accept or to decline CR without opening AC. \r\n\r\n**Actual results:** User 2 is shown \"Send Contact Request\" button.  He can accept CR by sending a counter CR. But sending CR to user who has already sent you his CR (and by that in fact already added you to contacts) does not make a big sense. And still, there is no way to decline CR from chat. \r\n\r\n**Expected result:**\r\nPending CR is shown instead of \"Send Contact Request\" button. Accept/Decline buttons are located under Pending request. \r\n\r\n**Case 2:**  User 1 (sender) has enabled CR, User 2 (receiver) disabled CR. Users are not contacts. There is an existing 1-1 chat between users in chat list. \r\n\r\n**Steps:** \r\n1) User 1 send CR to User 2\r\n2) User 2 opens existing 1-1 chat\r\n3) User 2 wants to accept or to decline CR without opening AC. \r\n\r\n**Actual results:** User 2 is shown Pending request. There is no possibility neither to decline nor to accept it from chat.  \r\n\r\n**Expected result:**\r\nAccept/Decline buttons are located under Pending request in 1-1 chat. \r\n\r\n",
