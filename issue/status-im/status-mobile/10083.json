  "body": "# Feature Issue\r\n\r\nThe current form of links is too verbose and long. After discussing this with @jarradh and some others we've decided to use shorter forms, like so:\r\n\r\n* https://join.status.im/markets in favour of https://join.status.im/chat/public/markets\r\n* https://join.status.im/u/0x04abcXYZ123... in favour of https://join.status.im/user/0x04abcXYZ123...\r\n* https://join.status.im/u/jakubgs in favour of https://join.status.im/user/jakubgs\r\n* https://join.status.im/u/jakubgs.eth in favour of https://join.status.im/user/jakubgs.eth\r\n* https://join.status.im/b/ens.domains in favour of https://join.status.im/browse/ens.domains\r\n\r\nThese were implemented in https://github.com/status-im/universal-links-handler/pull/29 and are already deployed.\r\n\r\n### User Story\r\n\r\nAs a user, I want to shorter universal links so that it's easier to remember them and make them yourself. They also produce more readable QR codes. \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWe will have to support both the old and the new way for at least one release to not break the old links. After that we can see in server logs how many people still use them and we can retire them eventually in a later release to avoid maintaining dead code.\r\n\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\nNew forms of universal links are supported on Android and iOS, in addition to old forms.",

If you go to https://join.status.im/@jakubgs.eth - which is the new form of https://join.status.im/user/jakubgs.eth - it will display a page, but it will not work with the App, regardless of from where you open it. For that to work changes have to be made to `status-react`.",
