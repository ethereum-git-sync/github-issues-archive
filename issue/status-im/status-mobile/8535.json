This is accessible only from the app, I don't think hashing and salting would change anything\r\n4. you can choose to only ask biometrics/seedphrase for using wallet keys and auto login (same as save password we have now, except that it uses a much better encryption for the files)\r\n\r\nSo just like biometrics, the pin code is just a yes/no for releasing the encryption key\r\nThat also means the user can now change their PIN code\r\n\r\nThe flow described above requires minimal changes because basically the key is the previous password used to login and sign stuff.\r\nThe PIN code input is the same as for keycard\r\nThe biometric is already in a PR\r\n\r\nTo me it seems like it is a low hanging fruit with high return, it is much easier to implement than what is described in the google doc without requiring any changes on status-go side (and actually, status-go already uses the password sha3 not the password directly, but password sha3 is still much easier to bruteforce than seedphrase)\r\n\r\nrelated to previous proposal:\r\n- discussion on status-go implementation https://github.com/status-im/status-go/issues/1463#issuecomment-508042399\r\n- initial android attempt https://github.com/status-im/status-react/pull/8525\r\n- last document left by Igor https://www.notion.so/Encryption-in-a-secure-element-ccb8778651024440a81f4f1e626a4342",

What do you think of spending a day next week to spike on it, ensure that `there's a clear migration path for existing users (which should be easy, we have done it before, but best to spend some time ensuring that, since a lot of things have changed)` and then marking it as nice-to-have? \r\n\r\nI don't want to get caught up in thinking that everything account related (or security critical) must be done before this one audit deadline. We have a relationship with TOB and can integrate security reviewed work in the future as well. Moreover, I don't like to rush things, no matter how simple. \r\n\r\nLooking forward to @corpetty's input on Monday too.",
