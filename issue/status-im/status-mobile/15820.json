(probably more)\r\n\r\nThe usage of all those functions is very inconsistent and also very confusing & might probably lead to display names being different in different parts of apps.\r\n\r\nThe way of fixing it and making it all much more consistent is by updaing `:contacts/contact-by-identity` and making it return `:display-name` as a part of the contact. This `:display-name` should be used anywhere where the name of a contact should be displayed.",
