    "body": "@acolytec3 to make this work, after eip681.cljs passed the ens name, resolve it before inserting it on field, to mimic what happens when someone manually enter the ens name. \r\n\r\nNote that in case of `ethereum:pay-snt.thetoken.eth/transfer?address=unicorn.stateofus.eth&uint256=1e16`, snt.thetoken.eth should find out the address and select proper token, and for the parameters with ens names (in this case `unicorn.stateofus.eth`) it should also resolve. \r\n\r\nIt's important that all ENS resolving happens outside eip681.cljs.\r\n\r\n_This is all too obscure for user, but if it resolves in background, then we can progress in this issue. I will open another issue requesting change in UI to give complete information for users, so they can know the ENS address entered, what resolved, and also details about the parameters(which by itself also depends in another issue, so this UI fix is something bigger)..._\r\n\r\n",

Right now it will only work for the main address being an ENS format since I'm just re-using the `set-recipient` method which assumes it only needs to resolve the \"to\" field from the transaction.  Will add that into the PR once I have time to think how to rework the `fill-request-from-qr` appropriately.",

    "body": "@3esmit @yenda  Follow-up question here.  When handling an ERC20 transfer, the flow of the logic is:\r\n `choose-recipient/fill-results-from-qr` -> `choose-recipient/extract-details` which then calls `eip681/parse-uri` - to identify the token based on the contract address passed.   I'm struggling to figure out how to take the result of that `parse-uri` which contains the address for the token contract needed for `eip681/extract-request-details` and accomplish the ENS name resolution without losing the thread that fills in the request details since the ens/get-addr function requires a callback which doesn't really seem native to Clojurescript (as there isn't any evident await/async type logic I could use to pause execution on `choose-recipient/extract-details` until the `get-addr` function resolves.  Are my instincts right that I need to move some of the logic in `fill-request-from-url` into `extract-details` so I can chain all the steps together.  I'm thinking the new flow would look something like this:\r\n* `fill-request-from-url` parses out the \"to\" address (and saves in the DB without resolving) and then dispatches an event `extract-details`\r\n* `extract details` parses the remainder of the URI and then either directly calls `set-recipient` if a standard eth payment URI or else parses the token address and then calls a new `parse-erc20-details` event that either resolves the ENS name of the token contract and calls itself with the token address (similar to how `set-recipient` does) or else calls `eip/extract-request-details` to parse the remaining details before moving onto `set-recipient`\r\n\r\nDoes this sound about right?  Just trying to think this through before I dive into a major rework of the `choose-recipient` methods.",
