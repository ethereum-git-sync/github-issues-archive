  "body": "# Feature Issue\nWe can do better making people aware that they need to back up their seed phrase. The current implementation includes badges on `Profile`, `Settings > Privacy and security`, `Settings > Privacy and Security > Back up seed phrase`. In addition we show a notification banner once the user has value in their wallet.\n\nAfter V1 release we received feedback that:\n- People hadn't backed up their seed phrase (we don't know what implementation they were using)\n- Didn't notice the back up seed phrase notification nor badges in a limited time frame after receiving funds through chat commands\n\nAside from this we know that from a usability perspective the back up seed phrase alerts' styling and patterns are not as alarming as that should be given the risk.\n\n### User Story\nAs a user I want to be made aware of having to back up my seed phrase as I'm not familiar with having to do anything like it, because I want my accounts and funds connected to it to be safe and available when I've lost my phone.\n\n### Description\nDesigns introduce a countdown to make back up seed phrase alerts increasingly more visible and finally unavoidable.\n##### Phase 1\n- `Notification dot` (on Profile) > (currently a nr badge)\n- `Number badge` on `Settings > Privacy and security` and `Settings > Privacy and security > Back up seed phrase` (exists)\n##### Phase 2\n- 3-day countdown triggered by `Assets in wallet` or `Having sent a message (exposing identity)`\n- Back up your seed phrase popover appears on or after every 3rd new day that the app is opened\n- Back up seed phrase `notification banner` is shown in wallet (exists)\n##### Phase 3\n- Back up seed phrase flow not completed by day 21 (7 days till countdown reaches 0)\n- Color of dot, badges and notification banner turns red\n##### Phase 4\n- Seed phrase not backed up by day 30 (countdown reaches 0)\n- Back up seed phrase flow appears when app is opened, cannot be dismissed, user has to complete flow to use the app\n\n![Frame 60](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35233054/76630663-b1970c00-6540-11ea-96c1-bbb762154c1e.png)\n\n\nDesigns on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/XUehMnhyD1FGcWzvGz6SXqvh/Wallet?node-id=8314%3A36337)\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\nImplementation follows Figma\n\n### Notes",
