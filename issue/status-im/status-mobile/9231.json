    "body": "Great feedback ! \r\n\r\nJust to be clear: \r\n- this case is about the user that wants to type his mnemonic and 'put it' on a keycard. So it's \"access key\">\"enter seed\"\r\n-  it's not about: the user that has already a keycard with a mnemonic imported on it, and want to add this keycard account on its phone. This use case is tackled with \"access key\">\"access with keycard\"\r\n\r\nFirst off the copy of the error message must be reviewed. I think the text should be \"This keycard has already a key on it. If you wish to change it, login first, and reset your card. If you want to access the key from this card, use \"Access key\" and \"Access key from keycard\" option.\"  @andrei do you agree ? if yes, may you create an issue, and add it in onboarding epic ? \r\n\r\nAlso, in your case @churik the card you tap has already an account on it. If it had not then the user would proceed. So in your case, the user has entered a seed to put it on a keycard, but the keycard he is tapping is not empty, it already has a seed in it. \r\n\r\n**I can't login because I delete the app** -> in this case the user needs to go to \"access key\">\"access with keycard\"\r\n\r\n**I can't reset the card because we removed this option.**->I agree this needs to be part of v1. This is #9229 and @rachel has put it in the v1 backlog\r\n\r\n",
