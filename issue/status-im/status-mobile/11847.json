This action needs to be defined\r\n",

    "body": "@guylouis Is the intention here to send a push notification or an in-app notification https://github.com/status-im/status/issues/35?\n\nI'd prefer an in-app notification as a) it is less aggressive and b) can be timely as the user is likely interacting with the app when conditions are met. Potentially there is argument c) can also work on F-droid as it doesn't require push notifications dependencies (not sure about this one)\n\nHowever, this might take more development effort; In-app notification pattern does exist and was used here: https://github.com/status-im/status-react/pull/11522",
