  "body": "# Problem\n\nThere is lots of code that is platform specific in the codebase, the issue is that this isn't a check that needs to be done at runtime. Platform specific conditionals should actually be macros that exclude the code from other platforms\nThe whole ui/screens/desktop folder of namespaces should be excluded from mobile builds as well\n\n## Implementation\n\nTurn all the platform conditionals into macro or whatever seems the best solution to do these checks at compile time rather than runtime\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\nThere is no more ios code in android and desktop build\nno more android code in ios and desktop build\nno more desktop code on mobile\nAll platform conditions are evaluated at compile time",
