    "body": "so it seems the question we have to answer is : do we keep on accepting a seed which includes word which are outside of BIP39 'official' lists here : https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/bip-0039-wordlists.md\r\nright ? \r\n\r\nTwo options\r\n1/ today we accept such a seed (going against BIP39 then), and just warn the user about this. Risk is letting the user setting up low entropy seed phrases.\r\n2/ we don't accept anymore such seed (I checked and Trust and Metamask don't accept it) and just need to warn the user when his seed phrase is wrong\r\n\r\nI don't know if there was a particular reason why we let the user use any word in his list of 12 words. @dmitryn do you know ? \r\n\r\ncc @gravityblast \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "> But it sounds like Status dictionary = common. And if a word doesn't match our dictionary, it can't also be a correct mnemonic coming from MEW or Trust or another wallet either?\r\n\r\nIf Status, MEW and Trust are following the mnemonic specification correctly, no. If a word doesn't match BIP39 dictionary, it is not a valid BIP39 (or whatever is supported) seed phrase; it can be a valid mnemonic of other specification, which isn't supported.\r\n\r\nIf Status want to support multiple specifications, would be a positive aggregation, but for me seems like everyone is already using BIP39.\r\n\r\nOpening words outside dictionary of BIP39, i.e. allowing invalid BIP39 seed phrases, does not seem to bring benefit to users, and will probably cause interoperability issues, recovery mistakes and low entropy seeds (with potential loss of funds).\r\n\r\nInstead of this, I suggest:\r\n- auto-completion (@yenda suggestion);\r\n- error \"red underline\" in unrecognized words, which would suggest similar words when tapped (just like any spell checker tool); \r\n- plan to allow plugins/extensions to enable different types of keystore/mnemonic specifications.",
