  "body": "# Bug Report\n\n_Expected behavior updated 1/11/19. Issue is ready for pick-up._ [RH]\n\n## Problem\n\nFor the recovered accounts having a lot of transactions it very long to fetch and display transaction history in History tab. Another note is that we apparently fetch them from the earliest to latest transaction which makes much less sense than if we reverse this order (so currently I see TXs I had 2 years ago and not those I sent/received today).\n\nSo with the account having ~650 transaction during the last 1.5 year on Mainnet it took ~10 minutes for last transactions (ETH and ERC20) I had couple of days ago to be displayed.\nAnd for the account with 11000+ transactions (in Ropsten network):\n- after ~4 minutes account recovered I've got first 6 ERC20 transactions made 1 year ago in History tab\n- after ~20 minutes pass I've got bunch of 100 transactions made 1 year ago more\nIt might take forever for me to see tx sent/receive today for this `11k-tx account` (seed phrase of this acc provided in steps below)\n\n #### Expected behavior\n_[TBD as it needs input from dev, design but for now...]_ \nDisregard the number of transactions address has I see last 10 transactions in less than 1 second performed with this address. \n\nStep 1 / Fetch latest transactions before earliest. Rely on Etherscan to get latest 20.\nStep 2 / Fetch if on wifi or user scrolls.\nStep 3 / Take over for Etherscan by Infura if fetching slows.\n \n#### Actual behavior\nIt takes 20+ minutes for list of 600 transactions to appear on Wallet -> Account -> History tab\n\n<img width=\"382\" alt=\"Screenshot 2019-10-14 at 13 48 53\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8749671/66746041-62618800-ee89-11e9-87d1-e82ff377dae6.png\">\n\n#### Notes\nIt seems that issue appeared after we moved Wallet to `status-go`. \n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n- navigating to Wallet -> Status account -> History tab of an account with 11000+ transactions takes < 1 second for last 10 transactions to appear\n- pulling down on History tab loads more transactions [10-txs in batch?]\n\n### Reproduction\n\n- Install fresh Status build\n- Recover the next account `tree weekend ceiling awkward universe pyramid glimpse raven pair lounge grant grief`\n- Switch to Ropsten network\n- Navigate to `Wallet` -> `Status account` -> `History` tab\n- Verify there is list of last 10 txs same as in etherscan for it's address https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0xf184747445c3B85CEb147DfB136067CB93d95F1D\n\n### Additional Information\n- Status version: develop nightly `0.14.0 (2910101102)`\n- Operating System: Android and iOS",

    "body": "@Serhy @yenda @flexsurfer \r\n\r\nYesterday I checked how it works on `status-go` side. It seems that there is some kind of binary search which happens on the interval from the first block until the current block. The algorithm checks if there's any change in balance value during that interval, if there was a change divides it into two intervals and checks balance change in these intervals, and so on, until a specific block with transaction will be found. Although it might be `O(log n)` in case if there is only a single transaction in history, the worst case here will be `m log n`, where `m` is the number of transactions. That's why there is a correlation between number of transactions in history and fetching time.\r\n\r\nAlthough we definitely can fallback to etherscan, as far as understand we switched to a new implementation because we planned to not rely on centralised services and so we would need to remove ethers dependency later anyway.\r\n\r\nBefore switching to etherscan I would try to have ~4 separate [`wallet_getTransfers` calls](https://github.com/status-im/status-go/tree/develop/services/wallet#wallet_gettransfers) for day, week, month and the rest of history (of course approximately, because we can only pass block numbers there). It sounds pretty straightforward to me and we could check whether it will be faster this way.\r\n\r\nAlso it would be great to have some feedback from `status-go` when search for transfers has ended without any results, in this case we also could show user that fetching is in progress, instead of showing `No transactions` label.\r\n\r\nLet me know if I missed some discussion on this regard and Etherscan has already been chosen as a best solution for this case.",

So we don't have any control on this on `status-react` side, and solution which I proposed will not work.\r\n\r\nThe way to fix it is to rewrite scanning on `status-go` side, so that instead of scanning the whole chain at once we do this in smaller portions (7-dayish number of blocks or something) and start with latest history.

Outgoing transactions will always at least cost gas, while incoming transaction will at least increase the balance. So if balance and transaction count didn't change then there is no new transaction in the range you are checking.\r\n\r\nBtw eth_scan only checks balances and it's typescript so not sure it will be any help.
