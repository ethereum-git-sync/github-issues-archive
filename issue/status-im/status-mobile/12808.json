    "body": "Hi @hesterbruikman,\r\nThese are the reasons(IMO) which make buttons a better choice than draggable for this feature\r\n- Reorder screen is only used by admins and only on rare occasions, and using another external library just for some rare cases doesn't seem right.\r\n- If used draggable then categories are ordered using drag, and nested channels are also ordered using drag and drop and especially in iOS, reorder screen is also itself draggable(drag to close).\r\nIt looks like too many nested drags and might conflict with each other.\r\n- If the number of channels inside the categories increases, then it will be very difficult for the user to track the drag in mobile screens.\r\nHe/she might accidentally drop at the wrong positions/categories and get confused about the previous location of the channel (this might work better on desktop). Buttons are just simple and clear about what they will do.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?",

Asking because users will probably want to move an important non-category channel around and away from others (like a \"Welcome\" channel, or a temporarily important one, like \"Liscon Logistics\").

We are going to need drag and drop lists in other places so good to get this in.  Happy to hop on a call to discuss further if that would be useful, but my current understanding is that this '3 step' (landing each step in product after it's complete) is the current plan of record.
