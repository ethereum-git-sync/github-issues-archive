  "body": "Currently the color system for customization colors is using predefined values in the codebase for it's various states (pressed, disabled etc)\r\n\r\nThis leads to a split in the functionality within the quo2 components (and potentially screens) when using the custom color of a community, as the community colors can be any hex color string.\r\n\r\n## Unified approach for customization presets and Community colors\r\nFrom discussing with Pedro the Community colors and their various states are created using a consistent pattern.\r\ni.e that for a given hex string, it's pressed state is defined by adding a 20% black overlay on top. It's disabled state just applies opacity.\r\n\r\nFor the customization preset colors it follows this exact same approach for `light` theme components. \r\nFor `dark` theme components it involves a similar system except the default state has the 20% black overlay and the pressed state removes it.\r\n\r\nFrom this we can refactor all quo2 components using customization and/or community color to take a single prop and treat these the same. We can essentially treat community colors the same as a customization color except the theme is always `light`.\r\n\r\n** Note **\r\nThe implemented solution should also consider the future use of b&w color option - not needed to implement it here, but it is better to implement a system that will allow it to be added rather than needing a further refactor later on.",
