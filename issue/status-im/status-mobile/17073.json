  "body": "# Feature Issue\r\n\r\nDisplay image URLs differently than common unfurleable URLs like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limnic_eruption.\r\n\r\n### User Story\r\n\r\n```\r\nAs a user,\r\nI want to send messages with one or more HTTP image URLs,\r\nSo that message receivers can see image previews without\r\nhaving to open the original URLs and expose themselves to centralized servers.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Scope\r\n\r\nWhen user sends a message with an image URL for the first time, the designs show we should show a confirmation bottom sheet to enable or disable link previews. It's okay to work on this in a separate issue since it may involve changes in status-go.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nIt is common to have image URLs without an extension. As of today (2023-08-21), status-go doesn't support fetching thumbnails for URLs _without_ extensions because its detection mechanism is not based on the response header `Content-Type`.\r\n\r\n#### Confirmation dialog to open image\r\n\r\nWhen the user presses on an image URL, a confirmation dialog should be displayed, so the user can choose between a dApp or a browser, but it can be annoying for the user to always perform this step. Consider talking to a designer about this problem.\r\n\r\n#### Composer preview icon\r\n\r\nUnfurled image URLs should have their image thumbnails in place of the favicons as we would usually display for non-image URLs.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/assets/46027/0dce3399-80c5-4d87-8d8d-c5c73d8e882d\" height=\"500\" />\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\n\r\nDesigns: https://www.figma.com/file/wA8Epdki2OWa8Vr067PCNQ/Composer-for-Mobile?type=design&node-id=9638-32638&mode=design&t=iMFvsLtbGRnWWnYd-0\r\n",
