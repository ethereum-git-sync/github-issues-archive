  "body": "Sometimes when building from the command line with `xcodebuild -workspace ios/StatusIm.xcworkspace -scheme StatusIm -configuration Debug -destination \"platform=iOS Simulator,id=${udid}\" -derivedDataPath 'build'` you get linker errors that don't appear when you build from Xcode related to undefined symbols (see logs below).\r\n\r\nThis seems related to: https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa/issues/2404#issuecomment-131932229\r\n\r\nIn general, we don't use Pods for anything other than Instabug and Firebase. With https://github.com/status-im/status-react/pull/1931 it's only Instabug left. To me Pods seems like more trouble than they are worth, given that most of our iOS dependencies are frameworks and not pods. Some issues with them:\r\n\r\n- Doesn't give us any cross-platform solution for dependencies\r\n- One more build step for end users (us devs)\r\n- Linker errors mentioned\r\n- Generally more complexity by having a pre-linker linker step (I think?)\r\n- One more cache dir to have to clear (outside of `node_modules`, `$TMPDIR` we now have `ios/Pods` and `Library/.../Cocoapods`).\r\n\r\nThe only pro I can think of is that it's often included in dependency README as a copy-paste, and supposedly it \"abstract away\" concerns. But this doesn't seem to work very well to be honest.\r\n\r\nI'll thus see how hard it is to move Instabug into a normal framework, which would allow us to get rid of this magic Cocoapods. It's also possible this error is unrelated to Cocoapods linking. TBD.\r\n\r\n### Logs\r\n\r\n```\r\nUndefined symbols for architecture x86_64:\r\n  \"realm::BpTreeBase::write_subtree(realm::BpTreeNode const&, unsigned long, unsigned long, unsigned long, realm::BpTreeBase::SliceHandler&, realm::_impl::OutputStream&)\", referenced from:\r\n      realm::BpTree<long long>::write(unsigned long, unsigned long, unsigned long, realm::_impl::OutputStream&) const in libRealmReact.a(weak_realm_notifier.o)\r\n  \"realm::BpTreeBase::introduce_new_root(unsigned long, realm::TreeInsertBase&, bool)\", referenced from:\r\n      void realm::BpTree<long long>::bptree_insert<realm::BpTree<long long>::LeafValueInserter>(unsigned long, realm::BpTreeNode::TreeInsert<realm::BpTree<long long>::LeafValueInserter>&, unsigned long) in libRealmReact.a(weak_realm_notifier.o)\r\n  \"realm::BpTreeNode::erase_bptree_elem(realm::BpTreeNode*, unsigned long, realm::BpTreeNode::EraseHandler&)\", referenced from:\r\n      realm::BpTree<long long>::erase(unsigned long, bool) in libRealmReact.a(weak_realm_notifier.o)\r\n  \"realm::BpTreeNode::update_bptree_elem(unsigned long, realm::BpTreeNode::UpdateHandler&)\", referenced from:\r\n      realm::BpTree<long long>::set_null(unsigned long) in libRealmReact.a(weak_realm_notifier.o)\r\n      realm::BpTree<long long>::set(unsigned long, long long) in libRealmReact.a(weak_realm_notifier.o)\r\n```\r\n\r\nType: Bug",

    "body": "Spent a bit of time on this but couldn't figure out how to link things right: framework paths, header search paths, filesystem vs xcode mismatch, search order, RCTStatus also depending on Instabug, different import conventions, etc.\r\n\r\n`/Users/oskarth/git/status-react/node_modules/instabug-reactnative/ios/RNInstabug/InstabugReactBridge.m:8:9: fatal error: 'Instabug/Instabug.h' file not found` is the general problem.\r\n\r\nIf/when we decide to revisit it, Instabug is the only thing that uses Pods, and we include lots of other frameworks: Firebase, Mapbox, ImagePicker, etc. There's also an alternative to Cocoapods and manual approach: Carthage. I haven't looked into it too much, but it seems like a lighter, more flexible, less magic approach.\r\n\r\nIn general, our xcode structure is a bit of a mess. Lots of strange links, lack of clear folder structure, mismatch with FS layout, odd and duplicate header search paths, etc. It'd be nice if we could clean this up at some point.",
