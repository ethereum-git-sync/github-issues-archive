  "body": "### User Story\r\n\r\nAs a developer I want an easier way to add correct and verified token config to the supported tokens list.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n*Type*: Refactor\r\n\r\n*Summary*: Right now when we add new ERC-20 tokens we have to supply the following info: contract address, symbol, name, number of decimals and icon in png format with symbol in the file name. \r\n\r\nSupplying correct information there is extremely important - setting a wrong token name can completely confuse the users and setting a wrong number of decimals can cause money loss. Verifying this data is a big part of manual effort on our end when we add new tokens.\r\n\r\nInstead of doing that manually, we should only add the contract address, icon resource files and the symbol and extract full name and decimals from the contract. We could even get the symbol like that, but it is useful to keep it in the code as a reference as contract addresses on their own aren't very legible. We can still query the contract for symbol and then assert it is the same as in code, just in case.\r\n\r\nThe one complication with this is that tokens list is currently hardcoded, so it's available even at compile time. After this change, the same list would need to be populated in run time, so some changes throughout the code may be needed.\r\n\r\nThis issue is a pre-requisite for #6225 ",
