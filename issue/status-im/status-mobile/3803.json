When I have the same account recovered on 2 devices and I am trying to message with those 2 accounts using 3d one - the problem is that message would be received by anyone and never reach the second one. If fails our tests for now. \r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nTests have enough  unique users to run independently and at one time\r\n\r\n#### Actual behavior\r\nApp behavior does not let to receive a message on 2 devices having the same account restored there. Once the message is delivered to 1 device, the second one will never receive it\r\n",
