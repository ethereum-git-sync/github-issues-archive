  "body": "# Problem\r\nVisible timestamps on all bubbles clutter up the chat and add noise when they're not needed. I recall we had a conversation here on how to make chat more 'readable', this is a huge part of it as you're asking your brain to filter out ambient, unnecessary information from a chat, all the time. Also, timestamps don't align that great hanging on odd random positions and in our case can be inaccurate or out of order.\r\nThe scope of this issue is to have them displayed on user action, a regular tap on a message. So this way they're only shown when you need them, kinda like glancing on your watch to tell the time.\r\n\r\n![Screen Recording (Safari)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4932774/83506706-ccd24180-a4c7-11ea-9659-5fb2f5dac92b.gif)\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\n\r\n* [ ] Remove timestamps from message bubbles\r\n* [ ] Add a touchable event on messages, on regular press we show a timestamp positioned in the longer margin (to the right of incoming messages, to the left of outgoing), this timestamp is centred vertically in the available space (message height) and positioned 12px from the bubble edge. It should disappear after 2 seconds. The animation here is `ease` duration `100ms` prop `opacity` from `0` to `1` and reverse.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Acceptance Criteria\r\nAll of the above points were addressed and tested.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\nyou're awesome :pray:\r\n\r\n",
