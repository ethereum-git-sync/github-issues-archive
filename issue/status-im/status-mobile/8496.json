  "body": "# Goal\n\nAn existing user who installs v1 either 1) on top of an existing build, or; 2) by recovering from their seed phrase, should be offered the **option** to create a new Whisper ID, but not forced. \n\nThose who create a new key will still be able to access their old account from the login screen, like so:\n\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15470435/60131249-d53adc00-9790-11e9-8375-48d7ee3f806d.png\" width=220/>\n\n**Open questions**\n- What is the most seamless way to move user's funds from old wallet to new wallet?\n- What is the most seamless way to move user's ENS name from old wallet/Whisper ID to new wallet/Whisper ID?\n- How do we distinguish legacy accounts from 'new' accounts? With the `legacy` badge? With nudges in-app to encourage migration?\n- Users who do not create a new account, but instead keep only their old one, will still benefit from the option to manage multiple wallets inside, correct? e.g. I can import my MetaMask wallet to use alongside my existing Status wallet, and Whisper ID.\n- For how long do we support old accounts? (This has not yet been discussed)\n\n## Stories\n\nThe [current design explorations](https://www.figma.com/file/dEIljL7UPbXgsZUA0Q4qlE5E/Onboarding?node-id=2043%3A152) (`Onboarding > Migration B`) are WIP. We need a better understanding of the options for moving a user's funds and ENS name to their new account. \n\nCurrent idea is to notify the user right after log-in/recovery, like so:\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15470435/60132808-2b5d4e80-9794-11e9-8c08-c3a6f05f3689.png\" width=220/>\n\n\n**User stories**\n- As an existing user installing or recovering Status v1, I want to understand the changes, and choose whether or not to create a new account.\n- I want to move my wallet funds to this new account, to improve my privacy.\n- I want to associate my new Whisper ID, with my existing ENS name. _Will it be transferred to new wallet key? We should potentially notify users again of the privacy sacrifice involved with using ENS._ \n- I want to easily access my old account, contacts, chats, etc.\n\n---\n- As the product team responsible for this work, we want to minimize the amount of screens + logic required for the above (!). :) \n- We want to ensure that the ENS migration is handled in the simplest possible way—if it is easier to do so as part of the ENS feature or even in a stand-alone DApp, we should consider it.\n\n## Notes\n\n**Related user stories**\nBrand new user installing v1 from scratch\n- Onboarding with keycard: user’s wallet is stored on keycard; Whisper ID stored locally.\n- Recovering account from outside Status: follows ‘regular’ recovery flow.\n- Creating brand new Status account: new wallet key, new Whisper ID.\n\nExisting user installing v1 but setting up keycard\n- User downloads new build, chooses keycard onboarding. Must lose old Whisper ID.\n\n[Notes from migration strategy call #2](https://notes.status.im/XTpDfTZRRVi7-54BlXtSug), when this plan was decided.",

It will only theoretically reduce bandwidth over time, but since all clients are still going to listen to the discovery topic, it is going to be an easy target for spamming. If someone decides to keep the volume high in discovery topic, clients are going to keep consuming an enormous amount of bandwidth which is more ridiculous for a v1 than breaking compatibility with beta. If they stop at some point, backward compatibility is broken.\r\nAre we going to stamp V1 on a product that most people will find unusable due to very high data usage because too much effort has been put into maintaining backward compatibility instead of iterating on lessons learned during the alpha and beta stages?\r\n",

    "body": "> Also I think we should consider doing some work at the communication protocol level regarding these migrations.\r\n> Saying that topic negotiation is a solved problem as I heard in the dev call is wrong. It will only theoretically reduce bandwidth over time, but since all clients are still going to listen to the discovery topic, it is going to be an easy target for spamming. If someone decides to keep the volume high in discovery topic, clients are going to keep consuming an enormous amount of bandwidth which is more ridiculous for a v1 than breaking compatibility with beta. If they stop at some point, backward compatibility is broken.\r\n> Are we going to stamp V1 on a product that most people will find unusable due to very high data usage because too much effort has been put into maintaining backward compatibility instead of iterating on lessons learned during the alpha and beta stages?\r\n\r\ncc'ing @oskarth in reference to this.\r\n\r\n> so, a dumb question but one I just need to ask.

We either (exact user flow to be designed) create a v1 type wallet with the seed the user entered, or propose him to just generate a new seed for him (is it really necessary?). In any, he can use Keycard to manage this wallet.\r\n\r\nIt's obviously a bit tough to keep all inline on our understandings there,  so if anyone that has some doubts on these could you raise it so that we converge ? \r\n\r\nMy doubts are:\r\n- for iii. I think we are going in another direction than the one wrote here where we actually let the user use this mnemonic he has entered as a legacy wallet. We will have to ask him because we cannot detect if a mnemonic is a status one or an other. The exception is if the user decides to store the new wallet on a keycard then we can't let him use it as a legacy wallet. \r\n",
