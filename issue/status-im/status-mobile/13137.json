  "body": "As a user\r\nI want to have a minimum number of characters in my password enforced\r\nSo I don't mistakenly choose a weak password\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWe should enforce (client side) a minimum of 8 characters for the password\r\nIdeally we exclude a list of common passwords, as per original comment below, but can be done separately\r\n\r\n\r\n### Original comment\r\n\r\nAs per the DejaVu security audit that was done in 2018, we should increase the password requirements.\r\n\r\nHere's what they said:\r\n> Status currently enforces the user to create a password that is six character or longer. If the user's device were ever compromised and the encrypted private keys were obtained, it would be a trivial task for an attacker to brute force a weak password and decrypt the user's private key.\r\n\r\nWe should increase the limit to 8 characters, and prevent users from entering passwords with low entropy such as \"000000\" or \"querty\". Right now, there's 56 billion possible combinations if the user is using a 6 character password (`62^6`) but that is increased to 218 trillion combinations with an 8 character minimum (`62^8`) which would take longer to crack, without interference to the user.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we should also allow characters from other systems such as Chinese, Cyrillic, Arabic, and Emojis to add to the allowed complexity.",

Looking forward to discussing and working on this bounty.\n**3) [jkbl](https://gitcoin.co/jkbl) has applied to start work _(Funders only: [approve worker](https://gitcoin.co/issue/status-im/status-react/13137/100027817?mutate_worker_action=approve&worker=jkbl) | [reject worker](https://gitcoin.co/issue/status-im/status-react/13137/100027817?mutate_worker_action=reject&worker=jkbl))_.**\n\nI can update validation process, so that minimum password length is 8 characters.\n\nExcluding list of pwned passwords would require using external service,  as currently list of pwned passwords has more than 15GB in size.\n**4) [trungtin](https://gitcoin.co/trungtin) has applied to start work _(Funders only: [approve worker](https://gitcoin.co/issue/status-im/status-react/13137/100027817?mutate_worker_action=approve&worker=trungtin) | [reject worker](https://gitcoin.co/issue/status-im/status-react/13137/100027817?mutate_worker_action=reject&worker=trungtin))_.**\n\nPer requirements, the password should:\n- Allow Unicode characters (so Chinese, Cyrillic, Arabic, and Emojis is supported)\n- Require a level of strength (use something like password-sheriff)\n- Limit min and max length\n**5) [fhrrydeveloper](https://gitcoin.co/fhrrydeveloper) has applied to start work _(Funders only: [approve worker](https://gitcoin.co/issue/status-im/status-react/13137/100027817?mutate_worker_action=approve&worker=fhrrydeveloper) | [reject worker](https://gitcoin.co/issue/status-im/status-react/13137/100027817?mutate_worker_action=reject&worker=fhrrydeveloper))_.**\n\nI already integrated strong password logic before. So it is easy for me. New thing is emojis. But I can solve this easily too. It will requires only add unicode variable.\n**6) [aaronteamaar](https://gitcoin.co/aaronteamaar) has applied to start work _(Funders only: [approve worker](https://gitcoin.co/issue/status-im/status-react/13137/100027817?mutate_worker_action=approve&worker=aaronteamaar) | [reject worker](https://gitcoin.co/issue/status-im/status-react/13137/100027817?mutate_worker_action=reject&worker=aaronteamaar))_.**\n\nI can solve the problem using a password generator i made that combines word,symbols and numbers all in one to make the password stronger than ever and i can match this up using an authenticator. Then if a VPN is provided during the password entering period it can help to stop interception  from hackers trying to gain access.\n**7) [dangarbri](https://gitcoin.co/dangarbri) has been approved to start work.**\n\nFind the code that manages the password view and update it with some simple password checking.\n**8) [aimanafzal](https://gitcoin.co/aimanafzal) has applied to start work _(Funders only: [approve worker](https://gitcoin.co/issue/status-im/status-react/13137/100027817?mutate_worker_action=approve&worker=aimanafzal) | [reject worker](https://gitcoin.co/issue/status-im/status-react/13137/100027817?mutate_worker_action=reject&worker=aimanafzal))_.**\n\nWrite an additional piece of code to support 8 characters for password with the enhanced security of implementing a Regex.\n\nLearn more [on the Gitcoin Issue Details page](https://gitcoin.co/issue/status-im/status-react/13137/100027817).\n\n",
