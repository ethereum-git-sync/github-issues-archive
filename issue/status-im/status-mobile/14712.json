We want to implement membership notifications gradually, and this issue supposed to track work related to group chat membership notifications.\r\n\r\n`Figma - Shell for Mobile`: https://www.figma.com/file/eDfxTa9IoaCMUy5cLTp0ys/Shell-for-Mobile?node-id=3804%3A812855&t=DFDzGj4GThvYiKUp-0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
