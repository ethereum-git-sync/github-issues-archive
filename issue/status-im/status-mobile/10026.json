This could lead to an undesirable situation when the user:\n\n- Cancels the process when asked to write down the PUK code and Pairing code\n- Generates new keys\n- Tries to store these Keys on Keycard\n\nThe user will currently receive the following message and will no longer be able to use the card. However the user will not be able to login or recover the existing account (they will not have written down their seed phrase at this stage)\n\n![photo_2020-02-10_16 34 19_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35233054/74230779-5cf43d00-4cc5-11ea-8af1-0d0d163a4bdc.jpeg)\n\n## Implementation\nShow a state that the keys have been generated and placed on the Keycard to better inform the user that at this point they can longer return.\n\nIn addition, solutions depend on:\n\n- Can the card hold multiple multiaccounts? (Why not?)\n- Can the back up seed phrase step precede the PUK and Pairing code? (At least that way, the keys can be accessed)\n- Can the multiaccount be added to `Your keys`, without the PUK and Pairing code been written down, for a limited time. With the passcode providing access. Blocking all functionality, only showing the PUK code and Pairing code\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n## Notes\nNeeds specification of options\n\n## Future Steps\n- Design screens for decided upon option\n- Implementation",

    "body": "@hesterbruikman \r\n\r\nIf we take again the steps you described:\r\n1/ Cancels the process when asked to write down the PUK code and Pairing code\r\n2/ Generates new keys\r\n3/ Tries to store these Keys on Keycard\r\n\r\nAfter 1/ currently the message the user gets is:\r\n \"Dangerous operation. \r\nThis will cancel keycard setup. It's highly recommended to finish the setup in order to use keycard. Do you really want to cancel ?\"\r\n\r\nAnd the state of his card is that it's initalized with a pairing code + pin + puk, but it has no multiaccount on it. \r\n\r\nWhen the user goes through 2 and 3/ then when he will tap a card, he will not get  the screen you showed, but a request to enter his pairing code. Which he did not write...\r\n\r\nSo for me the issue is really about, not being clear to the user when he cancels the setup in 1/ that if he doesn't write his pairing code, he's actually f***ed and can throw his card away. \r\n\r\nI completed the miro diagram of the onboarding logic (what happens with the card)\r\nhttps://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kvIXxoU=/\r\n\r\nPossible solutions I see: \r\ni/ change the warning to something much more explicit\r\nii/ change where the actual pairing of the card is done with the phone + allow a user to change his pairing code when he knows his PIN. So if the user cancels here, then he can resume (only with the same phone), and then he can set up a new pairing code in the settings\r\n\r\nI prefer i/ since ii/ needs to build this new 'change pairing code' feature which will be longer\r\n\r\n\r\n",
