  "body": "## Problem\r\nBefore we submit the v1 App to either Play Store or Apple Store or any other app directory we need to figure out how the way we sign our app affects the approval and listing.\r\n\r\nA reasonable assumption would be that once we publish v1 under a specific name signed with a specific set of keys we cannot change those keys or the name. But this has to be clarified.\r\n\r\n## Extra Problems For Extra Fun\r\n\r\nOther things worth knowing (based on [todays v1 scope meeting](https://notes.status.im/MRQYp8G2SJm22Ikcs67vgA?view) and @jarradh questions):\r\n\r\n* Is it possible to sign the App using multiple keys?\r\n* How do reproducible builds tie into this?\r\n\r\nI was hoping to get some input on this, specifically from @mandrigin and @pedro.",

    "body": "One way for Play Store is letting Google do the signing for you:\r\n\r\n>When you use app signing by Google Play, your keys are stored on the same infrastructure that Google uses to store its own keys. Keys are protected by Google’s Key Management Service.\r\n>Android apps are signed with a private key. To ensure that app updates are trustworthy, every private key has an associated public certificate that devices and services use to verify that the app is from a trusted source. Devices only accept updates when its signature matches the installed app’s signature. By letting Google manage your app signing key, it makes this process more secure.\r\n\r\nhttps://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/7384423?hl=en\r\n\r\nBut apparently:\r\n\r\n> Using app signing by Google Play is optional. You can still upload an APK and manage your own keys instead of using an app bundle. However, __if you lose your keystore or it becomes compromised, you won’t be able to update your app without publishing a new app with a new package name.__\r\n\r\nWhich answers one question.

The list is:\r\n\r\n* `Associated Domains` - This is related to `get.status.im` redirects.\r\n* `Game Center` - No fucking clue, makes no sense.\r\n* `In-App Purchase` - I guess related to our Dapps store?\r\n* `Push Notifications` - Makes sense",
