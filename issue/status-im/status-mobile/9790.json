    "body": "Ugh.... this 'sign out' has been bothering me! Thanks for creating the issue @andmironov And indeed the inconsistency makes it worse.\r\n\r\nI don't have an answer the perfect terminology in mind, but here are some perspectives on the behavior before jumping to naming:\r\n- We need the dialog atm because Sign out in effect resets your unlock settings (and possibly others, haven't checked). Ideally we remove the distinction between `Sign out` and `Closing` the app, as concluded eventually here: https://github.com/status-im/status-react/issues/9763#issuecomment-573063838. If we remove the distinction we don't need the dialog and the only question remains is what to call this thing in Settings.\r\n- If we make changes I would suggest to bundle these with replacing `Unlock` with `Your keys` to ensure consistency https://github.com/status-im/status-react/issues/9782\r\n\r\n**On the naming:**\r\n- Result of lengthy onboarding discussions was the term Unlock. Rationale being that `Sign in` or `Log in` are terms from a server era and not an accurate description of what happens. Which is `unlocking or decrypting your local keys`. If this is true for opening a Status multiaccount, I reckon it's true for closing one.\r\n- As far as I know, the keys are encrypted when you close the app or maybe even right after decrypting. So this is not really a sign out, a.k.a., lock, log out use case, but more of a `Close` or `Switch` case. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
