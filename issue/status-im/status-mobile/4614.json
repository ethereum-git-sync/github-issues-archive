Alternatively I would like to be able to put my private key in plaintext as a restoration mechanism as well as an advanced option.\n\nexample of another mobile wallet that allows this convenient feature for advanced users\n\n![img!UNITO-UNDERSCORE!1818](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18363825/40891789-85c8ce90-6751-11e8-96b6-8c3055590599.jpg)\n\n#### Actual behavior\nI can only restore my other account from mnemonic phrase\n\n### Solution\nDesign input needed on a place where this can be done from the recover account section\n\n",

    "body": "Hello, I'd like to add up my voice to this query.\r\n\r\nStatus being an \"explorer for decentralized applications\", it should consider as many ways as possible to transfer people from actual wallet solutions (like MetaMask, MyEtherWallet/MyCrypto, etc.) because people would like to keep the same address through their devices, or – if they have already signed up to some DApps – would like to keep their account when they migrate to Status.\r\n\r\nMetaMask offers a mnemonic backup only when set up for the first time. If the user haven't written down his mnemonic, he can still get his raw Private Key, and in this case, can't use it in Status.\r\n\r\nMyEtherWallet and MyCrypto use JSON KeyStore and raw private keys. There's no easy way to derivate a menomonic from there. Hence, people who initially have their tokens, ether and DApp accounts linked to that wallet can't use them on Status.\r\n\r\n",

My feeling is that we want to make onboarding as simple as possible, and I wouldn't complexify it with another way to import the master seed. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, as part fo the multiple account management across status and in the wallet, we know we want to be able to monitor any public key (even outside the HD tree), and we could think of extending that and import a keypair (public & private key) outside the HD tree too. This would answer the need, and would be a better answer since a user could still use his Status identity and use this keypair also. This keypair would be treated as a single keypair, and not a new HD tree of course. This is actually exactly what metamask does.\r\n\r\nwhat do you think of it ? \r\n",
