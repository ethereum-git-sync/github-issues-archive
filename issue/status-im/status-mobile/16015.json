I have a question regarding the behavior of the 'featured' sections in the app.\r\n By default, I've observed that the 'Status' community always appears after creating a new account. This makes it impossible to test how the 'featured' sections should look when there are no communities at all.\r\n\r\nI understand that in the release build, a new account will not have any communities. Therefore, I would like to inquire if it is possible to test the PR without any communities being returned, in order to test the behavior of the empty 'featured' section. Thank you",

One more question:\r\n\r\nQ2: While testing the PR, I noticed that only one community is consistently displayed in the 'featured' section. I'm trying to understand if this is the intended behavior. I have created at least 8 communities, yet only one of them is appearing in the 'featured' section. Could you please clarify what determines whether a community gets included in this section?\r\n\r\nQ3: From my understanding, the 'featured' section is meant to display communities recommended for users to join. However, even after joining a community, it continues to be shown in the 'featured' section. Should all types of communities be displayed in this section, or only \"those which with pending\" and \"opened\" statuses?\r\nCC: @osmaczko",

    "body": "Hi @VladimrLitvinenko, let me answer specific questions first, then elaborate more on the concept of communities portal.\r\n\r\n> Q2: While testing the PR, I noticed that only one community is consistently displayed in the 'featured' section. I'm trying to understand if this is the intended behavior. I have created at least 8 communities, yet only one of them is appearing in the 'featured' section. Could you please clarify what determines whether a community gets included in this section?\r\n\r\nAs @cammellos said, the communities in the portal are taken from the contract. The contract we get the information from is there: https://goerli-optimism.etherscan.io/address/0x22EE86A14b49890957fE71990073C6C68E05F9C5. It is still a mocked contract as we haven't deployed the Community Directory Curation DApp yet but it doesn't matter from the mobile app perspective.\r\n\r\n> Q3: From my understanding, the 'featured' section is meant to display communities recommended for users to join. However, even after joining a community, it continues to be shown in the 'featured' section. Should all types of communities be displayed in this section, or only \"those which with pending\" and \"opened\" statuses? CC: @osmaczko\r\n\r\nThe communities portal operates independently of the app/account state. The contents of the featured section are not influenced by whether a community has been joined or not.\r\n\r\nFor context: There exists a distinct DApp, called 'Community Directory Curation' which is responsible for managing the communities to be listed on the App's Community Portal. This DApp is self-contained and does not interact with Status clients. Essentially, users utilize their voting power, via SNT tokens, to vote for or against the inclusion of a particular community in the directory and the featured section. All pertinent data is housed within the contract, and this contract serves as the sole input to the app. To simplify, data sourced from the contract is structured as follows:\r\n\r\ncommunities: A,B,C,D\r\nfeaturedCommunities: A\r\n\r\nGiven that the contract has not undergone any recent changes, the list displayed on the communities portal should remain unchanged each time the app is accessed.\r\n",
