In result if there are new transactions we request them all of db instead of fetching them on for the block specified in `newblock` event, as it was done previously.  Back end changes: - In order to avoid handling of the reorganized blocks we use an offset from the latest known block when start listening to new blocks. Before this commit the offset was 15 blocks for all networks. This offset is too big for mainnet and causes noticeable delay of marking a transfer as confirmed in Status (comparing to etherscan). So it was changed to be 5 blocks on mainnet and is still 15 blocks on other networks. - Also before this commit all new blocks were handled one by one with network specific interval (10s for mainnet), which means that in case of lost internet connection or application suspension (happens on iOS) receiving of new blocks would be paused and then resumed with the same \"speed\" - 1 blocks per 10s. In case if that pause is big enough the application would never catch up with the latest block in the network, and this also causes the state of transfers to be delayed in the application. In this commit in case if there was more than 40s delay after receiving of the previous block the whole history in range between the previous received block and (\"latest\"-reorgeSafetyDepth) block is checked at once and app catches up with a recent state of the chain.](https://github.com/status-im/status-react/commit/b41df2f2fcb0fdb5043a52f77d820926b6ab2139) by [rasom](https://github.com/rasom)\n:hammer_and_wrench: [update Italian, Arabic, Spanish(LatAm), Chinese and Korean  Signed-off-by: Andrey Shovkoplyas <motor4ik@gmail.com>](https://github.com/status-im/status-react/commit/58afae07ba5199b3d140d23fbb0a5824cc688fe3) by [jinhojang6](https://github.com/jinhojang6)\n:hammer_and_wrench: [Explicitly start messenger  We should only start receiving messages/processing topics once all the initializiation is completed, so an endpoint that start the messenger has been added. Before we would initialize the topics/receiving messages at the same time, which resulted in a race condition where a topic was signaled from status-go and was considered new just because was not loaded yet.

The first one is that when we go from offline->cellular-network->wifi historical requests were not triggered (only when going from offline->online, but if they are disabled in cellular network they won't fire).  The second is due to the fact that it is possible that the connection status gets into a bad state, (this happens for example if get-latency returns all errors, but we are online, and it won't be retried), and no connection attempt is made anymore.  I have changed the logic to periodically check the connection state, and try to connect if too much time has passed since last error (10s), similarly to what we did before, but in a tick, so we are less reliant on having the right state in the db.
