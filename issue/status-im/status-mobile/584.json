I know you get it.\r\n\r\njarradhope [5:31 PM] \r\nnot dwelling at all, i'm having a blast chatting about it\r\n\r\n[5:32]  \r\nyes, sorry I meant there would be a set default, of like, 100eth or some other arbitrary number\r\n\r\n[5:32]  \r\nnvm not possible\r\n\r\nrabbit [5:32 PM] \r\nya but don’t let them disable it to 0 or whatever.\r\n\r\njarradhope [5:32 PM] \r\nmy ninjaedit i mean\r\n\r\nrabbit [5:32 PM] \r\nhaha\r\n\r\njarradhope [5:33 PM] \r\nyeah good point\r\n\r\nrabbit [5:33 PM] \r\nthe “I’ll take the risks” user needs to be smacked cause this isn’t the time for that. it’s negligent.\r\n\r\n[5:34]  \r\nI come from agency life, these are my babies we’re talking about. :angel:\r\n\r\n[5:34]  \r\nanyway good convo back to issues\r\n\r\njarradhope [5:35 PM] \r\nright, but say with physical wallets the amount of cash does have an upper limit\r\n\r\n[5:36]  \r\nbecause notes and wallet take up space\r\n\r\nrabbit [5:36 PM] \r\nooh that idea is fun to think of visually. to have a wallet (maybe icon?) that appears more and more full\r\n\r\njarradhope [5:36 PM] \r\nand are further constrianed by pocket size\r\n\r\n[5:36]  \r\ni love that idea @andmironov ^\r\n```",
