  "body": "# Problem\n\n**As a multiaccount user, I want to control which account I use to transact with DApps, so that (1) I never need to move assets between accounts to take advantage of DApps; and (2) my privacy can be better protected by not funneling all transactions through a single account.**\n\nIn v1, users can initiate transactions from the wallet screen (send/receive buttons) or from within a DApp. Chat commands are temporarily disabled.\n\nUsers deserve an option to select which of their accounts they transact with when using DApps. Currently, the 'default' account can not be changed. This severely limits the utility of multi-account. \n\nUpdate 2/10/19, after discussion btwn @flexsurfer, @simonricoo, @errorists, @hesterbruikman and @rachelhamlin:  \n\n- Account selection will be global and apply to all previous tabs and DApps. \n- Cookies & data in previous tabs will be cleared.\n- User will have to grant permission to DApp to access new account when opening again. \n- Out of scope: selection _within_ a DApp/tab.\n\nA future, more privacy-centric model more in line with the [windows manager mentality](https://discuss.status.im/t/window-based-navigation/1374/7) would allow users to switch accounts or even have a dedicated account per DApp.\n\nAn additional future requirement might be to manage DApp permissions at an account level. They are currently global, tied to the current Status wallet. \n\n## Implementation\n\nWe've designed this control in context of the DApp browser.\n\n[Figma screens](https://www.figma.com/file/MYWmd1buvc2AMvUmFP9w42t5/Browser?node-id=2998%3A0)\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15470435/66035408-fc791600-e502-11e9-8146-4d45f6f54ce9.png)\n\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- From the browser home screen, a user sees the ['Account name' option](https://www.figma.com/file/MYWmd1buvc2AMvUmFP9w42t5/Browser?node-id=2998%3A153) at the bottom, it hides on scroll. \n- Clicking on 'Status account' opens a bottom sheet with a scrolling list of all the user's accounts.\n- The [DApp permissions modal](https://www.figma.com/file/MYWmd1buvc2AMvUmFP9w42t5/Browser?node-id=3000%3A5095) reflects the specific account a user is connecting with, rather than just \"wallet\" generically. \n\n**Out of scope for this issue**\n- Selection from within a DApp/tab",

In past Metamask used to refresh the page, but now it fires an event.

    "body": "Ah, I see the issue. I think we need to rethink the flow of authentication of dapp.\r\n\r\n1. when opens an tab user is opening a session, when he loads an app it would be not authenticated (no accounts) but it would have a db, cookies or whatever...\r\n2. when user is requested account or when user manually go to accounts it can change what accounts are exposed, when there is a change that event is fired\r\n3. if user don't want to mix identities, user opens a new tab and select an unique account from there.\r\n\r\nWe can add some warnings (with dont show again button) to alert user that he is mixing accounts and some dapp might track it.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's hard to give you a fast path to fix this, If you want we can arrange an time for a call or a text discussion on Status.im channels. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
