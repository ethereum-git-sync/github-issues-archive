  "body": "# Problem\nWe have a circle icon that is displayed on the avatar of a new person that sends you a chat. The behavior of the icon is illdefined and because of its infrequent use and similarities to a 'online' icon causes confusion for users. However, the icon serves the important function of mitigating risk of impersonation. \n\nImpersonation can occur when. \nUser A (Jarrad) has added User B as contact\nUser B has or has not added User A as a contact\nUser C (impersonator) changes their chosen name to Jarrad, adds User B as a contact and requests a transaction.\nBy showing the blue circle, User B can be triggered to verify User C's identity outside of Status.\n\nWe would like to adjust this icon, or look for alternative ways to show that someone is a new contact. As discussed with Chat team, Design team, and with QA.\n\nThe icon can be removed when choosen names are removed as part of the Profile update. https://discuss.status.im/t/profile-information-structure-please-review/1080/22\n\nA more important indicator would be to show that someone is 'added to your contacts' in other words, that you are sharing your wallet address (as well as, currently, your chosen user name) with them. However, for the time being we will not repurpose this existing icon because of it's similarity to an 'online' status icon.\n\n![Screenshot_20190314-185229](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35233054/54423866-ef850880-4711-11e9-8ab1-f8435ec6ed6e.png)\n\n# Implementation\n\n\n# Acceptance Criteria\nPhone A\n- Create new account\n- Find someone (yourself) in public channel\n- Add to contacts\n- Send message\n\nPhone B\n- Icon should not appear on avatar\n\n# Notes\n\n\n# Future Steps",
