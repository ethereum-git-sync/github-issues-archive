    "body": "Things are still little unclear, but these are findings:\r\n\r\n### 1. Way to reproduce bug:\r\nIn target [_tmpdir-rm](https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/blob/6f10ff4d3e03798f16181e852f37dcb13a1bd32f/Makefile#L127), replace shell using\r\n```\r\n_tmpdir-mk: SHELL := ./nix/scripts/shell.sh\r\n_tmpdir-mk: ##@prepare Create a TMPDIR for temporary files\r\n\t@mkdir -p \"$(TMPDIR)\" && echo \"$(BASH)\"\r\n```\r\nand call `make _tmpdir-mk` to reproduce same output\r\n\r\n### 2. Weird Fix\r\nSo in line [65](https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/blob/6f10ff4d3e03798f16181e852f37dcb13a1bd32f/Makefile#L65), we are assigning default shell to `./nix/scripts/shell.sh`.\r\n\r\nAnd as `run-clojure` target don't have any shell assigned to it, it uses above shell.\r\nAnd somehow use of that also affecting `_tmpdir-mk` target and it also keeps using nix shell.\r\n(even though we are assigning `/bin/bash` for that target).\r\n\r\n(keeps using sounds weird, as `_tmpdir-mk` is supposed to run-first, but I tried to add debug log in nix shell script, and they always called even before `_tmpdir-mk` crashed)\r\n\r\nIf I assign `/bin/bash` also for `run-clojure` target using `run-clojure: SHELL := /bin/sh`, it fixes the issue or just removing line 65, also fixes the issue :)\r\n\r\n### 3. Better fix\r\nLooks like `-include` and `.PHONY` don't play nice together. Removing those targets from `.PHONY` fixes the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Removing those targets from .PHONY fixes the issue.\r\n\r\n- **Include** - The include directive tells make to suspend reading the current makefile and read one or more other makefiles before continuing. ([ref](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Include.html))\r\n\r\n- **-include** - If you want make to simply ignore a makefile which does not exist or cannot be remade, with no error message, use the -include directive instead of include. ([ref](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Include.html))\r\n\r\n - **Phony** - A phony target is one that is not really the name of a file; rather it is just a name for a recipe to be executed when you make an explicit request ([ref](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Phony-Targets.html))\r\n\r\n #### Thinking out loud\r\nI don't know exactly why they are not playing well together, but include is saying read a file, and phony is telling it's not a file, which sounds contradictory :)\r\n",

For example we could just use a real target with an alias:\r\n```Makefile\r\n$(TMPDIR): SHELL := /bin/sh\r\n$(TMPDIR): ##@prepare Create a TMPDIR for temporary files\r\n\t@mkdir -p \"$(TMPDIR)\"\r\n# Make sure TMPDIR exists every time make is called\r\n_tmpdir-mk: $(TMPDIR)\r\n-include _tmpdir-mk\r\n```\r\nThis way we allow `make` to check if `TMPDIR` exists, and not run the command if it does.",
