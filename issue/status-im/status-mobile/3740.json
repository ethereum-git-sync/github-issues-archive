Instead, they should be run as a last step of the PR build using the .apk that was created in the previous step. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7532782/38188630-105d12e4-365d-11e8-8ede-3db3da9e4ae2.png\" width=\"400\">\r\n\r\nThis way we could:\r\n- Be sure what build (commit id) was used\r\n- Have everything into one place and link github test result to the jenkins build url\r\n\r\nFor now, the test results can be ignored to not stop the build when there is a failure. In the near future though, the test failure should block the PR from merging (cc @yevh-berdnyk)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add running tests as another step into PR pipeline. Ignore the results for now \r\n- [ ] Use .apk from previous step",

But, `macos1` would need to wait until `linux1` is done. In order to simplify it, I think we could execute appium tests on `macos1` node and remove `linux1` completely. `macos1` image would contain all necessary dependencies. \r\n\r\nI'd also add couple of more `macos1` slaves to enable more parallel Jenkins builds.\r\n\r\n",

It we say that critial things do not work (smoke test), there is no need to announce the builds. But, it means that smoke tests should run with every commit. To be honest, I'd start with running them only when PR is in TO TEST and leave the slack notification stage as it is.

But, if we want to have smoke tests blocking PRs in Q2 we should do it. But, it's not top priority now. @yevh-berdnyk I'd start with defining the list of scenarios for the smoke test. Then, let's make sure they are stable (like in 100 PRs they were stable in 95%). Only then we will go back to this issue and will start to block the PRs.  \r\n\r\n",
