  "body": "Follow up to #11432 \r\n\r\n# Problem\r\nDeep link to public chat is intended for use with advertisers and influencers. Prior to introducing deep link to public chat, referral campaigns have been stopped following feedback that attributions were much lower than traffic (referral url use) provided by influencers and advertisers.\r\n\r\nAllowing users to receive a Starter Pack in exchange for their attribution should increase attributions, as well as user retention.\r\n_Previously StarterPack release for advertiser and influencer campaigns was too expensive. Gas prices are more favorable now and promo packs will be used to control number of Starter Packs being released_\r\n\r\n### User stories\r\nAs a user\r\nI want to receive a StarterPack when I join Status\r\nso that I can try features and get crypto for trying out the app\r\n\r\nAs a user\r\nI want to be pointed directly to a chat after creating an account\r\nso that I can find out what to do in the app\r\n\r\nAs I user\r\nI want to explicitly join the chat\r\nso that if there is spam in the chat, the app doesn't crash without me being able to do anything about it\r\n\r\n[Design](https://www.figma.com/file/brK5wYEsm82xbMz7V2orM3/Referral-program-UI-s?node-id=169%3A153)\r\n\r\n![Frame 55](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35233054/100136537-76006000-2e8b-11eb-92ca-d256386b1ba0.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Acceptance Criteria\r\n- User is shown button to Accept StarterPack and join public chat\r\n- Accept Starter Pack behaves the same as referral deep link to 1:1 chat\r\n- Messages for public chat are only fetched after user taps Accept and Join\r\n- Dialog incl Accept and join button remains visible in pending or confirmed state\r\n- User can join chat without accepting Starter Pack and attributing referrer by removing the chat from the chat list and adding it again manually",
