  "body": "# Feature Issue\n\nAdd option for user to increase the gas payment for a pending transaction.  The user facing changes required are:\n\n- When the user is redirected to the History screen after making a transaction, the transaction should be displayed on the History screen in a 'pending' state (unless it's already included in a block).  The fact that the transaction is in this state should be indicated by the attached pending_state_icon.png\n\n- A 'Increase gas' button should be added underneath the transaction entry in the history screen.\n\n- Tapping on this button should bring up a increase gas dialogue.  \n\nThis feature should be implemented at the same time as related feature #11215\n\n### User Story\n\nAs a User, I want to increase the gas payment for as transaction I've already made that hasn't yet been included in a block so that the transaction gets included faster.\n\n### Description\n\nSee design below.  Note that these screens are from the forthcoming wallet design refresh.  To implement in the current wallet history screen, just use the new pending_state_icon.png (attached) to represent that a transaction is in the pending state in the history view.  \n\nNOTE: please use current wallet design for now, new wallet design will be tracked in a separate issue.\n\n![increase gas overview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22846356/94019748-08ac5200-fdaa-11ea-8300-197ecf0b6b8b.png)\n\nIcon (let me know what other icon format variants are required)\n![pending_state_icon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22846356/94019767-106bf680-fdaa-11ea-9c73-9ef303dee622.png)\n\nFor the gas adjustment dialogue, just use the existing screen (shown below) for the time being.  The updated wallet design will come later.\n![IMG_2037](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22846356/94027180-7a889980-fdb2-11ea-9917-fcf5f0b3e294.jpg)\n\n\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n\nTest case:\n1) After making a token transfer from their wallet, the user is redirected to the History screen\n2) On the History screen the user can see that their transaction is pending because the list item representing the transaction has a 'pending' icon (as opposed to the 'sent' and 'received' arrow icons).\n3) User taps the 'Increase gas' button and the Increase gas dialogue appears\n4) User uses the dialogue to increase the gas being paid for the transaction. After the user taps 'Update' the dialogue closes.\n6) In the History screen, User taps on the transaction to go to the Transaction Details screen.  They check that the updated gas price is correctly represented in the Transaction Details screen.\n7) When the transaction is included in a block, the list item representing the transaction in the history screen changes to the 'sent' state e.g. the icon changes to the 'Sent' icon and the 'Increase gas' button disappears. \n\n### Notes\n\n[comment]: # (For the developer who will implement. Include planning poker estimates, guidance, etc.)",
