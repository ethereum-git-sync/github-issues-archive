  "body": "# Feature Issue\nAdd human validation component (e.g. Captcha)\n\n### User Story\nAs a system\nI want to ask the user to complete a task that is difficult for a machine\nSo that I know that the user is likely human and I can determine what permissions and attributions to apply\n\n### Description\nWith permissionless account creation, it is trivial to bypass any blacklists and spam whitelists with requests; Creating infinite addresses to requests permissions, attributions, credits, etc. This can be mitigated by imposing limitations on permissions, attributions and credits.\n\nUnfortunately, particularly in case of the referral program, imposing limits causes issues. Permissionless account creation through scripts can allow for unlimited StarterPack claims, but imposing limits increases the average cost per acquisition for new users.\n\nAn alternative mitigation is to include a human validation task. Allowing to claim a StarterPack only if this task is completed.\n\n##### Requirements\n- The task can be a captcha or an activity in the application (TBD)\n- Task needs to be easy such that it does not significantly decrease attributions\n- Task is accessible from multiple entry points in the app (see image below for first entry points)\n- Task is suitable for Desktop interaction\n\n\n##### Entry points\n![Group 52.png](https://images.zenhubusercontent.com/5eaacc9bd76e4cffd53fcf08/9e267a1d-b9cd-4a42-b6e1-869de69528b1)\n\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n- User has to perform a task. If task is completed, Starter Pack can be claimed\n- Task is triggered from all entry points\n\n### Notes",

Extra integration (maybe) - have verification party alternative to Discord within Status\r\n\r\nBut as I started researching the above idea seems to be clicking for me right now.\r\n\r\nBrightID mobile app is actually a react-native app just like Status - It actually seems possible to build entire functionality of BrightID mobile app right within Status even.
