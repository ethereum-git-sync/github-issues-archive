  "body": "### Description\n[comment]: # (Feature or Bug? i.e Type: Bug)\n_Type_: Bug\n\n[comment]: # (Describe the feature you would like, or briefly summarise the bug and what you did, what you expected to happen, and what actually happens. Sections below)\n_Summary_: If correct PIN was entered to sign a transaction but card was removed before action is completed then 'PIN does not match' error is shown. In case user does not re-enter PIN and just holds card again then app considers that another attempt to enter a wrong PIN was made and show error thta user now has 2 retries to enter valid PIN.\n\n![Screenshot!UNITO-UNDERSCORE!20190403-164136](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6584810/55488712-dbf20100-5630-11e9-8b47-d636b6bd7c28.png)\n\nIssues:\n\n1. I would expect some other message like \"can't read card, please hold it to the back of your phone\". \n1. There are no 6 dots shown that would \"invite\" user to start typing PIN again. I would expect they are shown together with an error message\n1. Most dangerous: if user holds card to the phone again without entering PIN then for some reason it decides that wrong PIN was entered again and shows \"You have 2 reties left PIN does not match\"\n![Screenshot!UNITO-UNDERSCORE!20190403-165422](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6584810/55489156-ab5e9700-5631-11e9-9672-f6f6e42318d9.png)\n\n#### Expected behavior\n[comment]: # (Describe what you expected to happen.)\n1-2. Another message if can't read card\n\n1. If put card back then it uses PIN entered before and validates it \n\n### Reproduction\n[comment]: # (Describe how we can replicate the bug step by step.)\n\n* Open Status and sign in with keycard\n* Wallet -> Send transaction -> select some contact and valid ETH amount -> tap Sign Transaction\n* do not hold card next to the phone, Enter correct PIN\n* when requested to hold card - touch it for a second to the phone and remove\n* check error message shown\n* hold card back again (do not enter any PIN)\n* check error message (in my case it tells that 2 retries are left and PIN is not correct)\n* remove card and hold it again\n* check error message\n\n### Additional Information\n[comment]: # (Please do your best to fill this out.)\n\n* Status version: 0.12.0 apk http://status-im-prs.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/StatusIm-190402-123212-80ef5d-pr.apk\n* Operating System: Android 9, Pixel XL\n\n",
