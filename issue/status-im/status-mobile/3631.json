  "body": "### User Story\r\n\r\nAs a developer, I want to regularly build an app for iOS and Android locally and test its functionality. However, I've never been able to build and run iOS version and had hours long (sometimes days) struggle with various build process issues for Android. In BKK, 4 core developers were sitting at my laptop for a few hours, trying to build iOS version for the device, and the best result was is a build for iOS simulator. I can't reproduce it now, though.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, I know that many ClojureScript developers here were successful with building and running app locally. I can see two reasons for that:\r\n 1) non-deterministic build process\r\n 2) additional knowledge required, which is not codified into instructions or build scripts\r\n\r\nObviously, the complexity of the build process for `status-react` is huge, but this is an essential complexity and we can't avoid it. We can, however, hide this complexity behind scripts and automatization.\r\n\r\nFor me, one of the biggest issues with building status-react is the fact, that build process heavily depends on the system-wide state â€“ particular versions of the tools and frameworks (npm, gradle, re-natal, lein, SDKs etc) and the presence or absence of specific files and directories (npm caches, system-wide config files, etc). And knowledge about this is not codified in scripts or codified very sparsely.\r\n\r\nFor devs who want to occasionally sync the repo, and build the app, there is simply no way to know what is wrong in this complicated build pipeline and which versions of what they have to have.\r\n\r\nI believe the build process should be deterministic - any developer should be able to clone the repo, run build process and be sure that the build process will use the same versions and frameworks, without learning all the build stack herself. If core developer or a hacker at the hackathon or any contributor wants simply build the app, we should not require her/him any additional knowledge.\r\n\r\nFor me, this issue was a major blocker for many ideas for more than half a year and the reason why we couldn't ask hackers to hack on our app during EthDenver hackathon.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nBuild process is just a function of a) input files and b) development tools/scripts/libs, which produces an output - the app. We need this function to be self-sufficient and have all inputs determined and codified, so the result is always the same.\r\n\r\nI think the best solution for this sort of problems is to Dockerize the build tools, so the whole build process narrows down to passing current repository tree into docker container and executing it. This approach is common and hides the building complexity from developers.\r\n\r\nThe only program that developer need to install is a Docker. All correct versions of build tools are inside docker container, so there is no chance to have \"wrong\" version. Also, it's always executed with a clean slate, so no cache or system-wide global configuration files overlap problems.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe acceptance criteria for this issue will be a Dockerfile (or two, for iOS and Android, if it makes sense), that installs all needed tools and dependencies and build a docker container for local use. Further, developer can simply run `docker <container-name> -v ... build ios/android` and get the build artifact,\r\n\r\nThis approach might be difficult for debug/dev builds, where a few backgrounds need to be run, ports forwarder and REPL instantiated(?), but we can start with making non-debug builds reproducible.",
