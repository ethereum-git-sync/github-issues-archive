(a small icon next to the timestamp for example, a la whatsapp?)\r\n\r\nThere's a distinction between types of chats:\r\n\r\nA message will start in `Sending...` state. That's for all chats.\r\nA message will become `Sent` when it leaves your device. That's for all chats.\r\n\r\nThe above is all we have for community chats/public chats.\r\n\r\nA message will be marked as delivered when acknowledge by the other recipient in a one-to-one.\r\nA message will be marked as delivered when acknowledge by at least one other recipient in a private group chat.\r\n\r\nAll signals are already available since this feature was already present in the old UI.",
