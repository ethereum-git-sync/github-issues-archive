  "body": "# Problem\n\nCurrently Status only supports a limited fixed list which is manually maintained by core contributors.\nIf a user own some tokens which are not on that list, they would not appear in any of the Wallet screens.\n\nThe issue is particularly irritating when the user buys unsupported tokens on one of the exchange dapps listed in Status but then never sees them appear under assets.\n\n# Implementation\n\nScreen designs in figma - https://www.figma.com/file/XUehMnhyD1FGcWzvGz6SXqvh/Wallet_Source-of-Truth?node-id=160%3A3954\n\nMinimal path\n\n- new screens for custom token entry by address and token details (see designs)\n- validation that checks if the address corresponds to an ERC-20 token contract\n- validation that checks if the address is already in the token list\n- validation that checks that contract defines name, symbol and decimals fields (see MVP for constraints)\n- validation that checks if name or symbol of the added token isn't a duplicate of another already added token (see MVP for constraints)\n- new database operations to store, retrieve and delete custom tokens. Store address and all values retrieved from the contract (name, symbol, decimals).\n- addition of custom tokens loaded from database to all-tokens in app-db upon login\n- use the same logo icon for all custom tokens, in this iteration the default icon is fine\n\nSo, to summarize, the flow that allows the user to add a new custom token and then be able to send and receive them, both directly in wallet and in chat (subject to initial constrants).\n\nConstraints (i.e. what's being left out from the minimal path):\n\n- Strictly speaking, fields name, symbol and decimals are optional in ERC-20 and having our wallet rely on them being present in the contract is a departure from the standard. Still, in the first iteration, we can reduce the complexity of the UI by requiring the added tokens to define them, which reduces the UI to a single field with an address.\n- Strictly speaking, token name and symbol are not guaranteed to be unique. Furthermore they are even subject to change over time as tokens get rebranded. Still, for the first iteration we can simplify things by assuming that they are and restrict any duplicates. The ideal solution would be to allow users to override or somehow tag namesake tokens, e.g. \"My WETH\" as opposed to \"Other WETH\" but that is outside the scope of this issue.\n\n\n# Acceptance Criteria\n\nUser can add new tokens by address (subject to some constraints). After the addition, user can see the current balance of new tokens (if any) and send/receive them in wallet and chat.",

Happy to provide more details and examples for how others use it, but standard best practice \r\n\r\nThis is going to become incredibly important as the user base grows - as to my knowledge you cannot export your private key from Status - so those that have sent tokens thinking it was open are now stuck.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/status-im/status-react/issues/6542\r\nhttps://github.com/status-im/status-react/issues/4614",

    "body": "Apologies for the delays everyone, had my hand full elsewhere.\r\n\r\nI expanded the work description to include the itemized scope and removed some high complexity items from it. We can address those in a different issue/bounty when this one is done.\r\n\r\nAdded:\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nMinimal path\r\n\r\n- new screens for custom token entry by address and token details (see designs)\r\n- validation that checks if the address corresponds to an ERC-20 token contract\r\n- validation that checks if the address is already in the token list\r\n- validation that checks that contract defines name, symbol and decimals fields (see MVP for constraints)\r\n- validation that checks if name or symbol of the added token isn't a duplicate of another already added token (see MVP for constraints)\r\n- new database operations to store, retrieve and delete custom tokens. Store address and all values retrieved from the contract (name, symbol, decimals).\r\n- addition of custom tokens loaded from database to all-tokens in app-db upon login\r\n- use the same logo icon for all custom tokens, in this iteration the default icon is fine\r\n\r\nSo, to summarize, the flow that allows the user to add a new custom token and then be able to send and receive them, both directly in wallet and in chat (subject to initial constrants).\r\n\r\nConstraints (i.e. what's being left out from the minimal path):\r\n\r\n- Strictly speaking, fields name, symbol and decimals are optional in ERC-20 and having our wallet rely on them being present in the contract is a departure from the standard. Still, in the first iteration, we can reduce the complexity of the UI by requiring the added tokens to define them, which reduces the UI to a single field with an address.\r\n- Strictly speaking, token name and symbol are not guaranteed to be unique. Furthermore they are even subject to change over time as tokens get rebranded. Still, for the first iteration we can simplify things by assuming that they are and restrict any duplicates. The ideal solution would be to allow users to override or somehow tag namesake tokens, e.g. \"My WETH\" as opposed to \"Other WETH\" but that is outside the scope of this issue.\r\n",
