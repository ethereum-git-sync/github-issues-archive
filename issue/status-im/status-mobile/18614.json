  "body": "# Bug Report\r\n\r\n\r\n## Problem \r\nWhile receiving tons of collectibles the app doesn't respond to taps (although it's possible to scroll lists).\r\n\r\nWe fetch collectibles as soon as the user logs in, so if the user has many collectibles, the app will be unusable for a while.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe app runs smooth while fetching the collectibles.\r\n\r\n#### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nApp doesn't respond to taps, we can't easily navigate between tabs, and it's hard to press any button.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\n1. Go to wallet tab\r\n2. Add the following addresses to watch:\r\n  - `0x35f0686c63f50707ea3b5bace186938e4e19f03a`\r\n  - `0xeb47ee537303e8d763251b7fb79388e8a581da3c`\r\n  - `0x864bb6c6d2dfec8f138ffe77f5599c750ff80bd8`\r\n  - `0x2a4c5a11f0c1a2a1bc5dfe21c332261750369f0c`\r\n  - `0x9e6cbbfd4da15983675de9f10f7c847d2d7bf451`\r\n  \r\n  They have a variety of number of collectibles.\r\n  \r\n3. Log out\r\n4. Log in\r\n5. The app will be slowed down.\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nCurrently, we are getting the collectibles by batches from status-go, which is really good.\r\nBut there are two factors that could be improved and it's highly probable that they are the reason for the app to be non responsive:\r\n\r\n1. JS objects -> CLJS maps transformation.  \r\n\r\n    This one could be improved by implementing a similar techique that reagent does: use a cache to avoid transforming alredy transformed keys. - we could use this function every time we want to convert  keys, not only for collectibles.\r\n\r\n2. The re-frame event storing the collectibles.\r\n\r\n    At the end, the re-frame event is the one taking a lot of time to get completely computed, we can process the collectibles fetched in smaller batches so that they take less to get computed. We will end up taking a little more to store the total amount of collectibles, but the app won't be slowed down. \r\n    \r\n    To solve this we can configure the batch size requested from status-go or implement [a re-frame based solution](https://github.com/day8/re-frame/blob/master/docs/Solve-the-CPU-hog-problem.md#the-re-frame-solution).\r\n\r\n[comment]: # (Please, add logs/notes if necessary)\r\n\r\n",
