  "body": "# Bug Report\r\n\r\nThe `clear` icon is currently exported from Figma with the `X` in the center using **white pixels**. The problem is that in order to programmatically color icons, we need to use the `tintColor` prop of the RN `Image` component, but the prop works by tinting non-transparent pixels. Because the `X` is not transparent, any tint color will make the component look like a simple circle.\r\n\r\nNote: I haven't looked at other icons and if they could have the same issue.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46027/230887851-465404d2-23a6-4ae8-826e-8c3338575c2e.png\" width=\"500\" />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46027/230886933-b54acf4c-277a-48a3-abd4-c24e38c255e3.png\" width=\"300\" />\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nBring the topic to designers' attention and align with the dev team the best approach.\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\n\r\nFigma Iconset https://www.figma.com/file/qLLuMLfpGxK9OfpIavwsmK/Iconset?node-id=3239-987&t=sUSeh1WzRnxzYj3q-0",

    "body": "I talked to @pedro-et last week about this issue and he suggested we use SVGs for icons, instead of PNGs. Although the issue I reported can be solved by asking designers to update the clear icon to have an `X` in the center be **transparent** and then we add a white background in dark mode manually, they prefer if we use SVGs.\r\n\r\nI also think icons should be SVGs, but I'm probably missing something. @flexsurfer, @Parveshdhull, @brianfernalld, @OmarBasem do you know the primary reason for icons to be PNGs instead of SVGs? Have you perhaps found rendering issues? Performance issues maybe? Although we can easily memoize SVG icons and any performance hit should be nullified.\r\n\r\nEdit: For reference, the code below is a working example where we can control the foreground and background color of the clear icon.\r\n\r\n```clojure\r\n(defn clear-icon\r\n  [{:keys [size fg-color bg-color]\r\n    :or   {size 20}}]\r\n  [svg/svg\r\n   {:width    size\r\n    :height   size\r\n    :view-box (str \"0 0 \" size \" \" size)\r\n    :fill     :none}\r\n   [svg/path\r\n    {:d\r\n     \"M3 10C3 6.13401 6.13401 3 10 3C13.866 3 17 6.13401 17 10C17 13.866 13.866 17 10 17C6.13401 17 3 13.866 3 10Z\"\r\n     :fill bg-color}]\r\n   [svg/path\r\n    {:d\r\n     \"M9.15142 9.99998L7.07566 12.0757L7.9242 12.9243L9.99994 10.8485L12.0757 12.9242L12.9242 12.0757L10.8485 9.99998L12.9242 7.92421L12.0757 7.07568L9.99994 9.15145L7.92421 7.07572L7.07568 7.92425L9.15142 9.99998Z\"\r\n     :fill fg-color}]])\r\n```",

    "body": "> back then we had 2 problems, performance and lack of good implementation, it didn't work well for all different svgs and for all devices\r\n\r\nThanks for all the context way back to 2017!\r\n\r\n> hm, actually you say we still have to do something additional in the code to make it looks right, so probably we could use svg in that case for some \"special\" icons , wdyt? in that case we could have them as reagent components right ?\r\n\r\nCorrect, that would work @flexsurfer. But we'll have a bunch of exceptions, like `expand-topbar`, `pending-state`, `mutual-contact`, and others that can't be represented correctly with the usage of the `tintColor` property because they have 2 non-transparent colors.\r\n\r\nNowadays we have Figma and as far as I tested the SVG exported by Figma is quite clean and can be adapted to hiccup, and they rendered correctly. Of course, there are many icons I haven't tested, so take my experiment with a grain of salt.\r\n\r\nSo the ideal approach to me would be to have a single solution to all icons, not a mix of PNGs and SVGs, but let's do a mix for now and see how it goes. I agree with your suggestion, it's also less risky than changing a bunch of stuff and introducing issues in some devices, who knows. If, in the future, we feel using SVGs is the way to go we can gradually migrate the other icons anyway.\r\n\r\nThanks @flexsurfer, I'll try to fix only for the clear icon using an SVG for now.\r\n\r\n",
