  "body": "# Bug Report\r\n\r\n\r\n## Problem \r\nWe have an e2e test  [test_restore_multiaccount_with_waku_backup_remove_switch](https://ethstatus.testrail.net/index.php?/tests/view/3201388) that always recovers one certain user and checks that his contacts and communities are restored. As mentioned in https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/issues/15500 we had an issue with restored contact names. But from yesterday we see that no communities restored at all for this user\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\nAll 4 communities are restored from backup\r\n\r\n#### Actual behavior\r\nNo communities are restored from backup\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\n1. Having a user is in 4 communities:\r\n    - admin in an open community\r\n    - admin in a community with a restricted access\r\n    - member in an open community\r\n    - member in a community with a restricted access\r\n2. Recover this user\r\n3. Open Communities view\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n- Status version: nightly \r\n- Operating System: Android, iOS\r\n\r\n\r\n[comment]: # (Please, add logs/notes if necessary)\r\n[log_recover.txt](https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/files/12174122/log_recover.txt)\r\n\r\n[test_restore_multiaccount_with_waku_backup_remove_switch_geth1.log](https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/files/12174344/test_restore_multiaccount_with_waku_backup_remove_switch_geth1.log)\r\n",
