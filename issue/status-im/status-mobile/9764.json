  "body": "**ISSUE** \nWhen the card interacts with the phone, and the the card is removed from the proximity of the phone, the card can be killed. Killed menaing that it is impossible to have any interaction with the card anymore. For instance: card does not answer to any CLI command, or when tapped on walletconnect android app, when tapping the card on the main screen no interaction happen.\n\n**REPRODUCTION** \nSergii described steps to reproduce the issue at card loading stage. Here is the list of steps: \n1) ./keycard-cli delete -l debug\n2) ./keycard-cli install -l debug -a [path_to_cap.cap]\n3) Get Started -> Generate keys -> Next\n4) Select Keycard -> Next\n5) Begin setup\n4) Hold the card to the back of device\n5) Create PIN -> Confirm PIN\n6) White down PUK and Pair codes -> Next\n7) Remember Seed phrase -> Connfirm\n8) Confirm seed phrase with first word \n9) Confirm seed phrase with second word… be ready to uphold the card\n10) While Finishing Up… spinning - untold the card. At (low-middle device) it takes ~8-9 sec. Unhold the card during that time several times (at 3-5-7th second) \n\nIssue was reproduced with Status\n- on oneplus (GL and Michele)\n- on samsung s10 (Andrey)\n- on J7 (Sergey)\n\nIssue was not reproduced with Status \n-  on Xiaomi Note 9 pro and LGV20 by Chu\n\n~~For now, it's been impossible to reproduce the issue with Keycard WalletConnect app https://github.com/status-im/keycard-connect/releases/tag/20191128~~\n\nSTRATEGY\nA/ MID-LONG TERM : solve it with NXP or change card supplier \nB/ SHORT TERM : mitigate the reproductibility of the issue by optimizing how the client interacts with the card",
