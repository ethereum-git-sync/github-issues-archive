    "body": "Hey @mlennie, in Status you're not limited to a specific JS framework, you can use React or any other.  Ionic should work also but remember Status loads online dApps hosted on the internet (not native apps).\r\n\r\nMost of the HTML5/JS features should work just fine the usual way as you would use them in the browser; Status doesn't provide a bridge to the native features but it injects Web3 which provides functionality for eth payments.\r\n\r\nGeolocation currently doesn't work in Status (the permission handling isn't implemented). Permission handling for geolocation should be implemented later as part of #3046, I believe. Gyroscope works fine (tested with the latest build).\r\n\r\nHope this helps.",
