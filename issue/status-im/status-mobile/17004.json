  "body": "# Problem\r\n\r\nI have observed this problem while upgrading to react-native `0.70` as well.\r\nCurrently reproducible on builds at this PR : https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/pull/16721\r\nThe app will hang at splash screen and when you put the app in background and open it again that is when you will see this error.\r\n\r\n### Screenshot\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1053\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-08-13 at 6 34 17 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/assets/64726664/f59d5666-79a5-48cf-8ea2-f66207d23342\">\r\n\r\n\r\n## Hypothesis \r\n- This is not related to the recent `reagent` upgrade I have seen the exact same error before the `reagent` upgrade as well.\r\n- This error originates after upgrading `react-native` to `0.70` and exists in all further versions. So there must be some thing that changed with that `react-native` version.\r\n- This error message is related to the generated `jsbundle`. Somehow the `clojurescript` code has no build time reagent errors, otherwise it should have failed when running `make run-clojure`\r\nMeaning this is a runtime reagent/react error. \r\n\r\nreference in reagent repo : https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent/issues/382",
