So there must be some thing that changed with that `react-native` version.\r\n- This error message is related to the generated `jsbundle`. Somehow the `clojurescript` code has no build time reagent errors, otherwise it should have failed when running `make run-clojure`\r\nMeaning this is a runtime reagent/react error. \r\n\r\nreference in reagent repo : https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent/issues/382",
