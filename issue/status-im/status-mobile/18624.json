  "body": "# Bug Report\r\n\r\n\r\n## Problem \r\n\r\nWe encountered an issue in e2e tests when clicking on certain links, a blank community screen opens.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"484\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-01-25 at 13 59 09\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/assets/67952253/1e4a35fb-c052-4f1f-8350-a70afe0d522d\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Test example with video:** https://app.eu-central-1.saucelabs.com/tests/bd486b79f980443fbc5c7127d2194dd9?auth=78eb25acecf48b024d251656d3ee2ac7#121\r\n\r\nTried to reproduce this manually and found that it seems that only links to “old” communities work this way, i.e. communities that were created once, but then for some period of time (~30 days?) the admin of these communities did not recover their account on any device. This assumption is based on the fact that in the tests, communities for these links were created once, and then only links were used without recovering the admin-user themself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Link examples:**\r\n\r\n1. https://status.app/c#zQ3shbmfT3hvh4mKa1v6uAjjyztQEroh8Mfn6Ckegjd7LT3XK\r\n\r\n2. https://status.app/c/G8EAAGTiXKuwNbVVAu0GNLD-XzX4oz_E8oC1-7qSLikaTnCuG9Ag13ZgQKrMd8En9Qcpuaj3Qx3mfZ1atZzH8Zw-x_sFJ_MDv0P_7YfqoV-pNr3V4dsza-jVk41GaCGWasJb92Oer8qggaoNWf0tYCgSH19VonXciKPUz3ITdgke#zQ3shbmfT3hvh4mKa1v6uAjjyztQEroh8Mfn6Ckegjd7LT3XK\r\n\r\n3. https://status.app/c/ixiACjAKCHRlc3RDb21tEhZkemZ4Z2Nodmpra2xra2xrbCAgbGxsGAYiByM4OEIwRkYqARQD#zQ3shuK3RAMBGtNWJ5QAKtuGeyEhiwko5gXhyGg6T89Q2xrHq \r\n\r\n4. https://status.app/c/CxWACikKElQtZyBjb21tdW5pdHkgbWludBIFZmZmZmYYASIHIzIxNjI2NioBMwM=#zQ3shfxPTZ1dUZTXpjEwYHc2TMSeVjAA6JJ5SD46EVKM2Wtcb\r\n\r\n5. https://status.app/c/Ow==#zQ3shbmfT3hvh4mKa1v6uAjjyztQEroh8Mfn6Ckegjd7LT3XK\r\n\r\nNone of these links open on mobile or desktop (empty screen on mobile and the link is not clickable on desktop).\r\n\r\nIf you follow link 1 (without encoded data) the website also does not open if you open it in Chrome on your computer.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"366\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-01-25 at 13 44 50\" src=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/assets/67952253/bd847655-9c54-4f7b-ba6e-cc5dfa1cffda\">\r\n\r\nLinks in the format like link 5 don't work at all, even for new communities/users, if you follow them from outside the app. \r\nSo maybe this is a separate issue. \r\n\r\nThe main guess atm, and the question associated with it: is the data stored on Waku for communities supposed to expire after some time?\r\nIf so, is this period equal to the storage period for backed-up data - 30 days?\r\n**And the main question is: is this an issue or expected behavior?**\r\n\r\ncc'ing @igor-sirotin and @yqrashawn, maybe you have some info/idea on this matter? \r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduction (hypothetical steps):\r\n\r\n1. Create a community, save the community invite link\r\n2. Don't recover the admin user for ~30 days\r\n3. Share the with another user in a Status chat\r\n4. Follow the link\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n- Status version: nightly 25/01\r\n- Operating System: Android, iOS\r\n\r\n\r\n[comment]: # (Please, add logs/notes if necessary)\r\n\r\n",

It's the community control node responsibility to stay online, the app will automatically push the community description to the network each 5 minutes (not sure of this period).\r\n\r\nSwitching to an empty screen doesn't look like a good solution to me. Probably we should come up with some UI design for such case. \r\n\r\nSame thing about profile links btw. ",

    "body": "@igor-sirotin thanks for the answer and explanation!\r\n\r\n> Yes, it's expected 🙂\r\n\r\nThe puzzle is solved now! 👍\r\n\r\n> Switching to an empty screen doesn't look like a good solution to me. Probably we should come up with some UI design for such case.\r\n\r\nI'll communicate this to design and John. \r\n\r\n> Not sure what's wrong with this one. Parses fine for me\r\n\r\nYes, it looks like the only difference is the presence of encoded data in the link itself. But the reason is the same.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI'll close this issue for now. If necessary, will open a separate one for `https://status.app/c/Ow==` links when get an answer. ",
