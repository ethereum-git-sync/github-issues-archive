  "body": "Currently where the spec has None for simple values, like ValidatorIndex (a ulong), we are using a placeholder ulong.MaxValue - 1. (Because ulong.MaxValue has meaning in the spec for Slot as FarFutureEpoch)\r\n\r\nIt is probably more correct to represent these as Nullable.\r\n\r\nIn many cases they are parameters to routines, in which case maybe Nullable<ValidatorIndex> is okay.\r\n\r\nAnother option would be to make the internal field of ValidatorIndex nullable, to represent the special value, or some other flag. But seems pretty messy.\r\n\r\nAnyway, review all the usages of the field, and if using straight Nullable<> is easy enough just do it.",
