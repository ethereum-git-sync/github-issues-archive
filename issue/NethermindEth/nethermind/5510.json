  "body": "Does it follow the Ethereum standard to require at least ten percent increase in gas price to replace a transaction? What is the motivation behind it? The line I refer to in code is:\r\nhttps://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind/blob/110e53d3e4e82cdd5cb5621a1acc0b1ef55f23a3/src/Nethermind/Nethermind.TxPool/Comparison/CompareReplacedTxByFee.cs#L21\r\n\r\nThe comment above the line says _It is required to avoid acceptance and propagation of transaction with almost the same fee as replaced one._ Why would such a transaction not be propagated? What is the exact issue prevented by this? If a transaction has higher gas price than the old transaction, then it gets superseded. If the idea is to prevent bulk transactions from replacing each other, then one could argue that those transactions may very well have a higher gas price difference than ten percent.",
