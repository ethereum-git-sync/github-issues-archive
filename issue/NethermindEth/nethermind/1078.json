  "body": "Note that store is an interface point IStoreProvider/IStore, so I planned multiple implementations; an in-memory one that can be used for unit tests, quick-start test net, etc.  I don't know RocksDB, so would probably have used some basic persistence for the first workable version; then have a third optimised, but can go straight to RocksDB. In the future I would probably still look at offering alternatives like Azure/AWS/etc, in case people want to be able to query it, explore it, etc. The interface should be relatively straight forward to implement an alternative. I even renamed the existing to MemoryStore, so we would have RocksDbStore beside it (AzureStore, etc), and config to switch between the two. There was one method in ForkChoice that did some searching that I thought should also move into IStore directly.",
