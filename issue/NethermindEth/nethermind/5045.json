  "body": "Reported by user `guaxinim.sol` on discord:\r\n```\r\nHey folks!\r\nI'm currently trying to check my node's sync status through the Prometheus metrics module.\r\nI was trying to use the nethermind_state_synced metric but I've queried the last 30 days and it kept 0 (not synced as mentioned by @OlegJakushkin here: https://discord.com/channels/629004402170134531/629004402170134537/1046663414988165120). \r\nI've made eth_syncing  and eth_blockNumber node calls in order to confirm sync status, but they showed my node was perfectly synced.\r\n\r\nHave you ever seen this behavior before? \r\nHow can I set/configure Prometheus metrics to properly shows sync state over nethermind_state_syncedmetrics?\r\n\r\nBTW, I was browsing the metrics docs and I ran into nethermind_blockchain_height and I was thinking to evaluate node's head lag roughly by subtracting (nethermind_blockchain_height - nethermind_blocks) as a temp fix/workaround, but I've realized that nethermind_blockchain_height simply gone on nethermind v1.14.7. Am I missing something here?\r\n\r\nNethermind version: v1.14.7\r\nSpecs: 8 CPU - 64GB RAM\r\nPlatform: Docker\r\n\r\nI appreciate your help guys ðŸ™‚\r\n```\r\nlink to msg above: https://discord.com/channels/629004402170134531/629004402170134537/1054901170868596748\r\n\r\nI took a look on our grafana and can confirm that we have `StateSynced = 0` on many synced nodes",
