    "body": "Sorry, the \"something sneaky\" is a malicious actor introducing a vulnerability into the `dotnet:2.2-sdk` build pipeline or into the Nethermind build pipeline.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nBy using a digest, upgrades to base images are always intentional, and you'll never end up in a situation where an attacker can compromise the dotnet build pipeline and then trigger an official nethermind build (or just time the attack to coincide with nethermind builds).  Instead, the attacker would need to compromise the `dotnet:2.2-sdk` build pipeline and then convince the nethermind team to update the digest, which is significantly more complicated.\r\n\r\nWhile this may be a relatively unlikely attack vector, it is one that is trivially addressed by using digests instead of tags, and in a space where people are dealing with large amounts of money, small changes that don't have a negative impact on usability can be worth it.\r\n\r\nNote: There is value in Nethermind regularly updating the dotnet digest to latest, I just believe that these should be intentional events, not something that happens automatically without no human input as part of CI.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThe other reason to use digests is that it allows a third party auditor to easily verify the CI builds.  Once verified, they can assert to everyone \"this build of Nethermind checks out, I verified the hash against a build I ran locally and it matches\".  With no digest, the auditor cannot easiely validate that the image contains what Nethermind team says it contains, so all users have to implicitly trust Nethermind to not do anything \"sneaky\".  Something \"sneaky\" here would be to say that you are building with Dockerfile `x`, but in reality build with Dockerfile `y` which contains some backdoor code.",
