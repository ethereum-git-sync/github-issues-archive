There is no info at all - only info is:\r\n```\r\nFull Pruning In Progress: 00:00:57.0603307 1.00 mln nodes mirrored.\r\nFull Pruning In Progress: 00:01:40.3677103 2.00 mln nodes mirrored.\r\nFull Pruning In Progress: 00:02:25.6437030 3.00 mln nodes mirrored.\r\n```\r\nand at the end:\r\n`Full Pruning Finished: 15:25:59.1620756 1,560.29 mln nodes mirrored.`\r\nbut lately on one of the users logs I saw that this number keeps increasing:\r\n`Full Pruning Finished: 07:35:54.9600798 1,680.70 mln nodes mirrored.`\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIt would be nice to somehow \"fetch\" initial guess from the system how much nodes it may need to mirror to complete pruning and refresh it once every 1 hour to adjust it. This would at least give moreless idea where are we at right now and how much it is yet to be done.\r\n",
