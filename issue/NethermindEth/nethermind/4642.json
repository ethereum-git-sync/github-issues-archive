  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nWe are seeing a issue with starting a Validator with staking before Node is fully synced (after StateNodes but before OldBodies/OldReceipts). We need to think about optimalization in that area.\r\n\r\n**Potential improvements:**\r\n1. Config flag to move OldBodies/OldReceipts before state. Drawback - Following chain procedure will be way much longer\r\n2. Prioritize New blocks rather than OldBodies/OldReceipts with some locks- hard to say if this is achievable in short-term but should seems to be a good starting point",
