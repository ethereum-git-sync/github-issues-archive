    "body": "After reviewing closely main changes suggested for now would be:\r\n* bigger write cache but smaller write cache number - this change is more by intuition based on reading\r\n* multi threaded compaction to increase the throughput on SSDs - seems to be bringing great results\r\n - in my case the DB has some bad score - 1.1 - 1.3 on all levels which cleared quickly with 500MB/s reads/writes with multi threaded compactions\r\n\r\n* will need to manage DB size parameter to be split into memtables (currently at 128MB) + blok cache; at 300GB my indexes took 3GB when all loaded to memory - when allocating 4GB memory it will be just fine to keep everything in - in such case we can set to keep filters and indexes in block cache and just control size of the block cache\r\n* need to look at index/filter partitioning - it seems that we would need to update our RocksDB version / update the RocksDbSharp wrapper\r\n* bottommost compression is not set - this may help, although even without it seems that our DB sizes are smaller than reported by Geth (due to the way we handle storage - worth analyzing)\r\n* we use Snappy on high levels - can check how we could enable LZ4 which was suggested by RocksDb creators to be always a better choice\r\n* need to check if options.OptimizeForPointLookup(128) actually works as the logs are suggesting that this setting is entirely ignored and 8MB * 4 block cache is used instead\r\n",
