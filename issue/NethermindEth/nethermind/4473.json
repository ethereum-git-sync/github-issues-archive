Please describe.**\r\nUsers are often asking questions related to our syncing process\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIt would be nice to create a page in our docs and just link it instead of writing an answer every time\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nIt could be something like this, but with better wording and with screens:\r\n\r\nIn our SnapSync/FastSync we are using pivot - known canonical block (pivotNumber, pivotHash, pivotTotalDifficulty) close to the head. We are full syncing blocks after the pivot and only downloading data before it.\r\n1) downloading headers after pivot (and OldHeaders - headers before pivot - in paralel)\r\n2) when we finish downloading headers after pivot, we start 2a or 2b depends of config\r\n2a) SnapSync Phase 1 - snap ranges and Phase 2 - healing (in logs as StateSync)\r\n2b) in FastSync it's StateSync\r\nAfter 2) our state is synced and node is downloading and processing new blocks (or after merge receiving payloads and processing)\r\n3) Old Bodies download - downloading bodies of blocks before pivot\r\n4) Old Receipts - downloading receipts from blocks before pivot\r\nWe are updating pivot in every release so it's worth to always use the newest version of nethermind\r\n\r\n\r\n",
