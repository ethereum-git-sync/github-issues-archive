  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nAs for now, we need to manually set a version before releasing. We should consider automating it together with our Release Workflow - version should be based on tag.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nWhile running Release workflow, as a very first stage, we should take a TAG provided, update Directory.Build.props file and push changes to master and release branches. Then rest of procedure should be applied.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nNo alternatives for this process but I see some extensions to it.\r\nWe may want to add to additional informations to Version number:\r\n1. \"unstable\" - when package/docker image/builded version is created from master branch\r\n2. \"preview\" - when package/docker image/builded version is created from release branch\r\n\r\nAlso it would be nice to automate next-version number.\r\nExample is:\r\nWe will release 1.14.4. Every new change above 14.4 tag and release should be 14.5-unstable. \r\nIt would be great to automate that in some proper way as well.\r\n",
