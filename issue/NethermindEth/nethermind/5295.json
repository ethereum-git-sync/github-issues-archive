  "body": "In networks with mostly/only Nethermind nodes, such as Gnosis chain and Chiado, Erigon nodes are sometimes unable to find peers that stay connected and sync.\r\n\r\nProposed solution: Nethermind considers peers with block height 0 as useless and drops them. Other Nethermind nodes as well as Trinity nodes are exempt from this rule, as they report block number 0 during sync and may still be useful.\r\n\r\nSince Erigon during its staged sync also stays on block height 0 for a long time, we would like to be added to the list of exempt clients.\r\n\r\nUseless peer check in Nethermind:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind/blob/7978ca15cba54d8c10e389f1a36bbfbee9ca4924/src/Nethermind/Nethermind.Synchronization/Peers/SyncPeerPool.cs#L496\r\n\r\nRelated erigon issue: https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon/issues/6307",
