Make a option of syncing state while online - Start snap sync on a secondary state and when finished swap old state with new one.\r\n- It may overwhelm node during attestation - but resync is disabling attestation possibility at all - so even 50% of attestation during resync is much better than 0\r\n2. Make a option of removing state/receipts/bodies directories and after restart resync only this part - useful in case that something is wrong with receipts or we want only to resync state without receipts/bodies etc.\r\n",
