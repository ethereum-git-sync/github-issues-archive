    "body": "Autogenerated, one time edited draft. To be updated with:\n - Graphs examples\n\n# Validator Effectiveness & Attestations in Nethermind Ethereum Client\n\nEthereum network attestations are validator votes on block validity. A validator's performance is pivotal to the Ethereum blockchain's operation, gauging a node's efficiency in verifying and proposing blocks. It encompasses factors like computational power, network speed, and storage capacity.\n\nKey performance indicators are:\n\n1. **Block Proposals**: Validator-proposed blocks count.\n\n2. **Attestations**: Count of validator attestations.\n\n3. **Slashings**: Times a validator has been slashed for malicious conduct.\n\n4. **Inclusion Distance**: Slots between when an attestation should and was included.\n\n5. **Uptime**: Online and available times to total time ratio for a validator.\n\n## Common Problems & Solutions\n\nBased on analysis of common issues discussed, here are some problems and suggested remedies:\n\n| Attestations Issue | Solution |\n|-------------------|--------------------|\n| Missed Attestations | Check hardware specs, network connectivity, and Ethereum client sync. |\n| Slow Syncing | Increase hardware capacity, switch to NVMe SSDs, check network connectivity. |\n| Execution Engine Sync Issues | Keep the engine synced, contact support for specific errors. |\n| Limited Disk Space | Ensure sufficient disk space. |\n| Pruning Problems | Verify node sync status, increase pruning cache size. |\n| Network Connectivity | Check ports, firewalls, network configurations. |\n| High Memory Usage | Increase RAM, monitor and manage Ethereum client resources. |\n| Configuration Problems | Consult Nethermind documentation, contact support for specific configurations. |\n| Performance Degradation after Updates | Check release notes for performance changes, contact support. |\n| \"Optimistic Head\" and Sync Issues | Check client logs for errors, upgrade to latest Nethermind version. |\n| Chain Verification Warnings | Share logs, configs, and other details with dev team for troubleshooting. |\n\nEach issue is unique, so suggested solutions might not always apply. For tailored support, consult our support team [on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/629004402170134531/629004402170134537).\n\n## Enhancing Validator Performance \n\n### Storage Operations\nValidator performance significantly depends on storage type. NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory express) drives, faster than SSDs, are recommended for quick block validation and attestation. They offer:\n\n1. **Speed**: Faster than traditional SSDs.\n\n2. **Concurrency**: Handles more simultaneous connections.\n\n3. **Efficiency**: Uses less power per transaction.\n\n4. **Durability**: Longer lifespan leading to less maintenance downtime.\n\nThus, NVMe drives boost validator performance in Nethermind Ethereum client.\n\n### Pruning\nNethermind supports two pruning types: old bodies and full pruning. \n\n**Old Bodies Pruning**: The state is kept, and old block bodies are pruned. Attestations are essential for validators to check recent blocks' validity.\n\n**Full Pruning**: Data older than a certain point is removed, including state and block bodies. Attestations are vital to verify blocks aren't pruned.\n\n",
