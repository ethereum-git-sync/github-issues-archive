To be updated with:\n - Real metrics values\n - Graphs examples\n\n# Validator Performance and Attestations in Nethermind Ethereum Blockchain Client\n\nIn the Nethermind Ethereum Blockchain client, validator performance and attestations are critical aspects to consider for optimal operation and maintenance. They play a significant role in the correct functioning and efficient performance of the Ethereum network.\n\n## Validator Performance\nValidator performance in the Nethermind Ethereum client is critical for the operation of the Ethereum blockchain, as it refers to the efficiency and effectiveness of a validator node in verifying and proposing new blocks. It involves several factors, including computational power, network speed, and storage capacity.\n\nThe key metrics to evaluate validator performance include:\n\n1. **Block Proposals**: The number of blocks proposed by the validator.\n\n2. **Attestations**: The number of attestations made by the validator.\n\n3. **Slashings**: The number of times the validator has been slashed for malicious behavior.\n\n4. **Inclusion Distance**: The number of slots between when a validatorâ€™s attestation should have been included and when it was actually included.\n\n5. **Uptime**: The ratio of the total number of times a validator is online and available to validate transactions to the total time.\n\n## Attestations\nAttestations in the Ethereum network refer to the votes by validators concerning the validity of a block. In other words, when a validator observes that a block has been processed correctly, it attests to that block.\n\nThe two types of pruning in Nethermind are old bodies and full pruning. \n\n**Old bodies pruning** - In this mode, the state is fully kept and only old block bodies are pruned. Attestations during this type of pruning are important as validators need to check the validity of recent blocks. \n\n**Full pruning** - In full pruning, the entire data older than a certain point is removed, including the state and the block bodies. Attestations become crucial in this scenario because validators need to make sure the blocks they're validating aren't pruned.\n\n## Importance of SSD, Ideally NVMe\n\nThe performance of a validator in the Nethermind Ethereum client is significantly impacted by the type of storage used. Fast Solid State Drives (SSD), and particularly NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory express) drives, are recommended.\n\nNVMe drives provide several advantages:\n\n1. **Speed**: NVMe drives are faster than traditional SSDs, which leads to quicker block validation and attestation.\n\n2. **Concurrency**: NVMe drives can handle more simultaneous connections, allowing for more efficient processing of multiple transactions and blocks.\n\n3. **Efficiency**: NVMe drives use less power per transaction, making them more energy-efficient.\n\n4. **Durability**: NVMe drives tend to have a longer lifespan than traditional SSDs, leading to less downtime for maintenance and replacements.\n\nFor these reasons, utilizing an NVMe drive can greatly enhance the validator performance in the Nethermind Ethereum client.",
