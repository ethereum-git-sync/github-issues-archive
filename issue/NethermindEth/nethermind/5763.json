To be updated with:\r\n - Graphs examples\r\n\r\n# Validator Effectiveness & Attestations in Nethermind Ethereum Client\r\n\r\nEthereum network attestations are validator votes on block validity. A validator's performance is pivotal to the Ethereum blockchain's operation, gauging a node's efficiency in verifying and proposing blocks. It encompasses factors like computational power, network speed, and storage capacity.\r\n\r\nKey performance indicators are:\r\n\r\n1. **Block Proposals**: Validator-proposed blocks count.\r\n\r\n2. **Attestations**: Count of validator attestations.\r\n\r\n3. **Slashings**: Times a validator has been slashed for malicious conduct.\r\n\r\n4. **Inclusion Distance**: Slots between when an attestation should and was included.\r\n\r\n5. **Uptime**: Online and available times to total time ratio for a validator.\r\n\r\n## Common Problems & Solutions\r\n\r\nBased on analysis of common issues discussed, here are some problems and suggested remedies:\r\n\r\n| Attestations Issue | Solution |\r\n|-------------------|--------------------|\r\n| Missed Attestations | Check hardware specs, network connectivity, and Ethereum client sync. |\r\n| Slow Syncing | Increase hardware capacity, switch to NVMe SSDs, check network connectivity. |\r\n| Execution Engine Sync Issues | Keep the engine synced, contact support for specific errors. |\r\n| Limited Disk Space | Ensure sufficient disk space. |\r\n| Pruning Problems | Verify node sync status, increase pruning cache size. |\r\n| Network Connectivity | Check ports, firewalls, network configurations. |\r\n| High Memory Usage | Increase RAM, monitor and manage Ethereum client resources. |\r\n| Configuration Problems | Consult Nethermind documentation, contact support for specific configurations. |\r\n| Performance Degradation after Updates | Check release notes for performance changes, contact support. |\r\n| \"Optimistic Head\" and Sync Issues | Check client logs for errors, upgrade to latest Nethermind version. |\r\n| Chain Verification Warnings | Share logs, configs, and other details with dev team for troubleshooting. |\r\n\r\nEach issue is unique, so suggested solutions might not always apply. For tailored support, consult our support team [on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/629004402170134531/629004402170134537).\r\n\r\n## Enhancing Validator Performance \r\n\r\n### Storage Operations\r\nValidator performance significantly depends on storage type. NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory express) drives, faster than SSDs, are recommended for quick block validation and attestation. They offer:\r\n\r\n1. **Speed**: Faster than traditional SSDs.\r\n\r\n2. **Concurrency**: Handles more simultaneous connections.\r\n\r\n3. **Efficiency**: Uses less power per transaction.\r\n\r\n4. **Durability**: Longer lifespan leading to less maintenance downtime.\r\n\r\nThus, NVMe drives boost validator performance in Nethermind Ethereum client.\r\n\r\n### Pruning\r\nNethermind supports two pruning types: old bodies and full pruning. Pruning can help your client to perform better and store all the data needed with a smaller footprint:\r\n**Old Bodies Pruning**: The state is kept, and old block bodies are pruned. \r\n**Full Pruning**: Data older than a certain point is removed, including state and block bodies. \r\n\r\n## FAQ\r\n> Q: Often, I am missing my attestations why?\r\n> A: Check Drive type (shall be NVMe SSD) - maybe you are not fully synced; check networking performance - maybe you lose connection from time to time; share your problem on Discord\r\n\r\n> Q: do you know how it is related to full pruning and old bodies/receipts sync?\r\n> A: If pruning is in progress, this can affect Attestations performance, \r\n\r\nQ: and what metric in Nethermind is related to it\r\nA: please see this metric: New Payload Exec time //TODO add\r\n//Todo make shorter\r\n\r\n",

A validator's performance is pivotal to the Ethereum blockchain's operation, gauging a node's efficiency in verifying and proposing blocks.\r\n\r\n## FAQ\r\n\r\n**Q: Often, I am missing my attestations, why?**  \r\n**A**: Check the type of Drive you are using, it should be an NVMe SSD. Perhaps you're not fully synced? Also, check your networking performance - you might be losing connection intermittently. Don't hesitate to share your problems on our Discord channel.\r\n\r\n**Q: Do you know how it is related to full pruning and old bodies/receipts sync?**  \r\n**A**: If pruning (**Old Bodies Pruning** or **Full Pruning**) is in progress, it can affect Attestations performance. Please refer to the related metrics.\r\n\r\n**Q: What metric in Nethermind is related to it?**  \r\n**A**: Please refer to the following metrics: `nethermind_new_payload_execution_time`, `nethermind_state_db_pruning`. If you see times exceeding 2 seconds, it could indicate a problem.\r\n\r\n![nethermind_new_payload_execution_time in Grafana](https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind/assets/2915361/d708ca8a-4573-4e02-8c57-b0cb8120117c.png)\r\n",
