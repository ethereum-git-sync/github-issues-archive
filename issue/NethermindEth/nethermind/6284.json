  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nWe need some kind of throttling when sending/receiving blob txs\r\n\r\nHow networking of blob txs works?\r\nBlob txs are never gossiped as full txs to other peers. Blob txs are announced in form of `NewPooledTransactionHashesMessage` - in message with hashes, types and sizes.\r\n\r\n1st scenario:\r\nWe are sending `NewPooledTransactionHashesMessage` when we receive new blob tx\r\nPeer can response with `GetPooledTransactionsMessage` - hashes of requested transactions\r\nWe are then responding with `PooledTransactionsMessage` - message with full transactions\r\nIt is handled here: https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind/blob/master/src/Nethermind/Nethermind.Network/P2P/Subprotocols/Eth/V66/Eth66ProtocolHandler.cs#L161-L167\r\n\r\nAt this point we need some limitation for amount of data which we are sending, to not affect health of the node. Maybe reduce/throttle announces when there is too much data flowing? Maybe not, and just create a queue with `GetPooledTransactionsMessages` waiting for response?\r\n\r\n2nd scenario:\r\nWe are receiving `NewPooledTransactionHashesMessage`. It is handled here https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind/blob/master/src/Nethermind/Nethermind.Network/P2P/Subprotocols/Eth/V68/Eth68ProtocolHandler.cs#L76-L102\r\nWith actual requests send here: https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind/blob/master/src/Nethermind/Nethermind.Network/P2P/Subprotocols/Eth/PooledTxsRequestor.cs#L75-L109\r\n\r\nThen we are receiving `PooledTransactionsMessage` with full txs.\r\n\r\nWe need some limitation here as well. Maybe it would be enough to change flag `CanReceiveTransactions` when we need to throttle a bit?\r\nFlag is used in both places, when receiving hashes:\r\nhttps://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind/blob/master/src/Nethermind/Nethermind.Network/P2P/Subprotocols/Eth/V68/Eth68ProtocolHandler.cs#L56\r\nand when receiving full txs:\r\nhttps://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind/blob/master/src/Nethermind/Nethermind.Network/P2P/Subprotocols/Eth/V66/Eth66ProtocolHandler.cs#L102\r\n\r\nIf flag will be changed to not accept hashes/txs, maybe it's worth to save hashes to request it later? But it's optional, most important part is to not let the node die when spammed hard",
