Chrome, firefox and opera are using webauthn and Windows Hello API instead. Ledger wallet may suggest to use Webusb even though windows have to fix a problem in Webusb. I have read [some enhancement](https://github.com/MyCryptoHQ/MyCrypto/pull/2569) from Mycrypto. \r\nAnd they have [fall back to U2F on Windows with Ledger devices](https://github.com/MyCryptoHQ/MyCrypto/pull/2581).\r\nIs there any plan to add Webusb support for Ledger wallet user?\r\n \r\n",
