  "body": "- **I'm submitting a ...**\r\n\r\n- [X ] Bug report\r\n\r\n- **Bug Report**\r\n  - What is the current behavior?  Attempting to withdraw ETH via MEW's MakerDAO interface results in a failure.  Error report includes an indication that The EVM reverted the transaction:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25880798/61646748-4d55ce00-ac79-11e9-9c97-d6c5839f412a.png)\r\n\r\n  - If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem:\r\n*Open a CDP using the MEW interface\r\n*Collaterlize some ETH\r\n*Generate some DAI\r\n*Withdraw the DAI and use as needed\r\n*Hold the CDP (and keep loaned DAI) for 5 days\r\n*Payback the DAI debt via the MEW interface\r\n*Attempt to withdraw the ETH using the MEW interface\r\n\r\n  - What is the expected behavior?  Expected behavior is that one would be able to withdraw the collateralized ETH after satisfying the DAI debt in the CDP.\r\n  - What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?  To be able to use the MEW interface to the MakerDAO for the full lifecycle of a CDP.  As it stands one must move the CDP to a wallet that is natively supported by the cdp portal on MakerDAO to successfully withdraw ETH\r\n  - Please tell us about your environment:\r\n    - Operating system - both Mac OS X (10.14.5) and Linux (Fedora 30)\r\n    - Browser and version Google Chrome latest stable release\r\n  - Other information (e.g. detailed explanation, stacktraces, related issues, suggestions how to fix, links for us to have context, eg. stackoverflow, gitter, etc)\r\n  Here is a video walk through of the challenge (with intro):\r\nhttps://youtu.be/071Qu5c8cMY\r\n\r\n",
