I will recommend not using MyEtherWallet.\r\nIf you are looking into starting a small project i will recommend you to look into better repositories.\r\n\r\nPlease see older similar isssues related to this:\r\nhttps://github.com/MyEtherWallet/MyEtherWallet/issues/3462\r\n\r\nHorrible organization. Stay away from this, and do not trust this project node_modules to production enviroment.\r\n\r\nRegards.",
