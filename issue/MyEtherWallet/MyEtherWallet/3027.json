  "body": "Dear MEW devs, we are looking forward to improving the Market Fee on Ethereum blockchain. We are a couple of engineers proposing an EIP improvement based on EIP-1559. We estimate 1559 is great but we propose an improvement to:\r\n\r\n* further reduce the gas price volatility with a median function (on premium gas price on top of base fees);\r\n* reduce base fees volatility with an additive function (linear dynamic) instead of multiplicative (ie. exponential dynamic);\r\n* _reduce the footprint of the changes on wallets and clients by maintaining the same tx format and UI._\r\n\r\nI know you have probably expressed your opinion before but we will appreciate if you can leave a **Support _+1_ , NotSupport _-1_, or NeedMoreInfo** opinion or comments on the forums from client/wallet apps before the AllCoreDevs meeting this Friday. This can helps us avoid the proposal get pushed for August or later:\r\n\r\nProposal:\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-3416.md\r\nEIP-33416 proposal for London fork:\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/294\r\nDiscord (Fee Market):\r\nhttps://discord.com/channels/595666850260713488/749160974506000444\r\n\r\nUI Comparison Diagram:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80925920/114789237-14ca2200-9d83-11eb-9d07-903e4f324f56.png)\r\nBest,\r\nHexZorro\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80925920/114789602-a6399400-9d83-11eb-9f8f-e79640d9259b.png)\r\n",
