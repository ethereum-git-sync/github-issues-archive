So the app is essentially in a broken state because it can't make requests to `api.myetherwallet.com`\r\n\r\nTo fix the issue, either properly redirect all myetherwallet.com requests to www.myetherwallet.com, or, configure the api.myetherwallet.com CORS policy so that api.myetherwallet.com can be accessed from the myetherwallet.com domain.\r\n",
