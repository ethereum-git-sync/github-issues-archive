Be aware that it might still be mined!\" So possibly it is not a bug and wallet should not prompt me for writing a bug report.\r\n\r\n  * Please tell us about your environment:\r\n    * Operating system\r\nWindows 10\r\n\r\n    * Browser and version\r\nChrome Version 94.0.4606.81 (Official Build) (64-bit)\r\n\r\n  * Other information (e.g. detailed explanation, stacktraces, related issues, suggestions how to fix, links for us to have context, eg. stackoverflow, gitter, etc)\r\n  * Where can this be found? e.g: `/interface`, `/create-wallet`, etc.\r\n",
