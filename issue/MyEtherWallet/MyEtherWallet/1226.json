  "body": "- **I'm submitting a ...**\r\n\r\n  - [ ] Feature request\r\n\r\n- **Feature Request**\r\n\r\n  - Briefly explain the feature you would like us to implement\r\nIn this issue the Pocket Network team would like to propose an integration between Pocket Core MVP and MyEtherWallet, allowing users to utilize the Pocket Core MVP network of nodes (currently 6 different infrastructure providers) to connect to the blockchain using a trusted decentralized network of nodes via random access across different requests.\r\n\r\n  - What are the current issues this feature will solve\r\nCurrently MEW supports connecting to the network via a custom RPC URL or a centralized provider. By adding this integration, users would have the option to have an alternative decentralized node provider for any network that Pocket Supports (Currently ETH, POA and ETC), with the potential to support many others dynamically without code changes.\r\n\r\n  - Is this feature cross compatible with other ethereum networks\r\nYes, any network with a HTTP interface is compatible.\r\n\r\n  - Are you willing to help us with development support if required\r\nYes, the Pocket Network team would put resources for support if needed.\r\n\r\n  - Where can this be added? e.g: `/interface`, `/create-wallet`, etc.\r\nAny screen with the Network popup or Network selection menu.\r\n\r\nFor more information regarding Pocket Network and Pocket Core MVP please refer to the links below:\r\n\r\n1. [Pocket Network website]( https://pokt.network )\r\n2. [Pocket Core MVP](https://pokt.network/pocket-core-mvp)\r\n3. [Pocket Developer Portal](https://docs.pokt.network)\r\n",
