  "body": "- **I'm submitting a ...**\n\n  - [x] Feature request\n\n- **Feature Request**\n\n  - Briefly explain the feature you would like us to implement\n    - When a new HWW connection is initialized, or the network is changed, it would be nice to let the device know about the selected network (mainnet, testnet, etc.), not just the keypath\n  - What are the current issues this feature will solve\n    - This is with regards with an issue I ran into when integrating the BitBox02 (https://github.com/MyEtherWallet/MyEtherWallet/pull/1957)\n    - For security and privacy reasons, our firmware does not allow signing for example mainnet transactions (normally `m/44'/60'/0'/0`) with accounts from other keypaths, such as the standard testnet `m/44'/1'/0'/0`\n    - Having this feature would help with an early detection if a user selects a network and keypath whose combination is not supported by the HWW device and a warning would be shown with appropriate instruction which keypaths are valid for a given network. \n    - Currently, the user may be able to receive funds on a keypath they cannot spend from as enforced by the firmware\n  - Is this feature cross compatible with other ethereum networks\n    - Yes\n  - Are you willing to help us with development support if required\n    - Yes\n  - Where can this be added?\n    - `NetworkAndAnddressModal.vue`",
