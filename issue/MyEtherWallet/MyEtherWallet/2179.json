  "body": "In your most recent update, the following has happened during the sending of about approximately 20 transactions involving custom tokens.\n\n1) Custom tokens I've added selectively remove themselves.  Not all.  Just some.  Arbitrarily.\n\nThis means I have to add a custom token almost every time I send one, even though I'm only sending about 5 different types of tokens.\n\n2) Custom tokens don't cross open browser tabs properly.\n\nI'm not sure if they used to.  But it seems odd that I can refresh one tab and get all the custom tokens back, but if I open another tab right next to it, most (but not all...) are not there.\n\n3) The balances of custom tokens is occasionally wildly wrong.  This isn't a new thing.  It used to fix itself by refreshing the custom token balances.  Less so now, which makes sending custom tokens difficult, when it thinks I have less than I do.\n\nAnd 4) \n\nIt changes the quantity of custom tokens to wildly large numbers while sending.  It's turned 5500 into 5.5e43 on the confirmation screen.  What?\nThis is a copy and paste from another one.\n\n+ 50000000000000000000 Unidentified Token\n\nI was trying to send 50 units of a custom token I had added (and re-added, and so on and so forth)...\n\nIt turns that into whatever that number is on the confirmation screen.\n\n",
