  "body": "- **I'm submitting a ...**\n\n  - [x] Feature request\n\n- **Feature Request**\n\n\n  - Briefly explain the feature you would like us to implement\n\nInstead of re-creating the hww object in `switchAddress()`, be able to access the existing object in `InterfaceLayout.vue` with `this.hardwareWallet` like already possible in `NetworkAndAddressModal.vue` on the props:\n```\n  props: {\n    hardwareWallet: {\n      type: Object,\n      default: function() {\n        return {};\n      }\n    }\n```\n\n  - What are the current issues this feature will solve\n\nThe BitBoxBridge is able to detect when a connection closes, so I would like to provide it with the `clearWallet` action as a callback, to clear the MEW interface when the user unplugs the usb device. However, this causes an issue when switching addresses, as the entire hww object is re-created, a new connection is initialized, the old websocket closes and therefore `clearWallet` is called. When this happens, then `toggleNetworkAddrModal(walletInstance)` no longer has access to the necessary `$refs` after `clearWallet`. \n\nIt would be great to just be able to call `this.hardwareWallet.init(selectedPath)` on the existing hww instance like in `NetworkAndAddressModal.vue`, then on the hww side, I can implement `init` to not close the websocket connection to the BitBoxBridge.\n\n  - Is this feature cross compatible with other ethereum networks\n\nYes\n  - Are you willing to help us with development support if required\n\nYes\n  - Where can this be added?\n\n`/interface`",
