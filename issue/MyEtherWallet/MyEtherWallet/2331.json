We would like to remove the following file as it's no longer in use: https://github.com/MyEtherWallet/MyEtherWallet/blob/master/src/networks/nodes/etc-ethereumclassiccooperative-parity-classic.js\r\n\r\nIf that's the only code change needed to move the default to the other ETC node: https://github.com/MyEtherWallet/MyEtherWallet/blob/master/src/networks/nodes/etc-ethereumclassiccooperative-parity.js\r\nthen I'm more than happy to submit a PR to delete `etc-ethereumclassiccooperative-parity-classic.js`.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know about the appropriate next steps and I'll submit a PR for your review.\r\n\r\nBest wishes,\r\n\r\nYaz",
