  "body": "- **I'm submitting a ...**\r\n\r\n  - [x] Feature request\r\n  - [x] Bug report\r\n\r\n- **Bug Report**\r\nI'm trying to run a local (same network, not same system) instance of MEW based on the latest release zip file. I downloaded the ZIP, and I hosted it on an NGINX server. The problem is that the local instance is trying to make calls back to `https://api.myetherwallet.com/eth` so I get a pop up saying network error. When I use the developer tools I see\r\n\r\n```\r\nRequest URL: https://api.myetherwallet.com/eth\r\nRequest Method: OPTIONS\r\nStatus Code: 403 Forbidden\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think that the REASON it's doing this is because it's trying to talk to your RPC hosts? Which is all well and fine but I can't seem to figure out how I can use my own RPC host. The reason I'm using NGINX is to serve all of this over HTTPS and I have my own RPC hosts available via HTTPS as well...\r\n\r\n- **Feature Request**\r\nAllow me to specify my own RPC host like the old version did?",
