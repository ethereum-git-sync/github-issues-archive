I know there's a search bar, but also just relocating tokens with a balance to the top would be a nice touch for users.\r\n\r\n  - Is this feature cross compatible with other ethereum networks\r\n\r\nIt's token relevant\r\n\r\n  - Are you willing to help us with development support if required\r\n\r\nI can try.\r\n\r\n",
