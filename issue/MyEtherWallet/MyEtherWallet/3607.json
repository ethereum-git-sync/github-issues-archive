When I'm trying to access webpage https://milestonebased.com/ I'm immediately redirected to website https://www.myetherwallet.com/phishing-catcher?phishing-address=https://milestonebased.com/ and then immediately to the page https://www.myetherwallet.com/wallet/access (probably because I'm not logged in in wallet).\r\nLooks like MEW CX assumes that this website isn't safe for usage but it is. Can someone please explain what does it mean and how to fix it?",
