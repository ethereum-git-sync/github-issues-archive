Even if 'n kill the internet connection for a VM with networking it still works even though there is no internet connection. It only doesn't work when the VM has no networking configured.\r\n\r\nI've tested this on another ubuntu machine and it works even if there is no network but, on ubuntu ofcourse I cannot just remove my network card completely, so this only validates the second part of the above statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
