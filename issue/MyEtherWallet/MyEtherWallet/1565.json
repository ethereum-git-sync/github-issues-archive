I and many others willing to sign keys will be there.\r\n- Devs form Debian tend to have well-connected keys as are leads from other cryptocurrency projects like Bitcoin.\r\n- You have someone in german-speaking Switzerland?\r\n- Unfortunately I don't directly know anyone in the Ethereum community that take security seriously and uses PGP.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to make suggestions if you can provide more info.",
