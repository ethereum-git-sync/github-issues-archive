The app is also heavily advertised on the website. Please publish the source code for the mobile app or add a huge warning for users (on the website and in the project's readme) saying that the app shouldn't be used to deal with any significant amounts of money because the source code is not available yet (you do plan to publish it, right?).\r\n\r\nTBH, this discovery is a huge red flag for me and it looks like you're trying to hide something. I don't plan to use a mobile app anyway, but I'm now not sure if I should trust the project at all.\r\n\r\nPlease don't close this issue until it's resolved.",
