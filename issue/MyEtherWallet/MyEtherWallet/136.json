I my case it should be 4 gwei, but instead it is 4000000000 gwei.\r\n\r\nAfter gas price unit is switched to gwei you can refresh page, enter address and push \"Generate Information\" button, price again will be 4000000000 gwei.\r\n\r\nExpected behaviour - gas price should be billion times less in gwei.\r\n\r\nMy environment - Chrome, Ubuntu 16.04\r\n",
