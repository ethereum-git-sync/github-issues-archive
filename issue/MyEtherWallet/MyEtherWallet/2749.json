  "body": "* **I'm submitting a ...**\r\n\r\n  * \\[ ] Feature request\r\n  * \\[X] Bug report\r\n\r\n* **Bug Report**\r\n  * What is the current behavior?\r\n  \r\nThe README says that \"After this step succeeds, you can stop and use the offline version by opening the index file from the dist folder with your preferred browser.\". This isn't true if that browser is Chromium; instead you get something like this in the console and a blank page:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSubresource Integrity: The resource 'file:///home/user/workspace/MyEtherWallet/dist/css/vendors.41684deb.css' has an integrity attribute, but the resource requires the request to be CORS enabled to check the integrity, and it is not. The resource has been blocked because the integrity cannot be enforced.\r\nindex.html:1 Subresource Integrity: The resource 'file:///home/user/workspace/MyEtherWallet/dist/css/app.a228decc.css' has an integrity attribute, but the resource requires the request to be CORS enabled to check the integrity, and it is not. The resource has been blocked because the integrity cannot be enforced.\r\nindex.html:1 Subresource Integrity: The resource 'file:///home/user/workspace/MyEtherWallet/dist/js/vendors.0c057a20.js' has an integrity attribute, but the resource requires the request to be CORS enabled to check the integrity, and it is not. The resource has been blocked because the integrity cannot be enforced.\r\nindex.html:1 Subresource Integrity: The resource 'file:///home/user/workspace/MyEtherWallet/dist/js/app.d8ffdcf6.js' has an integrity attribute, but the resource requires the request to be CORS enabled to check the integrity, and it is not. The resource has been blocked because the integrity cannot be enforced.\r\n```\r\n\r\nPresumably Chromium doesn't want you to be able to poll all the possible hashes of a file via setting the subresource integrity and seeing if it loaded or not, if you can't just open it. But for `file://` you can't just open anything.\r\n\r\n  * If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem\r\n\r\n1. Build MEW 79d730defff2d1dc6159fa6b9980b3e25b76a3e9 after fixing its outdated package.json dependencies and passing a higher Node memory limit to the build (`export NODE_OPTIONS=--max_old_space_size=8192`).\r\n2. Open index.html it in Chromium 87.0.4280.88\r\n\r\n  * What is the expected behavior?\r\n\r\nMEW should load. Or, the documentation should say it won't work form the filesystem and you need to use `npm start` all the time.\r\n\r\n  * What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?\r\n\r\nThe current behavior conflicts with the documentation.\r\n\r\n  * Please tell us about your environment:\r\n    * Operating system: Ubuntu 20.04\r\n    * Browser and version: Chromium 87.0.4280.88\r\n  * Other information (e.g. detailed explanation, stacktraces, related issues, suggestions how to fix, links for us to have context, eg. stackoverflow, gitter, etc): See above for console log\r\n  * Where can this be found? e.g: `/interface`, `/create-wallet`, etc.: `index.html`\r\n",
