  "body": "###### Info\r\n\r\n- **Version**: MyEtherWallet-v6.4.8\r\n- **Browser**: Chromium\r\n- **OS**: Linux, Raspberry Pi (raspios-bullseye-arm64)\r\n\r\n###### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Start MEW on offline computer by running `index.html`\r\n2. Create new wallet using mnemonic phase\r\n3. Access your wallet using mnemonic phase, enter the words\r\n4. MEW complains about missing internet connection. Accepting the terms and clicking \"access my wallet\" does nothing. In fact my browser freezed completely after clicking the access button few times and after opening the developer console. The developer console shows errors about WebSocket connections and CORS policy (trying to access manifest.json it seems).\r\n\r\n\r\n###### What do you expect to happen?\r\n\r\nI except to be able to create a new wallet using the mnemonic phase and log in to the wallet using that mnemonic phase. After successful login I would be able to view my private/public addresses and make offline transaction.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n###### What happens instead?\r\n\r\nI can't access my wallet using the mnemonic phase. I can't view the private/public address of the newly created wallet even though I have successfully created a new wallet using the mnemonic phase method.\r\n\r\nGenerating a wallet using keystore method works. With keystore + password I can login offline and see information about the newly created wallet.\r\n\r\n",
