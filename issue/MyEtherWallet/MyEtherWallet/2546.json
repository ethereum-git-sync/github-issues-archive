In reality, the \"private key\" section is missing. Anyone relying on this paper wallet to access this address will be very disappointed in the future.**\r\n  - If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem\r\n**Use mnemonic to log in, address -> printer icon**\r\n  - What is the expected behavior?\r\n**The print out will have the private key of the address selected**\r\n  - What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?\r\n**MEW is implying it is giving you a paper wallet. It is not**\r\n  - Please tell us about your environment:\r\n    - Operating system\r\n    - Browser and version\r\n  - Other information (e.g. detailed explanation, stacktraces, related issues, suggestions how to fix, links for us to have context, eg. stackoverflow, gitter, etc)\r\n  - Where can this be found? e.g: `/interface`, `/create-wallet`, etc.\r\n**/interface**\r\n\r\nThere should be a \"MY PRIVATE KEY\" section\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-08-18 at 1 26 34 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/361654/90562109-8ac7ac00-e156-11ea-9d30-56564d1fa7d8.png)\r\n",
