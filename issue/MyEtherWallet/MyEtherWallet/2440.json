  "body": "**Bug Report**\r\n\r\nHello. I work in Rotki, the portfolio tracker that respects your privacy. Our users can purchase a premium subscription by going here: https://rotki.com/products/. When this happens a payment request is sent to them. In this request they are asked by our automated system to send a certain amount of ETH/tokens to an address.\r\n\r\nThen our system is checking for when the address receives a transaction with an amount >= to the requested amount.\r\n\r\nLately some users have been sending an amount that's a tiny bit less than the requested. Because the last 2 decimal digits are not included. They told us they use myetherwallet.\r\n\r\nSo I just wanna let you guys know that it seems that when copy pasting an amount to send not all decimal digits are picked up (happened to at least 3 of our users). An example is:\r\n\r\n- Request for `0.047975436576472846` ETH\r\n- Actual payment sent: `0.0479754365764728` ETH\r\n\r\n",
