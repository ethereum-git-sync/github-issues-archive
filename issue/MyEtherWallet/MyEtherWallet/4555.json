It's been some time since this issue passed, so you can try everything. After you modify your node version, you need to change the corresponding NPM version. There are no specific requirements for the NPM version, which can be adapted to your node version.\r\n\r\n2.\r\nAfter changing the node version, the first possible issue you may encounter is as shown in the above figure. You cannot execute the ```npm ci``` command, which will prompt that your package lock.json file and the library used in package. json need to be the same version. Therefore, you need to first execute the ```npm update --save-dev``` command to update your package. json. It should be noted here that because devDependencies are useful in package.json, many of the library versions are very old (such as babel), which can cause various strange problems. Therefore, you need to execute ```npm update -- save-dev``` instead of ```npm update``` to update the libraries in devDependencies",

    "body": "Supplement: \r\nRegarding 2, the option 'resolutions' is available in package.json, which locks the versions of the libraries in it. These libraries are also very old and the ```npm update --save-dev``` command will not update them. When I was about to run this project, the version of the library in resolutions caused me to fail, so you need to delete this option. \r\n\r\nBy the way, because my country has a firewall and is not very friendly in accessing Github's servers, when installing Github's repository instead of NPM's repository, the problem shown in the following figure always appears,such as:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33616855/233955609-32646a2e-2146-4938-ada4-285659a3daa3.png)\r\nthe following issues will always appear:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33616855/233955781-b6463d6f-2243-4ed8-9af0-9a355a67bbd2.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33616855/233956043-bc37a3b4-f073-4c9b-b922-20876df09a22.png)\r\nI won't give any examples of other libraries installed from Github, but the solution is the same: download from NPM instead of Github:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33616855/233958405-e233a4fd-178e-412b-952e-4765e0bacd14.png)\r\nIf your country has good access to Github's services, ignore this issue.\r\n\r\nAnother issue with package.json is that you may encounter problems with Babel when working due to many library updates that have transitioned from CommonJS to ESM. Solving ESM issues requires Babel v7 or higher, and this library is no longer called Babel core but renamed @ Babel/core with many associated libraries such as @ Babel/cli. You need to change all of them to this\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33616855/233957332-1eb01b38-e0bd-4f0f-b493-1f264753e78b.png)\r\n\r\nIn short, you need to modify many aspects of package.json.

The general meaning of this issue is that your Windows system lacks C++building tools or Visual Studio, or other necessary tools for this project. That is to say, if you are not using a Windows system, you may not have this problem. If you are using a Windows system and have successfully encountered this issue, then continue to read on.\r\n\r\nFirstly, you need to execute ```npm install --global --production windows-build-tools```. Executing this command generally does not lead to a smooth installation, and you may encounter various strange problems. However, Google or ChatGPT can search for solutions to these problems, so I won't mention them here. Here I want to say that you need to install the version of Visual Studio 2017:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33616855/233963814-d12578fd-c0a6-40f1-af98-0d09c4d0eb58.png)\r\nOther versions may have issues, such as the Visual Studio 15 version I tried, which will report this error:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33616855/233963967-730c2cc3-2a52-4efd-b949-2f1b52d2c991.png)\r\n",

As above, if your network does not have this issue, ignore it. If it does, you cannot solve it by modifying package.json at this time because your package.json is already correct, and you can only continuously try ```npm update --save-dev```.Believe me, as long as I keep trying, I will definitely succeed, because when I try as many times as my hair, I succeed, and in the end, this command successfully generates a new package-lock. json. \r\nAt this point, you should note that the ```npm update --save-dev``` command does not fully install all dependencies. At this point, all dependencies in your package. json should have been updated to the latest version, which is the package. json I showed above. At this point, you need to delete node_modules, clear the cache ```npm cache clean - f```,and then execute ```npm install```. Note that it is not ```npm ci```. During the process of executing ```npm install```, you may encounter the same problem as ```npm update --save-dev```, where the github service cannot be accessed. The same solution is to repeat these steps:\r\ndelete node_ modules\r\nclear cache ```npm cache clean -f```\r\nInstall dependency ```npm install```\r\nUntil you have no installation dependencies that report errors.",

I executed the ```npm start``` command and reported an error. I did not find a screenshot of the error here to roughly explain, because the ```npm start``` command executed this:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33616855/233975562-e6e61495-3af3-430d-8527-df3eef8c3264.png)\r\nThe problem lies in this index.js file, as it contains a lot of code to pull requests from github:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33616855/233975795-b46b923f-31c6-496e-8702-7f22b2189815.png)\r\nThat's how I solved it. I annotate the code related to the request, then access the request address from the browser to obtain the corresponding JSON files, save these files in the project, and modify the corresponding import code where these files are used.Okay, that's it.",
