Steps to Reproduce:\r\n    - Go to *Access My Wallet*\r\n    - Select *Hardware*\r\n    - Select *Ledger* (previous you have to unlock the device and open RSK App)\r\n    -  Click on *Choose Hardware*\r\n    -  Then you will get the error **Ledger device: UNKNOWN_ERROR (0X6804)**\r\n  -  If you open the ethereum app, you can access without problem. This is happing with RSK Mainnet and testnet apps. \r\n  - It's possible to use the same device and RSK apps in MyCrypto without any issue. So I think it's a specific issue of MEW.\r\n -  Ledger Info: Ledger Nano, Firmware `1.5.5` and RSK Apps version `1.2.0` \r\n",
