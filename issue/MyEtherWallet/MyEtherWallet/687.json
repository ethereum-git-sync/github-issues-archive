  "body": "**Feature request**\r\n\r\nGiven MEW has access to the mnemonic/seed/extended private key, AND that MEW/Metamask are all HD wallets (deriving only one address but still HD wallets), there should be an option to export the `extended public key` so that users could easily import the xpubkey into **watch only** wallets.\r\n\r\nThat's something very common with Bitcoin, that is gaining traction in Ethereum.\r\n\r\nThank you for you feedback on this!",
