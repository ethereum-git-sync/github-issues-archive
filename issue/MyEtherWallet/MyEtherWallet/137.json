BlockScout provides a better user experience for individuals who are searching for transactions, blocks, and many other aspects of POA.\r\n\r\nIt would be a great feature to have BlockScout included in MyEtherWallet to replace the community explorer poaexplorer.com\r\n\r\nHere is the homepage of BlockScout for POA Network: https://blockscout.com/poa/core",
