  "body": "- **I'm submitting a ...**\n\n  - [x] Feature request\n  - [ ] Bug report\n\n- **Feature Request**\n\n  - Briefly explain the feature you would like us to implement\n\nRegister a custom protocol handler to EIP681 ethereum URLs. IRCCloud registers one for `irc:` and `ircs:`, Trezor registers one for `bitcoin:` etc.\n\n  - What are the current issues this feature will solve\n\nMaking pre-filling payments easier, kind of like the URL (legacy?) scheme works today with query string\n\n  - Is this feature cross compatible with other ethereum networks\n\nThis seems pretty widely deployed, despite the EIP being a draft\n\n  - Are you willing to help us with development support if required\n\nYes I can submit a PR. The required API is documented here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/registerProtocolHandler It is not too widely supported, however it's a great convenience when it does work, and will benefit a high percentage of users.\n\n  - Where can this be added? e.g: `/interface`, `/create-wallet`, etc.\n\nI think `/interface/send-transaction`",
