  "body": "###### Info\r\n\r\n- **Version**: 6.4.2\r\n- **Browser**: Firefox\r\n- **OS**: Linux\r\n- **Page Url**: Offline usage, MyEtherWallet-v6.4.2/index.html#/wallet/send-tx\r\n\r\n###### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nI download the latest version of MEW as a zip file, open index.html, access my wallet through a keystore file and open the _Send Transaction_ menu. I select an ERC-20 token to send, hit _MAX_ for the amount and enter a receiving address. The gas fee at the moment is too high for me, so I decide to wait while I do something else in my browser and check the tab now and then to see if I can get the tx through for a lower fee.\r\n\r\n###### What do you expect to happen?\r\n\r\nWhen I revisit the tab after an arbitrary amount of time, MEW should show the current transaction fee that is needed for a successful transaction.\r\n\r\n###### What happens instead?\r\n\r\nIf I wait long enough (roughly upwards of 15 minutes), a very low transaction fee is shown. This is because the _Gas Limit_ field has been reset in the meantime. However, this field is under _Advanced_, so as a beginner user I don't see it and simply hit _Next_ and then _Confirm & Send_ as fast as possible because I want to make sure my transaction is executed for the super low gas fee. The transaction gets sent but fails because it runs out of gas.",
