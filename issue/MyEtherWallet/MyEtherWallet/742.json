We should update the user balance in following cases.\r\n\r\n- we should update the balance of the user whenever there is a new block (Just ETH since, updating token balances on each block seems unnecessary, load on backend nodes) \r\n- we should update the ETH balance whenever user sends out an ETH transaction\r\n   - deduct from the balance onHash\r\n   - If the tx fail, deduct the gas and put the value back\r\n- we should also update the token balance onHash, if fails add it back\r\n    - In this scenario also deduct gasFee in ETH, this will not be refunded on fail",
