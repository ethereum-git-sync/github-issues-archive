Add Custom NFT Token\r\n    2. Select the newly added custom NFT Token\r\n    3. In the **Send Token** portion, enter the desired `To Address`\r\n    4. Click **Send** and let the confirmation modal pop up\r\n    5. Check to see that the `To Address` in confirmation modal is not the same as what was entered in Step **`c`**.\r\n\r\n**Note:** The To Address shown in the confirmation modal seems to be the token contract address of the custom token that was used to add the token\r\n\r\n- **Expected Behaviour**\r\n  - The `To Address` shown in confirmation modal is same as the address input in Step c.\r\n\r\n- Environment:\r\n    - macOS 10.14.5\r\n    - Chrome 79.0.3945.117\r\n\r\n- Where can this be found?: /interface/nft-manager\r\n\r\n- **Screenshots:**\r\n\r\n![nft1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36922376/72558856-8c33ac00-38c9-11ea-9aa5-ee2ab36af83f.png)\r\n\r\n![nft2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36922376/72558858-8c33ac00-38c9-11ea-928b-a12cd3296d3d.png)\r\n",
