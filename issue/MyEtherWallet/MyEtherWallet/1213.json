  "body": "The current \"Move CDP\" dialog is doing something a little tricky under the hood, which may  surprise users: if the destination address they provide has a proxy registered, the CDP gets sent there, whereas if it does not, it gets sent to that address. It might provide better guard rails if this instead warned the user that the destination address does not yet have a proxy registered.\r\n\r\nI noticed this when testing out firmware support on the KeepKey, and was surprised that the UI took the address and did registry lookup before constructing the `give` transaction. We may see a lot of user confusion from this, since unless you know what's happening (that the other address is the proxy instance), it looks like the UI is trying to steal your CDP. We unfortunately don't have any way to know what address owns the proxy when signing the tx, so I can't smooth over this on our end.",
