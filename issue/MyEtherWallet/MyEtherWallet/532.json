(All the icons above disappear, but the logout option is probably most important). Other missing options include Language, FAQ, Notifications, and Settings.\r\n\r\n  - If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem\r\n\r\nReduce screen size\r\n\r\n  - What is the expected behavior?\r\n\r\nIt should at the very least have the logout option and language options available. FAQ, notifications, and settings are also useful.\r\n\r\n  - What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?\r\n\r\nOn mobile systems, it is impossible to function normally without these options.\r\n\r\n  - Please tell us about your environment:\r\n    - Operating system\r\n\r\nWindows 10\r\n\r\n    - Browser and version\r\n\r\nChrome 71.0.3578.98",
