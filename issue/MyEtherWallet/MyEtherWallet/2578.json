  "body": "- **I'm submitting a ...**\r\n\r\n  - [x] Bug report\r\n\r\n- **Bug Report**\r\n  - What is the current behavior?\r\nWhen using the iOS MEW wallet, clicking \"generate transaction\" doesn't do anything. Clicking it multiple times generates a single console message saying that no more event listeners will be added.\r\n\r\n  - If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem\r\n1. Connect MEW wallet to MEW\r\n2. Select \"send offline transaction\"\r\n3. Enter some details (send 0 eth to yourself)\r\n4. Click \"Generate Transaction\"\r\n\r\n  - What is the expected behavior?\r\nA confirmation appears on my device running MEW wallet and I am given the option to sign the transaction, then the signed transaction appears in MEW\r\n\r\n  - What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?\r\nIt doesn't currently work, but clearly it should (nothing on the page is disabled, and it's a pretty important feature). Transactions can't be replaced, and custom transactions can't be sent.\r\n\r\n  - Please tell us about your environment:\r\n    - Operating system\r\nmacOS 10.15.5\r\n    - Browser and version\r\nBrave 1.13.82\r\n  - Other information (e.g. detailed explanation, stacktraces, related issues, suggestions how to fix, links for us to have context, eg. stackoverflow, gitter, etc)\r\nI checked back to version 5.2 (the first version that supports this app) and this doesn't work with any of them (which doesn't mean it hasn't ever worked; could be the last app update.)\r\n\r\n  - Where can this be found? e.g: `/interface`, `/create-wallet`, etc.\r\n`/interface/send-offline`\r\n",
