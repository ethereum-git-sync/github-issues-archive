  "body": "* **I'm submitting a Bug report **\r\n* **Bug Report**\r\n  * What is the current behavior?\r\n     During the offline transaction process, when the nonce is 0, the signature that is produced is incorrect. It produces NaN for the nonce value instead of 0.\r\n  * If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem\r\n     Follow the steps outlined in the documentation with an account that has nonce 0. You will see the signature produces a NaN value for the nonce even though the JSON file has the key/value pair \"nonce\": \"0x00\".\r\n  * What is the expected behavior?\r\n     The signature should correspond to a transaction where the the nonce value is 0 not NaN.\r\n  * What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?\r\n     Transactions that are not risky to transmit with a nonce value of NaN when it should be 0.\r\n  * Please tell us about your environment:\r\n     Windows 10, latest updates. Latest version of Chrome.\r\n   * Browser and version\r\n      Chrome 89.0.4389.82\r\n  * Other information (e.g. detailed explanation, stacktraces, related issues, suggestions how to fix, links for us to have context, eg. stackoverflow, gitter, etc)\r\n    I haven't tried to debug the code.\r\n  * Where can this be found? e.g: `/interface`, `/create-wallet`, etc.\r\n     The JSON file generated for the signed transaction has the key/value pair \"nonce\": \"0x00\", but the offline helper on the online website interprets it as NaN not as the integer 0.\r\n",
