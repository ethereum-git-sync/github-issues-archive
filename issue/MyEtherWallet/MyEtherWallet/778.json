  "body": "- **Change Request**\r\n\r\nWould like to inform that we did the token swap. \r\n\r\nFrom February 27th 9:00 UTC, existing LYM token with contract https://etherscan.io/token/0x57ad67acf9bf015e4820fbd66ea1a21bed8852ec was swapped with a 1:1 ratio with new LYM token with same decimals - 18; same name LYM (Lympo). New, upgraded contract - https://etherscan.io/token/0xc690f7c7fcffa6a82b79fab7508c466fefdfc8c5 \r\n\r\nOur official announcement. Please find below \r\nhttps://medium.com/lympo-io/its-time-to-upgrade-the-lym-token-token-swap-information-f1b4aea9a94a\r\n\r\nEtherscan already swapped our contracts and we would like to make a possibility to put old Lympo contract as a custom token and keep new contract LYM token as default in MEW. This will help our users and will not make confusing in the future.\r\n",
