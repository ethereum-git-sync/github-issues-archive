  "body": "[tersec](https://github.com/tersec) [on Feb 2](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost/pull/20#discussion_r797539182) â€¢\r\n\r\nAlong the lines of the comments about SignedBlindedBeaconBlock (#69), but here, the JSON-RPC and SSZ types are freely intermixed, with the sort-of-SSZ-type-looking SignedMEVPayloadHeader containing a MEVPayloadHeader the fields of which are a Data and Quantity (JSON-RPC serialization types), which itself contains a ExecutionPayloadHeaderV1(a consensus layer SSZ type, defined using the SSZ-serialization-defined Hash32, ExecutionAddress, Bytes32, uint64, etc types). It's not internally consistent.\r\n\r\nImplementing this might involve drawing out, at each layer, the dual JSON-RPC form of SignedMEVPayloadHeader, the dual SSZ form of MEVPayloadHeader (because the sort-of-SSZ-defined SignedMEVPayloadHeader either has to be read as a purely JSON-RPC object, or if not, for all its component parts to have consensus layer-like definitions in addition to the purely JSON-RPC definitions here), and likewise but inverted for the nominally-natively-SSZ ExecutionPayloadHeaderV1.\r\n\r\nFor example, one might imagine the CL/SSZ MEVPayloadHeader:\r\n\r\nclass MEVPayloadHeader(Container):\r\n    payloadHeader: ExecutionPayloadHeaderV1\r\n    feeRecipient: ExecutionAddress\r\n    feeRecipientBalance: uint256\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/realbigsean/lighthouse/blob/mev-lighthouse/beacon_node/execution_layer/src/engine_api/json_structures.rs fills this out with some gaps, but none of it is directly specified and there are various points of ambiguity.",
