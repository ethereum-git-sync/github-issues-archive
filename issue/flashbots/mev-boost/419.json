  "body": "# Rationale\r\n\r\nWhy should this feature exist?\r\n - when the builder doesn't collect any fee it is very enificient to create a payout TX on every block.\r\nsome validators use a contract which consumes 70-100k gas so without the payout TX the total block value will be  higher.\r\n\r\nWhat are the use-cases?\r\n - operating a builder that doesn't collect block fees.\r\n\r\n# Implementation\r\n\r\nDo you have ideas regarding the implementation of this feature?\r\n - yes\r\n   the simulation checks - \r\n \t- if the coinbase address is the same as the validator's address \r\n \t- the coinbase balance difference is the same as the bid value\r\n\r\nAre you willing to implement this feature?\r\n - yes\r\n \r\n cc @Ruteri ",

    "body": "Why does it matter that there could be other transfers to the coinbase?\r\n\r\nThe best block is the one that pays the most to the validator so even if there are other payments to the coinbase these are ok to assume as a reward.\r\n\r\nThe builder code does exactly that, just checks the coinbase balance before and after regardless of how the difference is accumulated.\r\n",
