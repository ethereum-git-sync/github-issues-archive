  "body": "On Docker hub, the `latest` tag is currently the portable build (since v1.4.0): https://hub.docker.com/r/flashbots/mev-boost/tags\r\n\r\nThere is still, however, an old and not updated `latest-portable` tag, which was last updated 2 months ago. \r\n\r\nLet's remove the `latest-portable` tag, because it's misleading and not needed anymore.\r\n\r\nIt might lead to existing integrations that use this tag to break. Although production deployments should usually reference a specific version instead of `latest`, and I believe the impact is negligible.",
