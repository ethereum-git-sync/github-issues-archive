It would be great to be able to ship a systemd unit file that allows updating the package to also reload the service, while keeping the configuration unchanged.\r\n\r\n### I have tried to make it better by loading the arguments from EnvironmentFile, but I feel it is only a hack for now:\r\n\r\n[mev-boost@.service](https://github.com/hegjon/mev-boost-rpm/blob/f88dcf4da131ed1340b96b89cb1e00012ac843da/sources/mev-boost%40.service#L16)\r\n```\r\nEnvironmentFile=/etc/mev-boost/%i.conf\r\nExecStart=/usr/bin/mev-boost $MEV_BOOST_ARGS\r\n``` \r\n\r\nAnd the [environment file](https://github.com/hegjon/mev-boost-rpm/blob/f88dcf4da131ed1340b96b89cb1e00012ac843da/sources/mainnet.conf#L8) for mainnet:\r\n\r\n```\r\nMEV_BOOST_ARGS=\" \\\r\n -mainnet\r\n -relay-check \\\r\n -relay YOUR_RELAY_CHOICE_A \\\r\n -relay YOUR_RELAY_CHOICE_B \\\r\n -relay YOUR_RELAY_CHOICE_C \\\r\n\"\r\n```",
