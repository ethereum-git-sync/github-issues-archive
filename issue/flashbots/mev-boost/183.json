  "body": "Opening this issue to start discussion around the topic of strategy censoring\r\n\r\nFront-running is illegal in traditional financial markets so it is no stretch of the imagination to think that < large validator set run by corporate entity > [ Coinbase, etc ] may be required to enforce a similar restriction on its validator's MEV augmented profits. \r\n\r\nTherefore, some type of strategy specific censorship is inevitable. And even if regulation isn't the driving force, it could be possible to see more altruistic focused validator sets coming from community governed groups such as Lido.\r\n\r\nSome open questions around this:\r\n- How to form open standards around types of arbitrage?\r\n- Can this choice be made in protocol (builder, relay, validator?) or is it best left to be socially coordinated?\r\n- Can we accurately classify MEV types?\r\n- If a heuristic based classification model is used, what are the risks of misclassification?\r\n- Will ignoring certain types of MEV lead searchers to construct builders for their censored strategy, and would this be a bad thing?",

    "body": "Thanks @dmarzzz for bringing the topic here. A few more things that came to mind:\r\n\r\n- If this is regulated, who is the responsible party? The validator will receive a full block, with no option to front-run it. The builders are just sorting bundles, no front-running there. These bundles could even be encrypted with some futuristic stuff. The searchers? They can be anonymous. The protocol designers? Like they should protect their users, but is it actually possible? The relay? But then an anonymous relay can appear that skips regulation.\r\n- What is altruism in here? There's the argument that when there is MEV, the only best thing to do for network stability is to maximally extract it. What kind of incentives will build up when builders censor transactions?\r\n- Is censoring more legal than non-censoring?\r\n\r\nMany many thoughts. But mostly questions. At flashbots we are thinking hard on this. It would be nice to hear more thoughts and experiences economic, legal an technical.\r\n\r\nWe are also designing the data collection and publication, so more people can contribute to the analysis. \r\nhttps://github.com/flashbots/flashbots-data-transparency",
