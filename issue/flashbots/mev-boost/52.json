    "body": "Thanks for the response @lightclient !\r\n\r\nThat's what I was thinking when I opened this issue. But all the calls from mev-boost to the execution layer were removed [here](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost/pull/53), so mev-boost won't drive *any* communication to a local execution layer. I think limiting mev-boost's role to only payload construction (and not payload verification) is good, which that PR achieves.\r\n\r\nThe updates to the diagram here I think make the changes clear: https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost/pull/57/files\r\n\r\nThe  `engine_forkchoiceUpdatedV1` call is still communicated to the relay through mev-boost, though. I would guess the relay just build payloads on top of whatever it is given, but I have no idea how it's being implemented (maybe the flashbots team can shed some light here).  Maybe the threat of tampering with these calls warrants JWT for consensus layer <> mev-boost communication?  ",
