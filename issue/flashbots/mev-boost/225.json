Its hard to believe MEV Boost does come without any risks. For every software module there are risks, known risks and unknown risks. I think there are some possibilities to get rekt by this implementation but time will tell. Would be great for more analysing what could go wrong. Slashing is not only in case of double-signing, there are some more circumstances to get slashed for misbehaviour in proposing (wrong) blocks. \r\n",
