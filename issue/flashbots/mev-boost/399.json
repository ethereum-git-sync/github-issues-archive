  "body": "Hello! I was redirected here from the FAQ section here: https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions\r\n\r\nI'm just having a hard time mapping out how each link in the new PBS model (searchers, builders, & relayers) profit? Asked another way, what each's economic incentive to participate and run the service?\r\n\r\nIt's my understanding that builders build the most profitable block for the validator, and collect a fee for themselves but am little lost as to how relays and searchers are incentivized to participate?

    "body": "I'd consider builders as just another type of searcher and their revenue model is the same: for some kind of (order, bundle) flow, the actor (searcher, builder) tries to make the most profitable object and suggests they take a fee for themselves from the materialized value; in a competitive market, you have many agents competing over opportunities so this fee becomes some small margin on top of costs (assuming no other cash flowing activities, a big assumption!) and most of the value in a given opportunity flows elsewhere in the \"value chain\" (today, we see most mev profits flowing to validators actually)\r\n\r\nrelayers are a critical part of today's blockspace market and you could expect them to do something similar to monetize -- although in fact to my knowledge none of the relays currently take any fee for their services; some relays basically \"bundle\" a builder and so you can imagine the two just operating together and the relay costs factoring into just another line item for the builder's costs. other relays are operated \"at a loss\" as they are seen by their providers as public goods to bootstrap the PBS ecosystem -- it remains to be seen if we will get any relays in the picture that do in fact monetize; I generally think it would be good as it signals relaying itself can be a profitable business and that would encourage greater competition (in a place that given today's constraints of the PBS model needs it the most!)",
