    "body": "It seems unlikely that we'll continue relying on a direct line of communication between the validator and relay/builder in the short/medium term, therefore the bids will be available on the p2p network. We might be able to avoid that by encrypting them to the proposer.\r\n\r\nThis is because we want to defend against relays withholding blocks after the validator signs the header, and the only way this is possible is if the `mev-boost` network i) observes the relay's solicitation of the proposer via a bid for including a certain header, ii) observes the signed blind beacon block from the proposer and iii) observes the _absence_ of the relay's unblinded header. Without any of these steps, the network cannot attribute the fault to either the validator or the relay.\r\n\r\nIn the long term, PBS will require builders to gossip bids so that proposer can pick the best one. With SSLE, the network won't even know who the next proposer will be.\r\n\r\nWith that said -- we may _have_ to sign the `GetHeader` request in a p2p context to avoid spam.",
