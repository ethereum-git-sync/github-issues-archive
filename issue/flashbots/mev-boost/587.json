  "body": "Currently logs only consist of status of messages, like this:\r\n\r\n`... msg=\"http: POST /eth/v1/builder/validators 200\" duration=1.155462 method=POST path=/eth/v1/builder/validators status=200 version=v1.6`\r\n\r\nAnd eventually there are some logs about errors:\r\n\r\n`... msg=\"error calling registerValidator on relay\" error=\"Post \\\"https://bloxroute.max-profit.blxrbdn.com/eth/v1/builder/validators\\\": context deadline exceeded (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)\" method=registerValidator numRegistrations=2 ...`\r\n\r\nWhat does that mean? is it a temporary error? should I be concerned?\r\n\r\nSo, it would be great to have logs about the actual status of relays. For example lighthouse consensus client says this:\r\n`Connected to beacon node(s)             synced: 1, available: 1, total: 1, service: notifier`\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to add a line every now and then that says the total number of relays, how many are connected, how many have problems, etc? It is important to give users a reassurance that everything is working ok.",
