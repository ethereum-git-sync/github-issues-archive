    "body": "What's at stake is Flashbots reputation, not the reputation of our anon auditor.\n\nIn particular, my reputation for having chosen this auditor. I can make this call confidently and the team trusts my decision because I have many years researching what makes good and secure free software. Also because they are not a new auditor, their past work is extensive and brilliant, and we are happy they want to work with us in their new identity.\n\nBut well, I think in here reputations are not really relevant also for two reasons. First, we let their work speak for them. On this initial audit, they worked closely with @metachris and we are satisfied with the scope, depth, and result of their review. After some formatting, we will share the report.\n\nSecond, because we know that one audit doesn't make secure software. We have more audits planned, with more eyes and more hands, for this and other parts of the stack, together with more test suites, more calls for the community to help us test and review, and incentivized testing programs.\n\nWe also know that none of this is enough for making bug-free software. So we have contingency plans and mitigations in the protocol and the tooling we are building around it.\n\nAll the process will be clear and transparent on this repo as we get to execute it. We welcome and celebrate anybody who wants to participate.\n\n@EvanVanNessEth let me know if you are still uncomfortable, and I can disclose more details. ",

    "body": "Audit report:\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# MEV-Boost Security Assessment\r\n\r\nMEV-Boost Security assessment for the Flashbots Collective\r\n---\r\n\r\n## System overview\r\n\r\n[MEV-Boost](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost) is a system created by the Flashbots Collective to allow the out-of-protocol Proposer/Builder separation on PoS Eth once the Merge takes place. By making use of MEV-Boost, solo validators are expected to be able to get a share of the MEV on Ethereum without relying on running MEV strategies by themselves, but rather, receive from different builders bids to include specific block contents on their proposing slot. \r\n\r\nThe system consists in different actors:\r\n\r\n - Builders: Block builders receive from different searchers bundles that will be \"glued\" together to create blocks. After creating them, they send a block header together with a bid value to relayers so that these block headers are exposed to validators. Afterwards, if validators select their bid, builders will unblind the contents of the block so that validators can add them to the canonical chain.\r\n - Relayers: Relayers are actors that save registered validators and receive builders bid to make them available to validators.\r\n - Validator clients: Beacon nodes that run the consensus logic. They register themselves to relayers through MEV-Boost, ask for specific block headers of the slots they propose and sign the block header so that the builder can unblind the block contents to include these contents on the proposed block.\r\n - MEV-Boost: MEV-Boost is a software that receives HTTP requests from the validator client, and send HTTP requests to relayers, handling communications and the logic by which the block header is selected from the different relayers. In the current system, MEV-Boost will always select the block header with the highest bid.\r\n - Execution clients: PoW ETH nodes that run the execution logic.\r\nIt is important to note that the specifications are still a work in progress and that both the builder and relay software are still under heavy development.\r\n\r\n## Trust Assumptions\r\n\r\nProof of Stake Ethereum roadmap presents a trustless proposer/builder separation protocol. In the meantime, the current system will depend on trust assumptions of the different actors: \r\n\r\n - Validators/MEV-Boost assume:\r\n     - Relayers will not send blocks that could make validators get slashed.\r\n     - Relayers will not send blocks bigger than the gas limit used in validator registration. \r\n     - Relayers will not use a false bid value.\r\n - Relayers assume:\r\n     - Validators will send periodically registration information.\r\n     - Builders will be online to share the block contents with validators if auction is won.\r\n     - Builders will not use a false bid value.\r\n - Builders assume:\r\n     - Relayers will not share their blocks with other relayers/builders.\r\n     - Relayers will verify that validators commit to a specific `blockhash`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Findings\r\n\r\n### Critical\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n### High\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n### Medium\r\n\r\n#### Signing library skips membership check\r\n\r\n*Update: Fixed in [PR21](https://github.com/flashbots/go-boost-utils/pull/21)*\r\n\r\nIn the `go-boost-utils` repository, the [`VerifySignature` function](https://github.com/flashbots/go-boost-utils/blob/cbdc1a5f5b7d8a32a41d89a4c1ce19600a6c691f/bls/bls.go#L92-L94) of the bls.go file makes use of the [`Verify` function](https://github.com/supranational/blst/blob/master/bindings/go/blst.go#L413-L424) of the upstream `blst` library but with the `sigGroupCheck` variable [set to `false`](https://github.com/flashbots/go-boost-utils/blob/cbdc1a5f5b7d8a32a41d89a4c1ce19600a6c691f/bls/bls.go#L93).\r\n\r\nThe [IETF BLS Signature specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-bls-signature) points outs about the usage of this variable in [Section 5.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-bls-signature#section-5.3):\r\n\r\n```\r\nSome existing implementations skip the signature_subgroup_check\r\n   invocation in CoreVerify (Section 2.7), whose purpose is ensuring\r\n   that the signature is an element of a prime-order subgroup.  This\r\n   check is REQUIRED of conforming implementations, for two reasons.\r\n\r\n   1.  For most pairing-friendly elliptic curves used in practice, the\r\n       pairing operation e (Section 1.3) is undefined when its input\r\n       points are not in the prime-order subgroups of E1 and E2.  The\r\n       resulting behavior is unpredictable, and may enable forgeries.\r\n\r\n   2.  Even if the pairing operation behaves properly on inputs that are\r\n       outside the correct subgroups, skipping the subgroup check breaks\r\n       the strong unforgeability property.\r\n```\r\n\r\nConsider ensuring that the `Verify` function is called with the `sigGroupCheck` variable set to `true` to enforce unforgeability of signatures.\r\n\r\n### Low\r\n\r\n#### Server-Side request forgery via unchecked redirects\r\n\r\n*Update: Fixed in [PR205](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost/pull/205)*\r\n\r\nA server side request forgery attack is the ability to force a system to create a new HTTP request by using the victim transport layer.\r\n\r\nA malicious relayer can take advantage of server redirects and trigger [`GET` or `HEAD` requests with empty body to any path or `POST` requests to any path with the initial payload body](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#Client.Do). This vulnerability can only be exploited if in the local network where the MEV-Boost software runs there is a reachable software with an existing vulnerability that can be triggered with the types of requests that an attacker is allowed to send.\r\n\r\nAs in most infrastructures MEV-Boost will have access to execution and validator clients, an underlying vulnerability in these critical systems could be triggered even though these clients are not exposed publicly.\r\n\r\nConsider modifying the [`http.Client.CheckRedirect`](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#Client) policy to ensure that no redirects will be followed.\r\n\r\n#### Server timeouts and `MaxHeaderBytes` configuration allows denial of service attacks\r\n\r\n*Update: Fixed in [PR210](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost/pull/210)*\r\n\r\nGiven the current [`http.Server`](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#Server) timeouts configuration and the default [`MaxHeaderBytes` value in use](https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/refs/tags/go1.18.3:src/net/http/server.go;l=855), it is possible for a malicious individual to perform a denial of service attack through HTTP requests on MEV-Boost.\r\n\r\nBy leveraging requests that asks for a path comprised of 1Mb of characters, it is possible to consume high amount of resources of the server running MEV-Boost. With the default configuration, we can slow other user's requests to the same MEV-Boost instance up to 15 seconds by only sending 100 requests via 10 threads with an attacker client. \r\n\r\nConsider modifying the [`ReadHeaderTimeout`](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost/blob/b93a9e3de1843dd284c9350ac9d2ca4a248e064c/server/service.go#L114) value or the `MaxHeaderBytes` value to ensure the quick return of malicious requests to quickly free resources. Otherwise, consider making these values configurable by a command line flag. Moreover, consider publishing documentation around how to set up a public facing MEV-Boost or strictly documenting that this system should be only reachable by trusted parties.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\n#### BLS library missing documentation\r\n\r\n*Update: Fixed in [PR205](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost/pull/205)*\r\n\r\nAs explained in the [IETF BLS Signature specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-bls-signature#section-3), BLS signature schemes can be basic, message augmentation or proof of possession. Each one of these schemes work differently and requires different behavior for the client making use of the bslt library.\r\n\r\nThe client built in the bls.go file of the go-boost-repository uses a [domain tag separator value](https://github.com/flashbots/go-boost-utils/blob/cbdc1a5f5b7d8a32a41d89a4c1ce19600a6c691f/bls/bls.go#L12) corresponding to the proof of possession scheme. However, the library never make use of the PopProve and PopVerify functions which are the ones used in the proof of possession scheme.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the bls client library does not support aggregated signatures, as the verification is only done with one message per verification.\r\n\r\nConsider clearly documenting the expected behavior of the bls client library, the deviations from the specification and the security properties of the used scheme.\r\n\r\n#### Client timeout can be set to insecure values\r\n\r\n*Update: Fixed in [PR210](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost/pull/210)*\r\n\r\nEven though MEV-Boost has a command line flag to set the timeout settings for the `http.Client` and that the default value is a \"safe\" value of two seconds, it is possible that a user sets this value to 0, disabling the client timeout and opening the door to being attacked by a malicious relayer that stalls the communication.\r\n\r\nThis is specially important during [`handleGetHeader` function execution](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost/blob/9a701c1b4d625d2e7f83fef2971af54ca856facd/server/service.go#L233) as any of the relayers can [block the execution](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost/blob/c47fa3e4739cc858ce0eabbf31a2131fce96fbf6/server/service.go#L298) until every single request to the different relayers return.\r\n\r\nGiven the [proposer boost](https://ethresear.ch/t/change-fork-choice-rule-to-mitigate-balancing-and-reorging-attacks/11127), it is recommended for validators to include the block before 4 seconds into the slot or they will be probably be reorganized out of the canonical chain.  \r\n\r\nConsider checking that the timeout cannot be set to 0. Otherwise, consider documenting this behavior so that solo validators can understand the implications of this choice.\r\n\r\n#### JSON Decoder allows extra information to be loaded in memory\r\n\r\n*Update: Fixed in [PR211](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost/pull/211)*\r\n\r\nIn the [`handleGetPayload`](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost/blob/9a701c1b4d625d2e7f83fef2971af54ca856facd/server/service.go#L343) and [`handleRegisterValidator`](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost/blob/9a701c1b4d625d2e7f83fef2971af54ca856facd/server/service.go#L188) functions of the `service.go` file, the request payloads are processed by a `Decoder` without making use of the [` DisallowUnknownFields` function](https://pkg.go.dev/encoding/json#Decoder.DisallowUnknownFields), which would allow the `Decoder` to return an error when the destination is a struct and the input contains object keys which do not match any non-ignored, exported fields in the destination.\r\n\r\nThe usage of `DisallowUnknownFields` is recommended to avoid loading to memory and consuming resources decoding an invalid input.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Appendix A: Specification improvements\r\n\r\nEven though this security audit was based on the MEV-Boost software, some security considerations were discovered for either the builder or relay software. A list of these is created to serve as base for further refinements and improvements of the specification of these actors to avoid these issues to trickle down on the implementations:\r\n\r\n#### Relayer `SignedBlindedBeaconBlock` validation\r\n\r\nTo be slashed, a validator would need to sign two competing blocks for the block of the slot they are in charge of producing.\r\n\r\nAs such, relayers need to validate the `SignedBlindedBeaconBlock` signed by validators to be of the correct `Slot` and `ProposerIndex` before showing the unblinded block to the validator. If this is not checked, validators will be able to access the block contents and use these transactions to craft a new block, where they extract the MEV for themselves.\r\n\r\n#### Validator `ExecutionPayloadHeader` validation\r\n\r\nValidators should propose their block as in the first 4 seconds of the slot. Failure in doing so will result in higher probabilities of the block being re-organized due to the new [proposer boost mechanism](https://ethresear.ch/t/change-fork-choice-rule-to-mitigate-balancing-and-reorging-attacks/11127) and the incentive of MEV extractors to create reorgs so that they can steal MEV extraction opportunties.\r\n\r\nThe `GasLimit` becomes then an important value, given the fact that if this number is high enough to allow blocks that are too big for the validator hardware to timely process the block contents it will probably end up in a missing opportunity for creation of a block in the canonical chain.\r\n\r\nAs such, validators should verify that the `GasLimit` value of the `ExecutionPayloadHeader` is lower than the gas limit value they used to register themselves to the relay network, which needs to be set to a sensible value that allows a validator hardware to timely create and validate the block.   \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Known-Issues\r\n\r\n - [Validator privacy](https://hackmd.io/@paulhauner/H1XifIQ_t#Privacy-vs-Simplicity)\r\n - [Unconditional payments](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost/issues/109)\r\n - [Late block proposal](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost/issues/111)\r\n - [Header and bid publicly accessible](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost/issues/112)\r\n - [Transaction cancellation](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost/issues/113)\r\n - [Relays gossiping payloads between each other & multiple relays with the same payload](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost/issues/122)\r\n - [Clarify relationship b/t builder, relay and proposer](https://github.com/ethereum/builder-specs/issues/23)\r\n - [Value can be spoofed by relays](https://ethresear.ch/t/mev-boost-merge-ready-flashbots-architecture/11177#malicious-relay-6)\r\n - [Not validating relayer key](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost/pull/143/files)\r\n",
