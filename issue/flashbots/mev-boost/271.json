Friends at Ethtaker says it's likely mev-boost proposed an invalid block but they are not 100% sure. Attached logs. And if someone can help me diagnose if the block from mev-boost was the issue. Thank you!\r\n[error_logs.txt](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost/files/9434513/error_logs.txt)\r\n",
