  "body": "The latest release of the pos Ethereum spec is called \"Kiln\" and will be used as the new testnet. The full spec can be referenced here: https://hackmd.io/@n0ble/kiln-spec\r\n\r\nThe following work needs to take place in order to be up to date with this release:\r\n- update mev-boost specs to reference the latest engine API: https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/blob/v1.0.0-alpha.7/src/engine/specification.md\r\n- `engine_executePayloadV1 ` was renamed to `engine_newPayloadV1` and the behavior was modified. This has implications for the fraud proof mechanism of milestone 2 as it is unclear if mev-boost can rely on this API to perform historical payload simulation. The POS research team and implementation teams should be contacted to address this issue.",
