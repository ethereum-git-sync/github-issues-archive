  "body": "As mentioned in PR #342 , I also thought it was a bug that the blocknative relay was receiving `getPayload` requests for payloads we did not deliver.\r\n\r\nBut I came to a different conclusion upon seeing growing sentiment from the various block builders and relays to send blocks to each other. Could this behavior been seen as a redundancy feature?\r\n\r\nMore specifically: If a block gets sent to all relays, and the relay who serves the winning bid goes down in between serving the header and payload, asking the other relays for that block could add redundancy?\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "That was some of the thinking behind the original implementation (as well as simplicity). But both mev-boost as well as the relays would log errors, users were confused, and there were additional concerns about privacy. Also the relay has to guarantee data availability for bids it sent to proposers. Semi-related - there is also work underway of retrying `getPayload` call.\r\n\r\nFor context, PR #342 has been included in the v1.3.2 release. Since then mev-boost only sends `getPayload` to the relays that served the specific bid.",
