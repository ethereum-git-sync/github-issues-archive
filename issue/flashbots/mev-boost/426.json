  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\n### Server\r\n\r\nIn the process of implementing features such as the [relay selection](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost/pull/186), I faced some issues related to the current architecture of the `server` package.\r\n\r\nI have identified the following potential refactors that, once implemented, would make granular updates easier for developers:\r\n\r\n- Add a `cache` package\r\n    - It would hold the bid cache specific types and methods\r\n- Add an `internal/testing` package\r\n    - It would hold the mocked types and mock relay\r\n- Add a package for relay-dedicated components\r\n    - It would hold relay entries types and methods\r\n- Move client methods in a dedicated package\r\n    - It would hold all methods used to make requests currently in the `utils.go` file\r\n- Refactor the mocked relay and associated tests\r\n\r\n### CLI\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, I also think that the current implementation of the CLI could be improved by taking advantage of the combined powers of Cobra and Viper.\r\nUsing this combination in a good way could lead to the usage of configuration files for mev-boost, which can be used by future features.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nI would like to have your opinion / critisims about these. If you have any a question or need more details, please ask.",

    "body": "Hey! Sounds like a great direction, and something I feel is needed üëç \r\n\r\nI'd take it step by step, and let's not grow the packages too quickly.\r\n\r\nI think a good starting point would be to have a `common` package (name flexible) which contains:\r\n\r\n* RelayEntry: https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost/blob/main/server/relay_entry.go\r\n* utils.go: https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost/blob/main/server/utils.go\r\n\r\nThis would be a good PR #1 and very helpful\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nRe other points:\r\n* `cache` package: what do you see being in there? if it's very service specific i'd almost leave it there rather than create a new pkg\r\n* `internal/testing` -- i think exporting the mocked types and even the mock-relay makes sense, for other projects to use them to test some things\r\n* The points re pkg restructuring - i'd love to address them a bit later after doing the first step\r\n* CLI: I'm open to improving configuration and switching to Cobra/Viper, but it must remain backwards-compatible (i.e. current single-dash arguments must continue to work).
