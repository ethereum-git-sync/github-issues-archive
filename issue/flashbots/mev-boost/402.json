  "body": "When we started this repository we positioned it as a project supported by Flashbots. I think that was important to bootstrap the process and help with adoption. Now the project outgrew Flashbots, it has received many critical contributions for people from other organizations, and for it to succeed we require more and diverse maintainers. The branding is outdated.\r\n\r\nThis point was brought by friends from Blocknative during the [PBS developers roundtable at DevCon Bogot√°](https://collective.flashbots.net/t/devcon-in-colombia-october-2022-pbs-developers-roundtable/420) as a clear first step and low-hanging fruit to make them feel more welcome to participate in the development. I thought this is obvious, and yet I missed it :scream: ",
