    "body": "> I think this PR is step in the right direction given that many people are wary of running mev-boost especially since the mev-boost reward has the possibility of being less than the reward you would have earned from a locally produced block. I have 2 comments (although this may be beyond the scope of the PR)\r\n\r\n>    There are 2 types of min bid, absolute min bid and relative min bid. I take it this PR is an absolute mid bid, but it would also be useful to have the option to specify a relative min bid which would be the min bid above the reward you would receive from a locally produced block\r\n\r\n>   Is there a way of transmitting this information to the relay? Under this implementation if I have a min bid of .1 eth will the relay realize this and only submit bids of .1 eth or more? Will the bid immediately be rejected, giving the relay the opportunity to submit a higher bid? Or will the low bid be silently ignored? The last case seems sub-optimal if the relay is willing to bid higher but did not know of the min required bid of the validator.\r\n\r\n@jumboshrimp100, responding here to keep the PR clean.\r\n\r\nThe PR/issue is just for the absolute bid and this value is not exposed to the connected relays.  There is ongoing work on exposing the local block value to the CL so that the CL can compare between builder blocks and the local block.  If/when that functionality is implemented in the CLs/ELs it will make min-bid in MEV-Boost largely obsolete (unless there is desire to enable 2-way communication with the relays, which may or may not make sense given the complexity/game theory/additional latency concerns)\r\n",
