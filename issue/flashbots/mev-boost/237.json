For example does it include a lot of \"operational\" specifics like interacting w/ nodes for propagating revealed blocks?  Or is it purely the \"routing\" portions of the relayer?  IMO the more operational specific parts should be under a more \"permissive\" license since those are the parts that are more likely to new to be specialized for a particular deployment of the relay, but I'd be open to hearing others opinions on even those parts being AGPL (to perhaps foster collaboration across teams).",

    "body": "Firstly, I'm so happy that flashbots has decided to open-source the relay! I've been wanting to look at it for a while now. Personally, I am less likely to contribute to projects with copyleft licenses (GPL, AGPL, LGPL, etc). Some projects/organizations ask developers to not even look at GPL code to 100% ensure they do not contaminate their copyright projects. This is because copyleft licenses are very restrictive. All this to say, I recommend the [Apache 2.0](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0) license.",

    "body": "Note that this license will apply only to the relay code as @metachris specified. \r\n\r\nmev-boost, common utils, and other free software projects from flashbots will remain with their current license, usually MIT.\r\n\r\nThe relay is a temporary trusted component that enables us to mitigate mev while we explore permissionless PBS. We are looking for a collaborative relation between potential relay operators to get us to full permissionless in-protocol PBS, which is a fun, challenging and long road.\r\n\r\nI think we can easily achieve that collaboration by always keeping in mind the PBS goal and ethereum stability and security. The particular licensing details are less relevant. What is important here is that the code will be free. And that collected data will be transparent to verify and analyze behavior, that's important too.\r\n\r\nIt's interesting to hear your strong opinions. We will receive all of them and take them into account, and make a decision after the security audit.",
