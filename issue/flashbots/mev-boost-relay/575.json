  "body": "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nI am testing some stuff with flashbots on the Goerli testnet. I have been doing that for several months without any problem.\r\n\r\nFor some reasons now, i cannot call eth_callbundle anymore on the testnet Goerli. It triggers an error and stop me from any further test i need to do since yesterday.\r\n\r\nHere is the response body i get now when calling this method → {“id”:10,“jsonrpc”:“2.0”,“error”:{“code”:-32000,“message”:“err: %!w(\\u003cnil\\u003e); txhash 0x952e025cdc76e8b39fdeb087fdbbd35e83d6fe16e0356f0351d1ba04e998d689”}}\r\n\r\nBTW the eth_sendbundle method is working fine.\r\n\r\nOn the mainnet the eth_callbundle method is working like a charm, so i assume it comes from goerli only.\r\n\r\nDo you have an idea why this problem appeared yesterday ? Do you have any solution about it ? Thank you very much for your help and have a great day.\r\n\r\nBest regards,",
