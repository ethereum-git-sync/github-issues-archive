  "body": "The `--redis-uri` command line option, used by all three relay programs, only supports begin given the hostname and port of the redis server.  Given a Redis server with TLS and a password, using the full URL `rediss://<user>:<pass>@<host>:<port>` as the argument to `--redis-uri` produces the following (with details e.g. hostname and password edited out):\r\n\r\n> `time=\"2022-11-19T21:26:12Z\" level=fatal msg=\"Failed to connect to Redis at rediss://<user>:<pass>@<host>:<port>\" error=\"dial tcp: address rediss://<user>:<pass>@<host>:<port>: too many colons in address\" service=relay/website`\r\n\r\nPassing in only the Redis hostname and port, excluding the protocol and credentials, also expectedly fails:\r\n\r\n> `time=\"2022-11-19T21:23:09Z\" level=fatal msg=\"Failed to connect to Redis at <host>:<port>\" error=\"write: broken pipe\" service=relay/website`\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThis happens because the provided URL is [passed as the Addr in redis.Options](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost-relay/blob/81e7c219ad079ddab5a5e1fbedfb4cbad0cc1bd7/datastore/redis.go#L49) without parsing out the various pieces.\r\n\r\nThe solution I propose uses [redis.ParseURL](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-redis/redis?utm_source=godoc#ParseURL) to populate the options for creating a new client. ParseURL enforces that a protocol be present, so to ensure backwards-compatability, addresses provided without a protocol are prepended with `redis://` to maintain the same behavior as before.",
