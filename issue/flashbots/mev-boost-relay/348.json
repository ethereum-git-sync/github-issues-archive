  "body": "**Cancellations carry a performance penalty, and we will make them opt-in!**\r\n\r\nThe performance penalty comes from the need to validate every single submission, whereas without cancellations we can discard submissions with a lower value, which will have a strongly positive impact on good submissions. (Note that right now we receive between 500 and 700 block submissions per slot).\r\n\r\n**We will soon remove cancellations from all submissions to the default URL `/relay/v1/builder/blocks`**\r\n\r\nIf you want to use cancellations, please add this query arg: `?cancellations=1`\r\n\r\nFull URL:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/relay/v1/builder/blocks?cancellations=1\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, please indicate interest in the cancellations feature by leaving a comment on this issue. If there is no interest in cancellations at all, then we might as well remove this feature.",
