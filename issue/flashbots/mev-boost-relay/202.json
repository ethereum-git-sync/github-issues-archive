  "body": "We will allow builders to cancel previous block submissions. This will work by always using the latest submission of a builder, even if it's less valuable. \r\n\r\n**Currently it works like this:**\r\n* Once a builder submissions is validated and the highest bid for a slot+parent_hash combination, a new getHeader response is generated and saved to Redis, which will be used for the next getHeader responses: https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost-relay/blob/016449fd1a9fc4fd5791146b189f7746c08009e1/services/api/service.go#L957-L1001\r\n\r\n**Changes needed:**\r\n1. Save the latest bid of every builder\r\n2. On every valid submission, recalculate the current best bid\r\n3. If bid value is different from the last cached getHeader response, then update it\r\n\r\n**Notes:**\r\n* See also #51\r\n* PR: #206 \r\n",
