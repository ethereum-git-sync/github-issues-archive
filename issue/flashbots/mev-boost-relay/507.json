  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nI am trying to setup MEV components on top of the [kurtosis-tech/eth2-package](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/eth2-package/pull/115) and I have got it to run but it only runs on a custom image with the following lines removed\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost-relay/blob/b7095834a40cb871074c48d02a8ade83e8ab65a3/services/api/service.go#L1263-L1272\r\n\r\nIf I let it stay I get a bunch of errors complaining about `\"could not verify capella payload signature\"`. Note that err is nil, the response is !ok.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**\r\n\r\n1. `kurtosis run github.com/kurtosis-tech/eth2-package@gyani/mev-capella-errors`\r\n2. Open the MEV website; and wait for slot 96/128\r\n3. Look at the logs for mev-relay-api\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe errors don't happen and the payload gets delivered\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n![image](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost-relay/assets/6670312/1ec205bf-95c0-4e24-896b-6b57358521f7)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Which version are you using:**\r\n- OSX - M1\r\n- Kurtosis 0.81.5\r\n- MEV Image - flashbots/mev-relay-api (latest)\r\n\r\n@avalonche FYSA!",
