  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nCurrently, only one call of getPayload is allowed for the same slot, which reduces chances of successful submission by distributed validators (DVT) if first submitter's beacon node has connectivity issues.\r\n\r\nSince DVT consists of multiple operators with different Beacon nodes executing the same duty (unlike standard validator clients), when submitting a signed blinded block, each participant's Beacon node would `POST /eth/v1/builder/blinded_blocks` separately, but unfortunately only one would succeed (the others would be rejected with \"payload for this slot was already delivered\"), thereby reducing the total network outreach of the proposal down to one beacon node\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nAllow multiple getPayload requests for the same slot\r\n",
