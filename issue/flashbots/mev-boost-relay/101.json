  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\n1. I was curious where the  censorship is implemented? Is it here or the flashbots rpc? \r\n\r\nII think i heard the relay publish was rushed due to censorship concerns? \r\nBut at the same time, afaik, the actual centralization and tx blocking occured at the rpc layer here:\r\nhttps://github.com/chimera-defi/flashbots-rpc-endpoint\r\ncode ptr: https://github.com/MicahZoltu/rpc-endpoint/commit/f1f1b23682b6470f7ae3b50e351c2e03c14114c1\r\n\r\nSo does one actually need to spin up the relay? Or is a modified flashbots rpc all thats needed? ",
