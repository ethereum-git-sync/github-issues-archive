Please describe.**\r\nThe new v2 publish block [endpoint](https://github.com/ethereum/beacon-APIs/blob/master/apis/beacon/blocks/block.v2.yaml#L6) can accept either json or ssz. We should publish blocks to the beacon node using ssz with the v2 endpoint being supported in the relay. This will improve block publishing latency.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nSerialise the payload with ssz instead of json when publishing to the v2 endpoint.\r\n\r\n",
