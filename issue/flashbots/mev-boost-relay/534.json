  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nAs pointed out by Auston and Max of aestus relay, the current `waitgroup` design for handling optimistic block processing only works on a per-instance basis. In order to work as intended, some cross-process synchronization step is needed. Probably the best way to do this is through redis.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe waitgroup is incremented up receipt of each optimistic builder submission: https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost-relay/blob/c52858a6687ae538685b753a3c8323bf9b7d0e5d/services/api/service.go#L609\r\n\r\nIt is then waited on in a few places to try to ensure there is no outstanding optimistic blocks being processed: https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost-relay/blob/c52858a6687ae538685b753a3c8323bf9b7d0e5d/services/api/service.go#L1304\r\n\r\nSince there are multiple builder API and proposer API instances, the per-instance waitgroup isn't sufficient to ensure that all the optimistic blocks have been processed.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAuston has explored changes to redis to handle this coordination: https://github.com/austonst/mev-boost-relay/commit/f52c9771b32a3d266db8b87b133f9d94b8a6179d\r\n",
