  "body": "Ideally the housekeeper could run as cronjob.\r\n\r\nCurrently the housekeeper runs as single instance, and syncs a lot of state from database to Redis. It also keeps some state around to not perform the expensive operations multiple times if not necessary.\r\n\r\nThe expensive operations are mostly\r\n1. writing all validators from the beacon node to redis\r\n2. writing all validator registrations from the database to redis\r\n\r\nThese are currently a redis command per entry, but could possibly be made batch requests.",
