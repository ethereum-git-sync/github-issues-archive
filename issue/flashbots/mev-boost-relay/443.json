  "body": "Now maintained in https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost-relay/blob/main/docs/docs/20230602-recent-performance-improvements.md\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThere have been a bunch of significant performance improvements in mev-boost-relay recently, and I wanted to shine some light on them and add more details and context about the nature of the changes as well as about the impact.\r\n\r\n**Fast-track simulation queue:**\r\n\r\n- Bids with the highest value so far can get fast-tracked: https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost-relay/pull/361\r\n\r\n**Skipping block submissions which are below the bid floor:**\r\n\r\nBid floor being the highest non-cancellable bid. The top bid value cannot be lower than that going forward.\r\n\r\n- Skipping non-cancellable bids: https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost-relay/pull/399\r\n- Skipping cancellable bids: https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost-relay/pull/401\r\n\r\n**Redis improvements:**\r\n\r\n- More Redis options (`connPoolSize`, `minIdleConns`, `readTimeout`, `poolTimeout`, `writeTimeout`): https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost-relay/pull/419\r\n- using Redis pipeline for most requests during block submission: https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost-relay/pull/435\r\n- After investigating redis `SLOWLOG`, there were two groups of Redis interactions causing the most latency: active validators and known validators (see [`slowlog` output here](https://gist.github.com/metachris/d44fe901cc28f3997d0f2fc234db2b9c)). Improvements with significant impact:\r\n    - Disable 'active validators': https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost-relay/pull/439\r\n    - Getting known validators directly from CL client instead of through Redis: https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost-relay/pull/440\r\n- For reference, Flashbots runs Redis in Elasticache, with 2 nodes of type `cache.m6g.4xlarge` (we'll look into downscaling to smaller instance type after these improvements)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**These changes resulted both in a significant drop of simulations, as well as reduced Redis load.**\r\n\r\nDrop in Redis load:\r\n![Screenshot 2023-05-31 at 14 22 06](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost-relay/assets/116939/9382fed8-673f-4c27-b932-c93851dbdab1)\r\n![Screenshot 2023-05-31 at 14 22 40](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost-relay/assets/116939/34c3764e-9c41-4ff8-9677-277dfd20105e)\r\n\r\nAmount of block submissions that were skipped versus those that were simulated. On average we can skip around 400-700 submissions per slot, while simulating 100-200:\r\n![Screenshot 2023-05-25 at 12 22 11](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost-relay/assets/116939/3f39d157-7ae5-4bcc-8d7d-27bc8a615b9d)\r\n",
