  "body": "New release coming up: **mev-boost-relay v0.16.0**\r\n\r\n\r\n### Latest alpha release\r\n\r\n* Tag: [v0.16.0-alpha1](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost-relay/releases/tag/v0.16.0-alpha1)\r\n* Docker image: [`flashbots/mev-boost-relay:0.16.0-alpha1`](https://hub.docker.com/r/flashbots/mev-boost-relay/tags)\r\n\r\n### Notable changes\r\n\r\n* Capella upgrades\r\n* #301 (database migration)\r\n* Various refactorings\r\n* [more details](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost-relay/releases/tag/v0.16.0-alpha1)\r\n\r\nImportant: this Capella-ready version of the relay requires a custom Prysm fork as CL client (the develop-boost-capella branch of [github.com/flashbots/prysm](https://github.com/flashbots/prysm/tree/develop-boost-capella)), which includes a new getWithdrawals endpoint the relay needs to verify withdrawals of block builder submissions. This is expected to be a temporary requirement, as there is a new https://github.com/ethereum/beacon-APIs/issues/244#issuecomment-1439293791 specified to provide all the required details, and once that is implemented in CL clients we will update the relay accordingly.\r\n\r\nSee [this writeup for more information](https://flashbots.notion.site/MEV-Boost-Capella-Upgrades-00cea01704794f6eb4f792c55b69c441) about the Capella changes across the MEV-Boost ecosystem.\r\n",
