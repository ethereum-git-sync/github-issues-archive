  "body": "Context:\r\n\r\nCurrently, the _relay/v1/data/bidtraces/proposer_payload_delivered_ endpoint returns a `BidTraceV2` object that does not include a `timestamp`. This becomes a problem when one tries to analyze the impact of time on block proposals. As discussed in [[1]](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost/issues/111) and [[2]](https://efdn.notion.site/ROPs-RIG-Open-Problems-c11382c213f949a4b89927ef4e962adf?p=385f0f6279374a90b52bf380ed76a85b&pm=s), time impacts proposers' incentives, and correct analysis can help us better understand how the game is played.\r\n\r\nI'm currently working on finding the unrealized value (UNREV) in payloads delivered through mev-boost. Since it is not always the case that proposers pick the (latest-delivered -> as only the latest submitted block of each builder matters) most valuable block available in any relay, UNREV emerges. \r\n\r\nAlthough one reason for UNREV can be a proposer being irrational (in the sense that not always aiming to maximize his utility, e.g., because he only wants to work with a specific relay), another reason is the **timing/availability of blocks**. It is highly possible that a proposer had accepted a block too early, exposing UNREV. For example, in slot 4,849,684, the [delivered payload](https://boost-relay.flashbots.net/relay/v1/data/bidtraces/proposer_payload_delivered?slot=4849684) paid 0.06 ETH. One second later, a [block offered](https://boost-relay.flashbots.net/relay/v1/data/bidtraces/builder_blocks_received?slot=4849684) 465 ETH (0x18ce78328850d8de2f9d4c6f3fbafdd3ae143b97a9860f8b8b78ad5ac7606167).\r\n\r\nWith the current endpoints (_proposer_payload_delivered_ and _builder_blocks_received_), one cannot do a complete UNREV analysis for each block as:\r\n- _builder_blocks_received_ only returns a subset of blocks received. If every relay offers their complete block data like [Flashbots](https://flashbots-boost-relay-public.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/index.html) does, then this issue can be resolved.\r\n- _proposer_payload_delivered_ returns a `BidTraceV2` object that does not include a `timestamp` (unlike `BidTraceV2WithTimestamp`). One can try to find the same block through _builder_blocks_received_ endpoint and use the timestamp there but I'm not sure if the timestamp of the delivered payload would be the same as the submitted builder block's.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n\r\n1. Introduces `BidTraceV3` which inherits from `BidTraceV2WithTimestamp` and adds an `extra_data` field as proposed by @metachris .\r\n2. _relay/v1/data/bidtraces/proposer_payload_delivered_ and _relay/v1/data/bidtraces/builder_blocks_received_ endpoints both return a `BidTraceV3` now. However, it is open to discussion whether both should return the same `timestamp` for a given block.",
