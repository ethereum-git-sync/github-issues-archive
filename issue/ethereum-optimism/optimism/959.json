Please describe.**\r\nWe have found that a majority of our bugs come from the connection between L1 and L2. This is where we have the most moving parts. Specifically we encounter the following errors:\r\n\r\n1. Deposits are double played.\r\n2. Deposits are skipped.\r\n\r\nWe would like to be able to perform (load) tests which catch these sorts of issues.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nCreate an L1 contract which sends messages into L2 that makes it really easy to track if messages were skipped, double played, or generally delayed.\r\n\r\nThe message sent from L1 to L2 should contain the following information:\r\n- `index`\r\n- `initiatedTimestamp`\r\n- `initiatedBlockNumber`\r\n\r\nWhen the deposit is received in L2, the following information about the deposit should be stored in an append only array:\r\n- `index`\r\n- `initiatedTimestamp`\r\n- `initiatedBlockNumber`\r\n- `receivedTimestamp`\r\n- `receivedBlockNumber`\r\n\r\nBy storing this information, we can iterate over the list of deposits and check to see if:\r\n\r\n1. Any are double played\r\n2. Any are skipped\r\n3. Any were ingested at a timestamp that is != to the timestamp that the deposit was received in. Note `initiatedTimestamp` and `receivedTimestamp` should always be equal.\r\n\r\nWe should then add an integration test which demonstrates this contract's functionality -- performing a deposit & verifying its integrity. This contract & test can then be used inside of a load test which will make it easy to detect if deposits were double played or skipped.\r\n\r\n**Alternate Solution**\r\nSubmit any deposit and scan the Geth's blockchain (`eth_getBlockByNumber`) and determine if there were any deposits that were either skipped or double played. The benefit of this approach is that it can also be used to detect monotonicity failures which we should also write tests around.",

I'm personally not opinionated about which is better & would lean towards whatever is easier.\r\n\r\nOne benefit of doing the integrity checks on Geth's entire blockchain (not using the contract) is that it might be easier to slot in the monotonicity checks as well. Might end up being a more flexible approach though I think also depends on the overall architecture of the load tests. I'll add this as an alternative solution.",
