    "body": "This parameter is required to fetch the initial OVM blocknumber and timestamp. When the sequencer starts up, it needs to be able to know what timestamp and blocknumber to start with after the genesis state. If a deposit is the first transaction, then it is possible for the sequencer to induce a monotonicity error right off the bat if it chooses a number that is too high. This config option allows the sequencer to set the initial timestamp/blocknumber to the smallest possible values that can be found on a deposit.\r\n\r\nA way to eliminate the need for this parameter is to add a dependency on an archival node and do a binary search for the deploy height of the contract by calling `getCode` over and over again to find the height at which the contract was deployed.\r\n\r\nI think that adding the dependency of using an archive node outweighs the benefit from removing this config option.\r\n\r\nAnother solution would be to have all of the contracts inherit from an `OVM_Base` contract that emits an event in its constructor and then we can query for those events to determine when the contract was created.",
