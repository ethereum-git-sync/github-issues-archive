  "body": "I'm trying to run [this bundler](https://github.com/eth-infinitism/bundler) together with local devnet, but have no luck.\r\n\r\nI first add `--rpc.allow-unprotected-txs` flag to both entrypoint.sh files in ops-bedrock folder, since without it I get \"only replay-protected (EIP-155) transactions allowed over RPC\" error later. Then I launch the devnet using `make devnet-up` and make some adjustments in the bundler code: change all relevant target ports from 8545 to 9545 and in the 2-deploy-entrypoint.ts file comment out the code that checks that `chainId` is either 1337 or 31337, since it is actually 901.\r\n\r\nBut when I run `yarn hardhat-deploy --network localhost` to deploy the entrypoint, I get \"Insufficient funds\" error.\r\n\r\nI think I need to change some private key-related settings of the devnet, but I'm not sure which ones. I tried changing `BLOCK_SIGNER_PRIVATE_KEY` and `BLOCK_SIGNER_ADDRESS` to `0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80` and `0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266` (`test*11 junk` mnemonic account 0), since the bundler seems to be using this account for deployment, but still got the same error.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIt would be great to have a local bundler out of the box, since there is already support for ERC-4337 on both OP Goerli and OP Mainnet.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nCurrently I have to run the bundler on hardhat L1. It works fine without any adjustments, but since I'm developing for Optimism it's not what I ultimately need.\r\n",
