  "body": "I launch local devnet using `make devnet-up` like it says in the docs, and everything starts working _eventually_. Containers start up quickly and I can see in the logs that both L2 and L1 mine blocks as expected, but `L1Block` contract deployed at `0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000015` on L2 does not start getting updated for a long time. Sometimes it takes 5 min, sometimes â€“ 20. It just keeps returning 0 for block number until _something_ happens and it starts updating.\r\n\r\nIt makes my autotests unreliable, because my app needs this value. Currently, I work around the issue by requesting the latest block number directly from L1, but this is not what I ultimately need.\r\n\r\nAny way to fix this?",

I think some data is saved to bind mounts instead of volumes, so every time I was upping the environment thinking that it was from genesis, there was actually a lot of importing taking place (stuff from previous runs), which was delaying everything else.
