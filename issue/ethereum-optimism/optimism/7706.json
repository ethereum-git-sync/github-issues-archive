Please describe.**\r\n\r\nI'm looking to spin up a op-stack rollup which uses a block time that is shorter than 1 second. The [l2blocktime](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/f514eac8f2a63632caad7ae2cba0c90bd251492b/op-chain-ops/genesis/config.go#L47) config value is a uint64, with units as seconds. This prevents target block times that are sub 1 second from being possible. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if the `l2blocktime` config value could be of the `time.Time` type, or stay as an integer with units as milliseconds. This way, more granular target block times could be used for custom rollups. \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nI've read through op-stack documentation, and did not find a concrete reason why sub 1 second bock times would be unachievable from a protocol design perspective. Maybe there's some context I'm missing here as to \r\n1. Why 2 seconds was chosen as the target block time for OP Mainnet\r\n2. If shorter block times are possible (akin to Arbitrum's ~0.26sec avg blocktime). \r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n",
