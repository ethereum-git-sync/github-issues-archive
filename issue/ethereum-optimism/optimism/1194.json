  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nI need to write tests for a contract, where the passage of time is important. With Hardhat Ethereum client I can call `evm_mine`, `evm_setNextBlockTimestamp` and `evm_snapshot` which can be used to move forward and even rewind time. With Optimism I can't run such tests.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI would like `evm_mine`, `evm_setNextBlockTimestamp` and `evm_snapshot` or some equivalents exposed by the local client.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nNone, this is probably the most elegant and developer-friendly.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nNope.\r\n",
