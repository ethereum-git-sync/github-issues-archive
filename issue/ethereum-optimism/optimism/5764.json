So just trying to understand if somehow we can automate it, we would be be able to put it in GitHub Actions to update Dependabot yaml as required!!!\r\n\r\nWith my limited knowledge of the project, I would request @smartcontracts @tynes @roninjin10 @MSevey to suggest the best way possible?",

    "body": "> Hi @ashutosh887 just trying to understand your approach, how would you be generating this file?\n> \n> \n> \n> are you going to use some script to auto-generate or would you be manually generating it?\n> \n> \n> \n> Because the problem with manually creating the yaml, is that, it will have to be updated every time there is change in the repository. So just trying to understand if somehow we can automate it, we would be be able to put it in GitHub Actions to update Dependabot yaml as required!!!\n> \n> \n> \n> With my limited knowledge of the project, I would request @smartcontracts @tynes @roninjin10 @MSevey to suggest the best way possible?\n\nThe file I posted in the description of the issue is the file. \n\nThe dependabot yml targets package managers. For this project that is go.mod, npm, docker, and GitHub actions. You don't need to update this file very often if ever. The only updates needed would be if a new package manager is added or if you wanted to adjust the dependabot settings for how often and how many PRs are generated for updates. ",

There is a tracking issue for it though \n\nhttps://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/2178\n\nBest course of action would be for the dev team to manage that at a process level. For example having a policy that all docker files like in the same directory for ease of maintainability. ",
