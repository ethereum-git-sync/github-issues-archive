Please describe.**\r\n\r\nWe are working on an integration with Celestia based on our fork: https://github.com/celestiaorg/optimism\r\n\r\nWe want to use dependabot to help track changes from upstream repos. \r\nSince this repo doesn't have dependabot, we enabled it on our repo and immediately received a flood of PRs. \r\nIdeally our dependabot only watches for updates unique to our repo, and part of this would be ensuring that this repo is also updating its dependancies. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nImplement dependabot to keep dependencies updated. \r\n\r\nThe `yml` file should look like this I believe, happy to open a PR for this\r\n```yml\r\nversion: 2\r\nupdates:\r\n  - package-ecosystem: docker\r\n    directory: \"/ops/docker\"\r\n    schedule:\r\n      interval: daily\r\n    open-pull-requests-limit: 10\r\n  - package-ecosystem: github-actions\r\n    directory: \"/\"\r\n    schedule:\r\n      interval: daily\r\n    open-pull-requests-limit: 10\r\n  - package-ecosystem: npm\r\n    directory: \"/\"\r\n    schedule:\r\n      interval: daily\r\n    open-pull-requests-limit: 10\r\n  - package-ecosystem: gomod\r\n    directory: \"/\"\r\n    schedule:\r\n      interval: daily\r\n    open-pull-requests-limit: 10\r\n ```\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n",
