  "body": "Hi, \r\n\r\nI am investigating how the dispute game works for cannon, and I have seen there are several related` .sol` files such as `packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/dispute/interfaces/IFaultDisputeGame.sol`, but I fail to find out the `.sol ` targeting at gaming with cannon. So is there such one existed at present? \r\nIf not, I would like to try out writing an example my self, is there any sample code I can refer to?\r\n\r\nThanks!",
