Please describe.**\r\nWe've had a few issues that were caused by accidental misconfigurations of our `package.json` files. For instance, https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/802 was caused by https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/commit/6dc1877490535dabc6ed5f127b5269cd5316e7e6 which used the wrong glob inside the `files` field. It's possible to test for this in advance by running `yarn clean && yarn build && npm publish --dry-run` inside the package you've modified, but this is risky (what if you forget `--dry-run`?) and not scalable.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI'd like to see some sort of automatic testing scheme in our CI that makes assertions about the contents of the npm package to be published if a given PR were merged and released. \r\n",
