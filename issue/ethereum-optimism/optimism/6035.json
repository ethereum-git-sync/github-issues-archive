I have yet to finalize a post bedrock withdrawal yet so I will know soon\r\n> \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nCall getMessageStatus with any historical withdrawal on goerli or mainnet\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nFInalized withdrawals should find a RelayedMessage event\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any other context about the problem here.\r\n\r\nThe issue here is we are for some reason hashing the withdrawal is wrong.   This will be quicker to debug on a devnet\r\n",
