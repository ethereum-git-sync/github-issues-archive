If sequencer accidentally or maliciously provide timestamps breaking the assumption that timestamp should be monotonically increasing, dApps relying on this assumption will be in trouble.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nWhen appending new transactions, their timestamp should be checked by the contract to make sure timestamp is monotonically increased.\r\n",
