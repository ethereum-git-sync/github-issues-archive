Please describe.**\r\nA frequent issue has been getting `CALL_EXCEPTION` errors when trying to call an L2 contract that failed to deploy. The most common two ways that L2 contracts fail deployment is \r\n1. Failed Safety Check (issue here https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/648)\r\n2. Running out of gas during contract deployment\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nWe need an integration test that performs a contract deployment that will run out of gas (e.g. while loop in the constructor) and checks that there is a clear \"Out of Gas\" revert message.\r\n\r\n",
