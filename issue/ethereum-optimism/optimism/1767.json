In my opinion:\r\n\r\n1. The solidity warnings should be easy to get rid off but it looks like they are having a discussion around the implementation of some of those functions [here](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/discussions/1444). Also it looks like the current implementation is needed to past the test as they are set now. I don´t know if it would be possible to straight up eliminate those functions for the moment since having some code that isn´t used does not make musch sense to me, or maybe just changing the tests that reference those functions. I´m a noob so there might be a reason and im not getting it.\r\n\r\n2. I was writing a script to execute between yarn build:contracts and yarn autogen:artifacts that checks for warnigs but your solution seems better and cleaner. I think it might be worth to keep an option (yarn build:ignore:warnings or something like that) to ignore warnings in case you are just doing some fast prototyping.\r\n",

    "body": "Hey friends, thanks for your interest here!\r\n\r\nOne consideration that might impact here is that most of the contracts are currently considered 'frozen' as we've recently completed an upgrade. But that being said, the kind of changes required to resolve these warnings are usually very small, and would be easy to merge even if we don't do so right away. I will ask some others who to chime in who will have a better idea about how to procede.\r\n\r\nAs far as the discussion about failing the build: \r\n\r\n1. I don't think the failure should happen in the yarn scripts, that'd be a bit too much clutter in the package.json. \r\n2. Other options include: \r\n\t- \tCausing a failure in the [GH workflow file for this package](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/92ef028c310aa26f75ac0a2a0c636658a3aa7f03/.github/workflows/ts-packages.yml#L1).\r\n\t- Writing a lightweight [wrapper](https://hardhat.org/guides/create-task.html#overriding-tasks) around the `hardhat compile` task to take an optional flag, like `--fail-on-warn`, and parse the output (or artifacts) to fail if there are any warnings.\r\n",
