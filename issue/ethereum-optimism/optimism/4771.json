  "body": "Describe the bug\r\nI have found that if a contract self-destructs and sends the remaining balance to itself, that balance remains in the contract after it is destroyed. Behavior of the EVM, in this case leaves the contract with a zero balance, this is different. Destroying some of the ether balance.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Reproduce\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\nDeploy a contract that has some function which selfdestructs the contract sending remaining balance to itself. eg:\r\n```\r\ncontract testSelfdestructs {\r\n    constructor() payable {\r\n      testSelfdestructs (payable(address(this)));\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nExpand this contract and perform the operation.\r\ncontract balance should be 0\r\n",
