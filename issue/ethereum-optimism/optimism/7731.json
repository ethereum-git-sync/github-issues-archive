  "body": "The features currently planned for canyon are the following:\r\n\r\n* Activating Shapella\r\n* Changing EIP-1559 parameters\r\n* Adjusting the channel ordering in the channel bank\r\n* Adding span batches\r\n* Fixing an op-geth receipt hashing bug\r\n* Adding the create2Deployer on base\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have unit tests for each of these features are part of our normal development process, but would like to test the activation & assert that the behavior is as expected before and after the network upgrade.\r\n\r\nTo test the above, we want to have scripts which do the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n* Shapella Before\r\n    * Block RLP **does not** contains withdrawals\r\n    * PUSH0 instruction **does not** work\r\n* Shalella After\r\n    * Block RLP **does** contains withdrawals\r\n    * PUSH0 instruction **does** work\r\n    * P2P gossip continues to work\r\n* EIP-1559 Changes\r\n    * Check that the new parameters are being used only after activation by calculating the basefee by the old formula & also by the new formula \r\n* Channel Ordering Fix\r\n    * Submit a dangling channel prior to the upgrade & observe a safe head stall\r\n    * Submit a dangling channel after the upgrade & observe no safe head stalls\r\n* Span Batches\r\n    * Submit span batches prior to activation & assert that no L2 blocks are derived from them.\r\n    * Submit span batches after activation & assert that the L2 safe chain advances.\r\n    * Submit normal batches after activation & assert that those still work.\r\n* op-geth receipt hashing bug\r\n    * Manually RLP encode & hash a pre & post canyon deposit receipt. Verify that the hash is in the receipts trie\r\n* create2Deployer\r\n    * Assert that the codehash pre-canyon is the empty code hash. Assert that post-canyon on specific chains that it is the expected code hash\r\n    * If testing the activation of multiple chains, it should remain the empty code hash on some chains\r\n    * Post-Canyon, send a transaction that uses this contract\r\n\r\n",
