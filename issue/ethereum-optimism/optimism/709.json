Please describe.**\r\nWe need a place to store the contract names (both L1 and L2), addresses, deployment configs, and ABIs for all of our environments. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nPublish the contract information for all of our chains to npm  (similar to this: https://github.com/graphprotocol/common-ts/blob/master/packages/common-ts/src/contracts/index.ts ) and hook it up to our deployments so that whenever there is a new deployment we are updating those addresses / that information.\r\n\r\nMost of the information should be retrievable from L1 by reading events emitted by the deployment. For instance, the version information, contract names, and addresses are all easily recoverable from the `DeploymentManager`. There will be some information that is easier to store off-chain like the ABI and Solidity source.\r\n\r\nIt is not a requirement that at first we actually recover the information from L1, but it should be possible to do so.\r\n\r\n**Completion requirements**\r\n- also generate markdown as we already do with addresses\r\n- abi accessible at `@eth-optimism/contracts/abis/blahblah.json`\r\n- solidity accessible at `@eth-optimism/contracts/sol/whatevr.sol`\r\n- `connectContracts` accessible at `@eth-optimism/contracts`\r\n- info should be able to be generated by L1, but we can be lazy and store it off-chain as well for easy access.\r\n\r\n**Blockers**\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/708",
