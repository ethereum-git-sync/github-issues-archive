  "body": "A divisor of 32 is a real burden for projects that rely on the L1->L2 bridge. \r\n\r\nEnqueue is already wildly expensive (>100k with no burn) and it is made worse by topping it off with a divisor of 32 when the gas limit has to be at least ~800k anyway (because of relay message overhead).\r\n\r\nWith a 1 million gas limit (pretty low considering the lower bound of ~800k), the sender has to spend around ~31,000 gas on the gas burn. At current gas prices this is around $2.81, which is much higher than you would be spending to actually execute a 1 million gas transaction on Optimism today (and this isn't including the base cost of enqueue 😅 )\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think of increasing the divisor (maybe to 128 or 64)?
