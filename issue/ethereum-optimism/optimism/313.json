Please describe.**\r\nThere are many environment variables managed across the codebases and there is a TypeScript `Config` class here: https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimistic-rollup-integration-tests/blob/master/packages/integration-tests/src/config.ts\r\n\r\nHaving something like this that is fully fleshed out and exported from one of the NPM packages would help to make configuration a lot easier and unified between all of the different repos/tests.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nA `Config` class that is aware of all of the environment variables used by the various repos and implements getters for them.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThere are a few of these `Config` classes around that are implemented for the env vars it cares about",
