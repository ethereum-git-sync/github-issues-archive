Please describe.**\r\nWe have [a folder named `deployments`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/packages/contracts/deployments) that holds the deployment artifacts for each of our deployments. Within this folder is a README that is generated based on the contents of the sub-folders within the deployments folder. We generate this README by running `yarn autogen:markdown` within the contracts repository. Unfortunately, we often forget to run this command and deployments are merged without also updating the README. I would like to prevent this from happening.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI would like to see some mechanism for automatically generating the README whenever the deployments are updated. I could see this being done in one of four ways:\r\n1. Some pre-commit hook that yells at you if a deployment folder was changed but the README was not also updated.\r\n2. An update to CI that yells at you if a deployment folder was changed but the README was not correctly updated.\r\n3. An update to CI that will automatically push a commit to the branch with the updated README whenever a deployment changes.\r\n4. An update to CI that will create a PR with the updated README whenever a deployment changes (basically the same as 3 but pull-based instead of push-based).\r\n\r\nI'm leaning towards (2) for its simplicity.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nWe could also just try to train the culture of looking for an updated README whenever a new deployment PR is opened, but that's still prone to human error. I like using software to eliminate chances for human error.\r\n",
