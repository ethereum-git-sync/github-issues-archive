  "body": "**1.Background**\r\nThe cost of the eth network is too high, which prevents many users from using it, so many users have moved to Matic or BSC, and the op is to lower the threshold for using the eth network, so users of public chains such as BSC are our target population.\r\n **2.Method**\r\nAllow users of smart contract platforms such as BSC to cross-chain Matic's assets to the op network through a cross-chain bridge, which can lower the barriers to entry into the op network and attract more people to use the op network. With the increase in daily activity, there will be more The project (not limited to the Ethereum platform) is transferred to the op network, and good projects can attract more people and achieve a good positive cycle. With the advantage of low handling fees, op will bring users of networks such as BSC and Matic Attract over and promote your own growth!\r\n",
