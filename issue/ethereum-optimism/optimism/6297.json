One of our components is using `@eth-optimism/sdk`.\r\nI saw that there is support for Base Goerli however i couldn't find support for Mainnet (also no issues/PRs). \r\n\r\nI previously took a look if i can open a PR for this, but i think i will not be able to as i don't have the Base deployment artifacts.\r\n\r\nHere is an example PR of how this should be done: https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/6261\r\n\r\nBtw, adding support for these networks in your SDK provides a very pleasant DX! Really happy to see how the collaboration between the networks in the Superchain is evolving.",
