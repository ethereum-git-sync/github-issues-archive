  "body": "Hey!\r\n\r\nSo I've read this threat report https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/05/18/eth_state_problems/ and I wonder if Optimisms fork of Geth which is based on Rojo Loco v1.9.10 has the same issue?\r\n\r\nAnd if it does or not..., is there a plan or an approach outlined how Optimism Geth fork would take changes from upstream, if at all? \r\n\r\nCheers ",
