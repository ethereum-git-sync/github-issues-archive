Something seems broken with the nethermind enhancements\r\n\r\nI have been digging into this for some time, but we are running a _pruned_ Nethermind nodes stack which might have been causing the issue. Need to test this out with a new non-pruned stack to revert with better answers.\r\n\r\nDid you happen to run a non-pruned Neth stack and still see the issue?\r\nI am assuming you might have also tried \"_nethermind_\" as the [type](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/0025fff177d656fc14d64c174eef3b69a03413dc/op-node/sources/receipts.go#L281) to test your setup. If you use \"_basic_\" it runs through a list of eth calls to figure out which will suit the stack you are running which to me increases latency.\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "I have tried with a pruned and \"archive\" node with the \"nethermind\" type, wihch run into the same issue. As I understand it, nethemind has some non-standard rpc paths which I believe optimism is attempting to use to retrieve and decode relevant l2 transactions faster. I am able to use the rpc from nethermind with \"basic\" and I am able to keep up with the network on my l2, while not dealing with the awful instability and corruption issues associated with geth's usage of the goleveldb module. I'd be interested in seeing the metrics on how much faster the \"nethermind\" type is supposed to be, but it doesn't seem from my perspective like the integration tests are sufficient to prove reliability or performance improvements.,",
