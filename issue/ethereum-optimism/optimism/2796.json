However, if the L1 chain is forked, all the L1 => L2 communications are not propagated (e.g. no 5000 ETH to test accounts) and it's impossible to submit transactions to L2.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Obtain all the Optimism Development Environment Docker images (as explained [here](https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/build/dev-node/#))\r\n2. Edit the `l1_chain` image to let it be able to fork the mainnet (e.g. by applying [this fix to the original hardat image](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/2795/commits/b37dd732844022123d9946d5903a5dc092c3023b)) to let it allow to correctly fork mainnet\r\n3. Rebuild the image through the command `docker-compose build l1_chain`\r\n4. Fork mainnet by inserting your node link in the `optimism/ops/envs/l1_chain.env` file\r\n5. Run the containers through the command `docker-compose up` and wait for the startup to be completed\r\n6. The balance of all the 20 test addresses is always 0 on l2\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe environment should work like with a brand new L1 chain but the behavior is that L1 transactions are not propagated to L2 (blockNumber on L2 should be greater or equal to 20 due to the transfer of ETHs to the 20 test addresses but it is always 0, even after hours)\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nNo screenshots available\r\n\r\n**System Specs:**\r\n - OS: Docker\r\n - Package Version (or commit hash): branch develop, commit c0c5af0b2c66ac0a440c10a3e9f2fd42f0ebc116\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nNo other info\r\n\r\nMany thanks!",
