  "body": "Hi team, have a question about the op-node p2p sync, as my understanding, the sequencer is the source of the block broadcast messages, other op-nodes connects to sequencer to get notified about the new blocks.\r\nWhile we know that not all op-nodes connect to sequencer directly, the topology could be:\r\n```\r\nsequencer <-> op-nodeA <-> op-nodeB\r\n```\r\nso now when a new block is produced, op-nodeA will firstly get notified by the sequencer, but how about op-nodeB, will op-nodeA forward the new block message to op-nodeB?\r\nI guess so based on my observing, just want to double confirm with you",
