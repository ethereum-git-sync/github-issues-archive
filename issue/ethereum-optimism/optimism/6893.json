  "body": "In the P2P Sync code, we handle errors with the P2P request by consuming all of the available rate limits, but we would also like to wait longer before making the next request. Consuming the available rate limit is not enough because the rate limit cannot go negative & we would want to wait for a longer period of time. Some sort of mechanism which delays the next requests needs to be implemented.\r\n\r\nCode that needs to be modified:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/fc8e68fc8060b56306402738f36c1b0145084db3/op-node/p2p/sync.go#L533-L542",
