Please describe.**\r\nWe are building a Rollup as a Service platform [Scalind](https://scalind.com/) (supported by Optimism [builders grant](https://gov.optimism.io/t/cycle-15-final-grants-roundup/6858)) and would like to add the ability to launch rollups with custom ERC-20 gas token. Many competing RaaS projects also promise similar functionality and given proliferation of new chains it'd be wise to have a standard implementation, probably as part of the main Optimism repo, rather than have many different forks each of which requires maintenance and might diverge significantly, lowering security\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nWe've got experience running such a rollup at GTON and can help create the first implementation if needed, possibly with the collaboration from other projects like Conduit, Caldera etc. if they decide to help. Such a project needs minimal diff with the standard implementation of Optimism and full test coverage to make sure the rollup is secure\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThe alternative would be for each project to maintain their own fork of the codebase but this in the end hinders security and might lead to user funds loss in case anything goes wrong\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI'd like to make this the place for discussions around the custom gas token rollups, would also try to involve more developers working on open source OP Stack implementation to get their input here\r\n",

    "body": "@tynes yes, you have to find balance here, any necessary sales are compensated by user purchases of the token they might need to make transactions on the rollup. We've also been correcting the gas price depending on the token price to make sure the correct amount is charged to break even.\r\n\r\nSo in general, given that there is demand for such rollup architecture, fuelled by several RaaS platforms and their clients, it does make sense to think about a standart here, especially given a small diff with the original codebase, but the cost of maintaining different implementations across many rollups  might be much higher and lead to more risks for users of such rollups",
