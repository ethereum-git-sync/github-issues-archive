Please describe.**\r\nWe are building a Rollup as a Service platform [Scalind](https://scalind.com/) (supported by Optimism [builders grant](https://gov.optimism.io/t/cycle-15-final-grants-roundup/6858)) and would like to add the ability to launch rollups with custom ERC-20 gas token. Many competing RaaS projects also promise similar functionality and given proliferation of new chains it'd be wise to have a standard implementation, probably as part of the main Optimism repo, rather than have many different forks each of which requires maintenance and might diverge significantly, lowering security\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nWe've got experience running such a rollup at GTON and can help create the first implementation if needed, possibly with the collaboration from other projects like Conduit, Caldera etc. if they decide to help. Such a project needs minimal diff with the standard implementation of Optimism and full test coverage to make sure the rollup is secure\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThe alternative would be for each project to maintain their own fork of the codebase but this in the end hinders security and might lead to user funds loss in case anything goes wrong\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI'd like to make this the place for discussions around the custom gas token rollups, would also try to involve more developers working on open source OP Stack implementation to get their input here\r\n",
