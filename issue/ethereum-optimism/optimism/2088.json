Please describe.**\r\nCurrently the [Optimism standard bridge](https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/bridge/standard-bridge/) serves ETH and tokens that are created on L1 and are bridged to L2. There is demand for the opposite direction bridging Optimism native tokens to L1. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe solution can be very similar in design to the Standard Bridge but in reverse, i.e. the ERC20 deposits are made on L2 and tokens are bridged and minted on L1 while withdrawals are initiated on L1 and unlocked on L2. \r\nAdditionally this bridge will be simpler in that it should not handle ETH but just ERC20s. \r\nThere are possible gas optimisations that can be made as well on top of what the Standard Bridge offers. e.g if the L2 bridge is a predeploy (therefore with an immutable address) there should be no need to set any address variables for that could save on reading storage.\r\n\r\nThe contracts added should have 100% code coverage.\r\n",
