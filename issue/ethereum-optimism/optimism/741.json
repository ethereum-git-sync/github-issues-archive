However, Ale's withdrawal tx was failing silently which his local watcher was able to detect.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**\r\n1. Git clone repo: `git clone git@github.com:Synthetixio/synthetix.git`\r\n2. Checkout the develop branch: `git checkout develop`\r\n3. Install deps: `npm i`\r\n4. Deploy contracts: `node publish deploy-ovm-pair\r\n5. Run tests: `npm run test:prod:ovm`\r\n6. See tests hang:\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nScreenshot was taken by Ale from Synthetix of his integration tests failing in his CI:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37757724/116949234-40844d80-ac47-11eb-82e1-8be4efd79110.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nWatcher should pick up all deposits and withdrawals on the other side, even if they revert",
