  "body": "Hi. According to the [Node Operator Guide Docs - configuring op-geth](https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/bedrock/node-operator-guide/#configuring-op-geth),\r\n> --rollup.disabletxpoolgossip: Disables transaction pool gossiping. While not required, it's useful to set this to true since transaction pool gossip is currently unsupported.\r\n\r\nDoes this mean there may a change to enable transaction pools between L2 execution clients in the future? Or L2 execution is strictly not allowed for tx gossiping? I think tx gossiping is needed for decentralized sequencer.\r\n\r\nAlso, can you please elaborate the sentence: `since transaction pool gossip is currently unsupported`? If we do not set `rollup.disabletxpoolgossip` flag, tx gossip works fine between two op-geth clients. Confirmed using hive integration tests - https://github.com/testinprod-io/hive/pull/9. So, technically tx gossiping IS supported, but not used. Also https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/hive/pull/54 mentions that tx gossiping works. \r\n\r\nMy understanding is that, because we have explicit sequencer transaction forwarding using `rollup.sequencerhttp`, we do not need transaction pool gossiping yet, so we explicitly disabled tx gossiping(although it is not required). However in the near future, we will use tx gossiping for something, such as sequencer decentralization.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n",
