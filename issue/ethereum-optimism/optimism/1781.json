Please describe.**\r\nInfrastructure providers (Infura, Alchemy, QuickNode, etc.) currently forward write requests to the Sequencer with custom proxy infrastructure that inspects the JSON-RPC request and checks the method. I have received various requests to build this functionality into the replica node software so that other people can run replicas too and can choose not to rely on infra providers for write requests.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nModify L2Geth so that replica nodes will forward write requests to the Sequencer if configured with a Sequencer RPC url.",
