  "body": "A lot of errors are repeated in the `BridgeProcessor` of the indexer `run` function.\r\nAll the returned errors of the `run` function are captured in the same place: we can log the error here.\r\nThe logs do contain additional attributes, but these could also be captured in a custom error type.\r\n\r\nOr, alternatively, if logging is the better solution here, maybe the error should not be returned at all?\r\nThe caller, besides logging the returned error, only counts the error in metrics, so that could be improved as well: the metrics could count different types of errors, to help identify the kind of problem more easily.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
