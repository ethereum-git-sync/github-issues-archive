Please describe.**\r\nWe now have four different packages related to smart contracts, `contracts`, `contracts-bedrock`, `contracts-periphery`, and `contracts-governance` (note that `contracts` will be replaced by `contracts-bedrock`). Each of these packages has a slightly different package structure even though they're largely doing the same things.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI would like to see a consistent package structure between each of the packages. I would also like to see common tooling pulled out into a separate package to avoid code duplication.\r\n\r\nI know this is a relatively high-level issue but I think it's worth putting here just to keep track of the progress of this.",
