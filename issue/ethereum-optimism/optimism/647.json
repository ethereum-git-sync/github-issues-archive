    "body": "I understand it’s not priority but just so you know some windows versions do not support windows linux subsystem these people would be stuck not being able to deploy anything. We have someone at work in that exact situation who is the game developer meaning we had to create a GitHub action for him to deploy it. Meaning his flow is push to branch then GitHub action compiled and deploys the contracts, then test, this is on repeat every time. I personally would raise this as a higher priority if possible and as you said seems a very easy fix. Just my POV. Thanks ",
