  "body": "The optimism monorepo utilizes CircleCI to execute its CI.  This configuration is documented in `.circleci/config.yaml`.  However, simply cloning this repo and associating it with a CircleCI account is unsufficient to actually make CI pass.  There are 3rd party services such as the GCP registry, and possibly others that are documented only insofar as they are referenced in the CI config file.\r\n\r\n## Why is this a problem?\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, for anyone without write access to the Optimism repository, they cannot successfully run CI tests in their own fork.  This means that developers can't leverage CI to help them iterate in their own development while preparing code for a PR, or in their own general experimenation.\r\n\r\nSecondly, for any individual or organization who does have a CircleCI account, their pull requests will end up executing in their own CI context resulting in failures on the PR.  Reviewers know that for instance the 'publish' steps of CI do not need to be green in order to merge, but it's still distracting and confusing.\r\n\r\nFinally, as a community focused distribution with many op-stack derivatives, it's important for the health of the ecosystem that forks and other op-stacks can focus on contributing their own unique value, rather than duplicating effort to maintain parallel CI forks.\r\n\r\n## How can this be addressed\r\n\r\nIdeally, the CI configuration and its dependencies could be exposed through some sort of infrastructure as code repository.  Say, Terraform or something similar.  In this way, other individuals or organizations could simply review the code and execute it in a project context to stand up the full CI system.  Possibly this code already exists and is available, but it wasn't obvious to me where to find it.\r\n\r\nBarring the ability to stand up the CI and its dependencies via infrastructure as code, even simple documentation about what services and accounts are required, what variables need to be set, and the general structure of the pipelines promotion, releases, etc. would be very helpful.\r\n\r\nNote, @ajsutton [suggested that I open this issue](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/7049#issuecomment-1699839373).",
