Please describe.**\r\nThis issue is a bit of a nit. We have this folder called `standards` that currently just contains some Uniswap contracts: https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/master/packages/contracts/contracts/optimistic-ethereum/libraries/standards. I don't quite think this is the right place for these contracts. Perhaps we could consider adding a folder `contracts/external/uniswap` instead?\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI think `contracts/external/uniswap` makes sense. Ideally we would separate out the contracts that we've written from the external contracts we're using.\r\n",
