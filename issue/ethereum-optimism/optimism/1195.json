Unfortunately when running tests on Optimism client, nothing is printed.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI'd like to have `hardhat/console.sol` working like on Hardhat or an equivalent tool.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nAdd a different debugging tool, which would be just as useful?\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nNone.\r\n",

Capture the logs and attach them to the receipt, then modify the `hardhat-ovm` plugin to print out the logs. That could be pretty cool but not sure how easy that is.",

In OVM 2.0, Optimistic Ethereum is extremely close to \"just Geth\". This means that your testing pattern should basically be the same -- test your contracts in Hardhat and then deploy to OE. I think we can close this since that testing pattern does allow you to use console.log.",
