Please describe.**\r\n\r\nI'm new to Optimism and currently trying to understand how it works. \r\nIf I understand it correctly, current implementation of `op-batcher` always submits the batch even when there is no transaction. If there is no valid batch available for derivation, `op-node` automatically create an empty batch for derivation. Since batcher tx fee is quite a burden for operators, I think we can skip the batcher tx when there is no transaction included in the batch. \r\nEvent though in that case we must wait for SWS to derive the block of that epoch, I think it's quite reasonable if chain operator prefers to reduce cost than faster derivation. \r\nPlease let me know if my suggestion sounds completely strange, since i'm still a beginner. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nA clear and concise description of what you want to happen.\r\n\r\nAdd an option for `op-batcher` to disable batch submission on empty batch.  \r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nA clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.\r\n",
