The last deposit was made on 4/21/2021 at 8:51:56.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n`Proxy__OVM_L1ETHGateway` should be the only contract able to make deposit calls to `OVM_L1ETHGateway`.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis issue was surfaced after a discord member pointed out that in our integration docs, we recommend using `OVM_L1ETHGateway` to deposit ETH to L2, an issue that will be fixed in it's own PR in [community-hub](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pulls)",

But then also:\r\n\r\n> we've heard of people putting this protection measure in place, but i don't think i had ever heard of someone actually making that mistake\r\n\r\n- @frangio\r\n\r\n> a fix on the docs is definitely easier than one in the contracts\r\n\r\n- @spalladino\r\n\r\nDo we know how that address got into the docs, how likely is this to happen again? I'm assuming it was read from a regenesis file somewhere, which does feel like an easy enough mistake to make. ",
