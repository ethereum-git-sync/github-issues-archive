Please describe.**\r\nI am trying to use hardhat and optimism sdk, however I fall under a dependency hell with Optimism requiring ethers^5 and hardhat requiring ethers^6. \r\nMy project requires a custom L2 token, and I am using hardhat as the framework for compiling and deploying this token. So I want my project to be ran from hardhat framework, including the use of optimism sdk. \r\nIs there any reason why not updating to ethers^6? \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nUse ethers^6\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nStop using this sdk or hardhat.\r\nCreate separate projects for sdk and hardhat.\r\n",

Updating @eth-optimism/core-utils shouldn't be a ton of work to ethers v6\r\n\r\nTo be honest this isn't super high priority for the team, i did a little extra work attempting to port the sdk but I need to focus on my decentralization work.

Add resolutions to your package.json\r\n[Resolutions](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/selective-version-resolutions/) will tell yarn to install a different version of ethers for the optimism sdk\r\n```json package.json\r\n{\r\n  \"resolutions\": {\r\n    \"@eth-optimism/sdk/**/ethers\": \"^5.7.0\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n2. install ethers v5\r\nyou may find that interacting with the optimism sdk with ethers v6 works fine but I suspect you may need to pass in V5 providers to optimism. We can install ethers v5 under the namespace `ethersv5`\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nyarn add ethers@latest ethers5@npm:ethers@5 @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox\r\n```\r\nEthers v6 can be imported as normal\r\n```typescript\r\nimport * as ethers from 'ethers'\r\n```\r\nAnd then ethers v5 can be imported using `ethers5`\r\n```typescript\r\nimport * as ethers from 'ethers5`\r\n\r\nI suspect you will have to initialize the optimism sdk via an ethers v5 provider but YMMV",
