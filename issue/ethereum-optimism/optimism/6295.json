    "body": "> This issue is caused by dependencies of sdk: [@eth-optimism/contracts](https://libraries.io/NPM/@eth-optimism%2Fcontracts)\r\n> \r\n> [@eth-optimism/core-utils](https://libraries.io/NPM/@eth-optimism%2Fcore-utils)\r\n> \r\n> These packages should be updated to use ethers^6.\r\n\r\n@eth-optimism/contracts is deprecated and we will want to remove as a dependency. Updating @eth-optimism/core-utils shouldn't be a ton of work to ethers v6\r\n\r\nTo be honest this isn't super high priority for the team, i did a little extra work attempting to port the sdk but I need to focus on my decentralization work. Happy to review any PRs if you would like to help",
