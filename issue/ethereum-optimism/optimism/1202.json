Please describe.**\r\nWe [run](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/650f2cb4fab67ac255e87cc290ce5a7f6301ce40/.github/workflows/ts-packages.yml#L57) a tool called [codechecks](https://codechecks.io) as part of our CI process. Unfortunately, [codechecks will complain](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/1196/checks?check_run_id=2958952070) when triggered in a PR from an external repository. Ideally we could get a fix merged into codechecks for this but not sure how feasible that is. For now, we'd like to disable the codechecks step when CI is triggered by a PR from an external repository.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nDisable codechecks when CI is triggered by a PR from an external repo. We tried doing it like this:\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/650f2cb4fab67ac255e87cc290ce5a7f6301ce40/.github/workflows/ts-packages.yml#L58\r\nBut that didn't work. I assume this is a relatively easy task if you know what you're doing, but the GitHub actions docs are pretty unclear about this. Maybe someone else can find something that I'm missing: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions#github-context\r\n",
