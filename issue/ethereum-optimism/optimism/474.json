We've made a [pull request](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/contracts/pull/342) in the past to address this but decided it was not the right way to go since a change was queued up (and is now [implemented](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/solidity/pull/22)) to the Solidity compiler that modifies how the execution manager is interacted with. This issue is to document the work to be done to revive that PR based on the new work in the Solidity compiler.",

Transactions will successfully revert, but we don't get the revert reason that we should be getting. Instead, we get the error shown above.\r\nThis issue is confirmed by observations of the tests for the [Waffle-ERC20-Example](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Waffle-ERC20-Example) repository\r\n\r\n## 2\r\nFrom having run variations of tests for the [Truffle-ERC20-Example](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Truffle-ERC20-Example), there is a _different_ error that is thrown when attempting to deploy a contract. The error thrown when deploying a contract with Truffle is something like:\r\n```\r\nError: while migrating ERC20: invalid transaction: insufficient funds for gas * price + value\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis error is thrown even after setting gasPrice to 0 in the network config and in the deployment and contract calls.\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\nAll that being said, it seems to me that these two separate errors are related",
