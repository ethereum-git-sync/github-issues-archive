    "body": "A draft of this exact thing has already been implemented as part of https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/8106\r\nThe derivation-pipeline is able to operate in a state where there's no \"chain\" on the EL side, and the engine-queue new-payload queue feeds into the engine as it's syncing. The engine handles the new payloads by extending the skeleton header chain, maintaining an accurate sync target, while continuing snap-sync, just like it would on a L1 CL<>EL optimistic beacon-chain sync.\r\nThis has been tested to successfully sync the op-goerli network, without prior datadir on the op-geth side. We may still want to decouple more of the engine-controls from the engine-queue / derivation pipeline, to encapsulate this syncing state better from the derivation work.\r\n\r\nThe remaining feature is the finalization: the op-node needs a way to turn the resulting synced chain into a finalized chain.",
