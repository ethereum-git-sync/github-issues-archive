If you intend to build a sparse merkle, you ought not pad.\r\n\r\nIf you intend to build a regular merkle that allows incremental storage of nodes, you ought not use the default hash mechanism (`bytes32(height)` would be sufficient padding).\r\n\r\nAlso, please consider tagging your interior nodes\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nName should reflect common definition of sparse merkles",

    "body": "Hey James, thanks for the issue!  Always great to see when the community has our back. ðŸ˜ƒ\r\n\r\nI'm actually not sure what you mean by padding.  Were you referring to [this line](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-monorepo/blob/f9f7f32f11c35acdf3b1b46ca8d076da09172516/packages/rollup-contracts/contracts/RollupMerkleUtils.sol#L73)? If so, that function does indeed return the root of a tree with 2**n nodes at each level.  [Here](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-monorepo/blob/f9f7f32f11c35acdf3b1b46ca8d076da09172516/packages/rollup-contracts/test/merklization/RollupMerkleUtils.spec.ts#L104) is a unit test comparing to our off chain SMT.\r\n\r\nThat said--it's definitely an unusual (ab)use of an SMT! This code is 8 months old and was built for the Unipig demo with knowledge that it would be deprecated. It was just easier to reuse our off-chain SMT even though a regular Merkle tree would suffice. We also didn't implement the standard SMT proof compression, though that seems unrelated to the points you're bringing up.\r\n\r\nIn any case--I'll throw up a ticket to remove this deprecated code so others aren't confused in the future.  If you or anyone else wanted to utilize it, I'd point to [this repo](https://github.com/d1ll0n/sparse-merkle-tree) where it's been picked up by another community member!",
