Make an L2 withdrawal on https://gateway.optimism.io\r\n2. Wait for tx to be confirmed by MM\r\n3. Click on address or MM icon in top right corner.\r\n4. See no pending withdrawal.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nShould see a pending withdrawal listed under user address after withdrawal has been made.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nLikely related to #1130, since withdrawals seem to not be registering on the UI. \r\nMaybe they're blocked just like deposits are blocked?",
