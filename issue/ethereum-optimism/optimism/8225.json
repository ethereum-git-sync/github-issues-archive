  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up to #8130, where the rethdb receipts fetcher was encapsulated in its own type `RethDBReceiptsFetcher`. This allows us now to persist a database instance/handle. The instance would replace the `dbPath string` field. It still needs to be determined how to persist the instance, since the rethdb fetcher currently opens the database on the fly on every request, and then throws away the db instance. We probably need to create a function `rdb_open_db` that returns a pointer to the instance as an unsafe Go pointer or so. And `rdb_read_receipts` would then receive this pointer instead of the db path string.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nExisting tests should be adapted and extended where appropriate.\r\n",
