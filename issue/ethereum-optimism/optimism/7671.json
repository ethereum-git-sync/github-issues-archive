  "body": "Op-node uses `cliapp.LifecycleCmd` to handle startup/shutdown/force-shutdown, while ensuring resources are closed and any shutdown errors are propagated properly.\r\n\r\nPrevious context-based shutdown patterns encouraged bad code that shuts down like `defer thing.Close()` without propagating the error, or even returning before go-routines of the service fully shutdown, since context closure triggers shutdown, but does not await the results.\r\n\r\nThere are also related CI flakes due to poor resource-closing behavior in the batcher, where flaky duplicate close calls cause erorrs, that then make tests fail.\r\n\r\nServices to update:\r\n- op-batcher\r\n- op-proposer\r\n- endpoint-monitor\r\n- indexer\r\n- op-wheel (`engine auto` sub-command is long-running, other sub-commands are not, may require some more work)\r\n- op-bootnode\r\n- op-heartbeat\r\n\r\n**Work in progress.** Prioritizing this issue today since the resource-closing issues in CI are not getting any better, and it's a good follow-up after the initial lifecycle util work in https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/7538 and resource cleanup start in https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/7592 and the older shutdown issue got stale and was on the wrong track (graceful and accurately-error-reporting resource closing is the important part, the context-part is not) https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/6742  Batcher has been refactored in #7682, other services remain.\r\n\r\nAnd update `DialEthClientWithTimeout` to make the caller set the timeout.",
