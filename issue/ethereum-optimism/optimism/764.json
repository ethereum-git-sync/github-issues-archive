Clone @kesar's project: `git clone git@github.com:PrediqtCom/prediqt-core.git`\r\n2. Install project deps: `yarn`\r\n3. Start `optimism/ops` containers\r\n4. Compile `prediqt-core` contracts for the OVM and run  integration tests: `yarn hardhat compile --network optimism && yarn test:ovm`\r\n5. See error:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"929\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-05-05 at 10 30 01 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37757724/117167426-daa1de00-ad8c-11eb-9102-ea555c23cf79.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nWe expect to receive an error message regarding the contract failing to deploy, however, it appears that the contract is failing silently.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nIn `MarketERC721` there is a [check for an acceptable timestamp](https://github.com/PrediqtCom/prediqt-core/blob/6cf0931cd3be6e48e63a6de855e0194279a2463f/src/ERC721/MarketERC721.sol#L37). We've confirmed that this works on L1 by changing the [`resolution` value in `Market.test.ts` ](https://github.com/PrediqtCom/prediqt-core/blob/6cf0931cd3be6e48e63a6de855e0194279a2463f/test/Market.test.ts#L50) and seeing that the `require` message is returned when the `_timestamp` is less than `block.timestamp`. \r\n",

Introduce a new flag to the execution manager: `isSimulatedTransaction`\r\n3. Inside of `OVM_ECDSAContractAccount` check whether `isSimulatedTransaction` is set and skip signature verification if this is the case.",

    "body": "Unfortunately, I think that solution won't be quite as simple because the `from` field of `eth_call` can be an arbitrary address, including an L1 precompile address or a different smart contract.  These are the challenges we've faced in the past due to this:\r\n- It is impossible to use normal OVM code paths (i.e. `ovmCREATEEOA`) to get an `OVM_ECDSAContractAccount` into the correct `from` address without a signature.\r\n- Geth does not allow us to write to the state trie if the account is an L1 precompile (including `ZERO_ADDRESS`--it throws an error, this is why we made `simulateMessage` when ChainLink was trying to do this) even if we write code to `put` especially for `eth_call`s, like we did with the `mockOVM_ECDSAContractAccount`.\r\n- If the `from` address is an existing contract, we need the correct code to be there in case the contract is called back into.\r\n\r\nI think that we could probably combine both approaches conditionally on the `from` address and get something that works for all cases and fixes the gas consumption, but it's not super elegant.  This is why I think the \"real\" EOA codepath should be made to look more like `simulateMessage`, as opposed to making `eth_call` look like the \"real\" codepath we have now, but mocked in some way.",
