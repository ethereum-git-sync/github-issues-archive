  "body": "\r\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nIn the tutorial there are a number of time consuming steps that are necessary to create the docker images for running Optimism:\r\n\r\n> git clone https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism.git\r\n> cd optimism\r\n> yarn install\r\n> yarn build\r\n> cd ops\r\n> docker-compose build\r\n\r\nThis is a slow process, and it hurts the developer's experience. Most of us don't want to deal with Optimism internals, any more than we need to see how the compiler we use is built. We just want to use the tools to build our own thing.\r\n\r\nThis is particularly problematic because it's something that happens extremely early in the process, possibly when a developer is still thinking whether to use Optimism or some other competing mechanism. People are impatient, and it's best to accomodate that if we want them to use our stuff.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nHave the Optimism team run a script somewhere that creates the images and then uploads them to a registry. Rerun as needed (when there is a major update, an important bug fix, or a security vulnerability fix).\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nOriginally posted in https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-tutorial/issues/35, @smartcontracts told me it's better to put it here.",
