  "body": "<!--\r\nNeed help?\r\nRefer to our contributing guidelines for additional information about making a good issue:\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum-optimism/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\nSort of a bug, but more of a standardization thing between us and other clients. Currently Geth is not defaulting to address(0) when doing a `call` or `estimateGas` without providing a `from` address. It's because of this block of code:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/94d8320cc9340b86bcbb2fead33d1e21ec6a0f76/l2geth/internal/ethapi/api.go#L802-L806\r\n\r\nSince every node is considered a mining node (we supply a private key for the mining account), there ends up being a key loaded into the account and therefore `call` and `estimateGas` transactions are being sent from the mining address. I deployed this basic contract on Kovan to confirm that this is the case:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncontract Tester {\r\n    fallback() external payable {\r\n        assembly {\r\n            mstore(0, caller())\r\n            return(0, 0x20)\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI then sent a `call` to this contract and got the following address back: `0x00000398232E2064F896018496b4b44b3D62751F`. This is the block signer address. Since we don't support in-node wallets for now anyway, I think the easiest fix is to put the block I linked above behind a `if !rcfg.UsingOVM` block.",
