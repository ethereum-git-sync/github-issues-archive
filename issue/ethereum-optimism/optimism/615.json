I'll quote what he said here and let him expand on what was said:\r\n\r\n### What happens if the contract a cross domain message calls reverts?\r\n1. Doesn’t seem like I’m like able to pick that up with the watcher\r\n    * Would like to be able to get the revert messages of relayed relayed messages, is that not possible?\r\n    * Relay event only emitted if call doesn’t revert\r\n    * Watcher looks for relay events\r\n\r\n2. Does the RelayedMessage event have to be emitted only on success? \r\n    * Don’t see why that can’t also be on failure (it literally gets stored as a relayed message even if it reverts)\r\n    * Maybe a separate event like SuccessfulMessage or something would be useful?\r\n    * Being able to detect a relayed message that didn’t succeed seems pretty important\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n@TransmissionsDev could you possibly provide a repro case?\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nShould be able to retrieve revert reasons from cross-domain message call reversions.",
