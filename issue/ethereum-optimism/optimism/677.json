  "body": "Something I noticed while debugging #570 and writing #676 is that Docker has a native `HEALTHCHECK` command and `docker-compose` has a native `healthcheck` configuration option. There is a nice sample repo [here](https://github.com/peter-evans/docker-compose-healthcheck) that demonstrates how we might be able to use it. [Here](https://blog.sixeyed.com/docker-healthchecks-why-not-to-use-curl-or-iwr/) is an opinionated article about how health checks should work too. We might benefit from this.",

    "body": "Came across this issue and dove into it a bit because I'm trying to get familiar with the repo ðŸ˜„ . After diving in a bit, I suspect that following a [wait-for-it.sh](https://docs.docker.com/compose/startup-order/) type strategy might work better than using `healthcheck` for the startup race conditions referenced in the issue. `Healthcheck` I believe is primarily designed to tell when a service is healthy/ unhealthy and doesn't do any blocking like `wait-for-it.sh` does. I'm a noob to the repo so very well might be off base here.",
