Please describe.**\r\nI have a habit of separating internal and external imports inside of TypeScript files. This makes it very easy to see which utilities are being pulled in from external dependencies. Our goal should be to eventually replace many of our external dependencies with simple functions of our own (for security reasons), so it's ideal to be able to quickly see when there are unnecessary external imports. Some of our integration tests currently have this, but others do not. It should be easy to standardize the remaining files around this pattern.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nStandardize all of the TypeScript files within `integration-tests/tests` around the pattern described above. Here's an example of how to organize the imports:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/e634bf2ca62b895db678531c4488aa2d2e2e1a2c/integration-tests/test/basic-l1-l2-communication.spec.ts#L1-L12\r\n\r\nNote the `/* Imports: External */` and `/* Imports: Internal */` comments that define the two sections. External imports first, then internal imports. Also note that `import { expect } from './shared/setup'` should always be at the top of the file. See here for an example of a file where the imports need to be cleaned up:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/e634bf2ca62b895db678531c4488aa2d2e2e1a2c/integration-tests/test/native-eth-ovm-calls.spec.ts#L1-L10\r\n\r\nThis should be:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport { expect } from './shared/setup' \r\n\r\n/* Imports: External */\r\nimport { BigNumber, Contract, ContractFactory, Wallet } from 'ethers' \r\nimport { ethers } from 'hardhat' \r\n\r\n/* Imports: Internal */\r\nimport { \r\n  fundUser, \r\n  encodeSolidityRevertMessage, \r\n  gasPriceForL2, \r\n} from './shared/utils' \r\nimport { OptimismEnv } from './shared/env' \r\n```",
