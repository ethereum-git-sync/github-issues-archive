  "body": "**Problem:**\r\nThe current way we connect to locally deployed contracts is not ideal\r\n\r\n**Potential solution (suggested by Kevin):**\r\nCreate a `deployments/local` folder that gets automatically updated with the new addresses if the user changes the deployer address. This would allow the [`connectToL1Contracts`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/713) function to be usable when running the `docker-compose up` script\r\n\r\nReply below with questions/comments/concerns\r\n",
