  "body": "**Problem**\r\nI'd love to inherit from [`Proxy.sol`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/Proxy.sol) in a custom proxy that I'm writing. However, the functions that I want to override don't have the `virtual` keyword :(\r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\nIdeally, a couple minor changes for the functions `upgradeTo` and `upgradeToAndCall`:\r\n* Add the `virtual` keyword, which would allow me to override these functions.\r\n* Change the visibility of these functions from `external` to `public`. This lets me call `super.upgradeTo/super.upgradeToAndCall`.\r\n\r\nBullet point 2 isn't strictly necessary since I don't _need_ to call `super.upgradeTo/super.upgradeToAndCall`. It'd just make my code cleaner.\r\n\r\n**Alternative**\r\nThe alternative is that I copy and paste `Proxy.sol` into my own file, but it'd keep my codebase cleaner if I could just inherit from Optimism's. Also, it's worth mentioning that OpenZeppelin's`TransparentUpgradeableProxy` has this same limitation, so that's a no-go.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n@smartcontracts said to open an issue for this. I'm happy to make a PR with these changes!",
