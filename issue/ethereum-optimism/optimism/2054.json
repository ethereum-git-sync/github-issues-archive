  "body": "This issue is part of a series of issues intended to get the test coverage of `core-utils` up to 100%. \r\n\r\nWe use an address aliasing scheme to prevent certain attack vectors where a contract on L1 could impersonate a contract on L2 and vice versa. As part of this, we maintain utilities for clients to be able to compute the aliased version of a given contract address. [The utilities can be found here](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/core-utils/src/alias.ts). We're almost at 100% test coverage for this file but a few lines still need to be tested. [You can find a coverage report for this file here](https://app.codecov.io/gh/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/core-utils/src/alias.ts).\r\n\r\nThe goal of this issue is to add tests that cover the lines not covered within the linked coverage report. Should be pretty straightforward!",
