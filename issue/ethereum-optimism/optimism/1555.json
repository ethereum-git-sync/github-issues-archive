    "body": "Just a few clarifications, since there is no `experimental` branch - I assume you mean the `develop` branch? \r\n\r\nAlso `Lib_BytesUtils` seem to have a 100% coverage, `Lib_RLPReader` have 1 function not covered, the `readBytes32` function.\r\n\r\nWhen I review the coverage report for `develop` branch - it seems coverage can be increased by targeting the 37 functions not covered in other tests. This is the list, could you indicate if some of these have higher priority than others?

    "body": "@coolhill  answers below:\r\n\r\n- Updated the description of the target branch - you are correct this is now `develop` since `experimental` was merged into `develop` for the last regenesis release.\r\n\r\n- `Lib_BytesUtils` has 80% branch coverage so perhaps you are looking at the Statements coverage which is 100%. Attaching a screenshot below \r\n![Screenshot 2021-12-14 at 15 46 55](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/703848/146010467-b0d8f6b6-4edc-41e1-93bc-4b67f1ad500e.png)\r\n - You are correct that the `Lib_RLPReader` `readBytes32` function is not test covered but additionally there's a number of other branches of logic which is not tested. Atm the branch test coverage of `Lib_RLPReader` is 66.67%. \r\n \r\nOn the list of contracts/functions we should cover, I'll provide more guidance soon. It's a valid concern since some of the contracts are likely to be decommissioned in near future and should be excluded from coverage",
