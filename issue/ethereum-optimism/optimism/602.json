    "body": "> This was silently fixed in ethereum-optimism/optimism#937\r\n> \r\n> Forgot about this issue. Please note that the watcher doesn't distinguish between failed and successful messages. For L1 => L2 messages you can distinguish based on the transaction receipt (status == 0 -> failed message). If you think it'd be worth distinguishing the two I'd recommend opening another issue with your preferred interface. Ty!!!\r\n\r\nGreat yeah this is how I thought it should be all along!",
