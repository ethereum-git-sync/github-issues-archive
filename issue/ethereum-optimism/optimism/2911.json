Main problem with increasing the gas limit is that Optimism's block times are much, much lower than Ethereum's block times, so increasing the gas limit creates the potential for the chain to become rapidly bloated.\r\n\r\nWe're planning to mostly resolve this issue in Bedrock with the following modifications to the protocol:\r\n- Optimism's block times will be fixed at one block every 2 seconds\r\n- Blocks will have a target gas limit of 2.5m with an elasticity multiplier of 8, meaning the maximum gas limit is 20m\r\n- We may increase the maximum to 30m if we feel it's safe to do so\r\n\r\nWe ran some analytics and found that at 20m the protocol can still be safe while also being able to execute a vast majority of the txns that have ever been executed on L1. If you have a specific jumbo txn that you want to execute that wouldn't work with a 20m gas limit, let me know.",

    "body": "> What is the difference between 20M and matching L1 spec of 30M?\r\n\r\nMatching the 30M spec seems reasonable and I will probably push for it. We're using 20M as a baseline for now (at the 2s block time) and will see how high we can reasonably crank up the gas limit before things get shaky. Further decreasing block times while increasing the gas limit to 30M would be fundamentally unsafe. Geth performance is mainly IO bound, not CPU bound. Accessing the state trie only gets worse as state gets more bloated. Requiring top-of-the-line sever hardware would reduce the future decentralization of the network by significantly increasing the cost to run a verifier that can actually keep up with block producers.\r\n\r\n> This makes some really drastic change to OP that make it not as useful as it currently is, with instant L2 finality.\r\n\r\nAlthough it's a significant change, it's one we believe is necessary for the long-term health and decentralization of the network. Best way to safely distribute unconfirmed L2 sequencer blocks to L2 nodes is to use a p2p network in the same way that Ethereum does. Most L2s today rely on a single centralized sequencer data feed, which ends up being extremely susceptible to DoS attacks and becomes a massive engineering problem to manage. By distributing via a p2p network, you can safely sit the sequencer behind a series of sentry nodes that then broadcast blocks to the rest of the network. It's much more stable and much more resistant to denial of service attacks.\r\n\r\n> What is the advantage of a 2s block production rate vs a 200ms/500ms block production rate?\r\n\r\nProducing blocks much faster than every 2s induces a load on the p2p network that may end up not being manageable. Additionally, it may not be feasible to produce blocks faster than ~200ms simply because of the amount of time required to recompute state roots (the MPT is an annoying and inefficient data structure). MPT performance only gets worse as the state trie gets bigger. 500ms may be the lower bound of safe and consistent block production. 1s may be more realistic. Again, like the block gas limit, 2s is an initial safe baseline for the sake of the devnet and we'll attempt to reduce that number as much as we can safely get away with. We've spoken in depth to many different projects on this topic and none are fundamentally broken by this change. Many projects also rely on a constant block production rate, so no matter what we'd remove the \"instant\" feature and replace it with a short-but-constant block time which can usually seem \"instant enough\" for most use-cases.",

    "body": "> L2Geth's leveldb layer isn't well optimized, you can just optimize the KV layer to reduce the I/O and do smarter caching. It's not really I/O bound, it's \"current crappy LevelDB implementation bound\" and competitive arb operators have custom code to accelerate the storage layer already, so its doable to get rid of the I/O bound and make it effectively still CPU bound.\r\n\r\nAlthough I agree it's feasible to do this, we're currently trying to launch Bedrock with a minimal diff to Geth. Optimizing the K/V layer is something we're interested in doing (and are actively pursuing) but will realistically not be in prod before Bedrock is out. \r\n\r\n> Moore's law is picking up again these days because AMD and Intel are finally innovating on single threaded IPC again.\r\n\r\nAlso worth keeping an eye on. And like I said, I'll push to at least stress test at lower block times just to see how the system behaves and figure out what its absolute limits are at the moment.",
