The main benefits are costs reduction and performance increase. For further details consult: https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton and https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/08/05/achieving-23-cost-savings-and-36-performance-gain-using-gitlab-and-gitlab-runner-on-arm-neoverse-based-aws-graviton2-processor\r\n\" Our latest cost analysis and performance benchmarks show that customers can realize cost savings of up to 23% and performance gains of up to 36% by deploying the GitLab application and GitLab Runner on the Arm-based Graviton2 when compared to the x86 based M5/C5 EC2 instances.\" \r\n\r\n- Enable developers to run `stellar-core` on their MacBook Pro M1/M2 laptops.\r\n",

    "body": "Taking a look at this! \r\n\r\nI see two main options for building linux/arm64 compatible containers:\r\n\r\n1. We add a new job that is similar to `docker-publish` to the circleci config (call it like `docker-arm-publish`) https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/98035730167fd5698d0436f1a170586c4625823b/.circleci/config.yml#L87-L110 The difference is that we use the arm execution environment https://circleci.com/docs/using-arm/. If we set resource class to `resource_class: arm.xlarge` then we should be provisioning a GCE instance that is compatible with ARM (i think that is what circle is doing under the hood?). I tried this with a test `t2a-standard-4` instance and was able to create a test `hardhat-node` image which is listed as `linux/arm64/v8` arch: https://hub.docker.com/layers/mikeneuder/hardhat-node/1.0/images/sha256-08d3fb84f0c4717155abf1fc88eceb094e35a051cc8fa6952225236649a67c9d?context=repo. \r\n2. We use `dockerx` in the CI workflow to build cross architecture images: https://www.docker.com/blog/getting-started-with-docker-for-arm-on-linux/. IIUC this builds a single container that can run on either architecture. This doesn't really feel like the problem we are trying to solve, but I am not sure. \r\n\r\nIMO option 1 sounds more like what we want to do, but I wanted to touch base here. ",
