The exact problem has not been found, but it appeared to be related to problems with the internal network. The services were not being initialized with the dynamic environment variables, in particular the `ADDRESS_MANAGER_ADDRESS`\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Add this repo to another repo as a submodule and pull/update\r\n1. Start up the `docker-compose` service from within the submodule\r\n1. The services will not properly start\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nI don't think using this repo as a submodule should break the docker setup - devs need a way to develop their apps against the system. This is meant to save time for future devs who attempt to use this repo as a submodule\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nIt would be nice if we could release an `npm` package that was a CLI tool that wraps `docker-compose` so that devs could install that package as part of their project and `npx run optimism start` or something like that",
