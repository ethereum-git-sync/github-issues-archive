    "body": "*DISCLAIMER as I am still very new to the crypto and web3 world there might be some inaccuracies. Feel free to correct me and provide me with more context*\r\n\r\n## Optimism + Ledger integration\r\n\r\nBased on the available documentation there are multiple ways the integration could be achieved, these have been outlined as levels - the nigher the level the closer the integration and the better user experience. Level 2 and Level 3 integrations require Ledger review and approval before they can be released.\r\n\r\n### Level 1 - App Connection\r\nThis would allow users to use their Ledger to connect to [Optimism Gateway](https://gateway.optimism.io/). There are some SDK implementations details that would need to be researched more in detail and implemented within the app.\r\n\r\nThe main issue with this would be that the Ledger doesn't support the Optimism network, so users would only be able to deposit the funds from the Ethereum Mainnet. This issue could be addressed with Level 3 integration. Alternatively, there could be UX and UI changes to disallow Withdrawing and to allow Depositing to a wallet which can be connected to Optimism network\r\n\r\nLedger documentation - https://developers.ledger.com/docs/transport/overview/\r\n\r\n### Level 2 - Ledger Live application\r\nWith this level the main advantage would be that the Optimism app could be displayed in the Ledger Live app browser. This level still has the same issue of not being able to use Optimism Network\r\n\r\nFor Optimism there are two options on now to achieve this:\r\n1. Integrating as a DApp\r\n2. Integrating as a non-DApp\r\n\r\n<img width=\"902\" alt=\"Screenshot 2022-01-29 at 08 38 46\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29582253/151651581-a427ecc6-c082-44fb-b107-1aa5b9b78b02.png\">\r\n\r\nThe most user friendly and highest long term support would be to implement Optimism as a DApp.\r\n\r\n#### DApp integration\r\nFrom what I understood there isn't a hard requirement for the app to actually be a DApp, it mainly needs a web client (*Might be that I am misunderstanding something or missing some context*). \r\n\r\nThis would allow a much closer integration and would remove the need for blind signing for Ledger users significantly improving the UX and trust. Additionally, with this integration if Optimism potentially provides an SDK, Optimism Ecosystem Apps could be surfaced within Ledger Live provided that the apps add support and interaction with the SDK.\r\n\r\nTo implement this, there are requirements to create a Plugin which would essentially work as a bridge between the app and the the ledger.\r\n\r\nLedger Documentation - https://developers.ledger.com/docs/dapp/nano-plugin/overview/\r\n\r\n#### Non-DApp integration\r\nThis would similarly allow the Optimism app to be surfaced on the Ledger Live App browser increasing discoverability. With the provided Ledger SDK integration would be seamless and would allow for the app to be used outside of the Ledger Live App browser.\r\n\r\nThe main limitations of this would be that there is no future potentially to surface the Optimism Ecosystem apps and the provided SDK has some missing features, meaning that the users might still need to use blind signing for some features.\r\n\r\nLedger Documentation - https://developers.ledger.com/docs/non-dapp/introduction/\r\n\r\n### Level 3 - Nano App\r\nWith this integration level it would be possible to install the Optimism app and by extension the Optimism Network onto a Ledger, this would increase trust and would unlock all the Optimism provided features for Ledger users. Additionally all apps using the Optimism network could individually add support for Ledger. And with previously provided Levels this would work together to increase UX for Ledger users.\r\n\r\nLedger Documentation - https://developers.ledger.com/docs/nano-app/introduction/\r\n\r\n### Conclusions\r\nWith the outlined levels of integration there is a big opportunity to increase Ledger user experience. The outlined Levels can be worked on in parallel, but for non-supported features, such as fund withdrawal, there needs to be some sort of handling and user guides which would help users to understand the limitations and benefits. Main language being that users need to move the funds outside of Ledger and then back into the ledger to store them until there is Level 3 integration which would unlock all the provided Optimism Network capabilities.\r\n\r\nAs some features loosely depend on other Level integrations (e.g. Level 2 integration requires web app updates to display the Ledger Wallet which could be achieved in Level 1), my main suggestion would be to develop this integration Level by Level this would allow us to identify any potential blockers and to pivot quickly in case of requirement changes. \r\n\r\n## Next Steps:\r\n1. Choose the initial Level of integration\r\n2. Research the level requirements more closely\r\n3. Create an tasks plan for the integration outlining potential pitfalls and areas where design and UX inputs are needed.\r\n4. Approve the outlined plan\r\n5. Start working on implementing the Ledger integration pivoting if needed.",

This work has been paid out in Gitcoin ❤️ \r\n\r\nWe are currently testing signing using ledger directly on the Gateway, without going through MetaMask. Ethereum app on the Nano supports Optimism as we are EVM equivalent. \r\nThis will then be followed by full Optimism support in Ledger Live.",
