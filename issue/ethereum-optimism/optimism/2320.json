Requesting events for a given block returns an empty array for a short period of time after the block is processed.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n[Use this](https://github.com/vimwitch/event-repro). It will send transactions and try to retrieve logs immediately when it learns of a new block, and 10 seconds after. The immediate retrieval almost always returns nothing, the delayed retrieval sometimes returns nothing.\r\n\r\n<strike>I observed a case where partial events were returned for a block but have been unable to reproduce.</strike> <strike>There were two transactions in the block and I got logs from one of them but not the other.</strike> There was a single transaction that caused 2 separate contracts to emit events, I got events from one of the contracts but not the other.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nAll logs are returned or an error status is returned.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n**System Specs:**\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "I think this is a result of the current network architecture. When you send a transaction to kovan.optimism.io, your request is being routed directly to the Sequencer node. The Sequencer then returns a result back to you which acts like a commitment of your transaction being included in the chain. However, when you send a *read* request (like querying events), your requests are being handled by some verifier (not the Sequencer). It usually takes a few seconds for the verifier to get block data from the Sequencer, so there's a delay in when the tx is made and when the event is available.",
