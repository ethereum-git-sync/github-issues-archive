We need to make sure that the values returned from `eth_estimateGas` and `eth_gasPrice` are very accurate for this reason. We should not accept transactions that are very mispriced for this reason. Note that there is no auction for transaction inclusion, the sequencer includes transactions based on \"fair ordering\" or in a \"first in, first out\" manner.\r\n\r\nThere is currently a bug in `eth_estimateGas` that causes it to fail when it shouldn't. We cannot use a gas estimation to prevent accepting overpriced transactions reliably until we fix this bug.\r\n\r\nSee: https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/661#discussion_r622617122\r\n",
