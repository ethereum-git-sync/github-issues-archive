Unsure of exact period but it appears to be between 4-7 days, after this point all requests for addresses.json/state-dump.latest.json timeout.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Clone and build HEAD of develop branch \r\n2. Start with docker up as per doc\r\n3. Leaving running for at least 4 days \r\n4. Periodically run curl http://localhost:8080/addresses.json, at some point no response will be received\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\naddresses.json and state-dump.latest.json can be always be retrieved via http on a long running instance\r\n\r\n**System Specs:**\r\n - OS: Debian 10 & Ubuntu 20\r\n - Package Version (or commit hash): develop branch\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Lack of errors is very weird. Sounds like the http server went down or there's some sort of networking issue. Are you able to get a shell inside the docker container? Maybe you can run `top` to see if the server is still running at all.",
