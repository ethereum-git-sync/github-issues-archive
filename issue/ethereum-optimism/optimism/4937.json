    "body": "This error looks wrong to me: the frameLength should never be that large. I think it hit a decoding error, and read the wrong data as frame-length.\r\n\r\nIn the verifier it was recently changed (thus also the different error message formatting) due to a finding of the Sherlock bug-bounty contest; https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/4867 which may be related.\r\n\r\nBut the error path is still the same:\r\n- The frame is too large: https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/72f24f11d21c167108082fdbe5bdffb3293348ed/op-node/rollup/derive/frame.go#L90\r\n- The frame decoding errors: https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/72f24f11d21c167108082fdbe5bdffb3293348ed/op-node/rollup/derive/frame.go#L140\r\n- The bad frame is ignored: https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/9a198e90b1a7ab90a2ca85a3277576103eba6548/op-node/rollup/derive/frame_queue.go#L45\r\n\r\nThis verifier code-path here functions as expected: bad frames are dropped and skipped over.\r\n\r\nThe batcher however needs to ensure it only outputs valid frames, or the frames will not be accepted.\r\n\r\nThe maximum frame size is configurable: https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/e03b50731e0718a311f4f59e0699c90e6a598759/op-batcher/batcher/channel_builder.go#L26\r\n\r\nAnd based on the max L1 tx size by default: https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/3468c6af6df8132c848f6f329a0a5592e6a14800/op-batcher/batcher/driver.go#L92\r\n\r\nWhich is smaller than the enforced frame size: https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/72f24f11d21c167108082fdbe5bdffb3293348ed/op-node/rollup/derive/frame.go#L14\r\n\r\nSo assuming the settings are left to defaults, then this may indicate some bug (that may be related or duplicate of the Sherlock contest finding) in the frame-encoding when buffering large amounts of data that corrupts the output (resulting in the ridiculous 2.8+ GB frame-size number).\r\n\r\ncc @sebastianst flagging possible op-batcher bug.",

    "body": "Thanks @protolambda for the initial analysis!\r\n\r\nThe `frameLength` of `2838834252` looks suspicious to me because it has the highest uint32 bit set: I think it never was a `frameLength` to begin with but instead is just random data that got decoded into a frame length. The unmarshaling code doesn't do any sanity check before this first check on the max. frame length. I bet the decoded frame number and channel id before are also random.\r\n\r\n@nolanxyg could you provide some more context?\r\n* What op-batcher and op-node configuration do you use?\r\n  * In particular, what channel configuration (target and max tx size, approx. compr. ratio)\r\n* What's your L1 here? \r\n* Is there any tx volume happening during the hours that your batcher is offline?\r\n\r\nPlease also give this a try with a more recent version of the monorepo. A few changes have been made to the batcher and node since your specified commit https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/commit/173181bd7f45aae9225523071defd5cf202fd812.",

    "body": "@nolanxyg Thanks, some op-node and L2 config would also be appreciated. E.g. what's you L2 block time? Note BSC seems to have a block time of 3 sec.\r\n\r\nWith your batcher configuration, it will have a hard time catching up because of the low target of `624` bytes. That value is/was set in our tests to force eager batch generation. But in realistic scenarios with high L2 volume, it's too low because each channel will only contain ~624 bytes of input data (and so even less output data because it gets compressed) and batcher txs are send sequentially.\r\n\r\nYesterday I added a new channel duration limiting functionality to the batcher at https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/4990 \r\n\r\nI suggest you test your system with this new batcher and also change the config as suggested in this PR's description, but with higher max channel duration and sub safety margin. It allows you to set a low channel duration so that channels are not kept open for too long (which gives a better UX at the expense of emptier channels during low L2 tx volume). This could be set to e.g. `MaxChannelDuration = 40` in a realistic setting to ensure that single-frame channels are submitted to L1 after at most 2 minutes (40 * 3 sec (L1 block time) = 2 min). But I don't know your requirements so whether you want to use channel duration limiting at all depends on your use case. My guess is you want to enable it, especially in your testnet.\r\n\r\nThen also increase the target tx size to 100000 and use a realistic value for the approx. compression ratio (0.4). Note also that newer batchers pull the channel timeout from the rollup node, so you can delete that parameter (`OP_BATCHER_CHANNEL_TIMEOUT`).\r\n\r\n## tl;dr\r\n\r\nUse batcher from #4990 and try with the following config (convert to env var names)\r\n```\r\n\t\tMaxChannelDuration:        40, // 40 * 3 sec (L1 block time) = 2 min\r\n\t\tMaxL1TxSize:               120_000,\r\n\t\tTargetL1TxSize:            100_000,\r\n\t\tTargetNumFrames:           1,\r\n\t\tApproxComprRatio:          0.4,\r\n\t\tSubSafetyMargin:           20,\r\n```\r\nThis is similar to our e2e test config, but has a higher max channel duration and submission safety margin.",

Setup the whole network (config with info mentioned above)\r\n2. Stop batcher for several hours (or batcher run out of money in our case as showed in below monitor)\r\n* \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33241113/222091229-463a90fd-b8d1-49b0-b8a7-cc04abc1b34b.png)\r\n\r\n3. Start batcher (or fund to batcher in our case at 03-01 10:43, and batcher ran out of money soon, so we fund to it again at 03-01 11:29)\r\n4. check the log of op-node, we found `frameLength is too large` error log at about 03-01 10:43 and 03-01 11:29, which is the time batcher return to work\r\n* \r\n<img width=\"1736\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33241113/222091012-427bf43b-cee6-4cd0-bc05-806c634261f3.png\">\r\n",

    "body": "@nolanxyg I looked at your logs screenshot. It's conspicuous that the error at 10:43 mentions a frame number of 14. Because the batcher should actually just send txs whose data only includes 1-2 frame(s) with your config (`OP_BATCHER_TARGET_NUM_FRAMES: 1`). So it looks to me like the frame data is total garbage. But then it seems like a miracle that parsing gets until \"frame 14\" and the 13 \"frames\" before that unmarshal without error. Also, the first byte of the tx data must be correctly set to `0 = DerivationVersion0`.\r\n\r\nI'm curious if you still get errors with the #4990 batcher. Also, could you enable batcher debug logging (`OP_BATCHER_LOG_LEVEL: \"debug\"`) and upload the logs near before and after the time when the node detects broken batcher tx data?",
