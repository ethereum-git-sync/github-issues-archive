Please describe.**\r\nA clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...]\r\n\r\nI am practicing building a private local L2 chain using Optimism. While doing so, I experienced that if the proposer is down for some reason for a few hours, it takes too long to propose up to the latest L2 block when it is run later. This is due to the fixed value of the SUBMISSION_INTERVAL setting in the `L2OutputOracle` contract. In other words, only a certain number of L2 blocks can be uploaded at a given time, and if the proposer is down for a while, it takes too long to upload the Output root to the latest block after restarting, which poses a significant problem for processing bridge tx during this time. \r\n\r\nOf course, we should pay attention to preventing the proposer from shutting down, but to prepare for various failure scenarios, it seems necessary to have the ability for proposer to upload Output root in bulk. \r\n\r\nFor example, a function similar to `L2OutputOralce.proposeL2Output` could be `proposeL2OutputBulk`, where we can provide a long L2 block root as input, wouldn't that be nice?\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nA clear and concise description of what you want to happen.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nA clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.\r\n",
