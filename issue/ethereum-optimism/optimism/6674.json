  "body": "**Description**\r\n\r\nThe `op-challenger` needs the absolute pre-state to attempt a \"step\" via its `Agent` component's `AttemptStep` method. In turn, the `Agent` queries it's composed `TraceProvider` for the absolute pre-state, implemented concretely by the cannon trace provider and the alphabet trace provider.\r\n\r\nOn startup (which is for now single-game spawned), the `op-challenger` should fetch the absolute pre-state from the on-chain  fault dispute game contract and compare this state with that of it's trace provider. If there is a mismatch, an error should be thrown.\r\n\r\n### Tasks\r\n- [ ] Implement a `FetchAbsolutePrestate` method on the `Loader` component.\r\n- [ ] Unit test this new `FetchAbsolutePrestate` loader component method.\r\n- [ ] On `Agent` initialization, validate the remote onchain absolute pre-state with the absolute pre-state from the local trace provider.\r\n\r\n**Considered Alternatives**\r\n\r\nInitially the thought was to pass the absolute-prestate in via a cli argument or \"embed\" this network-specific value in a mapping. But, since it is stored in the fault dispute game contract, it is much less error-prone and efficient to fetch this value from onchain.\r\n\r\n**Tests**\r\n\r\nUnit tests should be implemented for the `Loader` component.\r\n\r\n**Linked Linear Ticket**\r\n\r\nCLI-4286\r\n",
