Please describe.**\r\n\r\nYes, safe head may stop increase for 1hour(==channelTimeOut), which is a problem to some DAPPs since they may require safe head increasing timely\r\n\r\nI found that the team already identified this issue: https://status.optimism.io/clkhjkmre549295iqomx3wh79jr \r\nand revealed that team is actively working on a fix.\r\n\r\n1. could the team describe more about the fix tech-plan? \r\n* plan-A: optimize op-node to support read multi-channels from channel queue \r\n* or plan-B: just optimize op-batcher to avoid submitting broken channel(some frame in channel is missed, which result to channel time out)\r\nplan-B seems can not fix the issue perfectly, if batcher submitted a frame, the tx is on-chain successfully but rpc client return error to batcher due to network issue, so batcher will submit it again, this duplicated frame may cause channel queue stuck for 1hour\r\n* or plan-C?\r\n\r\n2. when will this be fixed?\r\nthanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n",
