  "body": "# The Problem\r\n\r\nThe release code is [heavily duplicated](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/master/.github/workflows/release.yml#L64-L202), in order to allow for dynamically launching jobs, conditional on the job being output by `changesets`.\r\n\r\nThe main challenge is basically having conditional/dynamic logic in the matrix generation, so that the jobs generated only match the published packages (whereas now we have hard-coded the jobs and conditionally trigger them)\r\n\r\n# The Solution\r\n\r\nIdeally, what we'd want, is a dynamic matric using `publishedPackages` which builds/pushes the services, and also \"intelligently\" builds the `builder` container only once (instead of having to re-build it for each service).\r\n\r\n# Another solution\r\n\r\nMaybe we do not need to intelligently build the builder image, and just re-building it once per service is fine.",
