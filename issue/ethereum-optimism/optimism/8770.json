    "body": "USDC.e circle USD Coin (Bridged from Ethereum) (USDC.e) Token Tracker on OP Mainnet.\r\n\r\nA relay transaction was requesting a deposit. When the L2 signature asked for 350,000,000 USDC.e there was no option to optimize the allocated amount signed from the wallet given access. Even though a bridge was being constructed this configuration confuses the user. This new transaction was applied from the previous transaction (airdrop) not allowing the wallet owner to understand this was a designed bridge that was new; instead it came from the first airdrop with the “withdrawal button” highlighted. Noticing the 0x Flashbot lead to researching to ensure no signature attack was detected. Is there a tool to help a user identify this was a bridge mission; especially for a new transaction, because this is what raised concerns from the wallet this happened in. Would like to have this documented as a way to help apply to an app. Next time will apply the notes of what was found through OKX that raised questions. Time though finally told the truth. This could be an added feature to a future IDS (Intrusion Detection System), or alert system as a way to implement alerts for security and detection purposes. ",
