Otherwise maybe assign someone to deal with the merge conflict\r\n\r\nThis will allow us to always be up-to-date with each geth version, instead of having to manually rebase.",

As part of Bedrock, we're going to be moving away from `l2geth` in the monorepo in favor of having geth in a separate repository, mainly for the purpose of maintaining history more easily.
