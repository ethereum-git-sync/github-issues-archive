Though we may switch to biome for linting in future for now we don't want to because it will not have many of the linting rules we currently have turned on via eslint. We only want to use biome format as a prettier replacement\r\n\r\n## Tasks\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add biome\r\n- [ ] Remove prettier\r\n- [ ] Configure biome so it is maximally equivalent to existing prettier formatting. Create smallest diff possible in the actual source code",
