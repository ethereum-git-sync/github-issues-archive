  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nThis task is an easy good first issue to replace prettier formatting for JavaScript files with biome.\r\n\r\n- [Biome is 25x faster than prettier](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/tree/main/benchmark#formatting) \r\n- [They recently reached the ability to be pretty prettier equivelent passing over 95% of the prettier test suite](https://prettier.io/blog/2023/11/27/20k-bounty-was-claimed)\r\n\r\nAn example of using biome can be found [here](https://github.com/wevm/viem/blob/main/biome.json#L25)\r\n\r\nNote: This does not include linting! Though we may switch to biome for linting in future for now we don't want to because it will not have many of the linting rules we currently have turned on via eslint. We only want to use biome format as a prettier replacement\r\n\r\n## Tasks\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add biome\r\n- [ ] Remove prettier\r\n- [ ] Configure biome so it is maximally equivalent to existing prettier formatting. Create smallest diff possible in the actual source code",
