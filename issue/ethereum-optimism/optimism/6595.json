Our token is already on ETH. We want to deploy a token that implements `IERC1363` for compatibility with the tokens on ETH, and we have confirmed that it can be paired to the origin on the StandardBridge as long as we implements `IOptimismMintableERC20` for the token. But we are debating whether to link our own implemented token or a token created through `createOptimismMintableERC20()`.\r\nWhen createOptimismMintableERC20() is executed, it seems that the `OptimismMintableERC20Created` event is issued(https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/38c8a267788f1ffd13139656638bdb31de78eda5/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/universal/OptimismMintableERC20Factory.sol#L83). Is this event particularly important? Can you tell me where it is used?\r\n",

    "body": "If the applications you going to run on the Optimism side require the IERC1363, then you should do your own version of the token. If maybe is the answer, then you should also do it. \r\n\r\nRegarding the event, I don't know the answer, but it seems like its not used by the bridge itself. I've implemented a custom token and deployed it directly (with no factory), and it worked just fine. The event is probably there to make easier for a user/ui to determine the localToken in the transaction receipt, as when createOptimismMintableERC20 called directly you won't have that return used anywhere.
