Our token is already on ETH. We want to deploy a token that implements `IERC1363` for compatibility with the tokens on ETH, and we have confirmed that it can be paired to the origin on the StandardBridge as long as we implements `IOptimismMintableERC20` for the token. But we are debating whether to link our own implemented token or a token created through `createOptimismMintableERC20()`.\r\nWhen createOptimismMintableERC20() is executed, it seems that the `OptimismMintableERC20Created` event is issued(https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/38c8a267788f1ffd13139656638bdb31de78eda5/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/universal/OptimismMintableERC20Factory.sol#L83). Is this event particularly important? Can you tell me where it is used?\r\n",
