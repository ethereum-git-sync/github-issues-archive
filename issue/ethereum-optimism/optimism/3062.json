  "body": "Hi, i am learning the OP source code, met some problem which confuse me, about the Deposit ETH action.\r\n\r\n1. User try to deposit ETH to his OP address;\r\n2. Call contract \"L1StanderBridge.sol 's depositETH function\" ;\r\n3. Core code: `bytes memory message = abi.encodeWithSelector(\r\n            IL2ERC20Bridge.finalizeDeposit.selector,\r\n            address(0),\r\n            Lib_PredeployAddresses.OVM_ETH,\r\n            _from,\r\n            _to,\r\n            msg.value,\r\n            _data\r\n        );`\r\n4. On the third point above, the \"finalizeDeposit\" function will be call on the L2StanderBridge.sol to finish the deposit action.\r\n\r\nQuestion is:\r\n     When did the \"finalizeDeposit\" being called and by which character? the Relayer?\r\n\r\nSome job i have done:\r\n      I been searching the \"message-relayer\" project which wrote by typescript, but didn't find any sign of the L2StanderBridge's \"finalizeDeposit\" calling. The call of \"relayMessage\" is also limited, and only the L1 contract can be called.\r\n\r\nWould you pls help me, thanks alot.",

    "body": "Hi, thanks for taking a look at our code! This can indeed be a confusing aspect of the system.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a transaction being sent from L1 to L2,there is no need for a relayer.  The L2 geth client actually runs the L2 transaction as if it were being sent by the address on L1 which called `L1StandardBridge.depositEth()`.\r\n\r\nI'd suggest looking more at our upcoming upgrade, including the contracts in [contracts-bedrock](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/b70872149d98f9b14e2b15f74f9d08de75bb8b6e/node_modules/@eth-optimism/contracts-bedrock/contracts), and the [deposit specs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/b70872149d98f9b14e2b15f74f9d08de75bb8b6e/specs/deposits.md#L1) which address your question. \r\n",

I will now explain it from the complete process, combined with the project components and the code call chain process.\r\n> \r\n> 1. User try to `deposit` ETH to his `OP` address;\r\n> 2. Call contract `L1_StanderBridge.sol' s depositETH function`;\r\n> 3. `L1_StanderBridge.sol` core code: `bytes memory message = abi.encodeWithSelector( IL2ERC20Bridge.finalizeDeposit.selector, address(0), Lib_PredeployAddresses.OVM_ETH, _from, _to, msg.value, _data )`;\r\n> 4. On the third point above, will call to the `sendCrossDomainMessage --> L1CrossDomainMessenger's sendMessage --> _sendXDomainMessage --> CanonicalTransactionChain's enqueue --> TransactionEnqueued`\r\n> 5. On the fourth point above, the `finalizeDeposit` function will be included in `TransactionEnqueued`;\r\n> 6. And the `DataTransportLayer` scan the block transactions and filter the `TransactionEnqueued`, then storage the `TransactionEnqueued`;\r\n> 7. `Sequencer` load the `TransactionEnqueued` from the DB, and execute the Tx which contains the `finalizeDeposit` message, this will call to the `L2_StanderBridge.sol 's finalizeDeposit function`;\r\n> 8. So far, the user's deposit process has been completed. His L2 address also has a corresponding recharge token;\r\n> 9. In the above steps, the `Tx` of the message containing `finalizeDeposit` is also packaged in the L2 block;\r\n> 10. `batch-submitter` will extract transactions from L2 block and pack them in `tx-batches` to L1's CTC;\r\n> 11. The tinth point, `deposit transaction` also be submitted by `batch-submitter`, because it is packaged in L2 block;\r\n> 12. `tx-batches` which in L1's CTC, wait for the `challenge time` pass;\r\n> 13. the the `challenge time` passed, now the `relayer` call to `L1CrossDomainMessenger's relayMessage`;\r\n> 14. Now the problem comes, the user's `deposit` action has completed in L2, you can see it at the `eighth point`. And now will it be executed again in 'l1crossdomainmessenger's relaymessage'? If not, why not? According to the process, it has indeed been submitted here.\r\n\r\n@Inphi @smartcontracts here",
