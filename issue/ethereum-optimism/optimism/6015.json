  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nin https://stack.optimism.io/docs/build/explorer/#installation-and-configuration it is cloning the Master Branch of BlockScout which is not supported with the OP-Stack chain. Since the transaction type of OP-Stack chain is different than Layer 1 chain.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nfollow the tutorial https://stack.optimism.io/docs/build/explorer/#installation-and-configuration and start the explorer, but it won't work\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nIt should run with no errors\r\n\r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\nThe master branch supports only L1 (as I was told by BlockScout support team), you have to clone the `production-optimism-stg` branch as it supports the L2 transaction type.\r\n\r\nIn OP-Stack dock it should be `git clone --branch production-optimism-stg https://github.com/blockscout/blockscout.git` instead of `git clone https://github.com/blockscout/blockscout.git`\r\n",
