Please describe.**\r\nWe currently do not have test coverage for syncing a verifier. This is a pretty big hole! To my knowledge, we would not be able to detect an error in the transaction batch submitter that causes verifiers to sync incorrectly. For instance, I don't think we'd detect it if the batch submitter submitted junk data for all transactions in our integration tests -- that's not good! Or if there was an error in the DTL or Geth, we similarly would not detect it!\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nOne quick way to solve this problem is by adding sync tests. These tests would behave in the following way:\r\n\r\n1. Perform a few transactions on L2 with an L2 sequencer.\r\n2. Wait until batches are submitted\r\n3. Record the final state root in the sequencer.\r\n3. Spin up a verifier which syncs the chain that was recently created\r\n4. Check the final state root in the sequencer vs the verifier, ensure equality.\r\n\r\nAdding these tests would allow us to catch a lot of common-sense errors in both the batch submitter and Geth's sync service. Long term we can have sync tests which sync mainnet & compare state roots, but even syncing a few blocks will catch a wide class of errors.\r\n\r\n### Note on adding a `fork detection service`\r\n\r\nNote that this relates to a service that we should have but currently do not: the `fork detection service`. The fork detector service is a simple node script which takes a set of web3 URLs & repeatedly queries them to verify that they all have the same state root. It can then be queried to check the status of the network as: `in consensus` or `forked`. It should list out all of the head state state roots for all of the nodes that it is polling and if the network is `forked` it should be easy to spot which nodes are in the majority vs minority. Theoretically, this service can be used in the sync tests, but that might be overkill.\r\n\r\n",
