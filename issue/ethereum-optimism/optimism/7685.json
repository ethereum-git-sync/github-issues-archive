  "body": "The `httputil.HTTPServer` has better shutdown handling, to fully close and allow for force-close, while propagating any errors. And it has more customization options and proper HTTP-server address reporting too.\r\n\r\nThe RPC server util should build around that, and provide the same shutdown features.\r\n\r\nThis can then be used by the go services like op-batcher and op-proposer, and maybe op-challenger.\r\n\r\nIdeally we also deduplicate more code with the op-node RPC server, which uses some custom RPC server definition still.\r\n",
