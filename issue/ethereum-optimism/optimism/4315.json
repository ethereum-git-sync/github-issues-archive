About generation 1 ( Pre 23 June 2021 history , From Jan 2021, till April 2021); \r\n- At those time, archived geth had used ( repo : https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/go-ethereum) \r\n- And DTL role would be a  https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-ts-services repo in my guess. \r\nSo In case of suitable to parse generation 1 block data, archive geth version v0.1.0 is good to go? or 0.2.0 would be better? \r\n\r\n2.  About generation 2 ( Pre 23 June 2021 history , From April 2021, till May 2021);  \r\n- I don't think that aforementioned archive geth used, But assure that regenesis repo gave me some hint about this. \r\nCTC contract about this one was deployed in this tx ( https://etherscan.io/tx/0x1c20c2ee279bfa7446fd7117b4b147cb2709f581a8052fa66276df2d1af3467b) \r\n- So based on the this suitable to parse generation `2` block data, archive geth version v0.1.0 is good to go? or 0.2.0 would be better?  v0.2.0 was released at the `Apr 9, 2021` so might be matched but I'm not sure. \r\n- One thing that makes me hesitated is this commit (https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/commit/925675dd920d1c66a4ae0410b454bc757f7882ed) . \r\nBased on this, Looks like suitable optimism-geth would be the this version ( https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/releases/tag/%40eth-optimism%2Fl2geth%400.2.6) \r\n\r\n3. About generation 3 ( Pre 23 June 2021 history , From May 2021, till June 2021);  \r\n- In here, I'm so depressed that no idea, because this version suitable to parse generation 3 block data but not sure. \r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/releases/tag/%40eth-optimism%2Fl2geth%400.4.8\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease let me know my guesses are correct. \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Go to '...'\r\n2. Click on '....'\r\n3. Scroll down to '....'\r\n5. See error\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nA clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nIf applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.\r\n\r\n**System Specs:**\r\n - OS:\r\n - Package Version (or commit hash):\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any other context about the problem here.\r\n",
