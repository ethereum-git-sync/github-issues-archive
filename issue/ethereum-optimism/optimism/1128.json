  "body": "Just keeping a record. Will tick these off once issues get created:\r\n- [x] Figure out how to get rid of the [`CTC_DEPLOYMENT_HEIGHT`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/8d67991aba584c1703692ea46273ea8a1ef45f56/l2geth/cmd/utils/flags.go#L812-L816) flag. There's no reason why we need to be setting this value manually, services should be able to retrieve it automatically.\r\n- [ ] Use the Deployer container for production deployments. We're doing deployments relatively manually when we can just be using the Deployer container.\r\n- [ ] Review and update READMEs:\r\n  - [ ] `/ops`\r\n  - [ ] `/specs`\r\n  - [ ] `/packages/batch-submitter`\r\n  - [ ] `/packages/common-ts`\r\n  - [ ] `/packages/contracts`\r\n  - [ ] `/packages/core-utils`\r\n  - [ ] `/packages/data-transport-layer`\r\n  - [ ] `/packages/hardhat-ovm`\r\n  - [ ] `/packages/message-relayer`\r\n  - [ ] `/packages/smock`\r\n- [ ] Review `/specs` and remove any outdated documents.\r\n- [ ] We need a README inside `/examples`.\r\n- [ ] Update primary README to explain changesets + release process.\r\n- [ ] Docs for running different types of nodes.\r\n- [ ] Add examples back into the integration tests.\r\n- [ ] Publish Docker images so we can instruct people to use the published containers instead of building manually.\r\n  - [ ] Also update docs to reflect this.\r\n- [x] Review `core-utils` for any outdated or unnecessary utilities.\r\n- [ ] Review `/patches` and see if everything in there is still necessary.\r\n- [ ] Update integration tests not to use the `message-relayer`.\r\n\r\nBigger projects:\r\n- [ ] Change the name of the DTL to something better like \"L1 Rollup Data Indexer\".\r\n- [ ] Rebuild the DTL as a part of Geth instead of as an external TypeScript service.\r\n- [ ] Rework the base TypeScript `Service` class.\r\n- [ ] Simplify the `message-relayer`.\r\n- [ ] Significantly improve test coverage of `core-utils`.\r\n- [ ] Determine and apply a new contract code style that can be enforced with a formatter.\r\n- [ ] Rename `hardhat-ovm` (maybe? it's just not a great name IMO).\r\n- [ ] Rewrite the `batch-submitter` using the common `Service` class (we really need to rewrite this, we've learned a lot since it was first built).\r\n\r\nStuff we could consider for fun:\r\n- [ ] Automatically generate part of our primary README based on changes to sub-packages.\r\n",
