    "body": "Yeah this is definitely a \"bedrock fixes this\" issue but more in the sense that \"bedrock makes this issue go away by removing that RPC endpoint entirely\".\r\n\r\nBasically there are two types of Optimism nodes right now, nodes that sync from L1 and nodes that sync from L2 (directly from the sequencer). Nodes that sync from L2 will always return zero. Nodes that sync from L1 will return an increasing value as the node syncs. \r\n\r\nYou always get zero from infra providers because they're running nodes that sync directly from the sequencer. They need to do this because otherwise they would have to wait for blocks to be published to L1 which means they would be behind the sequencer by quite a bit.\r\n\r\nIn Bedrock we get rid of this distinction between L1 nodes and L2 nodes. Nodes will sync from both L1 and from L2 (via p2p network instead of directly from sequencer). Blocks that are confirmed on L1 will be marked as \"safe\". \r\n\r\n",
