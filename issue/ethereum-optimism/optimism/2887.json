  "body": "We have a lot of room to fix ugly things within our Bedrock contracts. One such ugly thing is that we use prefixes (like `OVM_` or `Lib_` in the names of our contracts). I see no real reason why we can't rename these contracts. We've already done it for some of our contracts (like `OVM_DeployerWhitelist` => `DeployerWhitelist`).\r\n\r\nHere's the list of what I think should be changed:\r\n\r\n- [ ] `OVM_ETH =>ETH` and move into the `legacy` folder\r\n- [ ] `Lib_AddressManager => AddressManager` (same with `AddressResolver` and `ResolvedDelegateProxy`)\r\n- [ ] Literally every library within `libraries`, get rid of `Lib_` prefix\r\n- [ ] While we're at it, move `WETH9` into a `vendor` folder",
