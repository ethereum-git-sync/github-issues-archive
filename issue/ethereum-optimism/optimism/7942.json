Please describe.**\r\nThe Indexer API can be extended to support better specificity with an additional request query field (`message_hash`) that can be used for O(1) lookups on withdrawal. This is especially useful in circumstances when a client is trying to find indexed withdrawal metadata using an L1 withdrawal event (`WithdrawalProven`, `WithdrawalFinalized`). \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nA clear and concise description of what you want to happen.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nA clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.\r\n",
