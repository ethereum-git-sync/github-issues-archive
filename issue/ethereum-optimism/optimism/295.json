  "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nState root ordering within state commitment chain batches may differ from the transaction ordering with which the state roots are associated. \r\n\r\nThe root cause (no pun intended) appears to be that the SQL queries that assemble and order the batches order by different fields that _should_ produce the same result but may not.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\nThis is hard to reproduce, as it appears to be non-deterministic and based upon how Postgres assigns the ID of its records, possibly across multiple atomic transactions.\r\n\r\nThe best way to reproduce is by:\r\n1) Submitting a few hundred transactions in a matter of seconds to the L2 Node without the transaction batch creator or state commitment batch creator running but _with_ the L2 Chain Data Persister running\r\n2) Continue (1) until you run into a situation where there is at least one `l2_tx_output` record that does not appear in the same index when ordering the table's records by `ID` vs by `block_number`\r\n3) Run the state commitment batch creator & transaction batch creator\r\n4) See that the transaction in question appears at a different cumulative index when batched\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nState commitment batches have state roots which exactly correspond in number and order to the transactions within the transaction batch(es) they are committing to.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n**Specifications**\r\n - Version: Commit [29f2fc6847eca7d5ff90fceae0293916fed1669c](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-monorepo/commit/29f2fc6847eca7d5ff90fceae0293916fed1669c)\r\n - OS: N/A\r\n - Node Version: N/A\r\n",
