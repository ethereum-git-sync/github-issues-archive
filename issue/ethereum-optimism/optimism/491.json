  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nOur services (at least batch-submitter and data-transport-layer) are currently environment agnostic. However, being environment-aware helps us conditionally launch monitoring apps (eg Sentry and prom-client) and send tags to them accordingly.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nDetails need to be spiked out, but ideally during application start we can retrieve some variable for which environment the services runs in. We should also be able to tag logs with this environment. \r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nIf adding overall environment management is too much of an overhead, we could temporarily use env vars for these services such as `ENABLE_SENTRY=true`\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nCurrently only related to TypeScript services, but could be extended to other code we run.\r\n",
