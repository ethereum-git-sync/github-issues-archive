  "body": "We need a way to allow multiple Vyper binaries to play nicely with each other. We also need a way to distribute vyper for client-side frameworks.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to build Vyper for different platforms as an executable file. See [here](https://pypi.org/project/Cython/) and [here](https://github.com/cython/cython/wiki/FAQ#how-can-i-make-a-standalone-binary-from-a-python-program-using-cython). Check out if we can compile from C to WASM and other architectures with Clang/LLVM\r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\n- [ ] Cross-platform\r\n- [ ] Minimally invasive to Vyper's current packaging and distribution process\r\n- [ ] Can use multiple versions of Vyper in any host framework that is supported with this proposal (in Python, Javascript, etc.)",

There is some work done toward this in https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper-static-linux-build but it's specific to linux and outdated - it was done before we moved to an `entry-points` style system in `setuptools`.\r\n2. A script to produce a javascript package so we can distribute Vyper via NPM. Some work toward this was done in https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper-in-browser but it relies on a fork of pyiodide and is fairly outdated by now.\r\n3. Tests to confirm that the above scripts work.
