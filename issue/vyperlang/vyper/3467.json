  "body": "The current [Security Policy](https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/blob/master/SECURITY.md) needs a proper overhaul imho since the content is outdated (e.g. Vyper is _not_ currently in limited beta; Yearn, Curve Finance, or Lido have conducted extensive audits on Vyper contracts). Also linking [here](https://hackmd.io/@eYTwSKriTe6ANMFaEJCuxw/HJnkTkPGh) the write-up by @fubuloubu about the \"Vyper Security Alliance\". There is no rush to update the Security Policy, but I personally would aim for a properly overhauled version for the major `0.4.0` release.\r\n\r\nInformation that needs to be included in a Security Policy is imho:\r\n- Summary of all known security vulnerabilities (link to a specific section in the docs; not only the security advisories);\r\n- List of security vulnerabilities affecting a specific version of the compiler (can be e.g. a `JSON` file);\r\n- What's the policy around patching versions? E.g. let's assume there is a bug found in Vyper `0.3.9` which is also present in `0.2.16`, does Vyper release a patch not only for the `0.3.x` series, but also `0.2.x` series?;\r\n- Is there a bounty program we can somehow include and know how to fund?;\r\n- ...\r\n\r\nI opened this issue to gather all the feedback in one place. Let me know your thoughts.",
