We should also discuss what tools/partnerships would make this process as easy as possible for Viper developers.\r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed?\r\nMy ideal process is a python-based tool for deployment of Viper contracts. I am currently working on something using Web3.py, there is also Populus (and maybe Truffle).\r\n\r\n#### Cute Animal Picture\r\n![Proud Lion](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/19/96/37/1996370ba66c4a637a1cfb5c080cc8fc.jpg)\r\n",

    "body": "Awesome, I want in on that conversation! Lol\r\n\r\nI like Populus, but I haven't been using it because I had a different idea for contract organization, and I wanted to store my contract deployment parameters in a YAML so they are globally accessible for testing and also so that the contract dependencies are stored external of my test/deployment scripts. Additionally, the version of pyethereum it uses doesn't have the `ethereum.tester` module, and I prefer testing in Python versus testing in Solidity.",
