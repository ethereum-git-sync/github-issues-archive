  "body": "## Preamble\r\n\r\n    VIP: <to be assigned>\r\n    Title: Change public global getter from `get_var` to `var`\r\n    Author: David Knott\r\n    Type: Standard Track\r\n    Status: Draft\r\n    Created: 2017-11-27\r\n\r\n\r\n## Simple Summary\r\nI'd like to change the getter syntax for global variables.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nI think changing the public getter from `get_var` to `var` will make Viper cleaner and easier to use.  It'll also make Solidity compatibility easier as right now custom getters have to be written to Solidity ABI's.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\nInternally the change would look like this:\r\n```\r\nin contract:\r\nx: public(num)\r\nproposed getter in compiler:\r\n@public\r\n@constant\r\ndef x() -> num:\r\n    return x\r\ncurrent getter in compiler:\r\n@public\r\n@constant\r\ndef get_x() -> num:\r\n    return x\r\n```\r\nThe developer facing side will look like this:\r\n```\r\nin contract:\r\nx: public(num)\r\nproposed getter created:\r\nc.x()\r\ncurrent getter created:\r\nc.get_x()\r\n```\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\nThis VIP will break all contracts using the `public` getter for global variables, though I'm not too worried about this as Viper is not widely used yet. \r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",
