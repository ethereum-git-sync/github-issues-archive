I have a lot of experience working in QA/Automated Testing, a former CIO of a fiat brokerage/RIA, current software engineer, etc. and would enjoy the opportunity to contribute.\n\nAre there any AC besides the test suite passing?  Has there been a consensus in whether the migration to 3.9 is worth it, or is that the purpose of this issue -- exploration?\n\nMigrating from 3.6 to 3.9 can be a hassle depending on the code base and the libraries/OS being utilized.  Could your provide further background or metrics on client usage?  Fixing tests can be trivial, but it's more important to investigate whether or not this is the right time for a migration, if there are certain features from 3.9 that would be beneficial, or if there will have to be heavy refactoring/performance implications from migrating.\n\nWilling to have a conversation to discuss if this would be an appropriate project for me to contribute to, would just like a bit of clarification on whether the migration is planned or if this is just the exploration phase.\n\nIf we are just exploring the possibility of the migration, I'm willing to write some documentation about my analysis/findings of the implications of the migration.\n\nThanks.\n\nMortan\n**3) [izn](https://gitcoin.co/izn) has applied to start work _(Funders only: [approve worker](https://gitcoin.co/issue/vyperlang/vyper/2182/100024070?mutate_worker_action=approve&worker=izn) | [reject worker](https://gitcoin.co/issue/vyperlang/vyper/2182/100024070?mutate_worker_action=reject&worker=izn))_.**\n\nI'm not sure if we need to drop 3.6 now, but I will explore the new Python 3.9 in Vyper. :)\n**4) [arbreton](https://gitcoin.co/arbreton) has been approved to start work.**\n\nTotally can check the api updates for 3.9, check the current base and update it to the new version to fully drop support for 3.6\n\nLearn more [on the Gitcoin Issue Details page](https://gitcoin.co/issue/vyperlang/vyper/2182/100024070).\n\n",
