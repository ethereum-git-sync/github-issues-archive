    "body": "I checked out Solidity and it doesn't have function argument type checking functionality either, I believe this is due to the EVM storing all data in byte code.  As far as I know there's no easy way to do type checking on the EVM side of things (e.g. b and 98 are the same in bytes).  So I closed this issue because although I think how it works is dangerous, I think it's more of a constraint with the EVM then an issue Viper.",
