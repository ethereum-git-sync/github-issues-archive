  "body": "Documentation will help Viper become more widely adopted, here's a skeleton:\r\nI've implemented the base in Sphinx in this [PR](https://github.com/ethereum/viper/pull/285)\r\n**Introduction to Viper** --> Why Viper is necessary (strong type system, clearer code, easy accessibility and extensibility of the compiler code, etc)\r\n**Installing Viper** --> Viper's still in the non-user friendly stage so it'd help to have directions that anyone can follow (`make` being the most basic etc)\r\n**Viper by Example** --> I'd probably start with `Hello world` and an explanation of the syntax etc going into it and increase complexity from there\r\n**Using the compiler** --> A step by step guide that shows someone how to turn their Viper code into byte code\r\n**Contributing** --> It'd be great to get some guidelines in order to standardize and streamline contributions\r\n@Dexaran  @yograterol  --> Obviously there's a lot more to be added but these seemed like good starting points \r\n",
