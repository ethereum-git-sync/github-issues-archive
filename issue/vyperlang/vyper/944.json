    "body": "> are there examples where security is not hugely important?\r\n\r\nScam games.\r\n\r\nI don't think that's the right distinction to draw. Solidity is simply more powerful. It allows bigger user cases and bigger apps. We only aim to be the 80% solution. Most projects will be able to choose between Solidity and Vyper, after accepting the limitations we place on them over what is acheiveable on Solidity. There is only a small subset of use cases where Vyper is not sufficient to implement.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, it comes down to personal preference. This is a good thing, multiple compilers are like multiple full nodes: having a bug in one of them is really bad but not completely catastrophic (as long as both are used about equally)",
