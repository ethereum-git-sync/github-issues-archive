  "body": "## Simple Summary\r\nRemove the builtin `RLPList` function.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nMy understanding is that this function was put in place for, and served a very specific purpose related to the ETH 2.0 deposit contract. With a specific version of Vyper forked, verified and frozen for said contract, I see no need to keep this function as a part of the language.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n1. Remove `RLPList` from `vyper/functions`\r\n2. Remove the test cases\r\n3. Remove the section in the documentation\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\nIt is a breaking change, but I highly doubt it will affect any existing projects.\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)\r\n",
