  "body": "## Simple Summary\r\nAllow statements of the form\r\n```\r\nmatch expr:\r\n  case 1:\r\n    ...\r\n  case 2:\r\n    ...\r\n  case _:\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nIt allows cleaner code in certain situations, ex. https://github.com/curvefi/curve-pool-registry/blob/b47173844836187c42724aa4468e984c1abb62e8/contracts/Swaps.vy#L572-L629. It is also available in Python(>=3.10) and people kind of expect it to be available. It also makes it slightly easier to optimize code, since the expr being matched on only needs to be evaluated one time (without any further analysis).\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\nTBD\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\nWill only work with Python3.10+, unless we switch to our custom parser. For users who are using with Python <3.10, we could conceivably just fail if a match/case statement is detected, and recommend they upgrade.\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\n## References\r\nAdd any references that this VIP might reference (other VIPs/issues, links to blog posts, etc.)\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)\r\n",
