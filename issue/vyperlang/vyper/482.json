I think this is particularly relevant for Viper given that Viper doesn't support inheritance or libraries.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\nI propose implementing a built-in function that'd look like this:\r\n```\r\ncheck_merkle_membership(root_hash, hash_being_checked, proof_of_inclusion) => bool\r\n```\r\nBehind the scenes it'd implement the functionality performed in this [smart contract](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/blob/master/contracts/MerkleProof.sol).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\nThis would be new functionality and would not introduce compatibility issues other then `check_merkle_membership` becoming a reserved.\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",
