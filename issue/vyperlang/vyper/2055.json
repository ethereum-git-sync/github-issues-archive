  "body": "## How it works now\r\nReserved keywords are checked and blocked in `parser/global_context.py` based on several lists in `utils.py`.  The check is fairly restrictive - everything is checked regardless of capitalization, and we block names such as opcodes.\r\n\r\n## How it could be refactored\r\n1. The check should be happening during type checking, in `context/validation`.\r\n2. I think some of the restrictions are a bit excessive. We should have a conversation about this, maybe at the next meeting.\r\n\r\n## Where it will go\r\nIn the node visitors in `vyper/context/validation`",
