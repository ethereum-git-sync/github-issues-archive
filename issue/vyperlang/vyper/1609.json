  "body": "Per discussion during #1583:\r\n\r\nCurrently `LLLnode` accepts a `pos` kwarg which is used for source mappings. This is typically generated via `getpos(node)`. By allowing `LLLnode` to accept an AST node directly, `pos` can still be generated and now we also have the node available - allowing us to raise more expressive exceptions.\r\n\r\nTo implement this, add another kwarg `ast_node` to `LLLNode`'s init that takes precedence over `pos` when given. Going forward we will favor the use of `ast_node` over `pos`, but won't immediately remove `pos` as it could break the code in many places at once.",
