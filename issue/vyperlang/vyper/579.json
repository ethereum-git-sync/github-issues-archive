    "body": "@fubuloubu For example, if we look at the rST source for:\r\nhttp://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/api/#requests.request\r\nin the file:\r\nhttps://github.com/requests/requests/blob/master/docs/api.rst , notice that the section describing the `requests.request` function is not filled out in detail. All that appears in the rST source is: \r\n```\r\n.. autofunction:: request\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo the description of `requests.request` appears in https://github.com/requests/requests/blob/master/requests/api.py#L17 . Also, the HTML output makes use of the Sphinx `viewcode` extension : http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/ext/viewcode.html \r\nSo if you're reading the doc and you want to read the python code, click on the link called _source_ and it displays the relevant section of the `.py` file. Sphinx resolves the line numbers and HTML refs when the docs get built.\r\n\r\n*Note:* While the excellent intro to docstrings at: http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/documentation/ makes the whole process look easy. I found that making really nice docs automatically takes some practice. The Django community has really comprehensive suggestions: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/writing-documentation/",

Since this particular line spacing issue is supposedly fixed in v2.5 it might be better to wait for that release of the theme and see if it helps.
