    "body": "@pdaian Thanks for the overview. I am not too familiar with the whole ecosystem yet, I'd love to see standardization into the EVM for this sort of service, even though I understand it is tricky. My thought was that basically Code (inner functionality) and Events (output to real world) existed, but Oracle (input from real world) is not a standardized thing. I'm sure there are a lot of discussions in that regard, but I think Viper needs this functionality as standardized at some point to be truly successful.",

A few blocks ago it succeeded. Now it would fail. How do you validate that block? It's literally impossible, you need to take the miner's (validator's) word for it that the URL returned a valid result at the time.
