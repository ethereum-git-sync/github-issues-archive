  "body": "## Simple Summary\r\nEnable a popular \"cloning\" pattern using simple forwarder proxies (e.g. `create_forwarder_to`)\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nA popular pattern with smart contracts is to create a \"cloning factory\" using 1 implementation contract that implements a construction sequence (usually deployment without initializing anything and an `initialize()` method that serves as the constructor). This can sometimes cause issues if not handled appropriately (see [`devops199`](https://github.com/openethereum/parity-ethereum/issues/6995)) by enforcing that the `initialize` method is called when deploying a clone of that contract. To avoid the potential pitfalls of failing to appropiately handle these scenarios, a methodology that \"clone-enabled\" contracts to be simply used is preferred.\r\n\r\nThe pattern in general looks like this:\r\n(requires enabling internal methods to be callable in constructors e.g. #2251)\r\n```python\r\n@internal\r\ndef _init(*args):\r\n    ... # do stuff with args\r\n\r\n@external\r\ndef __init__(*args):\r\n    self._init(*args)\r\n    # Set internal variable to prevent contract from being re-initialized\r\n\r\n@external\r\ndef init(*args):\r\n    # Additional internal check that contract is not initialized\r\n    self._init(*args)\r\n    # Set internal variable to prevent contract from being re-initialized\r\n\r\n@external\r\ndef clone(*args) -> address:\r\n    clone: address = create_forwarder_to(self)\r\n    Self(clone).init(*args)\r\n    return clone\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\nIntroduce the `@cloneable` decorator, only applicable to constructors, which wraps the above common implementation into the following macro:\r\n```python\r\n@external\r\n@cloneable  # Checks internal `initialized` variable, only on `initialize()` call\r\ndef __init__(*args):\r\n    ... # do stuff with args\r\n    # Internally set `initialized` variable to avoid re-initialization\r\n\r\n# `init(*args)`\r\n#     function that works exactly the same as `__init__` is added,\r\n#     with the additional `initialized` check\r\n\r\n# `clone(*args)`\r\n#     function that creates a forwarder proxy of this contract,\r\n#     calls `init(*args)` on it, and returns the new address\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that `clone` and `initialize` should be reserved keywords so that functions with those names cannot exist in the contract if `@cloneable` is used.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\nNo backwards incompatibilities except the `clone()` function name becomes a protected keyword\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\nNo dependencies to other VIPs\r\n\r\n## References\r\n#2251 can make this easier to implement\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",
