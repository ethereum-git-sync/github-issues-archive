  "body": "I was testing some updates I was making with one of my example contracts and I think I may have stumbled upon a bug, or at least something I don't understand why it should fail (and it's not very clear why)\r\n\r\nTo summarize, I have a contract that contains a constant method to return the balance of some map (address -> record) for the address associated with the message sender. I decided to use this function in my other functions so I didn't duplicate this access in multiple spots, basically assuming that if I called this `@constant` function, the `msg.sender` attribute would be passed to that `@constant` function. However, when I do this I get the `TransactionFailed` exception from pyethereum.\r\n\r\nHere's an example:\r\n```python\r\nfrom ethereum.tools import tester\r\nfrom viper import compiler\r\n\r\nchain = tester.Chain()\r\ntester.languages['viper'] = compiler.Compiler()\r\nchain.head_state.gas_limit = 10**9\r\n\r\ncode=\"\"\"\r\nbal: num[address]\r\n\r\ndef __init__():\r\n    self.bal[msg.sender] = 1\r\n\r\n@constant\r\ndef get_my_bal() -> num:\r\n    return self.bal[msg.sender]\r\n\r\ndef foo():\r\n    assert self.bal[msg.sender] > 0\r\n\r\ndef bar():\r\n    assert self.get_my_bal() > 0\r\n\"\"\"\r\n\r\nc = chain.contract(code, language='viper')\r\nc.get_my_bal() # Works fine\r\nc.foo() # Works fine as well\r\nc.bar() # Fails with ethereum.tools.tester.TransactionFailed()\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if I am misunderstanding how the `@constant` is supposed to be used (I am assuming you should be allowed to call `@constant` functions from other functions) (I am also assuming that implicit values such as `msg.sender` are passed to `@constant` functions as well).\r\n\r\nNot totally certain what the problem is...",
