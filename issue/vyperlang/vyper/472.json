  "body": "## Preamble\r\n\r\nVIP: 472\r\nTitle: Decorator Macros\r\nAuthor: @fubuloubu\r\nType: Standard Truck\r\nStatus: Draft\r\nCreated: 2017-11-15\r\n\r\n## Simple Summary\r\nDecorators should be implemented in Viper syntax, not LLL\r\n\r\n## Abstract\r\nReplace current decorators with macros that provide equivalent functionality using Viper syntax. These macros would be executed during a pre-processor step in the compiler. The compiler will contain an option to output the pre-processed viper code for auditing purposes, if desired.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nThis reduces compiler code complexity in the intermediate stages (LLL), and makes it simpler to implement new decorators as macros for features the community needs.\r\nOne such example is: `@updatable(user1, user2, ...)` which creates a setter for variable with the associated decorator restricted to the given addresses (or list of addresses).\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\nCreate a preprocessor step in the viper compiler that takes as input a string of viper code (containing macros) and outputs the same string to the next step in the compiler with the designed substitutions. It should do nothing other than these substitutions (e.g. no type checking, syntax checking, etc.)\r\nThese macros should be modular, easy to specify (using python triple quote syntax with format, e.g. Python 3 compliant), and clear as to their intent.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\nIt's still early, better to change the compiler structure now before we get too much further.\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)\r\n",

    "body": "Well, not all decorators have to be macros, but the advantage to rewrite them is that they'll be written in native code, and easier to understand. Public globals work like this already, and the other decorators are essentially lll macros as written (making them harder to debug). Making as many decorators as we have (and future ones) be macros for viper code snippets (instead of lll) just makes it easier to debug/audit.

    "body": "Hey, new guy here. I can't say a lot about compiler internals (yet), but I honestly, really don't like the idea of _updatable_. At all.\r\n\r\nGenerally, I think it's a bad idea to implement overly complex checks and behaviors at the language level. There is no actual need for _updatable_, as it can easily be added as a private function call. The proposed behavior is too simplistic on one side (definitely unsuitable for any DAO-ish system), and at the same time, too complex for most use cases (check if sender is contract owner or not).\r\n\r\nI think most attempts at bringing logic into the language layer would result in similar, overly restrictive and at the same time too costly designs.\r\n\r\nAnd to be honest, too many macros (well, macros in general, especially if programmers can define their own) would break Viper's core premise of \"no modifiers\". Decorators should correspond to EVM-level features such as _payable_.\r\n\r\nAlso, hardcoding Ethereum addresses in contract code, which this decorator would encourage, is an antipattern in my opinion.",
