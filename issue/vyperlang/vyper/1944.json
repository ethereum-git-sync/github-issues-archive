  "body": "## Simple Summary\r\nIt should be possible to generate an ABI from a Vyper interface.\r\n\r\nCurrently this fails with an error of \"Missing or Unmatched return statements\".\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nA Vyper interface and an ABI are essentially different formats of the same information. It should be possible to convert from one to the other.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n1. Introduce a new suffix `.vyi` to differentiate between vyper interfaces and vyper contracts.\r\n2. Encourage the use of the ellipsis `...` for the function body within interfaces.\r\n\r\nIn general - if an ABI is to be compiled from a _contract_, that contract should be compilable. If an ABI is generated from an _interface_, the compiler should recognize this and not attempt to compile it. The presence of `...`, and nothing else, within a function body, serves as an indicator that this is an interface not a contract.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\nNo issues.\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)\r\n",
