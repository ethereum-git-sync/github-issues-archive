  "body": "This is just a thought but weekly stand-ups have worked well for the snake charmers team.  What I'm thinking is that Vyper could have weekly stand-ups at a set time *instead* of the bi-weekly meetings.  The problems I see with the current meeting format are:\r\n\r\n* The meetings often get re-scheduled or the schedule is shifted back by a week.  This leads to attendees forgetting to adjust their calendars and getting out of sync with the schedule.\r\n* Meetings often last an hour or longer.  There may be a lot of things to discuss but much of the discussion could take place between individuals or in github comment threads.\r\n* If anyone misses a meeting, it's quite a while until there's another opportunity to meet.\r\n\r\nStand-up style meetings seem better because:\r\n\r\n* They're more frequent so people are encouraged more to make a place in their schedules for them.\r\n* They're shorter and don't impose as much on the participants.\r\n* It's not as big a deal if someone misses one because there's less time until the next one and it's less likely they missed out on any important exchange of information.",

    "body": "@charles-cooper Re: minutes & meeting time announcements\r\n\r\nI feel like having those two things already increases the burden of attending/organizing meetings significantly.  Keeping minutes seems to imply that meetings will last long than 10 or 15 minutes.  I already think that's too long.  Also, announcing the time for every meeting seems more complicated than just agreeing to a specific schedule and sticking to it.\r\n\r\nThere are rarely issues with the snake charmers meetings because they're always at the same time and they're always short.  There's never any confusion about when a meeting will be.  It's also easy to attend them since you know they won't last long.  You can even be in the middle of coding something and attending a stand-up is not that disruptive to your thought process.",

    "body": "@davesque @fubuloubu @charles-cooper I think part of the problems David is experiencing is that the meeting agenda isn't put up early enough, I will strive to have this in the issue list at least 3-4 days before. Also I will ensure that even if I am on holiday the meeting will by held by @fubuloubu, unless we both are on holiday - then we will just skip it (this happened over the festive season, but that just makes sense IMO). This will ensure agendas are up in time. The meeting time is actually pretty consistent, every two weeks 15:00UTC. \r\n\r\n- Additionally the next meeting ticket will be created on each call, so everyone has ample notice of scheduled the time before.\r\n- I also want us to try to use jitsi - as this doesn't require people to log in with a gmail account like Meeting/Hangouts, and no participants have to accepted into the call.\r\n\r\n",
