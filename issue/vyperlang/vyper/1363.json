  "body": "### The road to a custom parser\r\n\r\nAs we have discussed this at lengths as parts of weekly calls, this is the proposed road map to swap out the current python standard library. Also lots of discussion on github (see https://github.com/ethereum/vyper/issues/563).\r\n\r\n- [x] Step 1\r\nCreate own custom AST node classes to represent our AST:\r\n     - Quick example located at https://gist.github.com/jacqueswww/aa24d22d95a578429e0f25f5f2de0b36\r\n     - This is great for readibility and understanding what is available.\r\n     - We should only add needed fields and/or attributes support, this way no existing python syntax can slip through (*args/**kwargs for example).\r\n     - Add a translate for taking the python `ast` classes and translate the to VyperAST classes.\r\n     - Renaming classes to be less abbreviated (can bestep 1 or step2) (see https://github.com/ethereum/vyper/issues/1363#issuecomment-474883371)\r\n- [x] Step 2\r\nAfter having our own AST classes (and improving readability by seeing where nodes originate from).\r\n    - create serializer of  our AST nodes, preferably JSON (both encode & decode)\r\n    - add type annotation to each class (where appropriate)\r\n    - create a type checking step straight on the VyperAST nodes\r\n    - add any other needed AST functionality on classes directly\r\n\r\n- [ ] Step 3\r\n Implement other parses that produce or translate to VyperAST classes.\r\n    - This is quite open but allows us to choose any type of parsing library or parser generator at this point, without making vyper code generator dependant on the library.\r\n\r\n\r\n![](https://ak6.picdn.net/shutterstock/videos/3244546/thumb/1.jpg)\r\n",

Currently, they attempt to mirror the naming scheme and structure of the ASDL-derived Python AST classes as precisely as possible.\r\n\r\nAs a quick aside, Python's ASDL definitions are found [here](https://github.com/davesque/vyper_parser/blob/master/grammar.py#L161-L285).  CPython uses a specific grammar to define its collection of AST classes.  The C implementation parses the ASDL grammar and uses it to create all the AST classes using the C API.\r\n\r\nNext, I'll work on defining some routines to convert the lark parse tree into an AST composed of our custom AST classes.  Currently, I'm targeting the entire Python AST.  I think this will be useful in verifying the correctness of the implementation.  Our test routines can just compare the results of Python's native `ast.parse` function to our custom parser for all python files in the standard library.  After this is done, we can cut back the definition to just what we need.",

    "body": "Here's a fun development from today.  For the string literal parsing portion of our custom parser, I'm going to just defer to python's parsing facilities.  Parsing string literals is pretty complicated and I think we can safely just use python's parser and convert the result to a tree of our custom AST classes.  In order to do this, I needed to write some code to convert python AST trees into trees of our Vyper-specific AST classes.  Here it is: https://github.com/davesque/vyper-parser/blob/master/vyper_parser/ast.py#L59\r\n\r\nIt passes tests for all python files in my standard lib directory: https://github.com/davesque/vyper-parser/blob/master/tests/test_ast.py#L21\r\n\r\nThis is something we could potentially begin using today if we're interested in converting Vyper to using custom AST classes.  Although I'd probably recommend holding off a little longer in case I want to change some things before committing to the API that I've come up with.",

It automatically infers the proper `VyperAST` subclass to use for an instance of python's standard `ast.AST` subclasses.  It does this by automatically collecting all subclasses of `VyperAST`.  This means that someone could potentially create one of their own subclasses of `VyperAST` and get weird behavior when it happens to shadow an existing class name.

    "body": "I think this is a worthwhile investment. Many of the issues I've opened recently have to do with trying to use the Python AST while supporting syntax in Vyper that is semantically different than the node produced by the Python parser. I think it would simplify the compiler by making AST nodes single purpose, removing the need to interoperate with changes to the Python AST. It would also mitigate issues like https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/issues/3475 since a custom parser would require types and not backfill the AST of a dynamically type language with type annotations. I would imagine there's also the added benefit of no longer having to worry about anything related to Python when discussing features and syntax.\r\n",

    "body": "Definitely something we want to do, we have a Lark grammar that's been tested and a part of the core now for over a year. We haven't had issues with it for a while.\n\nThe biggest problem with custom grammar is that we would get a ton of parsing issues grieving the users, the python ast solves that by being extremely well used and debugged. Hopefully could work on switching over to it as a part of a major revision\n\nWhat's still missing is that even though the parser parses reliably, we have not yet done the work of having it produces Vyper AST nodes or checked for equivalency with the current parser\n\nThat would be next steps before we can swap it in\n(Taking any contributors)",

    "body": "> I would imagine there's also the added benefit of no longer having to worry about anything related to Python when discussing features and syntax.\r\n\r\nThis is a double edged sword, really. Actually the main reason I haven't gotten rid of the existing parser flow so far is not technical, it's that in some sense it \"keeps us honest\" -- we can't really break away from python syntax too easily.",
