    "body": "In general, I think the goal is to make Viper as easy to use as possible, and therefore harder to create buggy contracts that lose money. I think identifying the usages of assembly in Solidity and implementing features that cover said functionality in Viper have real merit. If you want to take a stab at identifying those features, that would be really great! As someone who has some experience programming embedded devices, I know the power of being able to use assembly to create fast, tight code but it is totally opening pandora's box and is very hard to test which leads to incomprehensible bugs which can lose people a lot of money!\r\n\r\nI am not a core dev however, and this project is still in the early stages of development, so I cannot speak absolutely about this feature being in or not in Viper or whether other developers believe in this more conservative design philosophy.",
