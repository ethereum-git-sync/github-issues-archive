Will take that approach for now of manual getter; though definitely agree that this feature would be nice to have in the future (would also similarly love to be able to do something like `minterType: public(constant(String[48])) = \"MinterSetPriceV1\"` in the future, though currently working around with this approach which is _fine_ just less idiomatic/readable:\r\n\r\n```\r\nMINTER_TYPE: constant(String[48]) = \"MinterSetPriceV1\"\r\nminterType: public(String[48])\r\n```",

Thank you very much for calling that out–we can work within 32, so will adjust accordingly.",
