  "body": "## Simple Summary\r\nRemove `wei_value` as a type.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nWe have two ways to denote a value as wei: `uint256(wei)` and `wei_value`. Both are `uint256` and so they are effectively identical. However, `uint256(wei)` is much more explicit. And why do we need two ways to say the same thing? IMO it's more likely to cause confusion than bring any benefit.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n* Deprecate `wei_value` in the upcoming release, and then remove it altogether in the following one.\r\n* Scrub all mention of wei_value` from the documentation and example contracts, in favor of `uint256(wei)`\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\nIt will break existing contracts, but the fix is as easy as find-and-replace.  I think that if we deprecate it for a release, it will give users plenty of time to modify their contracts.\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)\r\n",
