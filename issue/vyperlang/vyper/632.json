  "body": "In the current sharding implementation we introduce some additional opcodes: SIGHASH (https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/226), PAYGAS (https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/234), and CREATE2 (https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/224). We write user account contracts that use (some of) these opcodes with Vyper LLL. To successfully compile these contracts we currently have to monkey-patch Vyper:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom viper.opcodes import opcodes\r\nopcodes['PAYGAS'] = [0xf5, 1, 0, 0]\r\nopcodes['SIGHASH'] = [0x3f, 0, 1, 0]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile this works fine, it would be nice to have them usable from Vyper-LLL directly. At the same time, one should probably not be able to use those when compiling for Ethereum 1.0.\r\n\r\nIn the long run it might make also to make sense to add something like `tx.sig_hash` and maybe `paygas(gas_price)` to Vyper itself.\r\n\r\nI haven't created a VIP because I'm unsure of how best to do this. Two options could be to (temporarily?) create a separate sharding branch or to add a `target_protocol` flag to the compilation functions.\r\n\r\nSee also: https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/266",

    "body": "I see no problem with directly adding these opcodes right now, but in order to build implementation around them, I think there needs to be a good discussion about what they are, how they work, and what the tradeoffs could be.\r\n\r\nFor example, `PAYGAS`, based on your example implementation, looks like you need to supply the gas price to it, which means someone needs to decide what that gas price is, either hardcoded in contract method or softcoded as an input. Softcoded as an input strikes me as a potential attack vector, what if someone chooses a really large gas price (like 1 Eth/gas) for a trivial transaction that pays for it's own gas and that attacker mines it's own transaction to steal the funds from a contract. Conversely, if it is hardcoded, it won't be able to adjust to market conditions, like right now with the really high gas prices we have been facing.",

    "body": "Softcoded seems more reasonable to me. In my understanding, `PAYGAS` should be triggered only after some verifications of the transaction data is done so miner won't be able to drain the contract's fund unless he can provide valid proofs, e.g. a valid signature, in transaction data. But of course if the contract was not designed to verify the transaction before paying to miner then miner will be able to replay the same transaction to drain all the funds.",

    "body": "> @jannikluhn not sure what would be a good function name for CREATE2 we currently have a function named create_with_code_of ?\r\n\r\nThe difference between `CREATE` and `CREATE2` seems to be that `CREATE2` takes an additional salt parameter. Therefore, would it be an option to overload `create_with_code_of` (salt given --> `CREATE2`, no salt given --> `CREATE`)?\r\n\r\n@NIC619 is implementing `CREATE2` right now in https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/pull/269, maybe he's got better suggestions.",
