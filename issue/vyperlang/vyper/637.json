In vyper compiler, the key_type of map can only be base type and byte array type, which is inconsistent with the doc(https://github.com/ethereum/vyper/blob/master/docs/types.rst) : \"Here _KeyType can be almost any type except for mappings, a contract, or a struct\".\r\n\r\n2. Assume key type can only be base type and byte array type.

    "body": "Not offhand. Mapping structs maybe.\r\n\r\nI was discussing with @jacqueswww in the Gitter, I think it we should not enable larger keys by default. The writer has the option of using it via `my_mapping[sha3(A, B, ...)]`, which would be accepting the costs of this decision explicitly. Personally, I also don't like extended key sizes as it it increases the vector for a key collision attack (finding another set of objects `A, B, ...` that overwrite the key in the hashmap), which is a possibility [[check this out](https://eprint.iacr.org/2012/672.pdf)], and the risk increases when data over the key size is used. This might be paranoia, because the attack is still very difficult, but it seems like a lot of concerns for what I currently believe has little utility in practice.\r\n\r\nAnyways, we'd have to come up with a practical limit for the amount of data that can be used to generate a key in the hashmap. How would we choose that limit?",

    "body": "True, but consider this: other uses of keccak (such as a block hashing) avoid any sort of attack because not only it is very difficult to compute a reverse hash that has the right properties, but you have a limited time to do it in (e.g. 6+ confirmations in PoW is effectively final), or it is very expensive if you are discovered making the change (high cost plus multiple validators in PoS) and many other parties have copies to compare against.\r\n\r\nIn this scenario, imagine someone wrote something like this: `token_balance[sha3(owner: address, acct: uint256)]`. Then they could sit there and look at two addresses that, when concated together, gives the desired key hash and allows the attacker to take simply control of funds. This attack is still extremely expensive and impractical for some set of keysizes, but if successful there is nothing else preventing the attack from being successful. The attack surface becomes easier as the keysize is increased, in this scenario there is likely a 2nd key corresponding to completely different choices of `address` and `uint256` that map to the same hash. The paper I linked in my prior post takes 2**115 iterations to find a collision in a key space of 1600 bits (If I am reading that correctly).\r\n\r\nI'm no expert by any means in cryptographic hashes, but that part makes sense to me: you have increased chances of finding a collision for every multiple of the base keysize used for the hashmap. And with no other effective means of securing against that attack (anyone can submit transactions to a smart contract), limiting that as a default enabled feature makes sense to me because base keysize (256bit) has the smallest attack surface possible.",
