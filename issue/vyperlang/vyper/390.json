I would be very okay with that syntax even changing a bit.\r\n\r\n`bytes <= N`:\r\nI still don't like this syntax, it's very ugly and I wish it would change. I don't see a problem with `bytes[N]` where `N` is a literal, net-positive integer. the `max`/`<=` syntax always seemed cumbersome to me, exposing an underlying concern that is not directly of very much use, especially when (I believe) it still takes up `N` bytes, at least when computing gas usages.\r\n\r\nPeople don't use it very much (right now), so I wonder if making this a pre-beta change would be advisible, before we get a larger flow of people into the language using it for who knows what.",
