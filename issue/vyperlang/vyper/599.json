    "body": "While Solidity does indeed offer this feature, if you read the [documentation](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/miscellaneous.html) you'll notice this only has a benefit when dealing with arrays of shorter values, as the EVM is actually optimized for reading on 32 byte (256bit) boundaries.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this feature is typically very error prone in most compilers that implement it (C is a great example) and only has a very limited utility on processors that operate on types less than their canonical size (see 32-bit/64-bit tradeoffs, etc.)\r\n\r\nFor Viper, we haven't started relentlessly optimizing the resulting bytecode yet, and while this is definitely one strategy for doing so, for the reasons noted it's not often a highly rewarding path, so I doubt you will see this feature for quite some time.\r\n\r\nThat being said, typically there are orders of magnitude that can be gained simply from optimizing your program itself towards how the underlying processor operates (which is a 256-bit simple stack-based processor). I believe the gains from optimizing your own algorithms will be a much more effective means of reducing your gas usages, rather than doing custom things with bytearrays and such. If your gas usages are high enough as to pursue serious reductions, then there are usually many different ways of reducing your computation that would be more effective than this proposal. Code optimization is definitely an art, and one that is particularly important for the EVM due to the costs involved.\r\n\r\nIf you had a snippet of code to share that you believe to be particularly gas-intensive, we could look into the optimality of the Bytecode it produces, or suggest alternative methods for obtaining what you desire.",

The documentation does not provide any info on this subject.\r\n\r\nFor our network, storage costs are hugely important, so if we stay with viper and do not go back to solidity, we will essentially need to write a macro library to constantly translate from byte arrays to numbers.\r\n\r\nIn any case,  with ETH costs rising, IMHO you guys will need to implement a  slot-packing functionality similar to Solidity,  otherwise you will be pushing people back to Solidity.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "The argument is a bit nuanced. It will reduce size in storage, but every access to that storage location has to use special processing in order to access it, increasing gas costs for the access. Since in EVM gas is charged per access as well as per storage, I think it is not clear that the cost associated with special access outweighs the benefits of reduced storage volume unless you are dealing with structs or arrays that store multiple elements. In those cases (structs/arrays) there is definitely a clear benefit to optimizing types.",
