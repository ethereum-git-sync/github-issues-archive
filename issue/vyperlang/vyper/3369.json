    "body": "been digging into this -- apparently, the topsort order for function codegen is not stable. this means that sections of bytecode might be generated in different orders across runs (although observed behavior of the contract as a whole will be the same). the underlying reason for this seems to be, while `dict` objects guarantee insertion order since python 3.7, [`set` makes no such guarantee](https://groups.google.com/g/dev-python/c/QYwuyo_qQRE), and sets are used in computing the call graph as of 4b44ee7bcc3d9dba74329cf35436a267e4dafa8: https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/blob/4b44ee7bcc3d9dba74329cf35436a267e4dafa87/vyper/semantics/types/function.py#L126\r\n\r\nit might be possible to force the insertion order to be stable by fixing `PYTHONHASHSEED`, but the underlying fix will be to replace any uses of `set` with `OrderedSet`.",
