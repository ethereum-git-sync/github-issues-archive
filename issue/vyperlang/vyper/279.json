There are still 1-2 unimplemented features I think? #297, #295\r\n\r\nNext I would say is functional testing. I don't think we have a set of tests that visibly proves the main features are correctly implemented. We need this to ensure that subsequent releases don't break currently provided features. I wanted to work on that. 100% coverage testing is somewhat important too, being a compiler, but I wouldn't argue vital at this point.\r\n\r\nBesides a security audit, I would also argue a user experience audit would be nice to ensure all error messages are clear and precise and the language grammar is clear, easy to use, and well-documented.\r\n\r\nThoughts?",

    "body": "100% functional tests written/passed, 95% coverage (coverage is hard lol)\r\nFunctional tests need requirements, is there a good resource for the exact requirements? I only know about the following as a specific language features (besides the clearer syntax):\r\n* gas estimation\r\n* overflow/bounds checking\r\n\r\nIMO security audit and UX audit isn't required for a beta. This language compiles to bytecode, so you don't HAVE to put it into to deploy a real contract to prove that ethereum integration works. Asking people to play with viper on testnet should be the beta phase (getting comments, bugs, etc. as a result). I would say don't trust viper with real money until 1st release (not beta), which we make the security audit a necessary gate to (for 1.0.0-rc) so you don't have to redo that work. A quick breeze-through to make sure nothing we're doing is inherantly unsafe is nice though.\r\n\r\nLanding Page, use GitHub docs? Does it need something more complicated than a show of the docs and some examples?",
