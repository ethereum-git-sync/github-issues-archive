  "body": "I am finding the syntax for logs in Viper particularly confusing. To declare a log event, you do:\r\n\r\n```\r\nMyEvent = __log__(args...)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe expectation then, if you are used to other programming languages, would be that `MyEvent` becomes a top-level identifier, but instead, `MyEvent` is accessible only as a property of the magic `log` object:\r\n```\r\nlog.MyEvent(args...)\r\n```\r\nThis presents additional problems. Users may be inclined to ask what the value of the `log` object is by itself, what is the value of just `log.MyEvent`, etc.\r\n\r\nMy proposal is to just remove this dot and replace it with space, thus making `log` a keyword. Then, logging of events becomes:\r\n```\r\nlog MyEvent(args...)\r\n```\r\nThen, it becomes clear that we are accessing the MyEvent identifier declared above, and also opens the door to treating `MyEvent(args...)` as a value later on:\r\n```\r\ne = MyEvent(args...)\r\nif success:\r\n    log e\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis syntax is consistent with how you raise an exception in Python, and I believe most programmers will find it more intuitive than the current one.\r\n```\r\nraise MyException()\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Cute Animal Picture\r\n\r\n![thinkstockphotos-92911769](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/138426/32916130-dc9653f4-caf9-11e7-8e0f-841881c8632d.jpg)\r\n",
