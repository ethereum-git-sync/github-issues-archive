  "body": "## Simple Summary\r\n\r\nCurrently vyper's immutables code path is inefficient and involves two copies: code to memory, memory to memory. make it use a single copy instead.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\n<img width=\"400\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11488427/211641537-c6042744-ecaa-49f5-a319-286ba87569f1.png\">\r\n\r\nunpacking immutables seems to cost way more than constants while they should have the same code path.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nreduce number of copies such that constants and immutables are similarly performant\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nIt is backwards compatible since this is a lower level optimisation.\r\n",
