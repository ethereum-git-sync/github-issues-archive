  "body": "## Simple Summary\r\nProvide unchecked conversion functions which truncate rather than throw on out-of-bounds downcast.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nIn converting between types, you usually want the default to be a safe cast, that is, if the input type is out of bounds for the output type, issue a runtime revert. However, sometimes - particularly in serde type applications - you want to be able to truncate dirty bits. A good example is computing addresses (either the output of CREATE or CREATE2), ex. here https://github.com/pcaversaccio/snekmate/blob/f4d7d81c2ee992dda399a4ad0035ff4cb943ac21/src/utils/Create2Address.vy#L63. This example issues an unnecessary runtime check that `convert(digest, uint256) & max_value(uint160)` is in bounds, even though it is in bounds by definition.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\nTBD\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\nAll VIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The VIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities.\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\nIf this VIP depends on any other VIPs being implemented, please mention them.\r\n\r\n## References\r\nAdd any references that this VIP might reference (other VIPs/issues, links to blog posts, etc.)\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)\r\n",
