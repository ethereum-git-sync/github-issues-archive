  "body": "### What's your issue about?\r\nETH Zurich, a university in Switzerland, already has a programming language named [Viper](http://viper.ethz.ch/). On October 30th I was contacted by a member of their faculty with a request for us to change our name in order avoid potential confusion with the myriad of tools available for that project. Their project has the potential to target the Ethereum ecosystem for formal verification purposes, so a name change was important to them.\r\n\r\nOver the past month we have discussed many possible name changes, including (for posterity):\r\n* Adder/Blackadder\r\n* Anaconda\r\n* Serpent 3.0\r\n* Ophidian/Ophidiam\r\n\r\nIn the end, `vyper` was chosen as our desired project name, in order to disambiguate with the other Viper project and match our `.vy` file extension choice.\r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed?\r\nIn order to accomplish the name change, we need to do the following\r\n* Acquire project names at the various services we use e.g. PyPI, ReadTheDocs, snapcraft, etc. (Please list all below)\r\n* Change the name on GitHub\r\n* Communicate to the development community the name change, how to update git remotes, etc.\r\n* Communicate to the wider Ethereum community about the name change, and market the project in order to build recognition\r\n\r\nPlease list below if there are further concerns or comments/questions. This must be a concerted effort by our entire community in order to be successful.",
