  "body": "### The Issue\r\nWe cannot run the full test suite on Windows because of issues with `pyethash` (https://github.com/ConsenSys/ethjsonrpc/issues/5), which is a requirement for `pyevm` (https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/395).\r\n\r\n### The Solution\r\nCreate a Windows build that runs a limited set of tests to verify the functionality of the CLI.  This is the only area of the code base that touches the file system - the most likely area for cross-platform issues.\r\n\r\nOriginally discussed at https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/pull/1781#issuecomment-569515758",
