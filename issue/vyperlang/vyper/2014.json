  "body": "### What's your issue about?\r\n\r\nThe example _examples/market_maker/on_chain_market_maker.vy_ seems to have a reentrancy bug. _ethToTokens_ and _tokensToEth_ first make an external function call before they update local state variables.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this reentrancy bug is demonstrated by the following example:\r\n\r\n- _initiate_ gets called with a `token_quantity` of 20 and `msg.value` of 100.\r\n\r\n- Contract _a_ calls _tokensToEth_ with a `sell_quantity` of 40.\r\n  - This contracts will send (20 * 100) / 40 = 50 back to _a_.\r\n \t- The default function of _a_ calls now again _tokensToEth_ with a `sell_quantity` of 40.\r\n \t\t- This contracts will send again 50 back to _a_.\r\n \t\t\t- _a_ accepts now the 50 without further reentrant calls.\r\n \t\t\t- The second send to _a_ returns.\r\n \t\t- This contract updates now `totalEthQty` to 50 and `totalTokenQty` to 60.\r\n \t\t- The reentrant call returns.\r\n \t- The first send to _a_ returns.\r\n  - This contract updates now `totalEthQty` to 50 and `totalTokenQty` to 40.\r\n\r\nThe contract has now 60 Tokens and 0 ether. Therefore, the invariant does not hold anymore and `totalEthQty` as well as `totalTokenQty` do no longer model the current state.\r\n\r\n\r\nI assume that these examples just demonstrate what Vyper contracts can do, but I would rather suggest to fix such a reentrancy bug not to show case anti-patterns.\r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed?\r\nMove the call to _transfer_ at the end of _ethToTokens_ and also move _send_ at the end of _tokensToEth_.\r\n",
