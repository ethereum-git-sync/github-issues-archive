  "body": "### Version Information\r\n\r\n* vyper Version (output of `vyper --version`): 0.3.10\r\n* OS: linux\r\n* Python Version (output of `python --version`): 3.11.6\r\n\r\n### What's your issue about?\r\n\r\nThe docs for `unsafe_div` indicate it [returns zero](https://docs.vyperlang.org/en/stable/built-in-functions.html?highlight=unsafe_div#unsafe_div) on division by zero. My testing shows this documentation is matches the current implementation, but is the decision to return zero on division by zero correct? I ask only after noticing that the solidity equivalent of unchecked math division by zero has a note in the [solidity 0.8.0 change log](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.20/080-breaking-changes.html#silent-changes-of-the-semantics) that it causes a [panic error](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.23/types.html#division) and reverts. I saw some old blog post suggesting division by zero used to return zero in solidity but no longer does. Which source is used as a reference to indicate what proper EVM semantics are for this case?\r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed?\r\n\r\nLink to the EVM semantics source in the docs to give more context on what the proper behavior should be.\r\n",
