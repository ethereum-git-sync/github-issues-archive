In the example below, the value returned by `a.pop()` is used but its side effect of decreasing a's length are to be omitted.\r\n\r\nThis behavior was introduced by the fix to this [security advisory](https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/security/advisories/GHSA-3p37-3636-q8wv). As the length of the append is cached before the evaluation of the pop and stored in memory after, the new length produced by the pop which is stored in the memory is not taken into account as it is overwritten by the cached length.\r\n\r\n```\r\n@external\r\ndef foo() -> DynArray[uint256, 3]:\r\n    a: DynArray[uint256, 2] = [12]\r\n    a.append(a.pop())\r\n    return a # outputs [12, 12] while the same in python outputs [12]\r\n```\r\n\r\nh/t @trocher \r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed?\r\n\r\nFill this in if you know how to fix it.\r\n",
