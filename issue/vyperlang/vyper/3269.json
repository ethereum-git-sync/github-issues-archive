The only bit I can find is that it is available as an output option. It would be helpful to know the structure of the output as well as descriptions for the fields in the output. I know there is a `pc_pos_map` in the structure, but what else? Documenting this more will help others develop more trace-related tooling using Vyper.\r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed?\r\n\r\nIs it possible to get this to show in the Output JSON? If so, that might be a good place to describe it. Else, anything beginner-friendly where I can use the docs to learn about `source_map` as an output so I can piece together solutions in my head and on paper.",
