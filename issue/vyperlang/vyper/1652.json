  "body": "## Simple Summary\r\nAdd support for the chain ID opcode through a new environment variable\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nBeing able to know what chain a contract is located on is valuable for many different kinds of signature verification operations because it is often used as a domain separator for message signing. Creating an environment variable that queries this value means there will be no human error involved in maintaining this value within contracts, so that contracts developed on testnets don't allow replay attacks when they are deployed on the mainnet.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\nThe feature is described in full via [EIP-1344](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1344). In vyper, this should appear as the `chain.id` env var, as it is derived from the chain context of the Ethereum client that executes this call (through it's Genesis config). It should have a type of `uint256` and a gas cost of `G_base`.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\nNo backwards incompatibilities\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\nNo dependencies\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)\r\n",
