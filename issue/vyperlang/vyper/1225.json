It cannot be dynamic, so an upper bound must be established. I propose `2**256-1` or maybe `10`. I'll seed the list with a few:\r\n\r\n* Vyperista\r\n* Vyperion\r\n* Vyperian People's Front\r\n* People's Front of Vyperia\r\n* Knights With No Nil\r\n* Brian\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\nCompletely breaking change. This new and all-encompassing term will just not function with the names currently employed. As a matter of fact, _any_ use of deprecated monikers will result in an unavoidable  number of brow-beatings, puns, gifs and rolled eyes. You have been warned.\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\nHumor. Wit.
