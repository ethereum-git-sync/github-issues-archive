Trying to declare a `send` method on a contract throws the following exception: \r\n```\r\nvyper.exceptions.FunctionDeclarationException: Function name invalid: send\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed?\r\n\r\nI see three options:\r\n- Vyper changes the `send` keyword to something else.\r\n- ERC777 changes the `send` method to something else.\r\n- As @mcdee suggested in the ERC777 issue, Vyper could allow for a contract method `send` that is different from the built-in function `send`. These two would be disambiguated by the way in which they are invoked. The built-in function could retain the naked invocation `send <address, amount>`  while a method declared on the contract would be invoked with `self.send()`. From the external point of view only the contract method would be accessible.\r\n \r\n#### Cute Animal Picture\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25539605/48189251-0bca0080-e340-11e8-93e3-e26e2f80a20f.png)\r\n\r\n",

Personally, I think ERC-777 should change that in order to keep things more clear, as `send` is used both in Vyper and Solidity and I think it would be best to reserve that.\r\nI'm not sure about that but I haven't seen much usage of this currently in production so I think changing the proposed ERC should be a problem.\r\n\r\nAny thought from others here?",
