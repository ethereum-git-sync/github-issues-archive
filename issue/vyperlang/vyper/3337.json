  "body": "## Simple Summary\r\nAdd special comments to vyper code to inform the optimizer what additional optimizations it may consider \"safe\"\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nThere are certain types of optimizations that one might make to Vyper code where understanding a global relationship would improve the ability of the optimizer to optimize code. For example, in an ERC20 implementation, typically there is a relationship that `totalSupply := sum(balanceOf)` for all possible addresses, but even this is a fairly complex relationship. We can actually reduce this to a much more actionable relationship for the purposes of optimization by saying that `totalSupply >= balanceOf`, which would tell the optimizer that any increments to both values by the same number should only throw once, so it's safe to perform one of them as unchecked arithmetic.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n```vyper\r\n# @opt totalSupply >= balanceOf[*]\r\nself.totalSupply += amount\r\nself.balanceOf[receiver] += amount\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\nIt's a comment, so no issues\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\nProbably requires that the optimizer allow extensible rules\r\n\r\n## References\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)\r\n",
