  "body": "### Version Information\r\n\r\n* vyper Version (output of `vyper --version`): 0.2.7+commit.0b3f3b3\r\n* OS: osx\r\n* Python Version (output of `python --version`): Python 3.6.10\r\n\r\n### What's your issue about?\r\n\r\nAccording to the example in the [documentation](https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/blob/60dfc974addc62720207771969aaadd8e5720ae4/docs/built-in-functions.rst), if an address is extracted using `extract32` only the necessary 20 bytes have to be provided. At least this is what I interpret from this example.\r\n\r\nBut if I understand the implementation correctly, `extract32` always needs a `Bytes` list `b` with at least 32 elements. The `start` determines from where on the 32 elements are extracted. But if `len(b) - start` is less than 32, `extract32` reverts.\r\nTherefore, the example in the documentation should revert and not output a result.\r\n\r\nAlso, why does `start` have an `int128` type? As far as I can tell, `extract32` always reverts if `start` is negative.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, is it correct that  e.g. for addresses if the 12 MSB are not zero the `extract32` reverts, similarly to `convert`?\r\n",
