    "body": "Hey folks.  This is one of the python devs with the foundation.  I'm currently trying to add both the Solidity `fixed` type and the Vyper `decimal` type to our ABI library: https://github.com/ethereum/eth-abi/pull/49\r\n\r\nAs people have noted, the `fixed168x10` type is the correct equivalent but @axic said this is a problem.  Can anyone give me an idea of how much of a problem this is or how exactly it might lead to issues?  Currently, my plan is to just treat `decimal` values the same as `fixed168x10` values but I'd like to know if I need to do any special bounds checking or overflow handling.  Would love to hear people's insights into that.",

    "body": "> For what it's worth, I'm not sure how much discussion was had on the byte size itself: fixed256x10 could be just as reasonable a choice.\r\n\r\nI had the same feeling on that.  Since the true bounds of `decimal10` (which are `[-2^127, 2^127 - 1]`) are already not honored by the `fixed168x10` type, would it make sense to just use `fixed256x10` as @DavidKnott suggested earlier in this thread?  Is there any reason to artificially cap the possible values to 168 bits?",
