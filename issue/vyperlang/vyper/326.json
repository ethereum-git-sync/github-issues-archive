    "body": "I'm too cheap to have a Mac, never used one lol. But to me it seems like the virtualenv isn't working properly if it's getting requirements from Python2.7 since there's a Python3.5 package available in pypi it should prefer. I'm still no expert at virtual environments, I've made a few mistakes like this. For viper on my Ubuntu Linux 16.04 install I've had to roll my own python3.6 as described in the installation doc, and the only extra thing I do is create a symbolic link to python3.6 in the folder where all the python symbolic links live. You should get no references to any system libraries, or Python2.7 at all if the virtual env is installed correctly. Maybe the OSX virtualenv experience has some extra weirdness to it?\r\n\r\nYou did remember to source the activation script, right?",
