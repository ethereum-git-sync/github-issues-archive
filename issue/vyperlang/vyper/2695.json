But developers may think of them more like storage variables (which can only be assigned to in the constructor), see https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/issues/2554. So we may want to have them in the `self` namespace.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\nexample:\r\n```vyper\r\nfoo: immutable(uint256)\r\ndef __init__(x: uint256):\r\n    self.foo = x\r\n\r\ndef bar() -> uint256\r\n    return self.foo\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\nAll VIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The VIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities.\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\nIf this VIP depends on any other VIPs being implemented, please mention them.\r\n\r\n## References\r\nAdd any references that this VIP might reference (other VIPs/issues, links to blog posts, etc.)\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)\r\n",

    "body": "I second this as it's apparently how most people think about `immutable`s (assign them like storage variables), and it makes `immutable` modules more consistent as you always have to prepend it with either the modules name or the `self` namespace. One request I would have, is that it should be possible (for certain use cases) to assign an `immutable` variable outside of the ctor like the following:\r\n\r\n```vyper\r\n# pragma version ^0.3.10\r\n\r\n_CACHED_SELF: immutable(address) = self\r\n\r\n@external\r\ndef __init__():\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat I however don't fully understand wrt consistency is that `constant`s are not prepended. I understand that they don't require module instantiation, but that's not obvious to 90% of the people, and many people will ask themselves (or even use `self.SOME_CONSTANT` before hitting a compiler raise) why there is no `self` namespace for `constant`s. While the argument for not using `self` for `constant` is technically correct, I'm not sure whether it's the best devex.",
