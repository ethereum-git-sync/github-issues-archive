Please let me know what you think and if you would suggest any other chapters to be added. \r\n\r\nIn order to avoid duplicate work please post below if you are working on anything at the moment and I will edit the list above to reflect that.\r\n\r\n#### Cute Animal Picture\r\nDogumentation is important!<sup><sup>sorry</sup></sup>\r\n![](http://i.barkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/o-DOG-READING-A-BOOK-facebook.jpg?q=70&fit=crop&crop=entropy&w=808&h=500)\r\n",
