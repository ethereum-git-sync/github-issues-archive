  "body": "## Simple Summary\r\nThe `raw_call` builtin function should handle both `gas` and `outsize` as optional arguments, using the following defaults:\r\n\r\n1. `gas`: `gasLeft`\r\n2. `outsize`: `0`\r\n\r\nThis is an extension of #1879\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n### `gas`\r\nIn the majority of cases, the desired effect in a `raw_call` is to forward all remaining gas. To me this feels intuitive, even expected. I don't think it should require an explicit declaration.\r\n\r\n### `outsize`\r\n`outsize` is necessary for type checking when the result of a `raw_call` is assigned to a variable, but in cases where the result isn't stored it feels unnecessary.  I think that we should use a default value of `0`. In this case we can internally return `None`, which raises if assigned to any variable.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\nChange the syntax in the following manner:\r\n\r\n#### Current\r\n```python\r\n# sending all gas, no assignment of return value\r\nraw_call(receiver, b\"foo\", 0, msg.gas)\r\n\r\n# declaring gas forwarded and outsize\r\nbar: bytes[32] = raw_call(receiver, b\"foo\", 32, 50000)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Proposed\r\n```python\r\n# sending all gas, no assignment of return value\r\nraw_call(receiver, b\"foo\")\r\n\r\n# declaring gas forwarded and outsize\r\nbar: bytes[32] = raw_call(receiver, b\"foo\", outsize=32, gas=50000)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe syntax for the default behavior looks much cleaner, and the advanced use is more explicit and so easier to understand.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\nThis VIP reverses the breaking change that would be caused by #1879.\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)\r\n",
