  "body": "* VIP: 818\r\n* Title: Add support for specifying byte array lengths when decoding RLPLists\r\n* Author: Mike Keen\r\n* Type: Standard Track\r\n* Status: Draft\r\n* Created: 2018-05-11\r\n\r\n### Simple Summary\r\nVyper's RLP implementation does not currently support specifying a length for byte arrays while decoding, resulting in too many bytes being allocated for byte arrays when decoding them from RLP. I suggest an enhancement which would allow an implementer to specify a fixed size for byte arrays while decoding RLP data. I am willing to explore implementing this. But would like some feedback on this first.\r\n\r\n### Abstract\r\n`_RLPList` currently does not allow for RLP `bytes` members' lengths to be specified when decoding. This works:\r\n\r\n    encoded_message: bytes <= 1024 = ...\r\n    values = RLPList(encoded_message, [int128, bytes32, int128, int128, bytes])\r\n    sig: bytes <= 1024 = values[4]\r\n\r\nThis does not work:\r\n\r\n    encoded_message: bytes <= 1024 = ...\r\n    values = RLPList(encoded_message, [int128, bytes32, int128, int128, bytes])\r\n    sig: bytes <= 934 = values[4]\r\n\r\nThis also does not work:\r\n\r\n    encoded_message: bytes <= 1024 = ...\r\n    values = RLPList(encoded_message, [int128, bytes32, int128, int128, bytes <= 934])\r\n    sig: bytes <= 934 = values[4]\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of this line...\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/vyper/blob/0d92d86752bcfca875e042cec6048488db3d479c/vyper/functions/functions.py#L431\r\n\r\n...Vyper simply allocates the same number of bytes for `bytes` members as was allocated for the `ByteArrayType` that represents the entire encoded message. This means if the whole encoded message's `ByteArrayType` has a `maxlen` of 1024 bytes, then every `bytes` member will get 1024 bytes when they are decoded.\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nIn researching [another issue](https://github.com/ethereum/casper/issues/110), I found the behavior described above.\r\n\r\nI think the ability to enforce a size for byte arrays in this context is syntactically desirable and I also think that allocating definitively too much memory for anything is undesirable long term behavior.\r\n\r\n### Specification\r\n\r\nI propose supporting the following syntax:\r\n\r\n    encoded_message: bytes <= 1024 = ...\r\n    values = RLPList(encoded_message, [int128, bytes32, int128, int128, bytes <= 934])\r\n    sig: bytes <= 934 = values[4]\r\n\r\nThis will require modifying the following logic:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/vyper/blob/0d92d86752bcfca875e042cec6048488db3d479c/vyper/functions/functions.py#L430-L438\r\n\r\nCurrently, passing in a spec for a fixed size such as `[int128, bytes32, int128, int128, bytes <= 934]` results in the following being executed:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/vyper/blob/0d92d86752bcfca875e042cec6048488db3d479c/vyper/functions/functions.py#L435\r\n\r\nSo, this logic...\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/vyper/blob/0d92d86752bcfca875e042cec6048488db3d479c/vyper/functions/functions.py#L434\r\n\r\n...would need to be made more robust, to support the proposed byte size annotation\r\n\r\nI'm certain that in the course of implementing this, other structural items in `_RLPList` will need to be touched.\r\n\r\nWill need to add at least one new test.\r\n\r\n### Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nI propose still supporting the following (works today) syntax...\r\n\r\n    encoded_message: bytes <= 1024 = ...\r\n    values = RLPList(encoded_message, [int128, bytes32, int128, int128, bytes])\r\n    sig: bytes <= 1024 = values[4]\r\n\r\n...in addition to what I propose adding. This would keep existing behavior in-tact while exposing the enhanced behavior I am proposing.\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",
