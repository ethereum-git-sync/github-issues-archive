  "body": "## Preamble\r\n\r\nVIP: #641\r\nTitle: Restrict functions that return to be `@constant`\r\nAuthor: @fubuloubu\r\nType: Standard\r\nStatus: Draft\r\nCreated: 2018-01-22\r\n\r\n## Simple Summary\r\nEnforce only `@constant` methods can return. Non-`@constant` methods should use Logs instead.\r\n\r\n## Abstract\r\nIn web3, if you make a state-changing transaction, the API will return the transaction hash for that transaction instead of any return values. After the transaction is accepted, the logs may be used for state feedback and/or further processing (via promises/callbacks). It typically isn't helpful for a computed variable to be returned in a state-changing function because of this, instead preferable to use Logs to maintain computed variables (so as to leverage the promise/callback techniques that Web3 provides for Logs). Let's make this the explicit way Vyper handles things.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nThis will simplify how to write different kinds of methods so it is more obvious how the method should be used. From a usage perspective, this will eliminate any issues with trying to use the return values from a transacted method, enforcing the use of Logs for that purpose.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\nPretty straightforward, if it has a return type and is not marked `@constant` throw a compiler error.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\nThis is not backwards compatible if anyone was using non-`@constant` methods to return before.\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)\r\n",
