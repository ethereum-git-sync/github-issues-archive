  "body": "Structs containing dynamically sized types (string, bytes) are not fully supported in vyper.\r\n\r\nThe following actions fail to compile and produce exceptions that are not immediately obvious:\r\n\r\n* An argument in an external function call\r\n* An argument in an internal function call\r\n* An input argument for function - but only if you attempt to access the dynamically sized data\r\n\r\nThe following actions _are_ supported:\r\n\r\n* returning from an internal function\r\n* returning from an external function\r\n\r\nAs a temporary measure I've added a better exception during type checking (https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/pull/2189). It covers all of the not-possible cases given above.  Going forward though, I think we should add support for these structs in the places where they aren't working.",
