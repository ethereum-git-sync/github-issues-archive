This is useful for name resolution and would make it easier to create something like a Vyper LSP. While Vyper prevents many instances of shadowing that would make name resolution ambiguous, this additional info would further disambiguate issues outlined like those in https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/issues/3582 and https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/issues/3581.\r\n\r\nFurther, all ids of contracts and other declaration AST nodes must be unique for the entire compilation unit i.e. all contract ids, function defs, struct defs, etc should be unique.\r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed?\r\n\r\nAdd reference declaration field to each use of identifiers (`Name` AST nodes).",
