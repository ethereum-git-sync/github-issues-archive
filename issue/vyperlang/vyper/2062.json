  "body": "> Note: will try refactoring out `vyper/signature` in favor of adding `ContractFunctionType.to_abi` ABI serializer, and replacing all uses of `vyper/signature` in `vyper/parser` in another PR (see https://github.com/fubuloubu/vyper/tree/refactor/abi-serializer)\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @fubuloubu in https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/pull/2054#issuecomment-650682785_\r\n\r\n## How it works now\r\n`vyper/signatures` handles the creation of signatures for functions and events, and generates the ABI. This logic is all fairly dependent upon `GlobalContext`.\r\n\r\n## How it could be refactored\r\nThis logic could be moved into methods within `ContractFunction` and `Event` in the new `vyper/context` subpackage.  The use of `GlobalContext` can be replaced with `Namespace`.\r\n\r\n## Why this is an improvement\r\n* This is a good first step toward removing `GlobalContext`\r\n* It allows us to remove the requirement that functions only call upward (this is happening in `signatures/function_signature.py`)\r\n* It's a good first step in feeling out how well `Namespace` fits where `GlobalContext` used to be",
