This is something that Solidity has done poorly and it creates a lot of complexity in the AST especially as the language has evolved and expressions like `X.Y` can represent a whole host of constructs. Below is an example of several instances of this in Vyper. In order to resolve shadowing like `self.caller = caller`, it requires keeping track of context like the namespace is `self` rather than just explicitly distinguishing that this is a reference to a state variable. Accessing attributes of `self` like `balance` and `address` could also be made distinct from variables or fields by creating a unique representation in the AST. This eliminates a lot of special casing, branching, and other complexities required in consumers of the AST by representing precisely info the Vyper has already gathered during compilation.\r\n\r\n```vyper\r\ninterface X:\r\n    pass\r\n\r\ncaller: address\r\n@external\r\ndef __default__():\r\n     caller: addres = msg.sender\r\n     self.caller = caller\r\n     amt: uint256 = self.balance\r\n     where: address = X(self).address\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed?\r\n\r\nMake field access distinct from referring to state variables or calls like `SELFBALANCE` and `ADDRESS`\r\n",
