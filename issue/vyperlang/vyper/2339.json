We use `from` when importing something.\r\n\r\nI encountered this problem when translating CryptoPunkMarket's Solidity code to Vyper code. This is the Solidity code:\r\nhttps://github.com/larvalabs/cryptopunks/blob/master/contracts/CryptoPunksMarket.sol\r\n\r\nThey used `from` field in some of their events.\r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed?\r\n\r\nIt's not a big problem for me. I can use different name, such as `from_`. If we are going to fix this, we need some different syntax. Something like namedtuple could solve this problem\r\n\r\n```python\r\nTransfer = Event(\"Transfer\", {\"from\": \"address indexed\", \"to\": \"address indexed\", \"value\": \"uint256\"})\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut in real Python, it will throw an exception when we put keyword as field in namedtuple. But it's weird that in Vyper we cannot have `from` field for event, but in Solidity we are able to do that.\r\n\r\nDo we need to maintain some sort of compatibility with our cousin, Solidity?\r\n",

Solidity people created EIP Event with datafield `for`, and I guess they will learn their lesson when someone would propose EIP Event with datafields `fallback` and `abstract` 😈 \r\n\r\nI've seen similar-ish issue in ORMs, where database column name had same value as method of basic object (`hash`).\r\n\r\nBasically my argument is that EVM logging may be produced and consumed with many languages, therefore not being able to use language keywords in event datafield names is a suboptimal choice.\r\n\r\nPersonally I am from **Ruby** crowd, and I _know_ that I may have a hash with every keyword as a key:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n{class: 'hmm', module: 'well', if: 'sure', break: 'np'}\r\n```\r\nalso I fail to grasp (reject) relevance of Pytnon syntax here,\r\nas the whole idea of having own grammar is kinda about ... having your own grammar,\r\nIt really looks like a usual case of grammar ambiguity (maybe LALR-related).",
