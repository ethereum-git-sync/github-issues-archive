  "body": "## Simple Summary\r\n\r\nVyper 0.3.7 added an option to disable metadata in bytecode.  However, this option seems to only be available as a command-line flag, and not via JSON input.  (If it is available via the latter, it's not documented.)  This option should be available via JSON input, or, if it already is, it should be documented in the \"Compiling a Contract\" page.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nAll compilation options that affect the bytecode output should be available via JSON input so that programs that need to invoke the compiler on specified text sources have access to all compilation options.\r\n\r\n(E.g., in Truffle, we often download sources from Etherscan or Sourcify and then compile them, and it's important that we use exactly the same settings that were used to compile them originally; if we can't do this via the JSON input, we have a problem.  Mind you, we don't yet do this for Vyper, but we're intending to eventually!)\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nThere should be no issues with backwards compatibility.",
