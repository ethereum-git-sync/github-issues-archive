  "body": "### What's your issue about?\r\n\r\nLet's say I want to make sure my auction starts at exactly 11PM UTC tomorrow. Following the example at https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/blob/v0.2.3/examples/auctions/simple_open_auction.vy it seems I would have to be poised to deploy my smart contract to the EVM at roughly 10:59PM UTC tomorrow (plus/minus my best estimate of how long it will take for my smart contract to be \"accepted\"). I would rather deploy it in advance and know that it is sitting there waiting to be activated at an exact moment.\r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed?\r\n\r\nThe example code does instantiate a `self.auctionStart` variable, but it appears to be unused. Shouldn't the `bid()` function in the example be checking that the bid is _between_ the start and end times? It currently just checks that it is before the end time. Otherwise it seems if I deploy my auction contract in advance following the example, bids can be submitted before the intended start time. Am I missing something?",
