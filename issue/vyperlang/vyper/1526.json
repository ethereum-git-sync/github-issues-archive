  "body": "### Version Information\r\n\r\n* vyper Version (output of `vyper --version`): Source: `0.1.0b10`, PyPI: `0.1.0b10`\r\n* OS: osx\r\n* Python Version (output of `python --version`): Python 3.6.8\r\n* Environment (output of `pip freeze`): [Not super relevant to my issue, but here](https://gist.github.com/CarlBeek/91dcdf4994f2ee4b98e1b2591c369451)\r\n\r\n### What's your issue about?\r\n\r\nWhen building Vyper from source and using PyPI the compiler versions are different. Obviously this is the case, as changes are applied to master (and thus master is not really at version `0.1.0b10` despite what `version` says), but it caught myself and the team at RuntimeVerification off guard when formally verifying the [Eth2.0 deposit contract](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/tree/dev/deposit_contract).\r\n\r\nThere is nothing explicitly wrong with how things are currently handled, but I feel like it is bad dev-ex to run into this issue (especially considering the nature of code being compiled by Vyper). In addition, note that many projects are going to use PyPI for installation which does not provide a commit-hash (which is ridiculous IMO) so comparing versions is harder than it needs to be. (Also downloading source-code from PyPI doesn't give the `.git` folders, so checksums don't match either.)\r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed?\r\n\r\n- I think changes to master should be committed to a `dev` branch (or some similar branch) or `version` should point to `0.1.0b10-dev` or similar.\r\n- A further suggestion: in your build instructions, I recon it would be nice if it recommended (optionally) checking out a tag first before running `make`.",

    "body": "My (stupid) story about this.\r\n\r\nI've tried to compile the `0.1.0b10` version from the source, but made a mistake of running `make` on the master (the default one given by the git-clone), so I did `make clean`, checkout the tag `v0.1.0-beta.10`, and did `make` again.  Seeing that `vyper --version` shows `0.1.0b10`, I just assumed that I installed the correct version.  But I found that the bytecode generated by my vyper compiler is different from [the one released in the Eth2.0 repo](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/deposit_contract/contracts/validator_registration.json), and I couldn't find my mistake (forgetting `pip3 uninstall vyper` when `make clean`) quite for a while.\r\n\r\nHere is the list of commands to reproduce it:\r\n```\r\n$ python3.6 -m venv ~/vyper-env\r\n$ source ~/vyper-env/bin/activate\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/ethereum/vyper.git\r\n$ cd vyper\r\n$ make\r\n$ make clean    #### but forgot: \"pip3 uninstall vyper\"  :(\r\n$ git checkout v0.1.0-beta.10\r\n$ make\r\n$ vyper --version\r\n0.1.0b10        #### but this is not the correct one\r\n```\r\n\r\nMore detailed information in `vyper --version` would be really helpful to debug/communicate in the future.

When looking at the IRs between the two versions, there do seem to be a bunch of simplifications in the new version. I'm definitely keen to switch over to b11, but I think that is largely dependent on how much work that would require being redone by the RV team, @daejunpark what are your thoughts?",
