  "body": "Per #2072, we are performing overflow checks on exponentiation as long as either the base or power is a literal value.  We still need to implement these checks in the case where both values are unknown at compile time.\r\n\r\n> Took a hand at (3) using the link @michwill sent: https://github.com/fubuloubu/integer-exponential. Looks like it takes 10994 gas in the `uint256` case, and 9575 gas in the `int128` case (one less round required). The calls normally take 558 gas and 752 gas respectively (no idea why `uint256` is cheaper here), so about a 10x-20x markup for this most general case\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @fubuloubu in https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/issues/1684#issuecomment-650891094_\r\n\r\nThe arithmetic leg-work is done here, we just need to implement and test it.
