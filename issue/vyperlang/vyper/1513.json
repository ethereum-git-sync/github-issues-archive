  "body": "I looked through the documentation article for built-in functions ([here](https://github.com/ethereum/vyper/blob/1acb781ea9861441cb565201bd9a9fbff9e32eff/docs/built-in-functions.rst)) and the format is a bit confusing.  The article uses a kind of ad hoc docstring style that mimics the sphinx docstring format but doesn't really adhere to it.  It also specifies each function as an inline code block.  Seems like we should be using the sphinx reStructureText API as seen [here](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/usage/quickstart.html#documenting-objects) to get nicely formatted, linkable entries in the documentation.\r\n\r\n_Converted from comment by @davesque in https://github.com/ethereum/vyper/pull/1437#issuecomment-507814359_",
