  "body": "### What's your issue about?\r\n\r\nInconsistency in checking invalid cases in `compile_lll.py`.\r\n\r\nFor the `with` variable lookup, it rejects immediately when the `with` statement is too deep:\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/viper/blob/b1fe12ddd8706ef3340a103916e3d3f2cc95ceef/viper/compile_lll.py#L50-L54\r\nbut for the `with` variable update, it does not check at all, which may lead to generate an invalid/wrong opcode (e.g., if the depth is 17, then internally it will generate `SWAP17` (doesn't exist) that will end up being encoded as `0xa0`, which is `LOG0`):\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/viper/blob/b1fe12ddd8706ef3340a103916e3d3f2cc95ceef/viper/compile_lll.py#L55-L60\r\n\r\nHowever, I couldn't find an example program that leads to such a deep `with` statement. It might not be possible at this moment, but it would be good to fix for later.\r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed?\r\n\r\nAdd the following check in the case of `code.value == \"set\"`:\r\n```\r\n     if height - withargs[code.args[0].value] > 16: \r\n         raise Exception(\"With statement too deep\") \r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Cute Animal Picture\r\n\r\n```\r\n       \\/)/)\r\n     _'  oo(_.-. \r\n   /'.     .---'\r\n /'-./    (\r\n )     ; __\\\r\n \\_.'\\ : __|\r\n      )  _/\r\n     (  (,.\r\n   mrf'-.-'\r\n```\r\n",
