  "body": "## Simple Summary\r\nDisallow using the `msg` context in public functions which are called internally.\r\n\r\n## Abstract\r\nThis is kind of a follow-up to the discussion in https://github.com/ethereum/vyper/issues/901. The currently implemented behavior is to disallow `msg.sender` in private functions, forcing the caller to pass it as an explicit function argument. The behavior proposed here is to extend this restriction to public functions which are called internally, and also to extend it to the entire `msg` context. If a user really wants to call an internal `@public` function which accesses the `msg` context, they are forced to refactor the function to pass `msg.sender` explicitly (and optionally change it to `@private`).\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n`msg.sender` can have different values depending on if the function call is generated from an external caller or an internal caller. For instance,\r\n```python\r\n@public\r\ndef call1() -> address:\r\n  return msg.sender\r\n@private\r\ndef call2(addr: address) -> address:\r\n  return addr  # Can't access `msg.sender` here, must pass as arg\r\n@public\r\ndef call3() -> address:\r\n  return call1()\r\n@public\r\ndef call4() -> address:\r\n  return call2(msg.sender)\r\n```\r\nIn this example, `call1` and `call4` return the address of the caller, but `call3` returns the address of this contract. This goes against Vyper's principle of auditability since extra context needs to be reasoned about when reading code. This proposal would force the above implementation of `call1` to be changed to pass `msg.sender` as an argument, mimicking `call2`.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the current behavior is an extra point of confusion for users coming from Solidity because Vyper's `@public` is more analogous to Solidity's `external` keyword than Solidity's `public` keyword (Solidity has a fine-grained distinction between `public` and `external` - `public` uses a jump which does not change the `msg` context, while `external` uses a message call).\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\nIn addition to disallowing `msg.sender` in private functions, additionally disallow any `msg` values (off the top of my head: `msg.sender`, `msg.value`, proposed `msg.data`) in internal calls to public functions by raising an exception.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n`msg.sender` and friends are no longer allowed in public functions which are called internally.\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)\r\n",
