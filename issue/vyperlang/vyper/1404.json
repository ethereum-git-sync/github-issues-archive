  "body": "Explore adding symbolic analysis test cases (such as [mythril](https://github.com/ConsenSys/mythril-classic) or [manticore](https://github.com/trailofbits/manticore)) for more complex internal features provided by the compiler (such as those in [here](https://github.com/ethereum/vyper/blob/master/vyper/functions/functions.py))\r\n\r\nThis has the benefit of providing super-strong verification that these complex internal features are properly implemented. These features should be small enough to be practical with this approach, although they might not work well in CI due to their operation time. Although, it might be interesting to make these available to developers through a plugin system or external API so they can verify code themselves.",
