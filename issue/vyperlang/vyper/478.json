Currently the assert statement in Viper produces a an invalid jump, draining all gas.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\nSyntax wise assert statys exactly the same:\r\n```python\r\ndef test(x: num) -> bool:                                                                                                                                           \r\n    assert x > 0                                                                                                                                                    \r\n    return True \r\n```\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\nPrevious Dapps or contracts that assumed gas will completely spent after a failed assert, will now receive gas back. It doesn't effect compatibility much, as viper isn't used in production yet.\r\n\r\n## References\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/eips/issues/140\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)\r\n",
