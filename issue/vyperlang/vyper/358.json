This extend to arrays very easily. Probably much more complex to implement, but the resulting code can be much more reader/writer friendly (we can implement much more straightforward looping constructs maintaining the gas estimate guarantee).",

    "body": "My bad, we know UTF-8 is dynamic but max 4 bytes, so we could do something like `string(N) := (bytes <= 4)[N]` (I didn't think of that initially, so UTF-8 can work that way). I mentioned UTF-32 since it would take the same number of reserved bytes (since EVM doesn't tightly pack storage anyways), for compatibility's sake using UTF-8 is smarter.\r\n\r\nYes, `string(N)` is syntactic sugar. I think `bytes(N) := bytes <= N` should only be reserved for working with generic raw data (e.g. pass-through of the data arg).\r\n\r\nA string type would open the doors to more standard string functions like find/replace per character (if a 2/4-byte Unicode character was chosen, then find/replace per byte wouldn't work), `strip()`, `substr()`, etc.",
