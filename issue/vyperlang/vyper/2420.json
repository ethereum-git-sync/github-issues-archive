  "body": "## Simple Summary\r\n\r\nI am porting code from solidity. the underlying cause of this is that vyper does not allow for 2 functions with the same name, but different arguments (NamespaceCollision: Member 'foo' already exists in address).\r\n\r\n`'foo' is a storage variable, access it as self.foo`\r\n\r\n`CallViolation: Cannnot call external functions via 'self'`\r\n\r\nfoo is a function, not a variable.  I assume what this means is that if I want a function that is accessible both as internal and external I need two functions and one calling the other?\r\n\r\nsince there is no override for functions both internal and external a solution is the following, but not exactly pretty.\r\n\r\n```\r\n@external\r\ndef fooExternal():\r\n    return self.fooInternal\r\n\r\n@internal\r\ndef fooInternal():\r\n    return 42\r\n```",
