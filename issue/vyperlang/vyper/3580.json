Instead, there should be a type conversion node that converts `x` to type `Test`. Additionally, the Hex literal `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000` should have have a type conversion to `address` as it could also be `bytes20`. Representing these semantics explicitly will increase the accuracy of tools that attempt to model Vyper's semantics faithfully.\r\n```vyper\r\ninterface Test:\r\n    def foo() -> (int128, uint256): nonpayable\r\n\r\n@internal\r\ndef foo() -> (int128, int128):\r\n    return 2, 3\r\n\r\n@external\r\ndef bar():\r\n    a: int128 = 0\r\n    b: int128 = 0\r\n    (a, b) = self.foo()\r\n\r\n    x: address = 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\r\n    c: uint256 = 0\r\n    a, c = Test(x).foo()\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed?\r\n\r\nCreate explicit type conversion nodes in the AST",
