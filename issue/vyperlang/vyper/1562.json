  "body": "### The Issue\r\n\r\nVyper docs are building, but many warnings are raised and some of the warnings mean the docs aren't displaying as intended.\r\n\r\nWhen I run the following commands:\r\n\r\n`sphinx-build -b html docs dist/docs` - \"build succeeded, 11 warnings\"\r\n`sphinx-build -b linkcheck docs dist/docs` - \"build finished with problems, 10 warnings.\"\r\n\r\nThe issues are most visible within [Vyper by Example](https://vyper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/vyper-by-example.html).  Code samples are meant to be added using the `:pyobject:` option within the `:literalinclude:` directive, but because Vyper code isn't proper Python syntax, the includes fail.\r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed?\r\n* Replace all `:pyobject:` mentions with `:lines:` that will build properly\r\n* Fix broken/forwarding links\r\n* Add another environment in `tox.ini` that tests the docs by building them\r\n\r\nI'm happy to work on all of this, but thought it best to get feedback/blessings first, specifically re: the modification to `tox.ini`",
