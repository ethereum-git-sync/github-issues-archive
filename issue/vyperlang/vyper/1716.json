Given this is a fairly fundamental variable when writing Vyper contracts, it deserves some proper documentation.\r\n\r\nRelated, re: https://github.com/ethereum/vyper/issues/1696, we should very clearly document that Vyper disallows external calls back into the same contract, the rationale behind this, and (once the issue is closed), how to perform this action via `raw_call`.",
