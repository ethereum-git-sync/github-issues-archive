  "body": "### What's your issue about?\r\nI tried implementing the ERC827 proposed standard using Vyper but when I tried to implement the new version for transfer presented in it I encountered this error: \r\n``Duplicate function or event name: transfer`` even though the parameters were different. It also happens even if the return type is different. I think it's a bug but if it was done intentionally I think we should change it since overloading is very useful and will probably become a part of more standards which in the end Vyper will have to support.\r\n\r\n#### Cute Animal Picture\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10667901/38142101-c46f78d8-3443-11e8-958c-d02e09ddb04f.png)\r\n\r\n",

But it introduces that extra bit of possible branching that make it unclear at call time what is happening, and what are the consequences there of.\r\n\r\nFor a smart contract use case, I believe even more than on a general programming use case.

Thus it's easier to write missleading code (foo(\"hello\") logs \"hello\" but foo(\"hello\", \"world\") steals you funds). Another problem with function overloading is that it makes the code much harder to search through as you have to keep track on which call refers to which function.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFunction overloading makes code EASIER to search through in the case that the API designer has appropriately named functions.
