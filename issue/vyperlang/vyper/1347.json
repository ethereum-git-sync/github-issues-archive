  "body": "## Simple Summary\r\n\r\nAs vyper adds new *built-in* functions and reserved words there will be an increased likelihood of name collision in user code.  Support for namespacing new built-ins will remedy this issue by reducing the number of names in the top level namespace.\r\n\r\n## Abstract\r\n\r\nVyper needs some version of what python calls, the \"standard library\".  A set of *modules* that are available by default for any Vyper contract to import and use, but which **are not** available in the global namespace by default.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nThe motivation for this comes from seeing multiple VIPs that introduce new top-level namespace variables. \r\n\r\n- https://github.com/ethereum/vyper/issues/1266 function `sqrt`\r\n- https://github.com/ethereum/vyper/issues/1277 decorators `funds`, `credit`, `debit`\r\n- https://github.com/ethereum/vyper/issues/1086 functions `bigadd`, `bigmul`, `bigdiv`, `bigmod`\r\n\r\nAll of these are names that a user *could* have already created in their contracts.  By adding these to the top level namespace, we will 1) reduce the number of available names a user may use in their contract code and 2) cause breakage in existing code that already uses one of these names.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nI propose introducing an importable standard library to vyper.\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom math import sqrt\r\nfrom accounting import funds, credit, debit\r\nfrom bigmath import bigadd, bigmul, bigdiv, bigmod\r\n```\r\n\r\nSimilar to python, I propose we define a `builtins` module that contains all of the functions which are available by default in the global namespace.  The vyper compiler would treat every vyper file as-if it had imported all of the top-level names from the `builtins` module.\r\n\r\nAny functions that are currently in the top level namespace which are deemed not to belong in the `builtins` should 1) be moved to an importable module and 2) be replaced by a version that behaves the same but raises deprecations warnings for some period before being removed from the global namespace.\r\n\r\nBonus points if we could combine this with EthPM packages in some way as it would lay the foundation for installing 3rd party modules which provide fancy functions and functionality not available in the standard library.\r\n\r\nExtra bonus points if this API allows us to leverage `DELEGATECALL` style libraries to reduce deployment costs when appropriate.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nThis would be backwards incompatible with respect to any function that currently exists in the top level namespace that is deemed to not belong there, but there is a clear and simple deprecation path for these.\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\nNone that I know of.\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)\r\n",

    "body": "1. I'm not a fan of requiring that the environment variables be imported.\r\n\r\n* I don't think I've ever written a contract where I didn't access `msg.sender` or `msg.value` at some point.\r\n* The value for these variables is constant, but often constant _in relation to the active transaction_. And depending on the function mutability, I can only access some of these values sometimes.  So we have an import of a thing that has a different value depending on where I access it, and that I can't always access.  It feels weird,\r\n* Given all environment variables are struct-like, it leads to questions such as: is `from ethereum.environment.msg import value` legal?\r\n\r\n2.  I'd also prefer to keep everything in the same root package: `ethereum.utils` should be `vyper.utils`.\r\n\r\n* Every name we use is one less name available to the user for their own project structure.\r\n* If I know that everything is in `vyper` it's much easier to know that anything that _isn't_ `vyper` is definitely importing an interface.  As soon as there are two options..  what if a new patch release added a third option? It makes it harder to grok what an import statement is doing.\r\n\r\nGenerally the layout you propose for `utils`, `constants`, `cryptography`, `math` makes sense to me, but I need to stare at it some more.",
