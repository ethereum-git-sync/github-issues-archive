  "body": "## Simple Summary\r\n\r\nThe current logo of Vyper is not useful, as it does not spell out the product name. I checked [the old issue of the logo design process](https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/issues/794), but unfortunately, this process only yielded a brand mark, not a real logo.\r\n\r\nBecause Vyper is a very unknown product, unlike e.g. Nike, having just what is called a \"brank mark\" as a logo bad. No one recognizes it unless it is specifically spelt out in the context e.g. Vyper documentation. But for Vyper to get adoption, the logo must appear in multiple places outside its own documentation. The logo should spell out the full word Vyper. This will also lead people to come up with more useful hacks in a pinch as I did.\r\n\r\nI created a logo that spells out Vyper based on the current brand mark.\r\n\r\nI will leave it here for now, unless someone comes up with a more professional logo. I suggest going to back to the original person who designed the Vyper brand mark.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\n[I needed the Vyper logo for PyChain 2022 website](https://www.pychain.org). Because no real logo was available, I took the creative freedom to extend the existing brand mark found on the Github repository.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nI did not use AI but extended it with Inkscape. Added the SVG editable file.\r\n\r\n[The font used is Quantico which is free](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Quantico).\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\n\r\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)\r\n\r\n\r\n![vyper logo with text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49922/194771649-adbdbc06-b5f3-4a27-ab19-ab61c4b4c8b2.png)\r\n![vyper logo with text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49922/194771650-78d06bc3-f858-449b-80ce-6284beb69d38.svg)\r\n![vyper-logo-transparent](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49922/194771651-9413ec93-c00e-4b0a-8aba-24afceefb20b.svg)\r\n",
