  "body": "## Simple Summary\n\"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.\" Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the VIP.\n\n## Motivation\nThe motivation is critical for VIPs that add or change Vyper's functionality. It should clearly explain why the existing Vyper functionality is inadequate to address the problem that the VIP solves as well as how the VIP is in line with Vyper's goals and design philosophy.\n\n## Specification\nThe technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow any developer to implement the functionality\n\n## Backwards Compatibility\nAll VIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The VIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities.\n\n## Dependencies\nIf this VIP depends on any other VIPs being implemented, please mention them.\n\n## References\nAdd any references that this VIP might reference (other VIPs/issues, links to blog posts, etc.)\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)\n",
