    "body": "Yeah, there is definitely nuance here. In order to be a successful developer language for more than small uses, we need some way of separating concerns where it makes sense and doesn't obfuscate the program.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion using statements will be for two uses:\r\n* package imports from eth-pm:\r\n```python\r\nfrom zeppelin.token import ERC20\r\n\r\n# variable pointing to an ERC20-compatible token contract\r\nmy_token: ERC20\r\n...\r\n```\r\n* importing other local files as self-contained, composed types\r\n```python\r\nimport Boardmember\r\n\r\n# create a group of 5 Boardmembers, whose functionality is defined in './Boardmember.vy'\r\nboard: Boardmember[5]\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn both cases, you will already have a full understanding of exactly what it is you are importing, so you are not going back and forth between files to understand what is going on. Interfaces are easy in this way (e.g. ERC20), and our model for composable object types will have to be flushed out for our v2 release.",

    "body": "So... here's my take on these.\r\n\r\n**Imports and/or package support (ethpm)**\r\n\r\nImports... Not like this, please. Not generic imports. It defeats the whole point of Vyper. I see two specific points where imports are a valid use case:\r\n\r\n- Calling external contracts by its abi. The abi could be importable, so one doesn't need to craft calls by hand via keccak hashing.\r\n\r\n- Deploying new contracts from a factory contract. In order to make builds not-painful, we need a way to import the binary of child contracts, to deploy it from contract methods.\r\n\r\nSo... how about this? Vyper should never import Vyper files. We need specific imports to import ABIs and contract binaries. ABIs should be represented as types (classes), while binaries (or in general, strings) should be represented as constants for the programmer.\r\n\r\n**Including on-chain deployed libraries**\r\n\r\nNo. Just no. Not like this.\r\n\r\nWe really need to rethink libraries from the ground up. Libraries sound good, but are the number 1 security vulnerability of Ethereum. If Vyper gets on the messed up crap Solidity library bandwagon, I'll consider it officially dead to me.\r\n\r\nDeployed libraries are a good idea. But we need serious, serious, serious work on the concept, re-architecting it from the ground up, and coming up with a solution that is secure, reliable and auditable.\r\n\r\n**Struct classes**\r\n\r\nWhat is the use case where this would be good for anything other than writing unsafe code?\r\n\r\n**Composable Types \"Widgets\"**\r\n\r\nI don't understand what the author meant by this sequence of words. ;)\r\n\r\n**Library Support**\r\n\r\nPlease don't.",

    "body": "Here's a quick thought train about what the philosophy of Vyper should be on code reuse. If more of you agree with me, or find it useful, it could be elevated to a guideline that should inform decisions on requests and questions such as imports, libraries and similar things.\r\n\r\nSo...\r\n\r\n**Daniel's Ethereum smart contract ars poetica**\r\n\r\nEthereum smart contracts run on a very limited platform (the EVM), that in many of its limitations, is comparable to a punchcard computer from the 70s. For this reason, using modern programming paradigms useful on low-security and high capacity (virtually unlimited) systems will yield all of the drawbacks, but none or few of the benefits of these approaches.\r\n\r\nSo an Ethereum smart contract should follow the traditional Unix application philosophy. A single contract should do a single, very narrowly defined thing. Complex behaviors should emerge from the interplay of multiple separate, independent contracts, as opposed to through one complex contract.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, in-contract code composition is not only undesirable from a security standpoint, it is useless from a best practice development standpoint. We need to provide tools that make it easy for developers to write contracts that can easily interact with other contracts. An existing, successful example of this paradigm is the built-in cryptographic precompiles in Ethereum, accessible from smart contracts as separate contracts through an ABI and fixed address.",

Breaking down concepts and composing them where they make sense can make it more readable and safer because the compiler takes care of linking things together.

    "body": "ERC20 is not a package, it's an ABI. We need the ability to import ABIs, not \"packages\".\r\n\r\nAs for collecting the smart contract system into one file, I'm not quite sure what you mean. Something like a Truffle migration? That would be a build and deployment toolchain question, which we should clearly demarcate from the compiler.\r\n\r\nThere's the compiler, which is Vyper specific, and then we could work on toolchain stuff that should be language agnostic, operating on ABIs and EVM binaries.\r\n\r\n> Library support (and libraries in general) I am much less convinced on their overall utility, but @pipermerriam has been convincing me\r\n\r\nOn-chain libraries are useful, but very dangerous. I am extremely against having this functionality as a language citizen. Instead, well-known contracts deployed on the chain could be used for reusable logic, similarly to the EVM precompiles. (Ie. you explicitly call them as contracts.)\r\n\r\nAs for delegatecall'ing them, that's inherently unsafe. I guess we need the ability to do delegatecalls, but let's not make it too self-evident or enticing... And definitely don't make it look like \"the right way\" or even \"**a** right way\" for purposes of code reuse. I still remember the Parity multisig... ;)\r\n\r\nLocal (build-time) libraries would kill auditability. We'd get the similar library hell that Javascript has. Only on Ethereum it's so much worse. \"Well I have this include that has publicly available source, and it looks safe... but back when I compiled the contract, the one I compiled it with had a backdoor, so your money is now mine.\"\r\n\r\nFor Ethereum contracts, copy-pasting code seems like a perfectly acceptable way. Later, we could have a developer ecosystem with shareable code snippets of common code to be included (maybe via an IDE)... but that's different from libraries.\r\n\r\nA Vyper standard library that is audited and proven to be safe could be a common ground between the requirements of security and developer friendliness.\r\n\r\n> I think ultimately, you cannot have a single 1000+ line contract and have it remain understandable\r\n\r\nI think you shouldn't have a 1000+ line contract, period. ;) (Likely deployment won't fit into block gas limit anyway.)",
