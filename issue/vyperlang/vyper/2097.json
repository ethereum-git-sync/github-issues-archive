  "body": "## How it works now\r\n`vyper.cli` contains all the scripts that are exposed by entry points.  This package is meant to contain all of the logic that touches the filesystem.\r\n\r\n## How it could be refactored\r\n* Try to reduce (or even eliminate) imports from other subpackages.  If something is touching the filesystem, or related to CLI, it should probably live in `cli.utils`.  It shouldn't be that hard to make this package a bit more standalone.\r\n* Move `vyper_json.compile_json` to the `compiler` subpackage. Compiling from the JSON input is something that frameworks may wish to do, they shouldn't ever have a need to import from `cli` unless they also want vyper to handle the filesystem aspects.\r\n* Add mypy types where missing\r\n* Rename / refactor functions according to the [style guide](https://vyper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/style-guide.html)\r\n* Add a `README.md` for the package\r\n\r\n## Why this is an improvement\r\nOne more subpackage up to the standards of our style guide.",

    "body": "> Move vyper_json.compile_json to the compiler subpackage\r\n\r\nI mean realistically, all this should be doing is converting input from JSON string (read from CLI args) to a dict in a particular format, and passing to `compiler`. If people can't do `json.dumps(pathlib.Path(_path).read_text())` with integrating Vyper, they have other problems",
