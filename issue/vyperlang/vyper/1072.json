    "body": "@fubuloubu I'm starting to look into this one. One note for now, this guy also compiles:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Compiles!\r\n@public\r\n@constant\r\ndef who(_arg: bytes[100]) -> int128:\r\n    return convert(slice(_arg, start=20, len=32), int128)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSeems like we may want to re-name this issue to be more specific to converting from `bytes` to `int128`, though perhaps we do want to also add converting from `bytes` to `address`? Though perhaps not converting from `bytes` to `decimal` as converting from `bytes32` to `decimal` is also not currently supported. Thoughts?",

    "body": "Anything to decimal is interesting... I would prefer that all basic types (those that take up 32 bytes) be directly convertible to one another easily. But obviously certain transformations are problematic.\r\n\r\nFor example, converting uint256 to decimal. Does it... clamp at INT128_MAX? Naively convert the value, ignoring higher bits? Multiply by the 10 decimal places?\r\n\r\nNeeds to be well documented. We should probably have a pow-wow about this... @jakerockland can you create a table in the docs of what happens when you convert each type to another. Try to think through what scenarios would be problematic and how we could resolve them. Then we can all approve that as a VIP and make sure they get implemented as stated in the docs. Does that sound okay?\r\n\r\nTurning into a bit more of headache than anticipated!",
