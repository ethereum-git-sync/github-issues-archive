  "body": "#### Simple Summary\r\n\r\nWe need package management integration like people expect in the modern age of programming. \r\n\r\n#### Motivation\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest pitfalls of Solidity as a language has been the lack of a package manager built into the language. Today, Golang has Dep, Rust has Cargo, Node has NPM, Python has Pip. Viper needs to cater to the needs of novice programmers and this is something that truly helps the development process.\r\n\r\n#### Specification\r\n\r\nFortunately, a [spec already exists](https://github.com/ethpm/ethpm-spec) and it's made to be compatible with other languages such as Solidity! We just need to build it in to follow the ethPm specification, perhaps carving out a slice of itself for Viper. \r\n\r\n#### Cute Animal Picture\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7756785/32985284-050f1eb8-cc7d-11e7-812d-7b25ce4e333c.png)\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "I've been suspect of the whole PM approach myself for this reason. When code is this expensive to get wrong and is this high level (so there is no reason to have a smart contract more than a few hundred lines tops), I prefer if you went through the effort of manually copying successful implementations instead of basing your code on libraries or classes from others. This limits the attack vectors available from external sources and has the added benefit of forcing you to understand your code enough to copy and paste it successfully.\r\n\r\nWe are planning on having the viper compiler define built-in macros for extensively proven use cases in order to make writing code easier for Viper developers. These macros will generate more basic syntax (sort of like preprocessor macros) so that the code you would make publicly available is is easily auditable as possible (everything all in one place).\r\n\r\n90% of smart contract work will be understanding and testing the code, I'd say focus on making that easier first. (or better yet creating a PM system that integrates testing easily with the underlying code modules easily)",

    "body": "To expand on \"universally identify code hardiness\", let me explain myself a bit: I used to work for an aerospace company where we followed DO-178B in order to qualify our software for flight. If I had a piece of software that was qualified to the Level A spec, that means there was a decent amount of \"trust\" that the software went through adequate testing to ensure it did what it said it did, and didn't have catastrophic bugs. It's not a guarantee however, so any software that had actually been in flight test or production for a fair amount of time had extra confidence because it survived \"in the wild\". The longer it spent in flight test or production, the more it could be trusted because it was being used for it's intended purpose. NASA has a related metric called the TRL which puts objective measurements on the amount of use a piece of software has. A TRL9 means it has been on multiple missions (used for it's intended purpose for many hours of mission time) and therefore can be trusted to be reused again with minimal impact.\r\n\r\nNot to say that Aerospace Software and Smart Contracts are the same thing. Smart Contracts will be used in a much more commercial setting on the web by many thousands of users, and additionally have to deal with malicious actors who wish to game the rules specified in the contracts by finding bugs that make them money. However, I believe both types of software are very similar in the respect that the code is deployed and cannot be changed without significant effort, so trying to ensure hardiness and fitness for a particular purpose will be of paramount importance.\r\n\r\nIf a Package Management system took all this into account, I would be much happier to enable it in this language. By that point hopefully Viper is something mainstream and this approach would make a lot of sense.\r\n\r\nI hope you understand where I'm coming from on this a little better now.",
