    "body": "Because what happens when you deploy a smart contract (in any language) is that you are deploying the bytecode generated by the compiler, the tools used are actually somewhat agnostic to which language you end up using (Solidity, Viper, LLL, etc.) Personally, I like using pyethereum for testing purposes because it's written in python, which is the same module we use for the majority of our testing here.\r\n\r\nIf you install pyethereum (`pip install ethereum>=2.1.0`), you can use the tester module for testing against a very simple blockchain via the following:\r\n```python\r\nfrom viper import compiler\r\nfrom ethereum.tools import tester\r\n# Get a new chain\r\nchain = tester.Chain()\r\n# Set the viper compiler to run when the viper language is requested\r\ntester.languages['viper'] = compiler.Compiler() \r\n# Compile and apply __init__ method (using init_args\r\ncontract = chain.contract(source_code, language=\"viper\", init_args, sender=..., value=..., etc.)\r\ncontract.myMethod() # Executes myMethod on the tester \"chain\"\r\nchain.mine() # Mines the above transaction (and any before it) into a block\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow for deployment against a \"real\" blockchain, you have several options: you can use a tool that can deploy the bytecode for you (which doesn't get pretty), or you can create your own process via py-testrpc and web3.py (which is what I am doing) to connect to a running instance of geth, deploy your bytecode, and interact with your deployed contracts. This is definitely a much more advanced step, but realistically using the `ethereum.tester` module above can let you do most of what you want to do (see how it works on a chain) without going through these steps of seeing how it works out there in the wild. If you're just getting into contract programming, getting very familiar with testing is a great first step and you can probably learn enough there to make you dangerous when you actually want to go deploy some code on testnet (or mainnet *shivers* lol).\r\n\r\nYou're right we need to actually come up with real tools and examples of how to do this eventually, especially the testing aspect. Let us know if you need some further answers on [gitter](https://gitter.im/ethereum/viper) and we'll keep this issue for us to create documentation on how to setup your own test  suite for contracts (using the same tools we use to test our own e.g. [here](https://github.com/ethereum/viper/blob/master/tests/examples/tokens/test_vipercoin.py))",
