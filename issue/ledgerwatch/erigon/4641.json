  "body": "This is a follow-up of this [long] discussion that started on discord (please read them all up to the last msg from me saying I'm going to open an issue on github): https://discord.com/channels/687972960811745322/906989870419959818/977295597092618280\r\n\r\nSince I agree with most points there, I'd like to summarize the pain points:\r\n\r\n1 - mixing configuration of RPC endpoints\r\n\r\nPost-merge, you'll having 2 RPC endpoints: :8545 for general use, :8551 for CL. They should not depend on each other's config. 8551 is a privileged port, meant to NOT be opened to public, it is authenticated and it's RPC methods are well defined by EL <-> CL spec.\r\n\r\nCurrently, enabling 8551 requires you to add the `engine` namespace to the `--http.api` config. `-http.api` is so far meant to enable namespaces on 8545. Now you introduce a change in semantics requiring `engine_` to be added to that config to enable something on 8551. But at the same time it DOES NOT enable `engine_` 8545 (and it MUST NOT) because this is a privileged API.\r\n\r\nSolution: don't use `-http.api` param to control CL semantics, let it be a well defined config to control only APIs for 8545.\r\n\r\nAlso, the argument that geth does the same was denied in a twitter conversation between Chase/Marius.\r\n\r\n2 - does it even make sense to any config to control what is enabled or not on :8551? the set of RPC methods is well defined by spec: https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/blob/main/src/engine/specification.md#underlying-protocol\r\n\r\nIMHO, only those APIs must be exposed on 8551, no reason for them to be configurable.\r\n\r\n3 - `--rpc.accessList` must not interfere on CL endpoint\r\n\r\nI whitelisted only some methods in our public sepolia.otterscan.io node, however while configuring a new node for the sepolia merge, I had to disable this entire feature because it was also being applied to the CL endpoint.\r\n\r\nI.e., you cant disable `eth_call` on 8545 because it will also disable it on 8551, but it is required by CL spec.\r\n\r\nSolution: again, don't apply `--rpc.accessList` rules on 8551.\r\n\r\n4 - `--http.vhosts` param must not be applied to CL endpoint\r\n\r\nSame as above, the reasoning is: 8545 is a public port, it would make sense for it to have a public hostname assigned; 8551 is an internal, privileged port, it'll be probably exposed on localhost (if CL running together) or in a local network host, if it has a hostname, it'll probably NOT follow a public domain.\r\n\r\nIf you want to enable a vhosts config to the CL endpoint, make it another config. It makes no sense to mix the same set of vhosts to both endpoints.\r\n",
