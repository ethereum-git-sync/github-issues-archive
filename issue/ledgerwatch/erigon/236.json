  "body": "It is required for items 4 and 6 of this list: https://ledgerwatch.github.io/Ethereum_1_Research_topics.html#Current-vision-of-the-project\r\n\r\nFunction `ResolveStateTrie` in `TrieDbState` in `core/state/database.go` figures out which parts of the state are required for the execution of the block, but absent from the the state trie (field `t` in the `TrieDbState`). Then it loads necessary data from the database and builds sub-tries that contain all the missing information. Next, it \"hooks\" (attaches) these sub-tries on the terminal `hashNode` nodes of the state trie.\r\n\r\nThis task is about optionally persisting these sub-tries into a separate database as witnesses. The key of each record needs be derived from two things:\r\n1. parameter `MaxTrieCacheGen` (which really means how many branch nodes of the state trie we are keeping in memory): https://github.com/ledgerwatch/turbo-geth/blob/8a632e764b48ff18f4a86a77ea935ce0c0dc8a97/core/state/database.go#L38\r\n2. block number\r\n\r\nLogically, if the we keep bigger part of the trie in the memory, the sizes of those witnesses generated in `ResolveStateTrie` will be smaller and vice versa. If we run the stateless prototype with various settings `MaxTrieCacheGen`, we can produce data for items (4) and (6) on the research list.\r\n",
