Doing in place extraction with wget would require me to shut the node down and delete my data, and then hope and pray that it all downloads and extracts properly in 1 go, and that it doesn't take days (since I can't use aria2 and extract locally). This after spending weeks to sync from scratch... The node did catch back up a couple hours after I posted last, and stayed in sync for about 5.5 hours, and then fell back behind again \r\n",
