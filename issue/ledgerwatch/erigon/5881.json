    "body": "I am absolutely not speaking on behalf of the Erigon team, but I do have long experience with the `trace_` namespace having used it since the first Parity version of these APIs since around 2017.\r\n\r\nThe behaviour you describe has been in the code since the beginning. In `trace_transaction`, the first trace (i.e. trace[0]) is identical to the top-level transaction itself. So, for example, if you called `trace_transaction` on a straight EOA to EOA transfer of ETH, the trace would have all the same values for `from`, `to`, `value`, etc. The only difference is the `gasUsed` value which reflects the total gas used of the transaction as a whole minus `gasUsed` in the remaining traces. (In this example, that number would be zero, so the top-level transaction `gasUsed` and trace[0]'s `gasUsed` would be the same.)\r\n\r\nI never quite understood why `trace_get` skipped the first trace, but that may be why. Perhaps the semantics of `trace_get` are to get the nth actual smart contract trace and because the traces for the transaction start with a trace of the top-level transaction it skips over that.\r\n\r\nUpshot: It's worked like this since the first release of the code, so I don't actually think this is a bug other than perhaps in the documentation.",
