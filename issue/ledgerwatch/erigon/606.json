We would have released earlier, but we discovered a way to drastically reduce the initial sync time for the node (that is sync from genesis, not the fast sync).\r\nNo, the code is not going to be merged back into geth, because turbo-geth is essentially becoming a very different product. The divergence is growing quickly and it will likely to continue to diverge.",
