  "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI work for a company that broadcasts multiple eth transactions daily. We are currently looking to switch from GETH to Erigon.\r\n\r\nI had two questions around the txpool in Erigon and how it works. I saw it is not a fork of Geth\r\n\r\nIssue 1 Essentially:\r\n\r\n- We broadcast a transaction at times of gas spikes.\r\n- The ethereum execution layer lets us know the transaction failed to broadcast due to insufficient gas provided.\r\n- We keep increasing gas, but still not enough.\r\n- When gas spike comes down, we reduce our gas price, but the node remembers a previous transaction with a higher gas price is still in the tx pool, so it prevents it from being sent.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy question:\r\n- Does Erigon automatically re-broadcast transactions?\r\n- Does Erigon keep transactions in the tx pool if it was unable to be submitted?",

    "body": "1. There is no such thing as “gas price” in txpool. Or you have N gas on-your-balance or not. “price of gas” is not involved and not tracked. \r\n2.  There is “base fee” in every new block header, this limit may work similar: increase/decrease may change which txs are ready for mining/rebroadcasting. So, txpool does re-calc things on every new block and rebroadcast what need. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTxpool rebroadcast all txs when they moving to “pending sun-pool”. See:  https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon/wiki/Transaction-Pool-Design\r\n\r\n3. “ Does Erigon keep transactions in the tx pool if it was unable to be submitted?” if txn is valid, just not enough balance - it will be placed in some sub-pool (not pending) and will stay in txpool and re-calc related parameters until it get mined (found in new block). Each sub-pool has own configurable Limit. TxPool flush new txs to own db every 30sec. \r\n4. if tx is rejected (when trying to add) - it return reason and just rejected. ",
