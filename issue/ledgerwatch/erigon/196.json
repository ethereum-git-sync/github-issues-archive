  "body": "There are few contracts on the mainnet that have been self-destructed, then received Ether, to become non-contract accounts. Obviously, non accessible, but blockchain does not know that :)\r\nFor example, https://etherscan.io/address/0x11fc42be8b14aeecfc371af217c4648e6423fa60\r\n\r\nWe currently keep the incarnation number of such accounts `0`, which is misleading, because the corresponding entries in the `StorageBucket` still exist. And when we want to verify the coherence of the state using `verifySnapshot` tool, these either do not match, or become \"special cases\", which are hard to distinguish from the genuine mismatches. The solution is to increase the incarnation number of such accounts at the moment when they receive Ether. That, unfortunately, means that we will have to do the \"incarnation check\" every time we create any account, not just contract. Would it be too much of a performance penalty? Is this worth it?\r\n",
