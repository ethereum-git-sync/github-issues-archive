  "body": "# Rationale\r\n\r\nStage Issuance is the part of the Erigon node that keeps track of how many Ethereums are in circulation. however, it is partly incomplete, as pruning and unwind are yet to be supported. this issue focuses on unwind which is the action to unwind back the database to a certain instance in the past.\r\n\r\n# Implementation\r\n\r\nErigon uses mdbx, mdbx is a key-value database which is divided in buckets, can be thought as a set of mappings at an high level.\r\n\r\nthe issuance stage fills a bucket `kv.Issuance`with the following key/values `block_number` => `total issued ethers`, what we want to do is truncate from the unwind point onward, an example of truncation could be the following https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon/blob/3cab0c786f0919b1addb4971b00e6de21410a1c6/eth/stagedsync/stage_execute.go#L513 up until line 530, we need to do the same with `kv.Issuance` bucket. (`Cursor` iterates from `startKey`upward until End of Bucket, and in our case deletes each entry).\r\n\r\nThe unwind function that needs to be filled is at this link: https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon/blob/3cab0c786f0919b1addb4971b00e6de21410a1c6/eth/stagedsync/stage_issuance.go#L181",
