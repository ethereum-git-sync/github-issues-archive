Help output appears to be from a copy and paste.  [The docs on this command](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon/tree/devel/cmd/txpool) don't especially have a general description, either.  I can infer it has to do with transaction pool handling, but it's not really clear if it's the entire network's mempool known to the node or local transactions or what.\r\n\r\nIt's not immediately clear to me if the commad options are for this one or sentry.\r\n\r\n#### Actual behaviour\r\n\r\nDescriptions of p2p sentry command.\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\r\n\r\n    $ txpool --help\r\n    Run p2p sentry\r\n\r\n    Usage:\r\n      sentry [flags]\r\n    [...]\r\n",

Also, after the-megre you will run external consensus service. \r\n\r\n95% of pool-related code (from p2p message parsing, to sorting logic) is inside this folder: https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon-lib/tree/main/txpool\r\n\r\nOur pool implementation is not fork of Geth’s ( And it’s Apache licensed) - here is design doc: https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon/wiki/Transaction-Pool-Design\r\n\r\n\r\n",
