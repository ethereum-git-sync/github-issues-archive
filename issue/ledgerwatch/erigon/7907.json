The fact that I see stage 2 logs means to me that it should be cycling over the stages, but it feels like it is stuck.\r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure that if I don't do anything it'll eventually fix by itself and finish, but can't see what's actually happening by reading the logs.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this is a log/display issue, or it reflects some exotic bug in the stage management because I don't think it should be take so much time to finish downloading the block bodies (it is completing the remaining blocks post first sync).\r\n\r\nsome potentially misleading logs IMHO:\r\n\r\n1 - There are repeating logs for the same block number (17708266) which says that the stage is stuck at that block, but OTOH the delivery/sec value shows something, which indicates there is download activity occurring. What's the truth?\r\n\r\n2 - It cycles between stages 2 and 5, but it reads as \"something is progressing\" internally because the block number doesn't move, what is happening here? I'm not familiar to post-merge CL lifecycle, not sure if it is related, in that case I would appreciate some explanation to understand better what my node is doing :)\r\n",
