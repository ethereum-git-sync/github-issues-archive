  "body": "We are currently in the process of extending the values in the `SUFFUX` bucket to contain not just the list of keys that have changed in given block, but also previous values (before the change). This allows decoupling of rewinding from the history of state buckets `hAT` and `hST`, making history of state optional, and also simplifying the rewinding.\r\n\r\nWe should go further and make another two improvements in the way we encode the list of key-value pairs:\r\n\r\n1. Make the list sorted by keys. This will allow more efficient merging of subsequent change-sets without deserialising every change-set first (in rewindData).\r\n2. Prepend (or append) the list by the positional index, so that the binary search on the keys is possible. We expect the values become quite large (100ks - megabytes potentially). Binary search will be useful to implement historical resolver `trie.Resolver' in the way which is not coupled to the history of state buckets 'hAT' and 'hST'. The idea is to perform rewind of a sub-trie, and for that, we would need to be able to efficiently derive change-sets only for certain range of keys. Start of the range can be found by binary search and then keys can be iterated until we reach the end of the desired range.\r\n\r\n",
