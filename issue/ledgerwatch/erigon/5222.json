  "body": "Historical context: \r\nContext: in the past it was not possible because Miner did use Erigon's write db transaction to calculate new state root (just technical problem) - but @Giulio2002  solved it: now Miner use in-memory-mutation instead of write-db-transaction. \r\n\r\nArchitecture idea: \r\nTo move Miner inside TxPool service (process) - can deploy TxPool as separated process and Miner will be inside TxPool process. (Miner will never call TxPool by grpc). If solve this task, then few new options may be available for us: \r\nMiner and TxPool will always leave in 1 service (process) - in TxPool service. \r\nSo, it's ok to do many calls from miner to TxPool or access TxPool's internal memory from Miner, or call private methods, or subscribe to some low-level events.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"move miner\" - to see better - you can look into ./cmd/txpool/main.go it's place where can start txpool as separated process. All Erigon's parts can start as separated process: ./cmd/rpcdaemon, ./cmd/sentry , ./cmd/downloader - but by default they are working inside erigon's process. Can disable internal by --txpool.disable and start external (see ./cmd/txpool/readme.md).  \r\n\r\nSo, what need to do first (forget about case when txpool is part of erigon (just imagine now - it never happen): \r\n- [ ]  add miner to external txpool, to ./cmd/txpool/readme.md. Now it's created in mining := stagedsync.New(  and assembleBlockPOS := . Miner must use remotedb instead of erigon's db (it's kv grpc service on --private.api.addr). Miner must use kvcache instead of reading state from erigon's db directly (txpool already using it, can see examples there). Miner and txpool must share same instance of kvcache (txpool already has logic to invalidate/update kvcache - you don't need work on it). \r\n- [ ] make sure miner inside txpool subscribed to notifications from txpool/sentry. Example of such notification in backend.go  case b := <-backend.pendingBlocks \r\n- [ ] make sure miner subscribed to notifications from sentry/erigon (there are cases when need stop mine because other node in network already mined it. \r\n- [ ] Add some tests for miner in txpool. Can get test cases from erigon or https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/tree/master/miner \r\n\r\nOnly when done implementation of miner inside separated txpool process, can do something about built-into Erigon txpool and miner:\r\n\r\n- [ ] replace grpc service, by direct-grpc service. Example: direct.NewTxPoolClient used int built-in RPCDaemon - ./cmd/rpcdaemon/cli/config.go:EmbeddedServices. \r\n- [ ]  Change RPCDaemon methods miner_* and ./turbo/rpchelper/interface.go:ApiBackend.PendingBlock() to call txpool grpc service instead of ApiBackend (ApiBackend it's --private.api.addr, erigon also has --txpool.api.addr: so need call 2nd)",
