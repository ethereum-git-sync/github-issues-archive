This is currently something very hard which requires full storage trace scanning for all transactions outside the node software as some contracts have calls which modify allowances in a way that fire a custom event.\r\n\r\nMore exactly, I would like to be able to find who approved a given address for token spending.\r\n\r\nThere s should be 3 optional parameters\r\n\r\n* `Token`. An array of Token contract s address, which if given allows to filter the tokens concerned.

Please note some tokens are unable to use UINT256_MAX for infinite amount as they for example limit themselves to UINT96_MAX, so it should be made optional to be able to return all amounts even if interested into infinite approvals.\r\n* `Block`. If a block number, returns the result for the given block number. If `latestblock`, returns for the latest mined block.

    "body": "Hi @ytrezq \r\n\r\nThanks for your suggestion.\r\n\r\nI completely understand exactly what you're asking for here, and while I agree that It's a much-needed capability of the node, I'm not sure it's Erigon specific. This is more of an issue at the RPC level which would extend across all nodes, not just Erigon.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, I work on a project called TrueBlocks (we're one of Erigon's ecosystem partners -- you can find our channel in their discord).\r\n\r\nYour first paragraph gets at exactly why the problem is hard. A single address may own hundreds of different tokens and, in order to get a completely accurate list of that address's token holdings (or in your case allowances), one would have to either know about each token beforehand or scan the entire chain (including into the traces) to find all occurrences.\r\n\r\nTrueBlocks builds an index of every appearance of an address (including the \"hidden-in-the-traces\" appearances) for exactly this purpose making your query pretty straight-forward.\r\n\r\n```\r\nchifra export <address>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that, unlike the RPC, this query is against the receiving address of the token, not the token address and it finds every appearance anywhere on the chain, not just events.\r\n\r\nThe following query returns every appearance of the address in an event with a given topic.\r\n\r\n```\r\nchifra export --logs <address> <topic> [block-list]\r\n```\r\n\r\nand the next\r\n\r\n```\r\nchifra export --logs --emitter <token_address...> <address...> <topic> [block-list]\r\n```\r\n\r\nfind events with a given topic emitted by a given list of token addresses for one or more holders at one or more blocks.\r\n\r\nWe're hoping to incorporate some of the indexing ideas we have about building this index into Erigon2. That conversation is just getting started, and you're welcome to join in on the discord.\r\n\r\nI think this issue can probably be closed or brought to the broader RPC discussion at the EIP level.",
