  "body": "Issue #1380, which I closed, points out that `eth_getLogsByHash` is not part of the **official** eth_ RPC namespace and suggests that it should be renamed to `tg_getLogsByHash`.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that `tg_getLogsByHash` already exists and returns the same data as `eth_getLogsByHash`. In other words, both exists.\r\n\r\nI tried to remove `eth_getLogsByHash`, but it wasn't obvious what was going on. There appears to be only a single routine in the `tg_` namespace.\r\n\r\nI tested to see if this `eth_` / `tg_` confusion exists with other APIs, but I didn't find anything.",
