Perhaps you could create a GitHub Project, or use Milestones, or something, to signify what's left to be done for Beta?\r\n- It's very tiring to have Erigon breaking and corrupting data release after release\r\n\r\nIt would be great if some focus was poured on getting a stable release out, a release that won't corrupt data & won't need \"updates\" (besides security) for at least 6 months.",

    "body": "Thanks for the comments! As you probably can imagine, developing Erigon (that includes pursuing) architectural vision, as well as keeping up with other implementation is challenging (we only just managed to incorporate EIP-1559 into the transaction pool, and now there is already merge prototyping that needs to start), and we also have shortage of developers that we are trying to address, but it takes time. Keeping things stable does add to the challenge.\r\nIn order to implement more efficient state sync (so that users don't always need to sync from genesis), we are likely going to make more drastic changes to the data layout, therefore I would delay transition to beta even longer.\r\n",
