    "body": "> Take a look on eth_getLogs\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost thank you for your reply @AskAlexSharov \r\nI have played a bit with with `eth_getLogs` but seem to be unable to fetch the gas used information I need. Here is what I have tried, test is for random block number 1000000.\r\n\r\n`curl -X POST  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"method\":\"eth_getLogs\",\"params\":[{\"fromBlock\": \"1000000\", \"toBlock\": \"1000000\"}],\"id\":1}' http://localhost:8545`\r\n\r\nWhich gives me:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\r\n    \"id\": 1,\r\n    \"result\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"address\": \"0xc083e9947cf02b8ffc7d3090ae9aea72df98fd47\",\r\n            \"topics\": [\r\n                \"0xe1fffcc4923d04b559f4d29a8bfc6cda04eb5b0d3c460751c2402c5c5cc9109c\"\r\n            ],\r\n            \"data\": \"0x00000000000000000000000039fa8c5f2793459d6622857e7d9fbb4bd91766d30000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000056bc75e2d63100000\",\r\n            \"blockNumber\": \"0xf4240\",\r\n            \"transactionHash\": \"0xea1093d492a1dcb1bef708f771a99a96ff05dcab81ca76c31940300177fcf49f\",\r\n            \"transactionIndex\": \"0x0\",\r\n            \"blockHash\": \"0x8e38b4dbf6b11fcc3b9dee84fb7986e29ca0a02cecd8977c161ff7333329681e\",\r\n            \"logIndex\": \"0x0\",\r\n            \"removed\": false\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\nSo this looks like an event triggered by one of the transactions in the block. Actually there is a second internal transaction in the block that is missing and even for this one the gas used is missing.\r\n\r\nFor comparison here is how I approach the problem with Parity API.\r\n\r\n`curl --data '{\"method\":\"parity_getBlockReceipts\",\"params\":[\"0xF4240\"],\"id\":1,\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\"}' -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -X POST http://localhost:8545`\r\n\r\nWhich gives me:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\r\n    \"result\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"blockHash\": \"0x8e38b4dbf6b11fcc3b9dee84fb7986e29ca0a02cecd8977c161ff7333329681e\",\r\n            \"blockNumber\": \"0xf4240\",\r\n            \"contractAddress\": null,\r\n            \"cumulativeGasUsed\": \"0x723c\",\r\n            \"effectiveGasPrice\": \"0x12bfb19e60\",\r\n            \"from\": \"0x39fa8c5f2793459d6622857e7d9fbb4bd91766d3\",\r\n            \"gasUsed\": \"0x723c\",\r\n            \"logs\": [\r\n                {\r\n                    \"address\": \"0xc083e9947cf02b8ffc7d3090ae9aea72df98fd47\",\r\n                    \"blockHash\": \"0x8e38b4dbf6b11fcc3b9dee84fb7986e29ca0a02cecd8977c161ff7333329681e\",\r\n                    \"blockNumber\": \"0xf4240\",\r\n                    \"data\": \"0x00000000000000000000000039fa8c5f2793459d6622857e7d9fbb4bd91766d30000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000056bc75e2d63100000\",\r\n                    \"logIndex\": \"0x0\",\r\n                    \"removed\": false,\r\n                    \"topics\": [\r\n                        \"0xe1fffcc4923d04b559f4d29a8bfc6cda04eb5b0d3c460751c2402c5c5cc9109c\"\r\n                    ],\r\n                    \"transactionHash\": \"0xea1093d492a1dcb1bef708f771a99a96ff05dcab81ca76c31940300177fcf49f\",\r\n                    \"transactionIndex\": \"0x0\",\r\n                    \"transactionLogIndex\": \"0x0\",\r\n                    \"type\": \"mined\"\r\n                }\r\n            ],\r\n            \"logsBloom\": \"0x00000000000000000000000000000000000800000000000000000000000800000000000000000400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000008000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000400000000000000000\",\r\n            \"root\": \"0x284d35bf53b82ef480ab4208527325477439c64fb90ef518450f05ee151c8e10\",\r\n            \"to\": \"0xc083e9947cf02b8ffc7d3090ae9aea72df98fd47\",\r\n            \"transactionHash\": \"0xea1093d492a1dcb1bef708f771a99a96ff05dcab81ca76c31940300177fcf49f\",\r\n            \"transactionIndex\": \"0x0\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"blockHash\": \"0x8e38b4dbf6b11fcc3b9dee84fb7986e29ca0a02cecd8977c161ff7333329681e\",\r\n            \"blockNumber\": \"0xf4240\",\r\n            \"contractAddress\": null,\r\n            \"cumulativeGasUsed\": \"0xc444\",\r\n            \"effectiveGasPrice\": \"0xdf8475800\",\r\n            \"from\": \"0x32be343b94f860124dc4fee278fdcbd38c102d88\",\r\n            \"gasUsed\": \"0x5208\",\r\n            \"logs\": [],\r\n            \"logsBloom\": \"0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\",\r\n            \"root\": \"0xfa28ef92787192b577a8628e520b546ab58b72102572e08191ddecd51d0851e5\",\r\n            \"to\": \"0xdf190dc7190dfba737d7777a163445b7fff16133\",\r\n            \"transactionHash\": \"0xe9e91f1ee4b56c0df2e9f06c2b8c27c6076195a88a7b8537ba8313d80e6f124e\",\r\n            \"transactionIndex\": \"0x1\"\r\n        }\r\n    ],\r\n    \"id\": 1\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if I am missing something.",

As mentioned in my first post I am looking for ways to fetch the receipts for an entire block at once. I know that the way to do it per-transaction is using `getTransactionReceipt`, however this would be impractical  for my use case. I want to monitor all gas being spent as the blockchain progress. Having a bulk request instead per-transaction is what the Parity API solves.\r\n",

    "body": "Oh. I see. Have you looked at `trace_block`?\r\n\r\n It's actually really fast and, while it doesn't deliver `receipts` per se, it delivers `Traces` which contain two subfields called `TraceAction` and `TraceResult`. If you look at these two objects the first corresponds pretty well to the transaction object and the later (`TraceResult`) corresponds to the `Receipt` object.\r\n\r\nThere's probably better links to show you, but these are handy:\r\n\r\nThis describes the `Trace` data: https://trueblocks.io/data-model/chaindata/#trace\r\n\r\nThis describes the `TraceAction` data: https://trueblocks.io/data-model/chaindata/#traceaction\r\n\r\nAnd this describes the `TraceResult` data: https://trueblocks.io/data-model/chaindata/#traceresult\r\n\r\nThe routine `trace_block` returns an array of all the `Traces` that happened in a given block.\r\n\r\nYou have to add up the `gasUsed` from all the results to get gas used in the block, but there's a weird result where the adding doesn't equal the same `gasUsed` as is found in the sum of the transaction's receipt, but that detail is something you'll have to work through. (I forget how to calculate the result so all the gas adds up.)",

    "body": "I finally had the time to play a bit more with the trace API @tjayrush, sorry for the long delay. It seems like one can indeed recover the gas used from the trace. However what the actual steps are I am not sure, so from my experiments with the block 1000000 it looks like:\r\n1. Each `call` trace is 21000 gas + whatever the value of the field:\r\n```\r\nresult\": {\r\n   \"gasUsed\": \"0x5a4\",\r\n   \"output\": \"0x\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n2. If you have two traces for a transaction you need to consider only the 'upper' most one. That is the one having a non 0 `subtraces` count. That is because this upper most call would include the gasUsed of the inner ones.\r\n\r\nHowever I suspect things are much more complicated and I am not sure how feasible it is for me to try and sum everything this way. For example I guess I should also consider if the output is not 0 and such things. With all this considered, my original proposal for an API extension stands. I think the node itself must have the logic implemented as it supports the getTransactionReceipt where all this calculations must be taking place.\r\n",
