Note that `SHR` grows much slower, `VIRT` is always the very high number here, but virtual memory allocation shouldn't matter much as I understand it.\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\r\n\r\n1. Install Erigon docker container\r\n2. Run it with `erigon --chain ropsten --datadir /data/erigon/ropsten/ --maxpeers 100 --nat extip:x.x.x.x --private.api.addr=0.0.0.0:9090` (or run with mainnet, same results) via `docker-compose`, let it fully sync.\r\n3. Wait and watch memory consumption over hours/days\r\n",

The ropsten node got stuck over night and so was somewhat behind on syncing after that when I restarted it 2.5h ago, but right now it's up to 9.8g `RES`, the log from this run so far is [erigon-docker-ropsten-20210910.log](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon/files/7144122/erigon-docker-ropsten-20210910.log)  (note that you may see 2021.09.01 in there as I tried to downgrade from .02 to .01 to find out if it helps, but both versions act the same in this regard)\r\n\r\nI'm happy to help in getting any other data as far as it can be done on a docker container.",

In any case, I tried to give you some data, so I tried running it like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndocker-compose -f /data/docker-compose.yml exec -u root erigon sh\r\napk add --no-cache go graphviz\r\ngo tool pprof -png http://127.0.0.1:6060/debug/pprof/heap > /path/to/volume/mem.png\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I found out that there was some font missing or something, as all characters came out as squares on that PNG, which isn't very helpful. So I ended up creating an SVG instead, though I had to go in with Inkscape to resize the document to the content so a normal image viewer would display it usefully. And then I found that GitHub doesn't support adding an SVG here :( - So, another trip to Inkscape and export as PNG to give you this here:\r\n![erigon-ropsten-20210910-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/824140/132879701-f3bb3728-a339-46ec-b3a8-465a7958b25a.png)\r\n",

    "body": "Ropsten has just a slightly higher rate of reorgs / forked blocks than Mainnet, but it sometimes has forks that go on for a longer period / block height. All in all, it's a pretty good test network for Ethereum node / client software, I hope the Erigon team is running a few Ropsten nodes due to this. Also, with the Docker container available, it's easier than ever before to actually set up and run such nodes. :)\r\n\r\nAll that said, I also always have services always hooked up to our nodes (via RPC), at least for monitoring node health, and those do a lot of requests for the current block with eth_getBlockByNumber (probably with \"latest\" as the parameter) and also to web3_clientVersion (which I have in the status output but I guess web3.py is requesting that also as a heartbeat for the connection). I would guess that it may not play a role for this leak, but I wanted to mention that in case it does.",
