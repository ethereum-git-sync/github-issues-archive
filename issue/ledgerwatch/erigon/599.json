  "body": "When Hash State was left at the block X from the previous cycle of staged sync, and now stage 4 finished with the block Y, where Y > X, stage 5 needs to advance (promote) the Hashed State to what it should be at block Y. To do that, it needs to aggregate keys from Change Sets for all blocks from X to Y (to detect which keys have changed), and fetch corresponding values from the Plain State to construct the incremental change that needs to be applied to the Hashed State (also via ETL mechanism, because the gap between X and Y could be large).",
