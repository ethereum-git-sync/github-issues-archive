  "body": "# Rationale\r\n\r\nThere's no reason to use Geth over OpenEthereum for Kovan, so nobody has cared to add Kovan support (i.e. support for Kovan's particular PoA consensus-engine implementation) to Geth.\r\n\r\nBut there *is* a reason to use *turbo-geth* over OpenEthereum for Kovan — namely, storage size. So there's a good reason to add Kovan support to turbo-geth.\r\n\r\n(From there, Kovan support might as well migrate upstream to Geth. Not like turbo-geth does consensus any different from upstream.)\r\n\r\n# Implementation\r\n\r\n> Do you have ideas regarding the implementation of this feature?\r\n\r\nNot really. I've never even looked at the OE codebase; I have no idea how Kovan's PoA implementation works, or how it's different from Geth's `clique` consensus. External documentation about it seems sparse. Just figured this feature-request should exist.\r\n\r\n> Are you willing to implement this feature?\r\n\r\nIf I have time, sure. I work for a blockchain data analytics company, and we're considering standing up some Kovan nodes to query from (switching away from Infura.) Using turbo-geth for these would reduce our operational requirements by quite a lot, so it's in our best interest to get this done, if it doesn't distract too much from our core mission.",

AuRa algorithm is much more challenging to implement compared to Clique, because it uses contract storage in order to decide the validity of headers.
