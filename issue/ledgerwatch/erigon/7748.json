Because we must rewind the hash state\r\n// and re-compute the state trie, the further back in time the request, the more\r\n// computationally intensive the operation becomes.  The staged sync code\r\n// assumes that if more than 100_000 blocks are skipped, that the entire trie\r\n// should be re-computed. Re-computing the entire trie will currently take ~15\r\n// minutes on mainnet.  The current limit has been chosen arbitrarily as\r\n// 'useful' without likely being overly computationally intense.  This parameter\r\n// could possibly be made configurable in the future if needed.\r\n```\r\n\r\nBasically what you're trying to do is so expensive on a compute level that there's a hard limit. You could increase this by updating the `maxGetProofRewindBlockCount` param in eth_call.go and rebuilding. I highly advise against this tho. ",
