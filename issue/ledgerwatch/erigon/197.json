  "body": "Alternative way of solving the problem described in https://github.com/ledgerwatch/turbo-geth/issues/196, without performance penalty:\r\n\r\nThere are few contracts on the mainnet that have been self-destructed, then received Ether, to become non-contract accounts. Obviously, non accessible, but blockchain does not know that :)\r\nFor example, https://etherscan.io/address/0x11fc42be8b14aeecfc371af217c4648e6423fa60\r\n\r\nWe currently keep the incarnation number of such accounts 0, which is misleading, because the corresponding entries in the StorageBucket still exist. And when we want to verify the coherence of the state using verifySnapshot tool, these either do not match, or become \"special cases\", which are hard to distinguish from the genuine mismatches.\r\n\r\nThe solution is to reserve incarnation number `0` for non-contract accounts. In the `StorageBucket`, there will be no entries with incarnation `0`. What are non-contract accounts? Those that either did not have contracts deployed on them, or those that have been self-destructed, and the new contracts have not been deployed on them. There should only be 2 changes required to implement this:\r\n1. Function `nextIncarnation` in `core/state/database.go` needs to return `1` and not `0` if there are no existing incarnations found: https://github.com/ledgerwatch/turbo-geth/blob/992e34745c7f2ff49212a70561c094ac2bb84286/core/state/database.go#L911\r\n2. In the `ToBlock` function in `core/genesis.go`, assign incarnation `1` to accounts that are contracts (non-empty code): https://github.com/ledgerwatch/turbo-geth/blob/992e34745c7f2ff49212a70561c094ac2bb84286/core/genesis.go#L249\r\n",
