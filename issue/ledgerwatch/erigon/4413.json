Both of them take more than 15-30seconds (!). This is not feasible.\r\n\r\n#### Actual behaviour\r\nOpenEthereum as a reference for those calls take milliseconds (around 100-400ms depending on load).\r\n\r\nWhy is that? Is there anything we can prepare the node to speed this up?",

    "body": "I am not a current member of the core team, but I used to be a couple of summers ago. I can confirm what @iFA88 says. That's one of the reasons (there are others) that OpenEthereum requires a 12 TB hard drive and Erigon requires a 2TB hard drive. You can't have everything.\r\n\r\nI switched officially from OpenEthereum to Erigon about a year and half ago. The main reason why I didn't do so earlier was because of the exact issue you describe. One of the things that we found to be very beneficial was to use `trace_block`. In fact, in our testing, Erigon's `trace_block` was faster than OpenEthereum's `trace_block`. I can't explain why this was the case, but it may have been another engineering choice -- perhaps Erigon optimizes `trace_block` whereas OpenEthereum chose to optimize `trace_transaction`.\r\n\r\nFor our application, the speed of `trace_block` is excellent, and I would argue that very small disc space usage is very much worth any performance differences.\r\n\r\nHaving said all of this. I am no longer a core dev on Erigon, so not exactly what you asked for.",

(Not speaking for the team, of course).\r\n\r\nI actually don't think you're correct when you say that \"for indexing the chain, those performance numbers are not feasible.\" 30-second return time is, but we're not seeing that at all.\r\n\r\nWe have a locally running version of Erigon and our software (TrueBlocks) indexes the entire chain on **a laptop computer** (admittedly a pretty massive one - 64GB of Ram, 8TB hard drive) in under two days. And this is an astronomically deep index. We visit every block, every transaction, every log, every receipt, and every trace and find many billions of address appearances (that is, `<block_number>.<tx_id>` pairs per address).\r\n\r\nI'm very sure there's something wrong with your setup. My guess is an under-provisioned machine.\r\n\r\nHope this is helpful. I'd be very interested to learn what you find. And, please remember, I'm not speaking for the team.\r\n",
