  "body": "#### Description\r\nStaged sync is awesome, but API responses should not confuse the user.\r\nToday I faced the following issue which seems like a bug:  \r\n\r\n0. Node started to sync, downloaded headers and tried to run the next stages.  \r\n1. At that moment my indexer were trying to parse info block by block and received the information about the transactions.  \r\n2. **While trying to get logs for the parsed blocks (`eth_getLogs`) the api responded with empty array of the logs for ERC-20 `transfer` topic.**\r\n3. After a while I queried again for the same blocks and saw non-empty array of logs from the `eth_getLogs` response.\r\n\r\nI believe the problem happens before LogIndex stage.\r\n\r\n#### System information\r\nOS & Version: Linux\r\n\r\nErigon Command (with flags/config):\r\n`--txpool.accountslots 1024 --trace.maxtraces 100500 --txpool.lifetime 6h0m0s --batchSize 1024M --private.api.ratelimit 100500 --db.pagesize=16kb --etl.bufferSize 1024MB --p2p.protocol=66  --maxpeers 50 --healthcheck --bor.heimdall=\"http://<my_heimdall_ip>\" --chain bor-mainnet --torrent.download.rate=512mb --torrent.upload.rate=10mb --torrent.port 42014 --snapshots=false`\r\n\r\nChain/Network: Bor\r\n\r\n#### Expected behaviour\r\n`eth_getLogs` should respond with error for not fully processed blocks, i.e. for the blocks that didn't passed all erigon stages of the sync\r\n\r\n#### Actual behaviour\r\n`eth_getLogs` returns an empty array of logs\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\r\nTry to query `rpcdaemon` for the block that didn't pass the `LogIndex` stage with the following payload:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n\"method\": \"eth_getLogs\",\r\n    \"params\":[\r\n              {\"blockhash\": <hash>,\r\n               \"topics\":[\"0xddf252ad1be2c89b69c2b068fc378daa952ba7f163c4a11628f55a4df523b3ef\"],\r\n              }],\r\n    \"id\": 0,\r\n}\r\n```",

If you use a node to constantly retrieve data this is crucial. For example, block explorers or DEX screeners rely on data from logs and right now they may miss some data if they use Erigon nodes. It's better to receive the data with a small delay rather than not to be sure about the data.",

    "body": "@alexqrid i think it's leak of abstractions (who care about this low level implementation details). It just must not brake sync. \r\n\r\n@Har01d - best way to solve it: subscribe to \"new headers\" event - it triggered after commit. It means if you call `eth_getLogs` after receive \"new headers\" event - it for sure committed. (\"new headers\" - it's historical name of event from geth). \r\nFYI: there is also \"new logs\" event as I remember.\r\nBy websocket: https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interacting-with-geth/rpc/pubsub \r\n ",
