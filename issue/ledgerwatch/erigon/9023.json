  "body": "# Issue: Implement Deneb Ethereum Hard Fork in Caplin Client\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\nThis issue tracks the implementation of the Deneb Ethereum hard fork within the Caplin Ethereum client. The Deneb update includes various improvements and changes that need to be integrated into our client to maintain compatibility with the Ethereum network.\r\n\r\n## Goals\r\n- Ensure full compatibility with the Deneb Ethereum hard fork.\r\n- Implement new Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) introduced in Deneb.\r\n- Test the integration thoroughly to ensure stability and performance.\r\n\r\n## Tasks\r\n- [ ] Review the Deneb hard fork specifications and list relevant EIPs.\r\n- [ ] Update the Ethereum client codebase to integrate new EIPs.\r\n- [ ] Conduct unit testing for each new feature.\r\n- [ ] Set up an integration testing environment to simulate the Deneb hard fork.\r\n- [ ] Perform end-to-end testing to ensure compatibility and stability.\r\n- [ ] Prepare documentation for the updates.\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n- Detailed specifications of the Deneb hard fork.\r\n- Access to Ethereum test networks for testing purposes.\r\n\r\n## Discussion Points\r\n- Any specific challenges anticipated in integrating certain EIPs?\r\n- Timeline and milestones for the implementation.\r\n\r\n## Additional Resources\r\n- [Deneb Hard Fork Specification](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/deneb/beacon-chain.md)\r\n- [Ethereum EIP Repository](https://eips.ethereum.org/)\r\n---\r\n\r\nPlease add any further details, questions, or resources that might be helpful. Team members are encouraged to update this issue with progress reports and any challenges faced during implementation.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nin the folder `cl/spectest` there is a folder with consensus specification tests, modify the Makefile as to not remove deneb and run the tests with make mainnet. make simply all the specification tests pass\r\n",
