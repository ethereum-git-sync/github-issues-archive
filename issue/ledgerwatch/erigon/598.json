  "body": "Presently, stage 5 starts with the Plain State representation in the DB bucket and converts it to a Hashed State representation in the DB bucket. It will work in 3 modes:\r\n1. Initial (clean) transformation. When Hashed State is empty, stage 5 walks over the Plain State item by item, applies `Keccak256` to the key and inserts into the Hashed State (indirectly, via ETL mechanism)\r\n2. Incremental transformation. When Hash State was left at the block `X` from the previous cycle of staged sync, and now stage 4 finished with the block `Y`, where `Y > X`, stage 5 needs to advance (promote) the Hashed State to what it should be at block `Y`. To do that, it needs to aggregate keys from Change Sets for all blocks from `X` to `Y` (to detect which keys have changed), and fetch corresponding values from the Plain State to construct the incremental change that needs to be applied to the Hashed State (also via ETL mechanism, because the gap between `X` and `Y` could be large).\r\n3. Unwinding. It mostly reverses the effect of mode 2 (with some nuances).\r\n\r\nAll these transformations are resulting in the database changes. We however also need to maintain in-memory trie cache in order to perform quick evaluation of the state root hash, as well as to support transaction validation in the transaction pool, and mining.\r\nTherefore, we need the stage5 to also have a \"resident\" (surviving between the staged sync cycles) trie cache, which is probably going to be most of the code taken from `TrieDbState`. It can begin totally cold when the process start, but then warm up when incremental changes applied in the mode 2.",
