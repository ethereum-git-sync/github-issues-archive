  "body": "Can't seem to find this in the documentation. \r\n\r\nErigon is currently on [10/15 CallTraces] Pruning call trace table. \r\n\r\nDid not specify pruning when launching erigon. Is this normal behavior?\r\n\r\nThis stage is extremely slow, slower than Execution stage. Been on this stage for an entire week now. Using an AWS io3 disk with really high throughput/iops.\r\n\r\nIf i exit the sync at this stage to restart the server for whatever reason, will it restart from stage 1/15? The server was accidentally restarted during execution stage near the very end and it had to restart from block 0 so not sure if this behavior applies per stage or the entire process.",
