    "body": "Hi thought I'd let you know of the following running current dev branch.\r\n\r\nRan a brand new sync without external CI and it synced up to block 15,999,999 processing all blocks. I naively presumed it was then syncing as it kept grabbing all headers up to date with my geth node and with etherscan.\r\n\r\nOnly when I tried to grab later blocks using RPC did I see that according to the node last block was 15,999,999. It wasn't until I used external CI that I saw it actually grabbed blocks from 16,000,000 onwards.\r\n\r\nIt looks like a code-path is being missed perhaps just during initial sync from zero?  I can send logs if you think they'll help. What I will try and do is once fully synced using external CI I will switch back to using internal to see what happens. Thought I'd comment here on this ticket as I see you're working on the code rather than opening up new one. Cheers.",
