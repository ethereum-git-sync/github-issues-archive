    "body": "Hi. Thank you. Probably I will deny this FR. By next reasoning: \r\n1. We are public software - it means other people using us and then doing bug-reports - \"full path to file\" will reveal details of their internal infrastructure (paths on server). \r\n2. We are public software - which often used by \"unskilled\" users - showing trace will only confuse them. If we will show human-friendly error message - likely they will self-help and not come to Bug-tracker. But showing human-friendly message with stack - likely will just scare them and they will not read the message.\r\n3. We have much C code. It means most of important errors - anyway will have limited stack. \r\n4. In my (personal) experience - having more context (more variables in error message) is more useful than knowing trace. \r\n5. In my (personal) experience - most complicated for debugging errors (like state-root miss-match) are well-known - everybody know where it happening, but anyway it may take days to debug them. \r\n6. We already have some self-made system of pre-definedÂ error-prefixes/logs-prefixes to understand which sub-system produced this log/error. \r\n\r\nPros: \r\n- actually we have 2-3 places in code - where having stack is super-useful, we added it there. For example: `erigon-lib/kv/mdbx/kv_mdbx.go` has func `dbg.Stack()`\r\n",
