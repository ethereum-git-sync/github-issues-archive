  "body": "We would like to experiment with an alternative data structure to maintain the cache of the Ethereum state. The new structure needs to be able to perform all the functions that `trie.Trie` currently does, as efficiently (in most cases), and hopefully to simplify a lot of this, because it will be close the the data structure in the database.\r\n\r\nThe structure proposed is a sorted map. Entries in the map are of the 3 varieties, each variety corresponds to a bucket in the database:\r\n1. Account leaves. Keys for these entries are the address hashes of the corresponding accounts. These entries are caching the bucket `AccountsBucket`\r\n2. Storage leaves. Keys for these entires are the concatenations of the address hash of the contract accounts and the hashes of the storage locations. These entries are caching the bucket `StorageBucket`\r\n3. Intermediate hashes. Keys for these buckets are the prefixes of the keys used in other two buckets.\r\n",
