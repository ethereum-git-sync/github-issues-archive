  "body": "Since all of the files required for snapshot sync are already shared via BitTorrent - it would be cool if a node started with missing snapshot data could identify the missing pieces and re-download.\r\n\r\nI attempted to test if this was possible by simply moving all of the `v1-013000-013500*` files to a different folder then starting Erigon, hoping Erigon would notice that the files were missing and re-download them. However, I got the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] [07-13|21:19:32.269] [Snapshots] Fetching torrent files metadata \r\n[EROR] [07-13|21:19:32.299] Staged Sync                              err=\"[1/16 Headers] ReopenSegments: snapshot missed: from 13000000 to 13500000\"\r\n[INFO] [07-13|21:19:33.033] [Snapshots] Fetching torrent files metadata \r\n[EROR] [07-13|21:19:33.064] Staged Sync                              err=\"[1/16 Headers] ReopenSegments: snapshot missed: from 13000000 to 13500000\"\r\n```\r\nRepeating\r\n\r\nThis would make sharing full archive node snapshots easier, as we wouldn't have to re-distribute and duplicate the storage of these files that are already shared by lots of nodes.",
