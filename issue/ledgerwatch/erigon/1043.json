  "body": "Currently `rpcdaemon` doesn't seem to have very intuitive logging.\r\n\r\nUnder normal verbosity (INFO) the only things that really get logged are `WARN` messages. Successful RPC calls are not logged as far as I can tell.\r\n\r\nUnder higher levels of verbosity (5=detail) I might get something like this:\r\n```\r\nDEBUG[09-03|20:30:27.826] Served eth_getBlockByNumber              conn=47.186.101.185:53502 reqid=1560785948 t=100.562645ms\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat feels like an INFO to me, not a DEBUG. I would expect a DEBUG to include the actual parameters that were served (E.G. the block number, and the bool in this case).\r\n\r\nEven turning on `--debug` didn't change the output of the above \r\n\r\nUltimately I would like to be able to record both successful and failed RPC requests, including their parameters. I can set whatever verbosity or debug is required, but I also feel like there's room for improvement in general for the default.",
