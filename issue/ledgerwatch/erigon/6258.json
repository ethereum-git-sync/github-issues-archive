Depending on the state of the node, the traces that I'm extracting can hold the wrong information. I find that out later in my ETL processes.\r\n\r\nReextracting the traces that had the wrong information solve the issue. So, here is my question, how can I be sure that a block range is really finalized with a rpc query? Or is it a bug in erigon?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for the support.\r\n",

    "body": "Thank you @quickchase and @AskAlexSharov ,\r\nAs Quickchase mention, I think that is the issue we faced (#6125 ). I had wrong status in my Traces (error instead of success) and sometime wrong value related to internal transaction in the traces too.\r\n\r\nAlso, when the node is syncing, I'm using the Finished stage height as the max height to extract. But when eth_syncing returns False, I'm relying on eth_blockNumber.\r\n\r\nAnd thank you for explaining the sync cycle and db transaction. It helps me better understand the internal of Erigon. I'm thinking to become a contributor on this project at some point.",
