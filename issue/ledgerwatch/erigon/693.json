  "body": "Currently stage 2 is initiated by the code in `eth/downloader/stagedsync.go`, and it eventually calls `InsertChain` function on the `BlockChain` object (it is in the `core/blockchain.go`), to insert the blocks. In order to avoid executing them and doing other things, it passes `execute` parameter as `false`.\r\n\r\nThe code of `insertChain` from `core/blockchain.go` needs to be copy/pasted into `eth/stagedsync/staged_bodies.go` and trimmed to only include the logic for `execute=false`. This would allow simplification and fixing some bugs, like: https://github.com/ledgerwatch/turbo-geth/issues/609",
