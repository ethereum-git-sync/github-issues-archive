  "body": "#### System information\r\n\r\nErigon version: 2022.99.99-dev-c66bde2d\r\n\r\nOS & Version: Windows 10\r\n\r\nCommit hash : 1e3ad39202bce335e7ec122f6242e6d4a75efabc\r\n\r\n#### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nSuccessful snap-sync of Ethereum mainnet with a RAM consumption of less than 4 Gb\r\n\r\n#### Actual behaviour\r\n\r\nYesterday, my erigon client made it past the phase where it downloads the 200+ Gb snapshot. I then shut it down using ctrl + c. Now, a day later, when I run erigon I get stuck at an error message shortly after startup saying access is denied when attempting to rename xxx-hearders.idx.tmp files to xxx-headers.idx. This error message repeats forever and prevents the client from syncing.\r\n\r\nAnother issue I have with the client is that it consumes an enormous amount of RAM. According to the github readme, erigon should use about 4 Gb of RAM during sync and about 1 Gb during normal work. But my client uses way more than that, generally between 8 - 14 Gb.\r\n\r\nThis is the way I run the client:\r\n\r\n`erigon --syncmode=snap --datadir=D:\\ETH_mainnet_erigon --port=0 --torrent.port=30303`\r\n\r\nHere are the logs when I run it:\r\n\r\n```\r\nINFO[05-20|14:28:33.046] Build info                               git_branch=devel git_tag=v2021.10.03-1106-g1e3ad3920

Have you tried reboot ?\r\n\r\n1) I have checked the task manager and only one erigon.exe instance is running.\r\n\r\n2) I use a .bat file that starts erigon from the command prompt. I used the .bat file both when I initially started erigon to download the snapshot and now when I run it. When I built erigon.exe however, I used powershell. This is the content of the .bat file:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd D:\\erigon\\build\\bin\r\nerigon --syncmode=snap --datadir=D:\\ETH_mainnet_erigon --port=0 --torrent.port=30303\r\npause\r\n```\r\n\r\n3) When I built erigon.exe in Powershell I used admin privileges, but after that I always run erigon in a regular, non-admin, command prompt using the .bat file. I have just now also tried to start erigon from a command prompt with admin privileges, but I got the same error message.\r\n\r\n4) Yes I have tried to reboot.\r\n",
