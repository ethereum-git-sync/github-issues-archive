  "body": "Note: I encountered the issue via using `ethereum-etl` and scanning through every tx in every block, but the response is replicable via the python `web3` package, too (so I think it's probably an issue with `erigon`). For me, it's reliable for certain blocks (like 209101, 209102, and 209104, but not 209103). It seems to only happen for early blocks -- the last block that triggers this issue is 765998.\r\n\r\nFor my purposes, this isn't a big deal, but something isn't right. I'm happy to answer Qs on my setup.\r\n\r\nI am using `--prune=hc`.\r\n\r\nIt *seems* as though, if a block is effected, then all txs in that block are effected.\r\n\r\n#### System information\r\n\r\nErigon version: `2021.11.3-alpha`\r\n\r\n(Also happened with a build from around Nov 28 or earlier)\r\n\r\nOS & Version: Linux\r\n\r\nCommit hash : \r\n\r\n`INFO[01-12|xx:xx:xx.xxx] Build info    git_branch=devel git_tag=v2021.12.03    git_commit=0a31443353b4937b8ead284f2c1e9b1768085820`\r\n\r\n#### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nThe transaction receipt is returned.\r\n\r\n#### Actual behaviour\r\n\r\n`null` is returned instead (the jsonrpc `result` is `null`)\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\r\n\r\nUsing the python `web3` package (the assert fails):\r\n\r\n```python\r\nassert w3.eth.getTransactionReceipt(\"0x035ed34d076f9b9313ccd5016c0ae0508fc9753780f2517e8ebd28ca5b981b4d\") is not None\r\n```\r\n\r\nraw jsonrpc request:\r\n\r\n`{'jsonrpc': '2.0', 'method': 'eth_getTransactionReceipt', 'params': ['0x53e1ee328cd7ba21941a4ca4c9c75b4b46ca7d538c4c0986b048301d2f7e6e4b'], 'id': 0}`\r\n\r\n(note: there are many txids for which this issue occurs -- I have a record of the block numbers and transaction numbers for all instances, tho. example log for blocks between 200k and 300k: https://gist.github.com/XertroV/9d9cd26e607d4c7560be8efb8cc646f9)\r\n\r\n#### Backtrace\r\n\r\nN/A",
