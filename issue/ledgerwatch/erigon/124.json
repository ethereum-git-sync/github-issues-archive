  "body": "Currently `trie.Resolver` supports historical mode, where it reads the range of keys from the history \"As Of\" given block number. The efficiently of such operation declines with the growth of the historical buckets.\r\n\r\nAlternative approach, which should work more efficiently for the cases where the \"As Of\" point is not too far into the past, is to utilise change-sets in the `SUFFIX` bucket, and effectively rewind the range of the current state while resolving. This should help answer queries related to snapshot sync Red-Queen/Firehose protocol, as well as light server support in the future.\r\n\r\nIssue https://github.com/ledgerwatch/turbo-geth/issues/123 provides a way to perform such partial rewind efficiently because binary search on the change sets becomes possible\r\n",
