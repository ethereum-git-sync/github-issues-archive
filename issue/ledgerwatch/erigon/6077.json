    "body": "@Giulio2002 Whether something is a breaking change is not subjective. I upgraded erigon recently on dozens of machines and for my existing setup it was definitely breaking.\r\n\r\nAnd what @dylancaponi meant by ETH ethos: There is a clear reason why the CL is promoted as its own system. You know that there are already many parts of the EL that might be considered a separate product (and you can run most of them individually using erigon). The clear differentiator with the CL mentality is giving the feeling to all node providers that you actually have to choose. This implicitly leads to client diversity which is crucial for reasons we all know.\r\n\r\nJust to add my 2 cents: I think seeing erigon as \"the one binary you run to spin up your own Ethereum node\" is a good philosophy that might even increase decentralization as it's also easy enough to run for people who don't care enough to actually spend a lot of time with it. Though, adding an explicit statement in the README that it is preferable to choose one of all the existing CL clients manually and a link to the client diversity page wouldn't hurt.\r\n",

But does this\nmean there cannot be simple but powerful suggestions to make it even better?\nBeing as old as it already is, erigon can easily adapt at least documenting\nbreaking changes. Nobody asks for no breaking changes at all. We understand\nthat being able to introduce breaking changes keeps you more agile.\nBut to be honest, the approach of telling people \"it’s alpha software, fuck\noff\" led to Nethermind overtaking erigon quite impressively. Keep it up if\nthat’s your goal.\n\nOn Tue, 23 May 2023 at 21:33, Dylan Caponi ***@***.***> wrote:\n\n> @Giulio2002 <https://github.com/Giulio2002> I like Erigon and want to\n> help it improve.
