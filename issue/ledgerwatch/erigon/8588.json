  "body": "`IPC` - is the way to solve `64k ports exhausing` problem. Companies which running much software per machine or having high RPC - getting this issue very fast. \r\n- 1 Erigon node can stand very high RPC load (especially on NVMe). RPC load can spikes. \r\n- OS is not efficient at handling TCP with multiple applications establishing and persistent connections from those applications, coupled with external connections - and at high req/sec rate. \r\n- other software (indexing: trublocks/thegraph, monitoring, etc...) also using ports. \r\n\r\nToDo: \r\n- To port geth's IPC implementation - we using `80%` of geth's RPC server. See: `IPCPathFlag`,  `Node.Config.IPCEndpoint()`, `StartIPCEndpoint`. I guess we can be just 100% compatible here - until we find something critical. \r\n- Add 1 more flag: `--ipc.api` - which working same way as `--http.api` - does limit which RPC namespaces are available over `IPC` \r\n\r\n---- \r\nSome cons and opinions of having IPC (will not copy it here - because it was published in private channel):  https://discord.com/channels/687972960811745322/897877410131902464/1007258281535869029 \r\n\r\n ",
