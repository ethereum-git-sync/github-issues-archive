  "body": "When block witnesses are serialised, the keys for the `LEAF` and `ACCOUNTLEAF` instructions are recorded in their \"expanded\" form. For example, even though an original key was `0x847f`, the expanded key (for hex tries) would be `0x0804070f`, which inflates all the keys by factor of 2. For binary tries, the key would be `0x01000000000100000001010101010101`, with 8-fold inflation.\r\nThe solution is to write non-inflated keys, perhaps prepended by the number of \"nibbles\" that are present (because we might be dealing with the keys that, say, have only three nibbles, for example, an expanded form`0x090402` can be \"compressed\" back to `0x9420`, but from that compressed form it is not clear whether it is encoding 3-nibble key or 4-nibble key).\r\n",
