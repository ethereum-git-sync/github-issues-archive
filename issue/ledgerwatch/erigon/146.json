  "body": "These tests are failing apparently due to the situation that can never be observed on the mainnet (or testnet):\r\n\r\n1. A contract with existing code and storage is inserted into the genesis state\r\n2. In the first block, the contract gets self-destructed, and then, in the same block, it gets redeployed (with `CREATE2` opcode invocation) on the same address.\r\n\r\nNormally, this re-creation in the same block as self-destruction is not possible, because:\r\n1. When new contracts are created, their `nonce` starts with 1, not 0 (whereas if you insert them into the genesis state, their `nonce` is 0).\r\n2. The check in https://github.com/ledgerwatch/turbo-geth/blob/3e6811277df88fea941aaa1478847880e9514a09/core/vm/evm.go#L400\r\ndoes not allow a new contract being deployed at an address where there is an account with `nonce` != 0 and non-empty hash\r\n3. The self-destructed contract actually gets removed from the state only at the end of the block, so if its `nonce` is not 0, it will prevent any re-creation within the same block. Although its code hash is considered empty, because of the code here: https://github.com/ledgerwatch/turbo-geth/blob/3e6811277df88fea941aaa1478847880e9514a09/core/state/intra_block_state.go#L566 :\r\n````\r\nfunc (sdb *IntraBlockState) getStateObject(addr common.Address) (stateObject *stateObject) {\r\n\t// Prefer 'live' objects.\r\n\tif obj := sdb.stateObjects[addr]; obj != nil {\r\n\t\tif obj.deleted {\r\n\t\t\treturn nil\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\treturn obj\r\n\t}\r\n````\r\n\r\n",
