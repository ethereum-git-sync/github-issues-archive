  "body": "In order to support RPC `debug_traceTransaction` call, and for other tracing facilities, we have this file: https://github.com/ledgerwatch/turbo-geth/blob/master/core/state/readonly.go\r\n\r\nIt defines type `DbState` that is similar to `TrieDbState`, but does not have any functionality to write to the database, and also it does not have the trie cache.\r\n\r\nWe would like to use it to retrace all historical transactions, in the way it was used in here: https://github.com/ledgerwatch/turbo-geth/blob/master/cmd/state/stateless/naked_accouts.go\r\n\r\nBut without actually calculating the naked accounts etc.\r\n\r\nIn order to make sure that the execution is correct, we need to extend `DbState` type to track account changes and contract storage changes during an execution of a block, so that at the end of the block, we can compare them with what we have in the `ChangeSet` buckets.\r\n\r\nNOTE: The part that collects changes and compares to `ChangeSet` buckets needs to be optional, so when we are sure the execution works correctly, we turn it off for better performance",
