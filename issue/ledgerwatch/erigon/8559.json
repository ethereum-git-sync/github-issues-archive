The silkworm followed this design. \r\n\r\nThis caused some issue when we are using silkworm with blockscout. The blockscout devs seems think the two field should be mutually exculsive. https://github.com/blockscout/blockscout/issues/8623\r\n\r\nI think it would be worth figuring out what the standard or de facto standard is in this case. \r\n\r\nThanks",
