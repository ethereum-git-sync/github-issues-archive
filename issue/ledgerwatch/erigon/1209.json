You may import that file into Postman to use it.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5417918/95521715-342d6000-0998-11eb-9213-b349afae5606.png)\r\n\r\nPostman is great because it automatically generates docs and can be used for performance testing. We can copy the results of the auto documentation into the ReadTheDocs documentation and/or link to it.\r\n\r\nI'll make a PR to track progress.",
