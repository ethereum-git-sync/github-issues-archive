  "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nMy name is Alex and I am working on [ECIP-1049](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/13)! This ECIP changes the Proof of Work of the Ethereum Classic network **from Ethash to SHA3 (Keccak256)**. SHA3 is capable of much higher block validation and hashing speeds than Ethash, and can greatly reduce the complexity of nodes and mining hardware. It is a Proof of Work scaling solution. \r\n\r\nEthash has also not worked in being ASIC-resistant, and the community has decided to move on from it since it is now technical debt that requires excess memory to mine (3.2GB) and a pseudo-random cache to validate (50+ MB just to calculate)\r\n\r\nPeer-reviewed analysis has shown SHA3 has over 4x the efficiency per hash over Bitcoin SHA2:\r\n\r\n![1_L_2QA8lRxyWpPLk84k5DRg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2533512/68529603-5f15bc80-02ce-11ea-9e63-cb0baea722f5.png)\r\n\r\nSo far we have created a SHA3 testnet, called \"Astor Network\" which was made from a forked Parity Ethereum client. This network is ETH based, and can be found [here](https://github.com/antsankov/parity-ethereum/blob/sha3/astor.json). We also have created an proof of concept CPU [Toy Miner](https://github.com/antsankov/ethereum-cpu-miner). \r\n\r\nIs Turbo-geth interested in supporting this network?\r\n\r\nExtra Materials:\r\n* [Astor Testnet Site](https://astor.host)\r\n* Talk I gave to the ETC Community in [Vancouver in 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV9_RaUFZWQ)",

I have been following some of your work on SHA3 mining online, and heard of the test net.\r\nWe did think about the ETC support, and I am sure it would be possible, but it is not currently our priority. Our priority is to make turbo-geth fully functional and \"ship\" it, then produce documentation on how other implementations can migrate to our data model, which I believe offers superior trade-offs.\r\n\r\nWe would definitely be interested in contributions that would enable turbo-geth to connect to ETC network, but we cannot currently accommodate this work ourselves.\r\nHope this helps, Alexey",
