Documentation on how to successfully fork, add a custom chainspec (e.g. https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon/pull/2733) and run a custom erigon binary.\r\n2. Load a custom chainspec that includes AuRa specific config, Genesis information and bootnodes info. Similar to the OpenEthereum style of loading configs. Not sure if this is already supported in erigon.\r\n\r\nAre you willing to implement this feature?\r\n\r\nFor approach 1, if it is possible, yes. I am willing to add a Wiki/Doc entry\r\n\r\nRelated issues:\r\n\r\n- #3643 ",
