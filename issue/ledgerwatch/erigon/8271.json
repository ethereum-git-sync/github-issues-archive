    "body": "1–2 hours in, I tentatively appear to be having quite substantial success by using a cronjob to restart Erigon every 25 minutes. My outbound traffic is a fraction of what it previously was, yet I have not noticed a substantial reduction in my attestation success percentage.\r\n\r\nIn my specific case, I am using very performant hardware, and the full restart-cycle completes in under a minute. I mention this because restart-time would be a big factor which other stakers must consider.\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying that this solution is at best a stopgap.",
