This class may have own mutex. \r\n\r\nSuch change will: \r\n- reduce amount of TxPool's mutex lock/unlock - because method `IdHashKnown` can call method of UnprocessedList first and only if it returns false - lock TxPool mutex and check in txpool.\r\n- Method `AddRemoteTxs` will not lock TxPool mutex anymore \r\n- Only important thing: need call methods of new UnprocessedList - outside (before) of pools mutex lock/unlock\r\n\r\n",
