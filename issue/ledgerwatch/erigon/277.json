  "body": "Running `stateGrowth` for the recent database and using 30 Gb virtual machine did not succeed.\r\nAlso, when run remotely, it ends up holding the remote db for too long, causing the explosion of the database.\r\nThe algorithm needs to be reworked, perhaps we can achieve consistency without running a very long remote transaction. For example, we can first decide the cut-off block, read the current state under one transaction, but then read history in many transactions, filtering out the records that must have appeared after the cut-off block.",
