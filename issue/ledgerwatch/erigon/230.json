  "body": "One unpleasant thing about memory mapping of the database file in boltdb is that BoltDB needs to obtain the exclusive lock on the database before it can execute the sequence of undoing the memory map and re-mapping with the new size. If there is a long read-only transaction going on at that time, the server's write transaction will have to wait for the remote transaction to finish before it can proceed.\r\nIs there a way to work around this?\r\n\r\nSome discussion from 2015 about it: https://github.com/boltdb/bolt/issues/392\r\n",
