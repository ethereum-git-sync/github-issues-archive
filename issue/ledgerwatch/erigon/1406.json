  "body": "**Only happens against the call-trace branch**\r\n\r\n### Discussion:\r\n\r\nOE appears to ignore errors when tracing where, if the call was actual call, an error would have occurred. TurboGeth does not ignore such errors.\r\n\r\nFor the following `curl` command, which is a simple ETH transfer, OE returns what appears to be a valid trace. TurboGeth returns an error. Note that the send has no ETH. If one 'zeros out' the `value`, TurboGeth returns a valid trace.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure which behavior is correct, but in any case TG does not reproduce OE. I think OE may have a bug here (see below).\r\n\r\n### Difference:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5417918/101991799-0527b900-3c7d-11eb-856d-6b96edd19ae4.png)\r\n\r\n### Curl Command:\r\n\r\n```[bash]\r\ncurl -s --location --request POST --header 'Content-Type:  application/json' --data-raw '{\"jsonrpc\":  \"2.0\",\"method\":  \"trace_call\",\"params\":  [{\"from\":  \"0x407d73d8a49eeb85d32cf465507dd71d507100c1\",\"to\":  \"0xa94f5374fce5edbc8e2a8697c15331677e6ebf0b\",\"value\":  \"0x186a0\"},[\"trace\"],\"0x186a0\"],\"id\":  \"1\"}' http://localhost:8545\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\n\r\nThis appears to only happen with state-changing `trace_call` invocations. If one modifies the `value` field of the request, TG returns a valid trace, even it's slightly different than OE (but this is a separate issue).\r\n\r\n### Expected:\r\n\r\nIt's not totally clear to me which result is correct. I think Parity may have a bug. [This test case](https://github.com/Great-Hill-Corporation/trueblocks-core/blob/develop/src/other/trace_tests/curl_tests/tests/trace_call_stateDiff.json) with [results here](https://github.com/Great-Hill-Corporation/trueblocks-core/blob/develop/src/other/trace_tests/curl_tests/expected/trace_call_stateDiff.json) shows, that for the same invocation, OE is reporting that the balance of the receiving account is modified which is incorrect since the sending account has no ETH.\r\n",
