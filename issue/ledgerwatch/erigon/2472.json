I don't see how ETH2 helps the discussion as the whole point of their sharding system is to accommodate many more states.\r\n\r\nI think if you really have no answer it should be part of the README, that this will eventually have the same issues as syncing an archival node on go-ethereum as gas limits increase to accomodate more states (while using less a lot storage space than the current version of go-ethereum). Right now it seems like even the benchmark with that intel chipset is just outdated or just not a good metric as the variables will always change rapidly.",

    "body": "> Ah, wow didn't realize geth had gotten that ridiculous!\r\n\r\nTo be fair geth **is not** ridiculous. Its code base has proven solid and the fact still holds >80% of network nodes share tells something. The fact is getting slower and slower (like **any other** ethereum node software) is due to the protocol design which does not scale well and, of course, the ever growing number of smart contracts transactions can interact with. In addition geth has followed a design pattern which is very orthodox to the original Yellow paper. Kudos to @AlexeyAkhunov for having rethought how to persist chain data internally.\r\n\r\nBesides, though we renamed to Erigon to state our difference, there probably wouldnt' be any Erigon if it wasn't for geth.\r\n\r\n> I have a 4GHz 8 core CPU being used at 20% for most of the 7/18 state syncing phase. I was wondering if that could be utilized more heavily as well as if there was room to offload some aspect to GPU processor its RAM - ultimately to speed things up. Speed up processing time by a few hundred percent, decreasing time by 75%\r\n\r\nTaking advantage of full computation capacity of your hardware would be nice to have: unfortunately the rules of the chain make it either impossible or heavily limit this. Multicore processing is possible when **parallel computation is possible** which, in most of stages, actually isn't. Basically every processed block needs data from the previous one(s) process hence linear computation is the only way to go. Besides most of operations are IO intensive rather than computation intensive: parallelization of IO intensive ops generally worsen performances.\r\nUsage of GPU resources would then add a lot of boilerplate code only to handle different types of chips (AMD/OpenCL vs NVIDIA/CUDA) with very arguable benefits: GPUs are good at parallel tasks (which we don't have).\r\n",

    "body": "@AndreaLanfranchi  @AskAlexSharov  Thanks. This is something I was just about to come comment about. Regarding future optimizations and youtube videos I'm not sure what I'm looking for, I watched the ETHLondon interview from last October which seems to be the most recent and basically Alex you are saying that you aren't sure if Erigon will lead to more accessibility of running a node or simply lead to more use cases of Ethereum networks that. But my observation, just like Andrea says, is that Erigon+TurboGeth is only a few percentage points of all reported nodes.\r\n\r\nRegardless, what video about future optimizations or possibilities should I be looking for? The ones that are a few years old now I'm assuming are irrelevant, especially after the grant helps you accelerate development.",

Give us time. You can't compare us to geth (yet) but is important to note we're the third node in the rank and also thank to gnosis plans about openethereum we expect to grow even more rapidly. Note we're on the market since less than a year and already surpassed other \"new\" projects like Nethermind\r\n",

    "body": "@AndreaLanfranchi nice, I recall briefly seeing that headline but didn't connect the dots. You'll zoom to 15% in no time, and that's before the Geth people take notice.\r\n\r\nI have a new question for you then, I've been following Turbo Geth since last year primarily for a better archival node. But the new pruned node is interesting as well.\r\n\r\nGeth nodes are primarily fast-synced and use 1/3rd of the space of an Erigon archival node, and this may be their primary use case. Any thoughts on what would be attractive to Geth nodes? A pruned Erigon node or a full/archival Erigon node?",
