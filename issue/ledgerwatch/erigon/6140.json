  "body": "## context\r\n\r\nMy goal was to attempt to simulate some on-chain activity between two nodes, in order to attempt to measure the effect of long-running RwTx on the MDBX database.\r\n\r\nMy secondary goal was to create an easily replicable scenario that could be run with a single \"go run\"\r\n\r\n## Issues\r\n\r\n1. While I was able to run and pass the test, they were spouting a large amount of errors about the sentry not being able to bind to port 0. This made it hard to read the actual logs\r\n2. The logs directory is sorta arbitrary and annoying to change (along with data). also the numbering was off which was sorta confusing\r\n3. Adding more nodes requires a large amount of added code (miningNodeArgs, nonMiningNodeArgs very specific)\r\n4. Attempting to write a new test resulted in a large amount of repeated code\r\n5. Could not create a new test/simulation without deleting existing code\r\n6. Had to create a fresh chain state every single test, so was unable break up tests into smaller components. It also made debugging & learning a bit difficult\r\n7. No configuration options\r\n8. Cannot test multiple-component erigon (for instance, remote-kv rpcdaemon)\r\n\r\n## Ideas\r\n\r\n1. Is there a reason you are not using erigon/rpc.Client? It is what I usually use when interacting with rpcdaemon and is already in the repo. \r\n2. If the user is using the devnet, likely they can compile erigon themselves. Would it be better to simply require the user to compile? If that is the case, could Exec the binaries, allowing to test other components\r\n3. erigon components natively support loading config from a yaml file, if running the binaries is good idea, perhaps the config could also be used? otherwise, being able to have multiple set of devnet configurations i think is a must.\r\n4. separate test cases from nodes, so test cases can be written as a go program or a go test, or even in another language.\r\n\r\n## what i ended up doing\r\n\r\nI ended up just using a makefile to launch the nodes, so i could easily change the arguments. \r\n\r\n```\r\nsentry01:\r\n\tsentry --datadir=./node1 \\\r\n\t\t--port=30303 \\\r\n\t\t--sentry.api.addr=0.0.0.0:19101\r\n\t\t\r\nrun01:\r\n\terigon --datadir=./node1 --chain=dev \\\r\n\t\t--private.api.addr=localhost:19001 \\\r\n\t\t--sentry.api.addr=0.0.0.0:19101 \\\r\n\t\t--http.api=eth,erigon,engine,admin \\\r\n\t\t--http.port=18501\\\r\n\t\t--dev.period=1\\\r\n\t\t--mine \\\r\n\t\t--torrent.port=42001 \\\r\n\t\t--authrpc.port=18801\r\n\t\t\r\n```\r\n\t\t\r\nthen i deploy contracts and did calls with functions like this\r\n```\r\nfunc main() {\r\n\t// create rpc client\r\n\tc, _ := rpc.Dial(\"http://localhost:18501\")\r\n        nonce, _ :=  getNonce(c) \r\n        deployContract(c,nonce)\r\n\t...\r\n\t\r\n}\r\nfunc deployContract(c *rpc.Client, nonce int) (res common.Hash, err error) {\r\n\ttxn := types.NewContractCreation(uint64(nonce), nil, 1000000, uint256.NewInt(gasPrice), debug_contract)\r\n\tsignedTx, err := types.SignTx(txn, *signer, models.DevSignedPrivateKey)\r\n\tif err != nil {\r\n\t\treturn\r\n\t}\r\n\ts := new(bytes.Buffer)\r\n\terr = signedTx.MarshalBinary(s)\r\n\tif err != nil {\r\n\t\treturn\r\n\t}\r\n\terr = c.Call(&res, \"eth_sendRawTransaction\", \"0x\"+hex.EncodeToString(s.Bytes()))\r\n\tif err != nil {\r\n\t\treturn\r\n\t}\r\n\treturn\r\n}\r\n```\r\nwhere i just dialed to the rpcdaemon.\r\n\r\n## other thoughts\r\n\r\nI realized that docker-compose solves a lot of these issues (logging, storage volumes, launch parameters, port assignments, etc). While that adds a system dependency, i think it would solve a lot of problems for people willing to use it\r\n\r\nHappy to create a bootstrap devnet config for docker-compose if you think that's a good idea.
