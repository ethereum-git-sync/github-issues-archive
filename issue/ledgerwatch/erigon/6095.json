ServiceA must be able to startup, handle requests, handle some work, be responsive, etc... \r\n\r\ncons:\r\n- some stages will get slower on big second cycle: for example stage_hash_state, stage_trie. \r\n- timeout - if some \"real problem\" happen with CL - timeout will hide it. so you may know about it after few days.\r\n- it's not very clear - must EL be \"passive\" or \"active\" (which service will drive the whole workflow forward)\r\n",

    "body": "@AskAlexSharov in response\r\n\r\n> cons:\r\nsome stages will get slower on big second cycle: for example stage_hash_state, stage_trie.\r\n\r\nWhen we sync BSC or Polygon, the first cycle takes like a week (or longer) and during that time Polygon and BSC generate a TON of blocks, but Erigon still handles the second cycle just fine (as far as I can tell). So I'm not sure how much weight to put behind that concern? It can take up to a week to sync the CL from genesis in an Archive sync, I think the time lost from that is far greater than the time lost from having a larger second cycle.\r\n\r\n> timeout - if some \"real problem\" happen with CL - timeout will hide it. so you may know about it after few days.\r\n\r\nI don't know if a timeout is a good idea or not, under normal operating conditions probably not, I was just putting it out as an idea how it might handle the situation on genesis sync.",
