  "body": "In the [RPC Daemon Documentation](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon/blob/devel/cmd/rpcdaemon/README.md#running-remotely), It is mentioned `When RPC daemon runs remotely, by default it maintains a state cache, which is updated every time when Erigon imports a new block. When state cache is reasonably warm, it allows such remote RPC daemon to execute queries related to latest block (i.e. to current state) with comparable performance to a local RPC daemon (around 2x slower vs 10x slower without state cache). Since there can be multiple such RPC daemons per one Erigon node, it may scale well for some workloads that are heavy on the current state queries.`.\r\n\r\n**Background of the question**\r\nRPC Daemon can horizontally scale, necessitating a corresponding scaling of the Erigon nodes when faced with substantial traffic or large resource consumption. I'm thinking to have Erigon nodes and RPC Daemons in N:M relationship with using L4 Load Balancer.\r\n\r\n**My question**\r\nAs explained in the doc, each RPC daemon maintains a cache, refreshing it whenever Erigon imports a new block. My primary concern is if RPC daemon experience cache updates in unexpected manner thereby some performance issue when connecting to multiple remote Erigon nodes behind load balancer (in case not using session persistence) which can have different block sync situation. \r\nAre such scenarios conceivable? or N:M relationship via load balancing is preferred strategy?\r\n\r\n",
