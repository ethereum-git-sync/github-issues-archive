Maybe remove 2nd parameter.\r\n- need more tests for Match method. cover edge cases like: nil, empty []byte, requestKey which is after latest key in file, prefix of existing key, suffix of existing key, prefix of non-existing key, suffix of non-existing key,  very long requestKey, etc...\r\n- `compress/decompress.go` does support uncompressed and compressed files. need tests for both cases. \r\n",
