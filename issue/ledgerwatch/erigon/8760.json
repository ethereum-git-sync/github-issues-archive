  "body": "I have a geth and an erigon node both for running bsc, I find that erigon txpool has much more transactions than geth. May I know what's the magic behind erigon that makes it collects much more transaction from the network?\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon/assets/4777457/80b6a2e7-a3be-405a-8b2a-4e79f753de32)\r\n\r\n\r\nbtw, both clients are using the default txpool size, which are, for geth it's 4096, erigon seems 30_000, I know erigon got set a bigger size, but you could see Geth is far from reaching 4096.\r\nThe two nodes are running in the same subnet, Geth has 66 peers connected and Erigon has 52 peers connected (yea, seems less peers contributes more transactions)",
