  "body": "Current implementation of Intermediate Hashes would not do anything with the entries in the `IntermediateCache` bucket if a contract is self-destructed, and, by the semantics of self-destruct, all storage is presumed deleted (cleared).\r\n\r\nThis was the omission of the initial requirements. In order to resolve this, but to avoid expensive database operation upon self-destruct, the following solution is suggested. We introduce a new type of value in the `IntermediateCache` bucket. We can encode it by `value` being an empty string (as opposed to 32-byte hash at the moment). The meaning of the empty value inserted into the bucket is that the entire subtree corresponding to the prefix is considered deleted\r\n\r\nThese empty values will affect the resolver, making it skip the subtrees that are marked empty.\r\nWhen the storage of the self-destructed contract gets re-written, this will need to \"push down\" the empty values to \"make space\" for the new values. By \"push down\" we meant replacing the existing 32-byte entires on the lower level with empty-valued entries.\r\n\r\nIf we then change the resolver to also skip the entries in the StorageBucket when seeing the empty-valued \"markers\" from the IntermediateCache bucket, we can potentially remove the notion of incarnation altogether.\r\n\r\nWe also need to think about how the background pruner of the current state would work. It needs to gradually push down the empty values and eventually clear out the leaves.",
