  "body": "\r\nLong time ago we added native golang fuzz tests to txpool and other places. But I didn't automate such tests (I didn't know how and Go's fuzzing was not enough mature). Seems now I understood how we can do continuous-fuzzing in Go (fuzz every night a bit, but keep progress between runs).\r\n\r\nGo does store progress in folder: $GOCACHE/fuzz\r\nwe need keep this folder - between test runs (on CI) - as file-cache.\r\nAnd seems we already doing it in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: `~/go/pkg/mod` it's actually `$GOCACHE`\r\n \r\nSo, seems we can create new github actions workflow - run it every night - and fuzz by something like: \r\ngo test -fuzztime=1m -fuzz=FuzzOnNewBlocks ./txpool\r\n\r\nAnd maybe even commit $GOCACHE/fuzz to some git repo (as a backup): it's human-readable text files \r\n\r\nAlso if fuzzing found some crush it adding new file (with crush case) to Erigon's source code: for example \"erigon-lib/txpool/testdata/fuzz/FuzzOnNewBlocks/\". And we need commit/push this new files - then Go will run such cases as usual unit-test (by `go test`).",
