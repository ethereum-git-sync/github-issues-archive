  "body": "# Rationale\r\n\r\nTo be more flexible when dealing with minority forks, while majority forks are invalid (like recent situation on Ropsten)\r\n\r\n# Implementation\r\n\r\nOption `bad.block` is declared here: https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon/blob/143a0d023192290df55eab5c99b7bd30cd2a1435/turbo/cli/flags.go#L153\r\n\r\nIt looks up specified block number as the one to avoid. The problem is that block number may mean different blocks. To be more precise, the `--bad.hash` option is needed. The implementation should mostly be the same as `--bad.block`, but no lookup is needed.",
