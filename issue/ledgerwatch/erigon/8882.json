  "body": "# Implement `blocksByRange` and `blockByRoots` P2P RPC Methods\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\nThis ticket aims to implement two critical P2P RPC methods: `blocksByRange` and `blockByRoots`. These methods are essential for efficient and reliable block retrieval in our blockchain protocol.\r\n\r\n## Goals\r\n- **`blocksByRange` Method**: This method should enable peers to request a range of blocks by specifying a start slot and a count. It will be instrumental in syncing blockchain data and ensuring data integrity.\r\n- **`blockByRoots` Method**: This method should allow peers to request blocks by their root hashes. This is crucial for verifying block information and retrieving specific blocks efficiently.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n- Implement the `blocksByRange` method according to the protocol specification.\r\n  - The method must handle requests for block ranges efficiently.\r\n  - Include error handling for invalid or out-of-range requests.\r\n- Implement the `blockByRoots` method as per the protocol specification.\r\n  - The method should efficiently fetch blocks based on their root hashes.\r\n  - Proper error handling for unknown or missing block roots is necessary.\r\n- Ensure compatibility with the existing P2P layer and data structures.\r\n- Document the implementation, focusing on usage, limitations, and potential improvements.\r\n\r\n## Resources\r\n- Protocol Specification: https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/altair/p2p-interface.md#beaconblocksbyrange-v2, https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/altair/p2p-interface.md#beaconblocksbyroot-v2\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\nConsensusHandler have a database objects to read blocks if you have the slot and the hash. hashes and slots are indexed in an external database engine which is not currently passed `kv.RoDB`, once you pass it through sentinel you can use the `beacon_indicies` package to find hash by slot and vice-versa. to write the beacon blocks in the stream request you can use the `ssz_snappy.EncodeAndWrite(...)`, limit each request to a maximum of 96 blocks. for each block requested increase the rate limiter count by 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
