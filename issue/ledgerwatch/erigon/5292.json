  "body": "#### System information\r\nErigon version: 2022.08.3-alpha\r\nOS: kubuntu\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm trying to run a Polygon full node using Erigon. According to the Polygon documentation, the minimal hardware configuration for that is 1.2 TB SSD in terms of space. To that end, I bought a 2 TB drive to run my node to ensure that I am reasonably future-proof.\r\n\r\nI have now been syncing my node for a few days (its still not done), Erigon’s datadir is the only thing on the drive and it now only has 50 GB of space left!. And the datadir is still growing so any time now I expect that my Erigon node will halt due to being out of space. Which is pretty heartbreaking since I bought the SSD specifically to run a Polygon node.\r\n\r\nWhy is Erigon using hundreds of GB more than what the official Polygon documentation suggests?\r\n\r\nAre there any settings related to pruning/snapshots etc. I can change when running my node that will reduce the hdd space required? What Erigon settings will produce the smallest possible datadir?\r\n\r\nThis is how I currently have Erigon configured:\r\n\r\n`erigon –chain=bor-mainnet --bor.heimdall=https://heimdall.api.matic.network/ --datadir=\"/media/pett3r/M.2 External/polygon_bor_data\" -ws`",

    "body": "> --prune htrc\r\n\r\nThanks, I've looked at the Erigon prune help now, but its still not obvious to me how the flag should be set for a regular Polygon full node. Here is why:\r\n\r\nFrom what I've read, an Ethereum full node (non-archive) normally only stores the 128 most recent states, or only 64 if fast sync is enabled. Which, given that Ethereum has a block time of ~13 seconds, should correspond to roughly 15-30 minutes of data.\r\n \r\nPolygon however, has a much shorter block time of about 2 seconds. Does that mean that a Polygon full node should store somewhere in the region of 400-800 of the most recent states instead of 64/128? Such that the stored data still captures the past 15-30 minutes. Or is it irrelevant how much wall-time the states corresponds to and it should still be 64/128?\r\n\r\nI'm assuming `--prune.h/t/r/c.older` are the appropriate Erigon flags to use for regulating this. Would this then be the correct way of running a Polygon full node:\r\n\r\n`erigon --chain=bor-mainnet --bor.heimdall=https://heimdall.api.matic.network/ --datadir=\"/media/pett3r/M.2 External/polygon_bor_data\" --ws --prune.h.older 128 --prune.t.older 128 --prune.r.older 128 --prune.c.older 128`\r\n\r\nor this?\r\n\r\n`erigon --chain=bor-mainnet --bor.heimdall=https://heimdall.api.matic.network/ --datadir=\"/media/pett3r/M.2 External/polygon_bor_data\" --ws --prune.h.older 800 --prune.t.older 800 --prune.r.older 800 --prune.c.older 800`\r\n\r\nBoth 128 and 800 seems suspiciously far off the default Erigon value of 90000. I would hate to misunderstand this and set the flags wrong again and lose weeks of unnecessary syncing a second time.",
