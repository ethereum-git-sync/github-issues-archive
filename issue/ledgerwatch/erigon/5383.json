Has been running now for 18 hours straight.\r\n\r\nThere is obviously no such endpoint, so I have no idea why it is checking every single port for something that doesn't exist and telling me it doesn't exist 50,000 times.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3518037/190512058-ce74b14c-9b64-4c66-8ba6-95116d81a59d.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\r\nI was trying to prune so I started with `--prune` parameter which apparently set some state which means I can never change the prune parameter again.\r\n\r\nSo to repair this, I deleted my `chaindata` folder and update the `prune` parameters as seen in the command.\r\n\r\nI don't know what ultimately started this behavior or how to fix it.\r\n\r\n`sudo -u erigon ./build/bin/erigon --datadir ~erigon/.ethereum/erigon --http.api web3,eth,erigon,net,txpool --prune.h.before 10000000 --prune.r.before 10000000 --prune.t.before 10000000 --prune.c.before 10000000`\r\n",
