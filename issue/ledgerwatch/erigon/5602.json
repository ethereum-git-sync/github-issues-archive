It seems it is because it is contstantly reorging. \r\n\r\nI am all the time getting ExecutionForkChoiceUpdateFailed in lighthouse and re-org info in erigon.\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\r\nStart erigon with lighthouse, let it sync.\r\n\r\n#### Backtrace\r\n\r\nsee attached files. One contains only logs with re-org string which shows that re-org is happening really all the time.\r\n[logs.txt](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon/files/9695277/logs.txt)\r\n[logs-fork-choice-only.txt](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon/files/9695278/logs-fork-choice-only.txt)\r\n\r\n",
