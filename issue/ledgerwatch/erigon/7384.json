  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI've been syncing the node for the past few days. Everything was going okay, and I thought it was about to finish. Then, my PC froze, so I had to restart it. The sync resumed, but after a few minutes, the PC froze again. I tried restarting it a few more times, but on each time the PC froze again.\r\n\r\nI managed to catch the error once before the PC died:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3414979/234359592-9280cd9f-7121-433d-9d3a-ec7c278dad4a.png)\r\n\r\nAny help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Is this a bug? Maybe the SSD load is too much, and I can limit Erigon's access to it? Should I format the disk and start over?\r\n\r\nI am using Erigon via ETH-docker.\r\n\r\nThanks.",
