  "body": "Hi there,\r\n\r\nLove the great work done on Erigon. Curious if work is actively being done on websocket subscription filters and logs? I know it is in the `TODO`s but I can't find a branch that has made any progress on that front. If there are blockers to completion, it would be great to have transparency into that. We @nascentxyz are working to understand the code so we can potentially contribute in the future, but are new to the repo (but not to geth).\r\n\r\n[@Nascentxyz](https://github.com/nascentxyz) would be willing to create a bounty for this work & potentially do a wider sponsoring of Erigon. On that front, what is the best way to go about that? We didn't find a gitcoin grant nor github sponsoring.",
