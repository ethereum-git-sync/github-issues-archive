  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI am building up my erigorn archive node and noticed that I didnt have the --internalcl flag when I got to block height 18299999. I stopped my docker container, and rebuilt it and I see caplin starting but is simply looping at\r\n\r\n`app=caplin stage=WaitForPeers have=0 needed=4 retryIn=3s`\r\n\r\nIt feels like this could have been a port forwarding or `devel` issue, but I get the same on `v2.55.1` , I'm forwarding the following ports into the docker image from the Internet on both TCP and UDP:\r\n\r\n```\r\n42069,30303,30304,4000,4001,5555,9093,9000,9100\r\n```\r\n\r\n(Some extra as I was trying to debug)\r\n\r\nIs there a port I am missing or something else I should be doing to stop this from being stuck at \"Waiting For Peers\" ?",
