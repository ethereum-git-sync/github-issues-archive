The actual miner field during execution is `0x0` so not only is this a bit misleading, but also causes issues in re-executing transactions for clients that rely on RPC.\r\n\r\nThe official version of Bor populates RPC responses as `0x0`.\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\r\n\r\nInvoke `eth_getBlockByNumber` on a regular Bor node and an Erigon node and compare the `miner` field\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\nReq:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n\t\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\r\n\t\"method\":\"eth_getBlockByNumber\",\r\n\t\"params\":[\r\n\t\t\"0x33d\", \r\n\t\tfalse\r\n\t],\r\n\t\"id\":\"1\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nErigon resp:\r\n`...\"miner\": \"0xb8bb158b93c94ed35c1970d610d1e2b34e26652c\"... `\r\n\r\nBor:\r\n`...\"miner\": \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\"...`\r\n\r\n",
