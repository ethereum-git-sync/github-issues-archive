  "body": "I searched the entire Erigon code base with this command:\r\n\r\n➤ grep Timestamp **/*.go\r\n\r\nit returns 122 occurrence. Notice the lower case 's' for 'stamp'.\r\n\r\nI then searched for \r\n\r\n➤ grep TimeStamp **/*.go\r\n\r\n(upper case 'S'). \r\n\r\nThe upper case 'S' appears only 10 times and in every case, it's in the new code added for `erigon_getBlockByTimeStamp` and its testing support.\r\n\r\nI've argued elsewhere that this routine should be in the `eth_` namespace, and while, I'm not making that argument now, I can see it being added in the future. Removing this inconsistency now would eliminate that entire discussion if this ever did get put in the `eth_` namespace.\r\n\r\nAs demonstrated above, I think most people don't use an upper case 'S' in Timestamp (except maybe in camelCase).\r\n\r\n@enriavil1 \r\n\r\n",
