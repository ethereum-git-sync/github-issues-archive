  "body": "Just providing some feedback / reporting some issues as I read through the flags on the new `alpha` version of Erigon.\r\n\r\n1. What does \"fast\" mean? Isn't default \"Full\"?\r\n```\r\n--syncmode value                   Default: \"snap\" for BSC, Mainnet and Goerli. \"fast\" in all other cases\r\n```\r\n2. Should the `ethash.dagdir` go inside the `datadir` it defaults outside of it?\r\n```\r\n--ethash.dagdir value              Directory to store the ethash mining DAGs (default: \"/home/chase/.local/share/erigon-ethash\") [<invalid Value>]\r\n```\r\n3. I don't think these flag names matches their description...\r\n```\r\n--http.compression                 Comma separated list of virtual hostnames from which to accept requests (server enforced). Accepts '*' wildcard.\r\n--ws.compression                   Comma separated list of virtual hostnames from which to accept requests (server enforced). Accepts '*' wildcard.\r\n```\r\n4. The release notes say that rpcdaemon is included and turned on by default but the flag is `--http` so it seems weird.\r\n```\r\n--http                             Enable the HTTP-RPC server\r\n```\r\n5. Is this a wildcard, a regex, or an exact match? Comma separated?\r\n```\r\n--rpc.accessList value             Specify granular (method-by-method) API allowlist\r\n```\r\n6. Typo!\r\n```\r\n--torrent.upload.rate value        byt,es per second, example: 32mb (default: \"4mb\")\r\n```",

    "body": "1.1. Maybe it's confusion in my head. My head has: \"fast sync\" it's sync algorithm, it can produce Full Node, Archive Node, etc... \"snap sync\" it's also sync algorithm which can produce Full Node, Archive Node, etc... In geth it's 2 cli flags: syncmode and gcmode. \r\n1.2 My intent was to keep some level of compatibility with geth cli flags. So, I re-used syncmode flag. Here is where they changed default --syncmode from fast to snap: https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/03/03/geth-v1-10-0/\r\n1.3 gcmode was not possible to re-use because our prune flag is very different - allow more granularity, etc...\r\n1.4 Our snap sync is not compatible with geth snap sync (not compatible snapshots format and sync protocol). But it's ok, because for end-user it behaves same way.\r\n1.5 I have problem with naming of snap-related flags. Example: `--snap.keepblocks=true --torrent.port=123 --torrent.download.speed=1mb` are all snap sync related flags. Because by design snap sync can work over Bittorrent or over IPFS - but I don't want go for `--snap.torrent.download.speed=1mb`. Maybe you have some ideas. \r\n",
