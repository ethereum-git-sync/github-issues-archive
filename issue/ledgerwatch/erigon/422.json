  "body": "Previously, incarnations were introduced to solve the problem of smart contracts being revived at the same address using `SELFDESTRUCT` `CREATE2` combination. Since we do not wipe out the entire contract's storage during `SELFDESTRUCT` (this could have been a DOS vector), we needed a way of shielding the storage items from before the destruction, so that they do not appear visible anymore.\r\nIncarnations added a fair bit of complexity into the code.\r\nNow, with the introduction of intermediate hashes, and specifically tombstones on the storage, we can remove the notion of incarnation. Now during self-destruct, we would place tombstone on the position of the root of the storage. This tombstone would make the destructed storage invisible.\r\n\r\nCare needs to be taken (and extra tests done) for the retrieval of historical state of contract storage. Currently, the changeSets contain incarnation numbers. If these were removed, we would need to perform an extra check for whether a certain contract is present in the state or not (self-destructed or not created) before accessing the changeset.\r\n",
