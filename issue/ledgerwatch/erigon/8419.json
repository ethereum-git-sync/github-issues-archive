    "body": "Hello sir, is the `--force.partial.commit` never being merged? This is very useful for folks like myself, running a research node on less than ideal hardware. By the time my node finishes processing the snapshots it is 400k blocks behind the tip, and it's slow, taking a few days to do the staged sync. If anything happens meanwhile, I'm back to where the snapshot sync finished (in my case, either power outages or my external ssd overheating and shutting down itself).\r\n\r\nThis doesn't need to be necessarily a flag, but could be auto turned on if the staged sync is going over more than 10k or 100k blocks.",
