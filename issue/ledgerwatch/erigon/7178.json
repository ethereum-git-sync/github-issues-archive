For general questions please use [Erigon's discord](https://discord.gg/hQ2dxbNZ).\r\n\r\nWhen i run an erigon node for Goerli, JSONRPC requests to 8545 fail. But when i run an erigon node with the exact same config for mainnet, JSONRPC requests to 8545 succeed.  This is not explained in the documentation as far as i can tell.  \r\n\r\nIn fact if I run my server in goerli at all and then try to switch back to mainnet, JSONRPC requests also dont work. The only thing that works is a fresh reinstall and config to mainnet.  ",
