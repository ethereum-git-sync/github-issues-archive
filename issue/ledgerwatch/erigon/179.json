  "body": "In order to minimise buffering requirements when producing and interpreting block witnesses, it is more convenient to provide all necessary arguments as operands to the instructions `LEAF`, `ACCOUNTLEAF`, `HASH`, etc.\r\nIt may make `GenStructStep` function more tricky, perhaps IT will need to have tapes instead.\r\n\r\nAnother benefit (and this is how the idea of this change came about initially) is the possibility of describing formal semantics of the block witness stack machine in a way similar to Web Assembly\r\n\r\nThis change will require changing the way `ACCOUNTLEAF` retrieves its arguments. Currently, two of them (nonce and balance) are expected to be provided with the tapes, and another two, Root and CodeHash, are supposed to be on the stack. And the `fieldSet` tells us which of the four present. We need to make it more similar to `BRANCH` instruction. All arguments would need to come from the stack (like in `BRANCH`), and `fieldSet` will be similar to `set` argument in `BRANCH`",
