  "body": "Erigon version: 2.40.1\r\n\r\nHas anyone else noticed that after v2.37.0, it is hard to find peers for the internal lightclient? In v2.37, there were always peers in mainnet (for goerli it is less, but still workable). I have tried v2.38, 2.39 and v2.40, and this is common in the logs:\r\n```\r\n[INFO] [03-10|13:06:47.119] [p2p] GoodPeers                          eth67=33 eth68=33\r\n[INFO] [03-10|13:06:55.574] [LightClient] P2P                        peers=0\r\n```\r\nSometimes it goes up to 1 or 2 then back to 0. As a result, erigon gets stuck, up to days.\r\n\r\n",
