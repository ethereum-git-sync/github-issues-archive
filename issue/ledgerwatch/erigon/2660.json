  "body": "We are working on the support of AuRa consensus in Erigon, and some initial work has been done by @AskAlexSharov to support Sokol POA network. This work needs to continue.\r\n\r\nRecently, it has been difficult to find peers for Sokol networks, so we should try to add support for Kovan to continue our development and testing, under the option `--chain kovan`. For comparison, Kovan and Sokol chainspecs can be found here: https://github.com/openethereum/openethereum/tree/main/crates/ethcore/res/chainspec\r\n\r\nand current spec for Sokol in Erigon here: https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon/blob/71ec0938b5691d34a2d5940c67db62c7d11aa086/params/config.go#L165\r\n",
