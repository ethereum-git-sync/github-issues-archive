I'm having same problem. Thanks\r\n\r\n@darklow @splix \r\nAfter POS transition (the merge), \r\n\r\nErigon or Geth run as Execution Client, and Prysm or Teku runs as Consensus Client.\r\nSo we need to run consensus client from now, and connect it with execution client.\r\n\r\nI've installed prysm (one of beacon chain client) and connected it with erigon.\r\nI used default `--authrpc.xxx` options, and used already generated jwt.hex file which generated by erigon (FYI, jwt file is used for communicating with beacon chain client).\r\n\r\nFor syncing prysm fast, I've also used infura.io and tried [this document](https://docs.prylabs.network/docs/prysm-usage/checkpoint-sync). It works well!",

    "body": "> > @splix @rlaace423 whats your beacon node setup?\r\n> \r\n> I was under impression that Erigon contains everything to run on Goerli. Because `erigon -h | grep beacon` gives nothing and I just expected it would continue to work as it was configured before. I see now that it need a different setup to continue.\r\n\r\nNo, at the moment after “the merge” you need to run two nodes, a consensus layer (beacon node) and execution layer (erigon). And that’s the same for all other ELs too: geth, Nethermind, besu. So make sure your setup is ready to mainnet fork.",
