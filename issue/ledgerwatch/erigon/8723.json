This is so can start implementing reqresp endpoints to serve blocks and blobs.\r\n\r\n# Implementation\r\n\r\nIdeally we want something like prysm has where they also manage how much memory and time can be allocated for requests.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/develop/beacon-chain/sync/rate_limiter.go\r\n\r\nthe underlying data structure they use is a leaky bucket so you can take it from there, what you can do is that whenever we handle a new request:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon/blob/9623b7cefe9a5d5332747f7c8de995187e057035/cl/sentinel/handlers/handlers.go#L87\r\n\r\nWe want to also check if we already reached a limit for that peer and then also account. for now It is fine if we just have something that rate limit our upload rate to other peers, aka how much data is erigon allowed to send to other peers\r\n\r\nI do not really care about the data structure, you can take it from Prysm for as much as it concerns me or you can make your own thing, as long as it works.",
