  "body": "Sentry client subscribes to GRPC \"streams\" of incoming messages.\r\nThose messages are received into a buffered channel:\r\nhttps://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon/blob/devel/cmd/sentry/sentry/sentry_multi_client.go#L181\r\n\r\nThis channel was added in a rush of some bug-fighting.\r\nThe effect of this channel is that processing of the messages is decoupled from receiving a little bit, so receiving doesn't drop messages if they are processed too slow (until the buffer is full, then it has no effect).\r\n\r\nIf the bug was fixed by other means, we can remove this channel, and process immediately.\r\nTo confirm, set the buffer size to 0, and test it with --syncmode=full on some big chain like Mainnet or BSC. Make sure we don't see log messages like \"consuming is slow, drop 50% of old messages\" on debug log level.\r\n\r\nAlternative improvement: keep the goroutine, but read from reqs channel as much messages as we can - and then process this messages in batch - pass batch of requests to lower level funcs.\r\n",
