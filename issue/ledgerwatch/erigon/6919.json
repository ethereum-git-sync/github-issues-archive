  "body": "Afaik, logs with `removed=true` are logs produced on blocks that are eventually uncled. \r\n\r\nI'm processing all logs that ever happened by iterating through blocks + transactions using: `web3.eth.getBlock` and `eth_getBlockReceipts` (<-- awesome btw). \r\n\r\nIs my thinking correct that since `web3.eth.getBlock` will never return uncled blocks (*), there will never be a log in `eth_getBlockReceipts` with `removed=true`\r\n\r\n\r\n*) I think `web3.eth.getBlock` might have produced a block that eventually gets uncled, when asking for blocks on head of chain in a POW-chain (when finality wasn't reached yet). Since mainnet is now POS, even at head of chain there will never be a to-be-uncled block. Is this train of thought correct? \r\n",
