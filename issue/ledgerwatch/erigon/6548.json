  "body": "I have followed the instructions in the Readme and setup Erigon on my home-server which looks to run fine at first.\r\nBut all my bandwidth is completely used up, not even SSH is working anymore.\r\n\r\nAfter killing Erigon, it take 1-2 minute for the internet to work again, sometimes I need to restart my router. \r\n\r\nSo after reading all your documentation, I see you have `torrent.download.rate` and `torrent.upload.rate` parameters. \r\nI try to use them, but my internet connection is still completely blown up. \r\nIts also really slow, like 400KB/s,. I can usually download files at ~ 10MB/s. \r\nNote: Its slow, regardless if I am using those flags or not. Also using standard `geth` I did not have this problem\r\nIs there anything else I can do? Is this only while synching and when I am fully synched it will not use so much bandwidth?\r\n\r\nI am using this command, but nothing changes : \r\n```shell\r\n./erigon --datadir=/some/path --chain=mainnet  --torrent.download.rate=1mb --torrent.upload.rate=1mb\r\n```\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18140070/211666620-8200a312-b97a-4a86-b8c6-d78d2f954f64.png)\r\n\r\n#### System information\r\n\r\nErigon version: `./erigon --version`\r\n```\r\n#  Version: \r\nerigon version 2.32.0-stable-021891a3\r\n```\r\n\r\nOS & Version: **Windows/Linux/OSX[**\r\nUsing Debian Based OS, POP-OS. \r\n\r\n#### Expected behaviour\r\nErigon should use less of my internet, so that my network is still working fine when using the torrent.download and torrent.upload flags\r\n\r\n#### Actual behaviour\r\nIt still seems to use all all available bandwidth and is baraely making any progress[[\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behavior\r\n\r\nInstall erigon and run \r\n`./erigon --datadir=/some/path --chain=mainnet  --torrent.download.rate=1mb --torrent.upload.rate=1mb\r\n`\r\n",
