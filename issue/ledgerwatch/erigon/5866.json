  "body": "#### System information\r\nErigon version: `erigon version 2.28.1-dev`\r\nOS: Ubuntu\r\n\r\nI'm currently in the process of trying to sync an Ethereum mainnet full node (non-archive) with Erigon. According to the system requirements, this should require about 400 Gb in storage.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am still syncing and my Erigon datadir has already exceeded 900 Gb.  So I'm assuming something is wrong. Before switching to Erigon I used Geth, and with Geth the datadir was about 650 Gb when fully synced.\r\n\r\nThis is how I run Erigon:\r\n\r\n```\r\nerigon \\\r\n--chain=mainnet \\\r\n--datadir=\"/media/pett3r/Proj/ETH_mainnet_erigon/\" \\\r\n--prune=htrc \\\r\n--ws \\\r\n--authrpc.port=8552\r\n```\r\nAs you can see I have the prune flag set. Do I need to have any other config flags set to achieve the 400 Gb datadir? Or are my prune flags set incorrectly?\r\n",
