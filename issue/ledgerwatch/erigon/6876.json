  "body": "I would have used the Discord option as stated in the template for \"Ask a question\" but the link is not working. Therefore I ask the question here:\r\n\r\nIs the downloader after the inital staged sync still required? \r\n\r\nIf not, and that would be my guess, why are there so many DNS queries for torrent trackers (see this post https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon/issues/5145)? For me it would only make sense to have the downloader active and query the trackers if it is still in use. Is this really the case? If not maybe this could result in an improvement to disable the downloader after sync?",

So far for me the only solution to restore my network is to completely power down my modem and reset it. When can we have `--torrent.maxpeers` enabled? I feel this may help me as it's mostly from a large number of connections and dns hits that pwns me.\r\n\r\nI'd love to keep seeding cause it's important for Erigon users.
