    "body": "Hello @jhiver and thanks for raising that issue.\r\n\r\nWhile this syntax may be removed, it is currently valid solidity. So I would argue that this is a bug on the brownie side and not in our contract. \r\n\r\nWe usually preferred doing `using xxx for *` than having multiple entries for the same library and different types ... but at some point we considered removing the `using` syntax completely. We will discuss this in light of this possible removal (that would be breaking, so I don't see that happening before solidity 0.9.0)",

    "body": "While i would tend to agree this is more a brownie bug than an OpenZeppelin bug, the practice is discouraged on one hand, and also the philosophy behind the library is to accommodate as much as possible (e.g. what SafeERC20 is doing, fixing broken ERC20 tokens transfers). Besides, previous versions did not use that syntax, so it's kind of a breaking change (it was compiling with previous versions, and no longer is).\r\n\r\nAnyhow, thanks for this wonderful library and have a great day!",
