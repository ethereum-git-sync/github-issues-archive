We will discuss this in light of this possible removal (that would be breaking, so I don't see that happening before solidity 0.9.0)",

Besides, previous versions did not use that syntax, so it's kind of a breaking change (it was compiling with previous versions, and no longer is).\r\n\r\nAnyhow, thanks for this wonderful library and have a great day!",
