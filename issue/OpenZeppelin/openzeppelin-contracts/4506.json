  "body": "**📝 Details**\r\n\r\nCurrently, we reference errors, functions and events from the docs by using the special braces syntax.  Its format was reported as inconsistency in the 5.0 audit report:\r\n\r\n> Throughout the scope (and codebase), events that refer to standard EIP events are mentioned as \"Emits an {IERCxxx-Eventname} event\" in the comments. In some other places, standard EIP events are mentioned as \"Emits an {Eventname}\" instead. For example, in the comments for [upgradeToAndCall](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/8fff875589443c607ac4ef2d201a6d8bec5a43c8/contracts/proxy/utils/UUPSUpgradeable.sol#L91) and [upgradeToAndCallUUPS](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/8fff875589443c607ac4ef2d201a6d8bec5a43c8/contracts/proxy/utils/UUPSUpgradeable.sol#L115), the declaration of the Upgraded event is not consistent.\r\n\r\nFrom @frangio\r\n\r\n> i think we should make it consistent within one contract, at least. within UUPSUpgradeable it's true that we use the 2 conventions in different places. i think we should use the shorter one but it's only doable if the name is in scope iirc\r\n",
