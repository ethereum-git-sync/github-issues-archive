Besides, Solidity has no float types, so it can be quite expected that a division will truncate.\r\n\r\n>  ...adding checks to SafeMath#div ensure there was no truncation.

It's quite easy to scan a contract's code for arithmetic operators, to know where safemath can be potentially missing. If we remove it, we'd need to keep in mind that \"some operators need safemath, others don't\", which increases the risk of forgetting to switch to safemath.\r\n",
