    "body": "Hey @andreafspeziale! These are all great questions that we've thought about thoroughly (I hope!), but I'm not sure if we ever wrote down the answers on GitHub.\r\n\r\n>1. Is there any specific reason why you did not added a Burner role?\r\nI'm thinking about some possibilities like having an ERC20 token acting as a kind of certificate of ownership so for e.g it can be minted and burned only by certain EOA or SC.\r\n\r\nThe idea behind burning is destroying _your_ tokens, which people started doing by transferring to the 0 address: this is simply a more convenient/clear way of doing so. Also, this way we can disallow `transfer` to 0, which may be a mistake (since 0 is the default value for an address), and make this value-destroying action explicit. Could you go into a bit more detail for those scenarios in which a specific address may arbitrarily burn tokens? I'm not convinced that is something general enough to warrant having it here.\r\n\r\n>2. I'm a bit confused about the _internal removeMinter function e.g in the MinterRole.sol.\r\nI should extend it in the parent contract defining the rules for accessing to that function, right?\r\n\r\nYup! We don't provide a way to remove roles by default, since that should be handled by your own application logic (if you want to), but we do provide a method for you to extend so that it's as easy as possible.\r\n\r\n>3. Is reasonable secure that e.g in the Minter role minters can be added by other minters?\r\n\r\nThe rationale behind this is that a minter account can already mint stuff for other people by simply doing what they ask, e.g. off-chain favors. In other words, if you already trust an EOA to mint tokens, you should also trust them to not give that minter role to other accounts. Sort of like how you only share secrets with friends you trust won't tell them to other people :)\r\nIf the minter role was instead given to a smart contract, then this is a non-issue, since the contract either will or won't have a call to `addMinter`, and it is then a matter of trusting the conditions under which it is called.\r\n\r\nHope this helps!",

    "body": "Thanks so much Nico for your time!\r\n1) I don't know if it is a good example but I was thinking about an ERC20 token project. \r\nHaving an amount of 10 token means that you own 10 of some off-chain asset kept safe by the token issuer.\r\nThe token act as a kind of certification.\r\nSo there is an actor that is the only one that can issue or burn that token.\r\nSo as far as you own that off-chain asset you have 10 of that token.\r\nFor redeem the off-chain asset you need to send to the issuer the 10 token.\r\nAt this point you redeem the off-chain asset and the issuer burns the 10 token.\r\n\r\nMaybe it is not an applicable example but It make me think about a Burnable role.\r\n\r\n2) Great it as I've intended it!\r\n\r\n3) The trust towards an EOA for example can change during times.\r\nMaybe before you (as manager / owner ) are able to remove that account as minter the already minter EAO start adding random minters just to screw up everything somehow.\r\n\r\nThanks again!\r\nA.",

    "body": "Hey @andreafspeziale,\r\n\r\nThat first scenario does make sense, but it is supported by the current model :) You could burn your tokens and show that to the issuer, or transfer them to the issuer, and have they burn them.\r\n\r\nRegarding the minter role, transactions are non-reversible in the blockchain world, so you should be very careful as to who you give the role to. That said, if you wanted some sort of mechanism for one account to be able to remove others, you can easily do that by calling the internal `_remove` function.",
