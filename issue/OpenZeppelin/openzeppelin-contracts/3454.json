Tell us what you were trying to do and what happened instead. -->\r\nHi!\r\nI'm trying to install OpenZeppelin contracts via npm into my project and running into an issue when running `yarn install`. I'm hoping someone here can clarify what I'm doing wrong.\r\n\r\n<!-- Remember, this is not a place to ask for help debugging code. For that, we welcome you in the OpenZeppelin Community Forum: https://forum.openzeppelin.com/. -->\r\n\r\n**üíª Environment**\r\n\r\n<!-- Tell us what version of OpenZeppelin Contracts you're using, and how you're using it: Truffle, Remix, etc. -->\r\nI'm working on a base of the [solidity-template](https://github.com/paulrberg/solidity-template) repo with no changes made yet, except a .env file and my attempt to install OpenZeppelin. I believe I'm trying to install the most recent version of openzeppelin, since I just called `npm install @openzeppelin/contracts`\r\n\r\n**üìù Details**\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the problem you have been experiencing in more detail. Include as much information as you think is relevant. Keep in mind that transactions can fail for many reasons; context is key here. -->\r\nI have a copy of the [solidity-template](https://github.com/paulrberg/solidity-template) repo up and running with no issues. Running yarn install on the project, produces no issues. In order to use OpenZeppelin, I've run `npm install @openzeppelin/contracts`. I then go to run `yarn install` and get the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n‚û§ YN0001: ‚îÇ ethereumjs-abi@npm:^0.6.8: Failed listing refs\r\n‚û§ YN0001: ‚îÇ   Repository URL: ssh://git@github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-abi.git\r\n‚û§ YN0001: ‚îÇ   Fatal Error: Could not read from remote repository.\r\n‚û§ YN0001: ‚îÇ   Exit Code: 128\r\n‚û§ YN0000: ‚îî Completed in 20s 358ms\r\n‚û§ YN0000: Failed with errors in 20s 366ms\r\n```\r\n\r\n**üî¢ Code to reproduce bug**\r\n\r\n<!-- We will be able to better help if you provide a minimal example that triggers the bug. -->\r\nAn unchanged copy of the [solidity-template](https://github.com/paulrberg/solidity-template) repo with a .env file with a random 12 word seed as described in .env.example in the repo.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your help! I assume it's something basic that I'm doing wrong.\r\n",
