  "body": "**üßê Motivation**\r\n\r\nStatistical functions are transcendental functions. This means they cannot be represented with a ration of polynomials and are evaluated irrationally. We have documented this in rigorous detail [here](https://www.primitive.xyz/posts/solstat). However, statistical processes are critical to a large number of engineering applications in both in finance and gaming. \r\n\r\n**üìù Details**\r\nWe at primitive have both built and financed audits for [SolStat](https://github.com/primitivefinance/solstat), a statistical approximation library in solidity with custom EVM precision. I would like to open up discussion about including these contracts in the Open Zeppelin contracts and welcome community feedback. \r\n",

I'm a fan of Primitive's work and content. :slightly_smiling_face:\r\n\r\nCan you elaborate on what you think would be better if SolStat was a part of OpenZeppelin Contracts, compared to remaining a separate library?\r\n\r\nThis is a question I ask myself in general, but SolStat in particular looks like a library that needs highly specialized maintainers working on it.",
