  "body": "## üéâ Description\r\n\r\nWanna introduce you the way of token smart contract upgrading without all holders migration by token owner and keeping all allowances.\r\n\r\n- [ ] üêõ This is a bug report.\r\n- [x] üìà This is a feature request.\r\n\r\n## üìù Details\r\n\r\nThis technique supports any `Pausable` tokens. It requires to `pause()` old contract and to create a new one with passing the address of old contract into the constructor. Holders will migrate their balances and allowances lazily in the first transaction.\r\n\r\n## üî¢ Code To Reproduce Issue [ Good To Have ]\r\n\r\nThe source code is available here https://github.com/bitclave/TokenWrapper:\r\n- BasicTokenWrapper\r\n- StandardTokenWrapper\r\n- BurnableTokenWrapper\r\n\r\nExample of old token contract:\r\n```\r\ncontract MyToken is StandardToken, PausableToken {\r\n\r\n    string public constant symbol = \"MYT\";\r\n    string public constant name = \"MyToken\";\r\n    uint8 public constant decimals = 18;\r\n    string public constant version = \"1.0\";\r\n\r\n    function MyToken() public {\r\n        totalSupply_ = 1000000 * 10**decimals;\r\n        balances[msg.sender] = totalSupply_;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample of adding ERC827 `approve(address,uint256,bytes)` method (usually this will be done with the inheritance from ERC827Token):\r\n```\r\ncontract MyToken2 is StandardTokenWrapper, PausableToken {\r\n\r\n    string public constant symbol = \"MYT\";\r\n    string public constant name = \"MyToken\";\r\n    uint8 public constant decimals = 18;\r\n    string public constant version = \"2.0\";\r\n\r\n    function MyToken2(address _token) public StandardTokenWrapper(_token) {\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // Modern approve method from ERC827\r\n    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value, bytes _data) public returns(bool) {\r\n        require(_spender != address(this));\r\n        super.approve(_spender, _value);\r\n        require(_spender.call(_data));\r\n        return true;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```",

Please let us know what do you think.\r\n\r\nI think we can close this issue, but I'll wait for your comment.",

    "body": "@frangio I am sorry but I don't have a user there so I will just leave this last comment to stop discussion here.\r\n@k06a Here are arguments why pause is ok security wise and even IMPROVES the security and why you need it:\r\n1. BEC token where the pause ability saved a lot of money: https://medium.com/secbit-media/a-disastrous-vulnerability-found-in-smart-contracts-of-beautychain-bec-dbf24ddbc30e https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-10299\r\n2. MFT is another contract with vulnerability found which was saved by being pausable: https://blog.mainframe.com/important-mft-contract-redeployed-4f0b0bd8dc3b\r\n3. Claiming its bad claims all the following tokens are bad: EOS, Tron, Icon, OmiseGo, Augur, Status, Aelf, Qash, and Maker tokens are pausable https://blog.cryptofin.io/what-we-learned-from-auditing-the-top-20-erc20-token-contracts-7526ef3b6fb1\r\n4. although discussing security tokens, the arguments in the following link about why to make the token pausable are partially valid for utility tokens too: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1400#issuecomment-420490082\r\n5. allows tokens to be freezed in order to move them in the future to a different blockchain if wanted/necessary which is an important ability\r\n6. regarding trust, one can say that users should NOT trust tokens which are NOT pausable because they can lose their money with such tokens more easily where pausable tokens can pause in emergency and the users balances are publicly known and it would be a criminal act for the token issuer to just \"walk away\" with the money for no reason after pausing the token\r\n7. the following reddit thread was opened at the time of the infamous DAO hack WHILE IT WAS HAPPENING and you can read the comments to see how the DAO users helplessly watched their money drained without any way to stop it. they would surely prefer a pause ability https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4oi2ta/i_think_thedao_is_getting_drained_right_now/\r\n8. unlike redeployable tokens which break the trust more than pausable token (because pausable tokens are part of something the user agreed to while redeployable tokens can introduce a whole new undesired contract code. and also pausable tokens dont modify balances while upgradable tokens can cause modifications), the pausing ability is even more important than upgrading ability for security reasons. that is because the pause serves as a response to attack while the upgrade can be looked at as a second step of restoration and it can also be done manually by deploying a fixed contract and updating the balances in it.",

    "body": "@k06a regarding your article\r\n\r\n>I believe there is a better approach to upgrade contracts gently: every user should migrate themselves with a mandatory transaction and smart contract could just provide functionality to perform this upgrade more slightly. \r\n>This approach allows community:\r\n>    Audit new version of smart contract\r\n>    Perform migration when everyone is ready (not to break DEXes on token upgrades)\r\n>    Decide which new version to follow in case of project/team hard fork new version of smart contract\r\n\r\nWhile nicer on paper, this ignores the possibility of a bug affecting the upgrade mechanism itself. As a real-life example, [MakerDAO's bug](https://blog.zeppelin.solutions/technical-description-of-makerdao-governance-critical-vulnerability-facce6bf5d5e) could have been fixed by the community voting to migrate to a new contract, but _it was the voting itself that was broken_. Not only that, an exploit allowed for tokens to be forever locked inside the contract at no cost of the attacker, again preventing some users from migrating. \r\n\r\nThe way MakerDAO chose to tackle this was by using their own voting power in secret, before making the vulnerability public, so that malicious agents wouldn't get a chance to attack their users. I think this was the right call, and the migration plan was executed seamlessly, but it does mean that the underlying contract was swapped for a new one without anyone getting a say in it. And we're talking about an extremely high-profile project and technically-savvy team, and a contract that has been audited and public for almost two years. \r\n\r\nI think that in the current state of the industry, (complex) smart contract systems can be used to _reduce_ trust, but they cannot remove the need for it completely.",

    "body": "@nventuro I believe if we take the assumption that there was a KYC on the token creator or in other words that he was verified in real life and that users made their checks before buying the token, then pausing ability is BETTER than the DAO voting ability you described. Pausing protects from attacks and does not perform any change at all to what the users agreed. On the other hand giving some people under some algorithm, even if decentralized the power to perform changes for EVERYONE is more problematic. You can see the ethereum all devs meetings consist of less than 30 active people so the decentralized is actually not so decentralized.\r\nAnd since the creator was verified, it would be a criminal act for him not to unpause the tokens and he has no way to make it not be connected to him.",
