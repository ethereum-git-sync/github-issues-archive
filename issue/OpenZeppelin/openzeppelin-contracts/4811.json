Tell us about it! -->\r\n\r\nERC1155 receiver functions `onERC1155Received()` and `onERC1155BatchReceived()` are declared with calldata args in some places and memory args in other places. I would expect consistency across this library, unless there is a clear explanation to be inconsistent.\r\n\r\n**üìù Details**\r\n<!-- Please describe your feature request in detail. -->\r\n\r\nUse calldata or memory for all function args for `onERC1155Received()` and `onERC1155BatchReceived()` throughout the library.

    "body": "Thanks for reporting @engn33r.\r\n\r\nThe reason why we use `memory` across our implementations is because `calldata` can't be constructed from within the contract. Public functions can't be called internally if they don't use `calldata`. This explains mismatches between the interfaces defined with `calldata` and the implementations with `memory`. Note that the implementations are still compliant because the function selector remains the same.\r\n\r\nA good example of this is [ERC1155-balanceOfBatch](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/7bd2b2aaf68c21277097166a9a51eb72ae239b34/contracts/token/ERC1155/ERC1155.sol#L76).\r\n\r\nHowever, I agree `onERC1155BatchReceived` is likely to be called only externally, but I'm not sure about that. We've previously [had discussions considering using `calldata`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/issues/4216), but it's a matter of analyzing every single use of `memory` to evaluate whether it makes sense to use `calldata` instead.",
