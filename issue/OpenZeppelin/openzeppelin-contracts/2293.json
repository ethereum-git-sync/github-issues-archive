I can simply call:\r\n```js\r\nconstructor(address _newOwner) public {\r\n        transferOwnership(_newOwner);\r\n\r\n        ...\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nIn a constructor of a derived contract.\r\n\r\nThough this will be slightly more costly as the event is fired twice (once from 0x0 > msg.sender and then from msg.sender >  owner given in the derived constructor). I saw this as less ideal, definitely makes the deploying cost a bit more expensive than it would need to be.",
