    "body": "Hello @JackBekket,\r\n\r\nIf you have a look at the [ERC20 specifications](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md), you'll see that `name`, `symbol` and `decimals` are optional. Consequently, they are NOT part of IER20, because a contract that would not implement them would still be compliant with the standard.\r\n\r\nIf you want to have the \"extended\" interface, with these optional functions, you can (as @julianmrodri pointed out) use the `IERC20Metadata` interface. [This is what we do in @openzeppelin/subgraph for example](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-subgraphs/blob/main/src/datasources/erc20.yaml#L16).\r\n\r\nNote that when reading any of these three functions, you should make sure you have a fallback mechanism if the function is not implemented and the call reverts.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
