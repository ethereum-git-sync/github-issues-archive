  "body": "**üßê Motivation**\r\n<!-- Is your feature request related to a specific problem? Is it just a crazy idea? Tell us about it! -->\r\nAs someone learning how to implement on-chain governance through OZ's Governor contract, I found the Governance in the guide to be missing important information and in some cases, outdated. I'd like to make it better!\r\n\r\n**üìù Details**\r\n<!-- Please describe your feature request in detail. -->\r\nHere are a few of the key missing areas I've found:\r\n- There should be more details included about how to actually deploy the token contract. The example contract code given isn't actually suitable, since it doesn't mint any token upon creation.\r\n- The sample governor contract uses the timelock controller, but there is no sample contract provided that extends GovernorTimelockControl, and there is not enough information for someone starting out to be able to infer how to do this properly\r\n- The example code uses hardhat's extension of ether.js, but it does not mention hardhat in the guide. Someone using ether.js in a different environment would not be able to run the example code\r\n- \"ethers.utils.id\" is now just \"ethers.id\" due to a new ethers version\r\n\r\nOverall, I think it would be better if this guide were actually a walkthrough. \"Deploy on-chain governance locally on hardhat!\" That way there is an actual example that people can interact with locally. I'd love to hear yall's thoughts on this!\r\n\r\n<!-- Make sure that you have reviewed the OpenZeppelin Contracts Contributor Guidelines. -->\r\n<!-- https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md -->\r\n",
