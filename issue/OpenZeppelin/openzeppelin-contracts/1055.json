  "body": "\r\nIn RBAC.sol, the @dev comment for the contract still says: \r\n* It's also recommended that you define constants in the contract, like ROLE_ADMIN below,\r\n * to avoid typos.\r\n\r\nIn the current version, ROLE_ADMIN is never defined anywhere in the contract. \r\nI suppose it was just overlooked when an inbuild admin role was removed (?). I briefly skipped over the history, but couldn't find the exact commit. Anyway,  it caused a minor moment of confusion for me, so I thought I should at least mention it. \r\n\r\n- [ ] üêõ This is a bug report.\r\n- [ ] üìà This is a feature request.\r\n- [x] :monkey: This is some super minor nitpicking thats neither a bug nor a feature request\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
