Can you elaborate the benefits you see from organizing roles as ERC1155?\r\n\r\nA significant benefit of this would be that we embrace having access to network-level permissions rather than contract-level permissions established by an organization/protocol/etc. With 1155-driven access, people can more effectively manage the permissions across the entire network without running a function on every piece deployed or having to \"use the chain as a database.\"\r\n\r\nFor reference, here is an example of `AccessControl` built using ERC1155 badges: https://github.com/nftchance/remus/blob/master/contracts/auth/BadgeAccessControl.sol\r\n\r\nAlthough the logic for minting/revoking Badges has been excluded, it makes sense for that to be the case as localizing the minting of the Badges would negate the benefits when aiming to create network-level permission systems.",
