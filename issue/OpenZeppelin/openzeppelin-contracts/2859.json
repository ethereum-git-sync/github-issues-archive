  "body": "**üßê Motivation**\r\nRecently, with the NFT rising and on-chain metadata protocols such as Uniswap and Loot (including all of its derivatives), Base64 encoder has become a widely used library, but there's no further documentation about it, and everybody seems to be copying the usage from the base Uniswap and Loot contracts:\r\n\r\n- Uniswap: https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-v3-periphery/blob/main/contracts/libraries/NFTDescriptor.sol#L66\r\n- Loot: https://etherscan.io/address/0xff9c1b15b16263c61d017ee9f65c50e4ae0113d7#code#L1609\r\n\r\nEven though it seems to be working correctly, it might be needed to include in Open Zeppelin as one of the available libraries, so there is an official reference for it.\r\n\r\nCurrently, there is this [Base64 outdated experiment](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/solidity-jwt/blob/master/contracts/Base64.sol), and [this is the implementation](https://github.com/Brechtpd/base64#readme) that most of the projects are using up to this date\r\n\r\n**üìù Details**\r\n\r\n- Include @Brechtpd implementation into `contracts/utils` folder\r\n- Add documentation and tests for them\r\n\r\nEdit: Base64 data prepended with its media type [is considered a valid URI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs). This library will enable NFTs on-chain `tokenURIs`\r\n\r\nI can help if there's somebody who can guide me through the process",

I don't think it's technically necessary. Sure it will result in shorter output but at the expense of more computation. Is there a reason I'm not seeing?\r\n\r\nNote: If we agree to include this, if we want to use @Brechtpd's implementation we need to ask him if he's interested in contributing the code to the library and having us maintain it.

    "body": "My best guess about its importance is that it's the only way to store JSON metadata on-chain and make it compatible with Platforms like Open Sea. Since ERC721 `tokenURI` function expects to return a URL pointing to the JSON metadata, using a Base64 encoded JSON prepended with `data:application/json;base64,` is a valid HTTP response for those platforms.\r\n\r\nActually, this is the reason why I ended up using this, and seems to be generally accepted for it (also, encoded base64 images are also read by Open Sea). Anyway, I think that lack of documentation about its usage and importance is exactly what's missing.\r\n\r\nI can try to contact @Brechtpd if needed\r\n\r\nEdit: I don't know how I missed this, but the base64 is not just a valid response for Open Sea and others.

    "body": "> But it is possible to build a data URI using ASCII/UTF8 encoding. I guess Base64 is needed when the image is a binary format like PNG, but if you're using the Base64 library you're likely producing an SVG on chain and in that case it is possible to just use ASCII and skip the conversion step.\r\n> \r\n> @ernestognw Thanks for going ahead and asking. I actually would like to be sure he understands we mean shipping his code as a part of OpenZeppelin Contracts.\r\n\r\nCan you provide an example of a `tokenURI` using ASCII/UTF8 encoding? Mozilla docs states that `base64 token if non-textual`, which I understand applies for both SVG and PNG (even for JSON)\r\n\r\n```\r\nData URLs are composed of four parts: a prefix (data:), a MIME type indicating the type of data, an optional base64 token if non-textual, and the data itself:\r\n\r\ndata:[<mediatype>][;base64],<data>\r\n```\r\n\r\nMaybe there's a misunderstanding here, the Base64 doesn't aim to encode the image (which is useful too), but to encode the JSON that the `tokenURI` URI is retrieving.\r\n\r\n![Captura de Pantalla 2021-09-15 a la(s) 16 46 13](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33379285/133514130-b1702169-f0c2-45c6-9190-21cce844aaae.png)\r\n\r\nFrom what I understand, there's no other way to build a URI that retrieves a JSON and is on-chain.\r\n\r\nAnd sure! Let's determine first if this is needed or not, and if we proceed I can contact again with @bretchpd to formalize it  :)",

    "body": "> > Just to clarify I'm not saying it's wrong to use Base64 but I don't understand why it's necessary and would love to know if there is a reason to prefer it.\r\n> \r\n> @frangio I believe they are encoding it to save space, as AFAIK there's a [`65k`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs#common_problems) limit when using `base64`. Here are some projects with their authors which could explain a bit better on why `base64` encode the metadata rather than escape it like in the [example](https://etherscan.io/address/0x68a65e7968fbacd2387dad316918da69a7011608#code) you shared.\r\n> \r\n> * [Animal Color Book](https://generative-transfer-art.vercel.app/) by @wilsoncusack [used the same version of](https://github.com/Generative-Transfer-Art/solidity/blob/main/contracts/project1/TransferArt.sol#L4) @Brechtpd's library to generate pixels per transfer.\r\n> * [Adventure Cards](https://0xadventures.com/) by @paulmars used a [custom](https://github.com/paulmars/contracts/blob/main/contracts/Loot.sol#L259-L324) version of Loot's contract instead to paint words into the SVG.\r\n> * [Rarity](https://rarity.game/) by @andrecronje, is another similar, and it used a [formatted](https://github.com/andrecronje/rarity/blob/main/core/rarity.sol#L701-L756) version of the `base64` library.\r\n> \r\n> Those are just some I could find from the top of my head, and as you can see, all used a different library or format for encoding `base64`, helping the case of using a standard one.\r\n> \r\n> @ernestognw let me know if you need help with the PR and docs.\r\n\r\nI think this is enough to justify the inclusion of the library. I've been kinda busy but I can start opening a branch on a fork and try to document all of these things you're sharing.\r\n\r\n@frangio, what's the procedure to make a PR with their corresponding docs?\r\n\r\nI'll reach out to you on Twitter if I have any question",
