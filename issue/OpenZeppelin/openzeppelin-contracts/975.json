    "body": "@subramanianv This is something we've considered a few times. I really don't see how it would make it easier for compiling and verifying, though. For verifying there is additional obstacles such as compilation parameters which are not specified in the source code pragma.\r\n\r\nWe think it makes sense for a library such as OpenZeppelin to use `^` version specifiers because it allows our users to compile their contracts with newer Solidity versions without us having to rush to update with every Solidity release. In fact we have a policy of waiting at least a month before updating the Solidity version we use for development, to give some time for possible bugs in the compiler to be discovered. \r\n\r\nThe Solidity team is quite commited to backwards compatibility, so we trust that it is fine to allow users to use semver-compatible greater versions.\r\n\r\nWe would certainly recommend, however, for end-users to pin the compiler version they use during development.",
