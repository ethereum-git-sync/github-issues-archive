If I recall correctly, the main argument against this is that PRs will be made by default against `master` instead of `dev`, requiring users and maintainers to double check that the target is correct (though I'd expect there to be a setting in GitHub to change this behavior).\r\n\r\nThere's also the point that people shouldn't really be looking at code on GitHub unless it's from a specific release tag (we've seen tons of tutorials, Remix guides, etc., indicating to simply clone master).",

    "body": "@nklipa13 My guess is that this was particularly annoying in the past few months given that there were a lot of big changes like the migration to Solidity 0.5 that weren't in `master` for a long time. This was totally exceptional because it caught us a bit unprepared. We've learned from that experience and a few others and I'm confident it won't happen again. :slightly_smiling_face:\r\n\r\nWe're reluctant to change the default branch to something other than the development branch because of the overhead it will cause for contributors and maintainers, as @nventuro explained, and we believe reducing that overhead should be the priority in the repository.\r\n\r\nI don't think this will be such a big problem from now on, but please let us know if it does come up as an annoyance again!",
