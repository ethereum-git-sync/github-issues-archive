  "body": "Like the previously disscused at [OpenZeppelin Forum](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/removing-address-0x0-checks-from-openzeppelin-contracts/2222). i am agreed that zero address checks in OpenZeppelin Contracts it's not that important. since people can burn through other address like `0x0dEad` and many more ways.\r\n\r\nmaybe we can consider to remove zero address checks so the contracts more flexible as a module. and maybe it can saving some gas. so any update of this issue?",

    "body": "I don't really see reasons to allow use of 0x0 like any other address (in transfers or elsewhere), and I do see some reasons to disallow it, namely that it can show up accidentally in a few places: read from an uninitialized variable or in the return value of `ecrecover`. They are not particularly strong reasons but I think the net result is that we should treat the zero address specially and disallow its use in most places.",
