    "body": "Hello @baermathias \r\n\r\nThe `amount` keyword was introduced by [this commit](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/commit/2f9ae975c8bdc5c7f7fa26204896f6c717f07164) in may 2019. It also changed some wording such as `from` and `to`\r\n\r\nWe recently re-introduced the `for` and `to` wording, following the [ERC20 specifications](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20). \r\n\r\nThe events somehow follow the specifications in using in using `value` (the specification uses `_value`).\r\n\r\nThe function parameters could be changed to match this naming. AFAIK, this has no impact on the way the contract can be used/overridden (let us know if that has consequences to you) ... but feel free to create a PR proposing that change.",
