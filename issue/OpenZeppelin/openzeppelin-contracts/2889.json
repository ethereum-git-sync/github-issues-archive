  "body": "**üßê Motivation**\r\n<!-- Is your feature request related to a specific problem? Is it just a crazy idea? Tell us about it! -->\r\nHi, I just submitted my first pull request ever here on openzeppelin (PR #2887) and I have been told to discuss my idea here with an issue :)\r\nMy idea is to make contracts sellable. For now, Ownable contracts can only be transfered for free to another owner by the owner himself/herself via Ownalble.transferOwnership.\r\n\r\nOwning a contract gives a power on this contract and can also be profitable (selling NFTs for instance, or with built-in royalties). Some owners could be intersted in selling it to another party and doing it the safest way possible, which I want to implement. The contract should of course always stay transferable for free as well.\r\n\r\n**üìù Details**\r\n<!-- Please describe your feature request in detail. -->\r\n\r\nMy idea for this module are :\r\n\r\n- Owner approves buyer: allow the owner to approve a buyer with given price\r\n- Approved buyers buys: allow an approved buyer to buy the contract (the eth. will go to the owner and the ownership will transfer)\r\n- Owner approves proxy: allow the owner to approve a trusted proxy to transfer the ownership of the contract (as it is done for tokens)\r\n- Appproved Proxy trasnfers ownership: allow an approved proxy to transfer the ownership of the contract (proxy can be marketplace sale contracts)\r\n\r\nThe difficulties that have raised are the following:\r\n- ERC: I would have liked to implement the ERC interface but then my contract could not be inherited by other contracts also inheriting from an ERC interface as I wish it could.\r\n- Ownable inheritance: I would have liked to inherit from the Ownable module but as far as I understand it would then not be possible to transfer the contract ownership with other methods than the Ownable.transferOwnership method.\r\nThis latter method is onlyOwner so I can't make a buyerApprove/buy nor proxyApprove/take set of methods to transfer the ownership. Also, the _setOwner is private so cannot be inheritated (as it shouldn't).\r\nWhat I am proposing is thus to copy/paste the Ownable code inside the Sellable contract, which make Sellable able to use _setOwner, and make child classes able to use Ownable like if it was inherited.\r\n\r\n<!-- Make sure that you have reviewed the OpenZeppelin Contracts Contributor Guidelines. -->\r\n<!-- https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md -->\r\n",

    "body": "Hello @Lcressot \r\n\r\nAFAIK this approach, of having an ownable-sellable contract is not widely used nor is it clearly documented. As I already said in #2887, I think this should be the topic of a new ERC. I would love to include that in our codebase at some point, but before that, I think this disserves to be discussed in the [ethereum-magicians.org](ethereum-magicians.org) forum and submitted to the [EIP repository](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs).\r\n\r\nFor your point about ownable, I believe #2568 addresses it.",

    "body": "@Amxx \r\nFollowing the discussion at #2887, thanks for the explanations, indeed I wasn't using the correct terminology.\r\n\r\nTo answer you, I do not intend to build a contract marketplace myself, I just happened to witness people wanting to buy contracts and I had this idea. I am pretty confident that some day soon a lot of contracts in the industry will be sold.\r\n\r\nHowever it will maybe be done in real money with real contracts stipulating who the smart contracts should be transfered to. But there will probably also still be more intermediate size companies or independant willing to have a safe blockchain way to make a sale. And who knows maybe contracts could someday get traded on the stock market ^^\r\n\r\nSo my goal was really just to contribute but not for a short term usecase of my own. So I will keep in mind your idea of suggesting it to EIP repo and ethereum magicians, maybe we can do that together as I am still very new to these things :)",

The marketplace will be a lot better if it welcomes any contract, not just ones that adopt this proposed interface.\r\n\r\nI am biased a few ways here because I'd like to buy contracts (with no less than 1,000 transactions) and I make money auditing contracts.¬†",

    "body": "There seem to be two independent things being discussed here: one is the ability to sell a contract, the other is a Claimable variant of Ownable. I don't understand the relation between those two things.\r\n\r\nFor the ability to sell a contract, which is the focus of this issue, I agree with prior discussion that it should be based around an existing standard for reuse of existing marketplaces, and it seems that ERC721 is fit for this purpose, so it would be a matter of figuring out how to make ownership of a contract into an ERC721 token. But I think this is already reasonably achievable with what we have available:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\r\npragma solidity 0.8.9;\r\n\r\nimport \"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol\";\r\nimport \"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Address.sol\";\r\n\r\ncontract Ownership is ERC721 {\r\n    uint constant NFT_ID = 1;\r\n    \r\n    constructor(address initialOwner) ERC721(\"Ownership\", \"OWN\") {\r\n        _mint(initialOwner, NFT_ID);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function relay(address target, bytes memory data) public {\r\n        require(msg.sender == ownerOf(NFT_ID));\r\n        Address.functionCall(target, data);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAn `Ownable` contract can then set an instance of this contract as the owner.\r\n\r\nThere is one problem with the above code: a current owner can frontrun a purchase to transfer or renounce ownership of a contract. A possible way to fix this issue is to reject `relay` of `transferOwnership` and `renounceOwnership`, although there may be other functions that should be rejected as well.",

    "body": "@Amxx @fulldecent @frangio Hi guys, I was inspired by @frangio's last answer and I imagined a solution to make contract's ownerships be tradable as ERC721. I made a code here: [NFTOwnable repo](https://github.com/Lcressot/NFTOwnable). I tested it and it seems to work, I would be glad to contribute to openzeppelin, tell me what you think :)\r\n\r\nMore precisely, to make a contract A be tradable, my idea is to make it inherit from NFTOwable. It will then have a private instance of ERC721Ownership which is an ERC721 contract containing one only NFT, that of the contract A's ownership.\r\nWe can transfer A normally like any Ownable contract, or we can transfer/trade its ERC721Ownership counterpart, which will trigger the transfer of A. Under the hood, the ERC721Ownership instance always keeps contract A's address  as owner, but it acts like if its owner was the owner of contract A.\r\n\r\nI think this solution has all the requirements we were looking for, and I am looking forward for your thoughts on it :)",

    "body": "@Lcressot In your design, it's like there are parallel ownership mechanisms. I wouldn't say that the NFT actually represents the ownership, because you can transfer ownership independently by calling `transferOwnership` directly. I think this loses some interesting properties of fully coupling the ownership to the NFT in both directions.\r\n\r\nI think these are very interesting examples and showcases of how the OpenZeppelin Contracts building blocks can be used, and I would encourage any of you to write some content about the idea, and possibly share it on our forum. But this use case is too niche at the moment for us to be interested in merging the functionality and maintaining the code.",
