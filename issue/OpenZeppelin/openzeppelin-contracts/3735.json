Tell us about it! -->\r\n\r\nThere is a number of games with gene sequences mechanism like CryptoKitties, DeRace, and Axie. Imagine I have a Kitty with rare genes and I want to breed it with others for profit. There is no easy way of doing so because all games have different interfaces and thus It is difficult for exchanges to implement lend/borrow mechanics. ERC4907 will standardize the way how it is done without implementing a flash-borrower and magic tricks\r\n\r\n**üìù Details**\r\n<!-- Please describe your feature request in detail. -->\r\nHere is ready to use implementation\r\nhttps://thirdweb.com/doubledev.eth/ERC4907\r\n\r\n<!-- Make sure that you have reviewed the OpenZeppelin Contracts Contributor Guidelines. -->\r\n<!-- https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md -->\r\n",

    "body": "@frangio you are right about that comment. it totally makes sense. Unfortunately, this is what we have now. no better standard for temporary ownership was introduced. \r\n\r\nLet's talk about how this can be done securely and in the proper way.\r\nhere is a Kitties code for breeding\r\nhttps://github.com/dapperlabs/cryptokitties-bounty/blob/master/contracts/KittyBreeding.sol#L200\r\n3rd party platforms can prepare for sign such a set of transactions\r\n\r\n- transfer token#1 to from walletA to walletB\r\n- call breed function(token#1, token#?)\r\n- transfer token#1 to from walletB to walletA\r\n- transfer erc20fee to from walletB to walletA\r\n\r\nIn fact this is what wyvern protocol does\r\nInstead, I offer to add AccessControl to the token class and assign a new role to exchange (but not owner). Now exchange can assign USER role to anyone to breed as much as he can during subscription time. \r\n\r\nNow as I write this it seems like a bad standard for this purpose to me. It does not restrict usage amount and does not take into account breading limit and cooldown. As well as there is no way to add new exchanges or the owner can discard all usages. I have to think about this more.\r\n\r\nAnyways this standard can be added now and replaced later with a better one.",
