    "body": "Here we are close to get all our tests passing with solidity 0.5.0: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1496\r\n\r\nThat is the first step. Then, I see two options because we want OpenZeppelin 2.0 to have support and a stable API for a while.\r\n\r\nIf we consider that the addition of `payable address` is a breaking change of our stable API, we would have to release OpenZeppelin 3.0.\r\n\r\nIf we don't consider that a breaking change, we do what we usually do with solidity releases: wait a month or so and then release the update as v2.1.0. This is stretching a little the concept of stable API and semver, but maybe we can document it as an exception justified by the fact that we depend so closely on a project that is on the v0.x phase. Then when Solidity releases 1.0 we release OpenZeppelin 3.0 with a stable-for-real-this-time API.\r\n\r\nIn both cases, I think we should push everybody to use solidity 0.5.0. If they want an old compiler, they can use an old OpenZeppelin version.\r\n\r\n@frangio what are your thoughts?\r\n\r\nps: we should announce this discussion on twitter so people affected can leave their proposals.",

I've not looked through all OZ contracts, but some of it is likely covered by the creation of 0.5 interfaces for 0.4 contracts as described in the breaking changes: https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/050-breaking-changes.html#interoperability-with-older-contracts\r\nWhere applicable, I'd hope that the next OZ release would contain such interfaces.",

    "body": "@axic @gnidan @JonahGroendal\r\n\r\nRegarding supporting Solidity 0.5.x, they key issue is that we've committed ourselves to having a stable API, and requiring a compiler upgrade goes against that (in a nutshell, a stable API means everything will keep working the same accross minor version upgrades).\r\n\r\nWe've been discussing this (extensively) over the last couple days, since there seem to be no good solutions: all of them involve some sort of compromise, and we weren't sure which were the right ones. Below is a summary of things we considered and different possible approaches, and how we intend to move forward from now on. There is no final decision yet: we'd greatly appreciate everyone's input on this.\r\n\r\nSome facts:\r\n- truffle now compiles using Solidity 0.5.0 by default, so any guides indicating to run `npm install truffle openzeppelin-solidity` are now broken.\r\n- Minor releases of Solidity may include features we want to add to OpenZeppelin, like 0.4.x's `emit` for events, `constructor`, `view` and `pure`, etc.\r\n- Not including said features by keeping OpenZeppelin in 0.5.0 (with a ^0.5.0 pragma) would mean that any users compiling with the latest version (which can be done on the very day of the release, thanks to truffle 5) will get warnings on OpenZeppelin code due to it not using them (i.e. the same thing that happens on 0.4.24 when using the old constructor syntax).\r\n- The Solidity team plans to release major versions, containing breaking changes, at a relatively fast pace (less than every one year). While (IMO) a good thing, given the current state of the ecosystem and need to iterate, this means that this issue will arise again in the not too distant future, suggesting some sort of long-lasting policy is required on our side.\r\n\r\nGiven this, we've considered:\r\n- Releasing a new major release (i.e. OpenZeppelin 3.0) on new Solidity major versions. This 'preserves' semver, but has some major problems: it doesn't address new desirable features being added in minors, makes our release schedule dependent on Solidity's (e.g. in this case, we'd be releasing 3.0 less than 3 months after 2.0, with no 2.1 in between), and makes OpenZeppelin's versioning scheme not very meaningful (since we'd have majors both for API-breakage and for compatibility, making the whole thing harder to understand). In particular, having to bump majors every couple of months due to reasons external to the planning of the library feels like a bad idea.\r\n- Having new releases support 0.4.24 by default, and 0.5.x on some side distribution channel. This could be either an npm tag (e.g. `2.1-solc-0.5`), a subdirectory inside the package (`import 'openzeppelin/contracts/0.5/ERC20.sol'`), or a separate npm package. None of these solve desirable features added in minors, and add an extra layer of complexity on both maintaining the project and using it that we're not comfortable with. We don't want to add yet another package, and due to `semver` quirkiness it is not always obvious that the right package will be installed (npm isn't really designed to support having multiple versions of the same version).\r\n- Dropping the Solidity version entirely out of our stability guarantees. This means keeping 2.0 as the last 0.4.24 compatible OpenZeppelin release, and have 2.1 require Solidity 0.5.2 to compile. OpenZeppelin's stability will be restricted to its API, made up of contracts, functions and events, regardless of the tools used to achieve said API (the best ones available, which will generally mean the latest compiler version). Users that do not want to upgrade their Solidity version will still be able to use older releases, for which we would still provide support in the form of patch updates to e.g. fix bugs. npm's `--save-exact` flag can be used to pin an OpenZeppelin version, avoiding any future compatibility issues until users are ready to make the switch.\r\n\r\nOur conclusion from the previous discussion is that these issues stem from a general immaturity on the development ecosystem. We'd like to both not be hindered by it, and push forward towards adoption of newer and better tools. Because of that **we're heavily leaning towards the third option (having 2.1 require Solidity 0.5.2)**. All of this will of course be documented on our documentation, to make it as clear as possible.\r\n\r\nThis is not a decision we're making lightly, and once again, would love to hear your thoughts about it. If you have any suggestions that you think are better than our proposed scheme, please share them!",
