  "body": "I would like to escalate this issue: https://twitter.com/Dexaran/status/1682826099800125442\r\n\r\nLong story short:\r\n\r\n- I reported an issue with ERC-20 token implementation at OpenZeppelin https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/issues/4451\r\n\r\n- I got a response \"we can't fix it\" and it is OK. You can't fix it. I agree. But it doesn't mean it is not a flaw. And the fact that you can't fix it does not automatically mean that it does not pose a threat to the safety of users funds.\r\n\r\n- I recommended to add a warning to documentation \"Token developers must restrict `transfer` function or users will lose money\" and it is still not done.\r\n\r\n- I submitted a security bug report and I expect to get $25,000 payment because the reported issue fits in \"Critical severity bugs\" as per your description.\r\n\r\n- Is it a bug that can cause permanent freeze of users funds? - Yes it is.\r\n\r\n- Is it in your code? - Yes it is.\r\n\r\n- Is it in scope and fits in \"critical vulnerability criteria\" at your bugbounty program? - Yes.\r\n\r\nI kindly request an explanation of the following:\r\n\r\n1. This bug bounty page says that \"[https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts?utm_source=immunefi)\" are in scope. So is https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/tree/master/contracts/token/ERC20 in scope then? It looks like it is.\r\n\r\n![OpenZeppelinBugbounty6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26142412/255351406-4ab1ee53-7219-4e2b-a3a5-c116501dde1d.png)\r\n\r\n2. Permanent freeze of funds is considered a critical security vulnerability. I have a [proof-of-concept script](https://dexaran.github.io/erc20_losses/) that demonstrates a permanent freeze of funds amounting in $1,1B worth of tokens. Isn't it true?\r\n\r\n![OpenZeppelinBugbounty7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26142412/255351496-0246fb67-bf3d-494e-97f4-1efcff64a06e.png)\r\n\r\n3. [Your response](https://twitter.com/Dexaran/status/1682861872012308482) states that \"it is not a security bug report because it corresponds to the expected behavior to ERC-20 standard\". This is not actually true because what I reported is a vulnerability in your particular implementation of the standard. The code is located here: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol If we will take this code and compile it \"as is\" without applying any changes - it will contain a vulnerability that has critical severity according to your own description at the bug bounty page: it can result in permanent freeze of funds for end users. And it already resulted in a freeze of $1,1B worth of tokens in 50 examined contracts out of 1200 existing contracts. Your code contains this flaw. And this code is in scope of the bounty.\r\n\r\n4. \"It was discussed MANY times\". - Yes it was, but does this automatically mean that it is not a security vulnerability? Does discussing process reduce the severity of a reported problem?\r\n\r\n5. \"Devs have the ability to override their implementation in order to add specific restrictions\". Yes devs have this ability. But the fact that a critical severity security vulnerability in  your code can be fixed by \"devs\" does not reduce the severity of the vulnerability in your code, right? Again, your code contains this vulnerability. Your code is in scope. This code: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol What is the point of having a bug bounty if you can just reply \"It is not a critical severity vulnerability because third party devs can fix it\"?\r\n\r\n6. \"Since such restriction is not required by the standard, and some implementations rely on such transfer, we should not disable them by default.\" - Ok, but it doesn't automatically mean that it is not a security vulnerability. And it doesn't mean that this $1,1B worth of tokens that are stuck in the contract are not permanently frozen. I'm not saying that you must disable transfers. I'm saying that I reported a security vulnerability that fits in your bug bounty program and I want $25,000.\r\n\r\nHere is a full description: https://dexaran820.medium.com/known-problems-of-erc20-token-standard-e98887b9532c\r\n\r\nHere is a Proof-of-Concept script that calculates how much tokens are currently frozen in the examined contracts: https://dexaran.github.io/erc20_losses/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
