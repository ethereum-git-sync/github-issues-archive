  "body": "**üßê Motivation**\r\nWith the current `Ownable{2Step}` contracts, users can either transfer ownership in one step or two steps. There is currently no implementation to have both options in one contract. However, this would make sense for, e.g., a contract factory setup. First, the factory deploys a contract, thereby inheriting the ownership. Second, the factory transfers the ownership to an EOA in one step. Going forward, the EOA can transfer the ownership in two steps.\r\n\r\n**üìù Details**\r\nWithin the `Ownable2Step` contract, instead of overriding the `transferOwnership` function to be a two-step transfer, extend the `Ownable` contract with a `transferClaimableOwnership` function that enables the two-step transfer, while keeping `transferOwnership` as a one-step transfer.",

    "body": "Hello @Artifex1 \r\n\r\nThis is something we discussed for a long time in the `Ownable2Step` issue/PR.\r\n\r\nIt was decided that in `Ownable2Step`, the `transferOwnership` should be overridden so that the default is a 2 step transfer.\r\nThere was a discussion about including, or not, the one step transfer using another function (something like `forceTransferOwnership`). This was not done because it would be opinionated from us to include it by default when anyone can enable this manually in their code.\r\n\r\nYou may want to do\r\n\r\n```\r\ncontract MyOwnable is Ownable2Step {\r\n    function forceTransferOwnership(address newOwner) public onlyOwner() {\r\n        _transferOwnership(newOwner);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nor\r\n```\r\ncontract MyOwnable is Ownable2Step {\r\n    function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public override onlyOwner() {\r\n        _transferOwnership(newOwner);\r\n    }\r\n    function transferClaimableOwnership(address newOwner) public onlyOwner() {\r\n        super.transferOwnership(newOwner);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```",
