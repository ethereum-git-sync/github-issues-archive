  "body": "**üßê Motivation**\r\nOpenZeppelin currently supports Ownable and Role-Based Access Control as AccessControl schemes. Additionally, I propose introducing a new RBAC scheme called Token-Control Token Circulation (TCTC). TCTC enables the control of transaction access based on token ownership. The TokenController.sol contract required for implementing this scheme is just 30 lines long. By utilizing the ERC721 platform, it becomes possible to grant and revoke specific roles, such as MINTER_ROLE and BURNER_ROLE, for the target token. Moreover, privileges like MINTER_ROLE can be visualized as tokens, providing a user-friendly interface for many users to understand easily.\r\n\r\n**üìù Details**\r\nThe code of TokenController.sol and its reference implementations are: \r\nhttps://github.com/kofujimura/TCTC",
