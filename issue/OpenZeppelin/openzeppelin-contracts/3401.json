  "body": "**üßê Motivation**\r\nI saw that the ERC1155 standard does not have the possibility to approve tokens by id or amounts as for example in ERC20. IMHO, this is very **dangerous**.\r\n\r\n**üìù Details**\r\nI have designed the following code to avoid be approved for all ids, later I thought to develop the same but with amounts.\r\nPlease, take a view, in this repo I explain the whole idea: https://github.com/ivanmmurciaua/ERC1155ApprovalById\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about including this like an official extension? That's would be great.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nIv√°n M.M.",

    "body": "Hello @ivanmmurciaua \r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind that our implementation of ERC1155 follows [the standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155). If you think there is a fundamental issue with the standard, I don't think this is the right place to have this discussion. You should rather go to the [Ethereum magicians forum](https://ethereum-magicians.org/).\r\n\r\nYou point being about approvals, it would be part of cross-contract interactions (and should probably be natively recognized by wallets as an approval operation). This makes me thing that standardisation of the interface is important (this is why I think it needs to be discussed with the eth magicians before we implement it)",
