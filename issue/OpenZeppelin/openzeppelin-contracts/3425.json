  "body": "Dear Support,\r\n\r\nI have a hard time \"Import Openzeppelin-solidity/contracts/....sol\"; in Remix-IDE and from what I saw Openzeppelin-solidity has changed to \"openzeppelin-contracts/\" instead. My problem is, that every time I've changed it to \"openzeppelin-contracts/\" in Remix IDE, it does not seem to \"accept\" the changes in Remix IDE and still pops up the same \"old\" error of \"Not Found of OpenZeppelin-solidity/contracts/..\". (although I've changed it)\r\n\r\nI've searched using Stack Exchange for ways to overcome this, such as using \"https://github.com/OpenZeppelin\", @OpenZeppelin, and using v2.4.0 or v2.5.0 --> still does not solve this problem. \r\n\r\nI'm curious, is there a bug issue in OpenZeppelin that forbid us to change it in Remix IDE?\r\n\r\nSorry, I'm out of ideas for this issue. Any suggestions? I'm using Remix-IDE in Chrome \r\n\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your advice on how to resolve this, thanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
