  "body": "**🧐 Motivation**\r\nAs stated in the [governance introductory article](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/governor-smart-contract/):\r\n> OpenZeppelin Contracts contain the most common requirements out of the box. Beyond these, OpenZeppelin Governor could potentially be configured with ERC721 voting power so certain NFT owners can participate in governance when specified.\r\n\r\nI was wondering if such possibility is already explored somewhere or not yet...\r\nI imagine the customization and usecases could be infinite, but what would imply to have a basic version of the OZ Governor that uses ERC721 tokens to create proposals, delegate and vote?\r\n\r\nThis issue is a continuation of the https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/issues/2868 one.\r\nIn [this thread](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/using-governor-with-erc721/15824) I explain a little bit more the usecase I'm working on.\r\n\r\n\r\n**📝 Details**\r\nFollowing @Amxx suggestions I drafted 3 new contracts:\r\n- [GovernorERC721Votes](https://github.com/ivanminutillo/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/governance/extensions/GovernorERC721Votes.sol): A new governance flavor extension for voting weight extraction from an ERC721Votes token. \r\n- [ERC721Votes](https://github.com/ivanminutillo/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC721Votes.sol): A clone of ERC20Votes, with the same functions - included `getPastVotes` - but that inherits `NFTPermit` instead of `draft-ERC20Permit`\r\n- [NFTPermit](https://github.com/ivanminutillo/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/NFTPermit.sol): A draft implementation of Permit for the ERC721 token (taken from [here](https://gist.github.com/Amxx/e3c87476093a6b27d9271b2e54b35292))\r\n\r\nAs I am not really proficient with solidity, I expect there's lot of devil in the details when implementing even the most trivial things, so I was wondering if I'm totally out of track or not?",

    "body": "I can't say we thought about this. \r\n\r\nWe considered that the `uint8 support`, introduced by bravo, could be used in many different ways? It can be an enum, but it could also be a ranking. These \"grades\" would be used to compute the weighted average and decide the outcome of the vote.\r\n\r\nFor maximum bravo compatibility, we wanted our external function to share the same signature, so we couldn't add/remove or even change the types of the existing parameters. That being said, if you want to implement your approach, you can have the `castVote`, `castVoteWithReason` and `castVoteBySig` function disabled (by overriding `_castVote` with an empty function that reverts, and add functions of you own. \r\n\r\nInterfaces that are commonly use to vote on compound like governors will not be able to have users vote, but the rest of the system (proposal / queueing/ execution) should be transparent.\r\n\r\nyou system would have to :\r\n- create new public voting function\r\n- extract the weight of each vote\r\n- prevent double voting\r\n- implement the `_quorumReached` and `_voteSucceeded` function\r\n\r\nNote, the `propose` function requires `getVotes` to exist, so you may need to expose something like the NFT balance even though you don't use that for the actual voting",

    "body": "Interestingly, that proposal could be implemented by using the `ERC721Enumerable` interface. `castVote` can enumerate the tokens owned and mark them as already used for the proposal. This is a reasonable use case for enumerability on chain. It could still run out of gas if the number of tokens owned by a voter is too large. Not sure how that risk can be mitigated.\r\n\r\nAnd it also doesn't implement vote delegation, which some people have pointed out as an important primitive to increase participation in governance.",
