IMO This change makes the tokens in openzeppelin non-compliant to ERC20 and ERC721.\r\n\r\nEven if you think that it is still compliant, I hope you can still see the problems it will make for dApps trying to read ERC20 events. dApps won't know if the token is OZ or ERC20. The whole point of the standard was to have a standard way of doing things.\r\n\r\nI don't see any reason except style consistency to remove the underscore. Maybe keep the underscore in the standard interfaces at least?\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Thanks for the response @frangio Here are my further thoughts\r\n\r\n> I don't see how this causes compatibility problems. Dapps aren't affected by the event argument names used in the source code, they just care about their order and indexedness, where OpenZeppelin is definitely compliant. This means that dapps don't need to know if the token is OZ or ERC20 as you implied.\r\n\r\nI'll try to explain why some dApps will need to refactor their code to arguably worse code or will need to know if the token is OZ or ERC20.\r\nWhen fetching events, Web3 1.X returns a `returnValues` object that maps event parameter name to value. Please refer to documentation and example available on https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/web3-eth-contract.html#contract-events\r\n\r\nWhen fetching events using Web3 0.X. it returns `args` object that does the same thing. Doc available on https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API\r\nA sample code:\r\n```\r\ncontract.SampleContract ().watch ( (err, response) => {  \r\n    console.log(response.args.eventParameterName);\r\n});\r\n```\r\nI know we can use topics array for the same purpose but it has disadvantages:\r\n1) You have to remember array index rather than name. Or check from code every time. Extra hassle for no reason.\r\n2) You have to refactor your code.\r\n3) Code's readability slightly decreases.\r\n\r\nKinda similar to why we give proper names to variables :) You don't have to but it makes life easier.\r\n\r\n\r\n>I think style consistency within the library is the more valuable thing from the perspective of those users, and we chose to prioritize that rather than doing verbatim what the ERC text says.\r\n\r\nI'd have to disagree here. If a contract is not ERC20 verbatim, I will not call it ERC20 complaint. In my opinion, You can freely add stuff that the standard does not prohibit like reverting rather than returning false but you should not change what the standard defines as \"SHOULD\" or \"MUST\".\r\n\r\n\r\n>As a sidenote, it's not really clear what it means to be compliant with a Solidity interface defined in an ERC. Event argument names are only one of the issues. Perhaps we should write an ERC about it. stuck_out_tongue\r\n\r\nI agree with this one. Everyone has their opinion. An ERC might actually help :stuck_out_tongue:\r\n\r\n",

Similar to how open zeppelin does not ship Bytecode and ABIs.\r\nThis change hurts more when we already have deployed stuff to the main net. We'll have to use a different ABI than what the original source code produces. For example, our utility token has a classic code that generates ABI with underscores while newer tokens being generated from our beta dApp won't have the underscore in the ABI. Either we'll be forced to use a slightly modified ABI for one of these or use indexes instead of names. \r\n\r\n> Removing the underscore prefixes in OpenZeppelin allows clients built with our JSON interfaces to use non-prefixed parameter names, but it does not affect at all the ERC20 compliance of the produced bytecode.\r\n\r\nIMHO this change to the interface was not required. Style consistency is meant to make interpreting stuff easier rather than creating more confusion.\r\nI consider ABI to be part of the ERC. Given that standards usually define the interface rather implementation, I'd argue that ABI is just as important if not more than bytecode for compliance. But it's my own interpretation and I can see why others might consider only the Bytecode to be compliant with an ERC.",
