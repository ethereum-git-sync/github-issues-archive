  "body": "## 🎉 Description\r\n\r\nI have several places in the code, where calling an external function should be permitted only to some other contract. Typically, that contract holds (or has a reference to) the contract which implements the external function. Of course, if a reference (`address` or `interface`) is used, then there can be several contracts holding the contract which implements the external function.\r\n\r\n- [x] 📈 This is a feature request.\r\n\r\n## 💻 Environment\r\n\r\nI am using Truffle + Ganache on Windows, but this feature request is generally platform-agnostic.\r\n\r\n## 📝 Details:\r\n\r\nI have implemented this feature, and thought it might be appropriate for you to add it too.\r\n\r\nMy naming conventions are:\r\n- 'owner' - deployer of the contract (same definition as yours)\r\n- 'user' - some other contract\r\n\r\nI have named this module 'Callable', since it supports both 'owner' and 'user', to which I refer by the general term 'caller':\r\n\r\n```\r\ncontract Callable is Claimable {\r\n    mapping (address => bool) public users;\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * @dev This method adds the given address to the list of `users`.\r\n     */\r\n    function addUser(address user) external onlyOwner {\r\n        users[user] = true;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * @dev This method removes the given address from the list of `users`.\r\n     */\r\n    function remUser(address user) external onlyOwner {\r\n        users[user] = false;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * @dev Throws an exception if called by any contract other than one of the `users`.\r\n     */\r\n    modifier onlyUsers() {\r\n        require(users[msg.sender]);\r\n        _;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks",
