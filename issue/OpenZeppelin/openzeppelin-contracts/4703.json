The only situation I can think of is burning it, but that seems like a very specific case.\r\n\r\nAt the very least, when zero address validation is needed, a negative test case is required. In cases where sending to the zero address is also necessary, a positive test case will be needed and will be tested regardless. This is because, upon quick review, it may seem that the .call() automatically validates the zero address, eliminating the need for any additional checks.",
