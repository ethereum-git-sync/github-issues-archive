I think `RBACWithOwner` is suitable to control access controll with permission than `RBACWithAdmin`. `RBACWithAdmin` has several problems.\r\n\r\n1. It can't be integrated with `Ownable` becuase both control permissions. If we have a contract `T is RBACWithAdmin, Ownable` and a single `admin` added, and want to chagne `owner`, 3 transaction are required\r\n```javascript\r\ncontract.transferOwnership(newOwner, {from: owner});\r\ncontract.adminAddRole(newOwner, 'admin', {from: owner});\r\ncontract.adminRemoveRole(owner, 'admin', {from: owner});\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. `RBACWithAdmin` may have no `admin` at all if `admin` send trancation\r\n```javascript\r\ncontract.adminRemoveRole(admin, 'admin', {from: admin});\r\n```\r\n\r\nI suggest to integrate `Ownable` with `RBACWithAdmin` to handle `owner` and `ROLE_ADMIN` at the same time, making sure that `owner` has all permission to control `ROLE_ADMIN`",
