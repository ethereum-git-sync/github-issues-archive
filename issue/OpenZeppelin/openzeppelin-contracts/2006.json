  "body": "**🧐 Motivation**\r\nMore and more we see contracts being installed individually, instead of as part of the npm package. A recent example is the VS code plugin extension by the Microsoft Azure blockchain team: this extension allows a user to choose a contract by name, and it just downloads the solidity file (and its dependencies) to a local folder.\r\n\r\nThis has the problem that any project-wide information, such as copyright, license, or package version is lost. Though we could ask to every tool to add this information as they download the contracts, it may be easier to just add it at the source.\r\n\r\n**📝 Details**\r\nAdd a comment header to every contract with something along the lines of:\r\n```solidity\r\n/**\r\n * @openzeppelin/contracts@X.Y.Z\r\n * Copyright zOS Global Limited, licensed under MIT\r\n * See https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/\r\n */\r\n ```\r\n\r\nAnd modify the release script so the version identifier on each contract is automatically updated, possibly just by using `sed -i`.",
