    "body": "Hello @CodeSandwich \r\n\r\nI think one of the reason we haven't done that so far is that it would possibly be a breaking change when overriding, because it would expend the \"dependency tree\", and that might require you to specify additional overrides (the IERC20 interfaces) in child contracts.\r\n\r\nStill, applying the change to our master branch does not break compilation, so it might not be as breaking as we anticipated. Worst case scenario, we could to that in 5.0 ... but maybe we could do it before.\r\n\r\n@frangio anything I'm missing here?",
