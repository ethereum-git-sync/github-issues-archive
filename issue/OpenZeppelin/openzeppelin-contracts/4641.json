I'm Lucas, a core contributor to the Radworks project. https://radworks.org/\r\n\r\nWe've been using https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts as part of [Drips](http://drips.network/). It's in fact one of our most critical dependencies!\r\n\r\nWe really appreciate the work you all do and we want to make sure that you are all well-funded to keep doing it. For that reason, we have decided to donate some funds to your project through [Drips](https://www.drips.network/) (an initiative that is coming out of our organization for funding FOSS).\r\n\r\nWho can I talk to about it?\r\n",
