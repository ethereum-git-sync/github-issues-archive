  "body": "[@Amxx suggested adding such a function](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/pull/582#issuecomment-1488838524) to the Cairo version of the ERC165 module in case a smart contract stops supporting an interface after an upgrade. I'd like to open the discussion on whether such a feature would be desired.\r\n\r\nI don't think i've seen much literature around smart contract interface compatibility across upgrades, so I'm not sure how such a feature would be received in the wider ecosystem. In Cairo-land at least, we're considering a massive interface change during [network regenesis](https://medium.com/starkware/starknet-regenesis-the-plan-bd0219843ef4), where such a feature makes sense.",
