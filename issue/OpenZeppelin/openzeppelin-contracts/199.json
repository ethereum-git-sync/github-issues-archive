  "body": "`Shareable` needs some work. From the audit: \r\n\r\n- Doesn’t check if _required <= len(_owners) for instance, that would be a bummer. What if _required were like MAX - 1?\r\n- I have a general concern about the difference between owners, _owners, and owner in Ownable.sol. I recommend “Owners” be renamed. In general we do not recomment single character differences in variable names, although a preceding underscore is not uncommon in Solidity code.\r\n- Line 34: “this contract only has six types of events”. . . actually only two.\r\n- Line 61: Why is ownerIndex keyed by addresses hashed to uints? Why not use the addresses\r\ndirectly, so ownerIndex is less obscure, and so there’s stronger typing?\r\n- Line 62: Do not love ++i) ... owners[2+ i]. Makes me do math, which is not what I want to do.\r\nI want to not have to do math.\r\n- Move execute function from `MultisigWallet` to `Shareable`. ",

    "body": "@maraoz I think it'd be simpler if the ```Shareable contract``` creator passed themselves in as an owner in the ```owners``` argument if the want be one instead of automatically adding the ```msg.sender``` in the constructor.\r\nWhat're your thoughts?\r\n\r\nAlso I'm a little confused why there should be a mapping and an array for keeping track of owners.\r\nIt seems like:\r\n```mapping(address => bool) ownerIndex;```\r\nShould be enough to keep track of owners.
