    "body": "`assert` is more of an invariant label; during runtime, execution should never reach the point where an assert fails. At the moment, this is more of a \"recommendation\", but in the future it will ideally be fully verifiable.\r\n\r\nAssuming that overflows aren't a desirable feature, any time that your int overflows, you can assume that something has gone very wrong (possibly via some sort of malformed/malicious input), so bailing hard and consuming all gas is pretty reasonable.\r\n\r\nSo I suppose the advice would be to write your contract such that those asserts are never reached, which means using `require` to screen the input to your calculations. Basically, normal uses of your contract should never hit assert and won't be bitten by the gas consumption.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nthat said, I totally see why it would be nice to use require, just from a \"good citizen\" perspective; it might be worth a separate SafeMath library that uses require, but changing the currently used one is probably not reasonable or doable.",
