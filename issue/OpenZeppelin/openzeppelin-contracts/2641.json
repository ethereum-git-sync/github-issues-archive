  "body": "So I deployed both the smart contract and the private sale contract. There seems to be a problem with total supply and token tracker of the private sale contract (yes i did enter correctly the token address when deploying private sale ) \r\n\r\nBelow is the smart contract \r\n\r\nhttps://bscscan.com/token/0xf38cd9fa7903871e7602b03acb7dd5b9c210a788\r\n\r\nBelow is the token contract \r\nhttps://bscscan.com/token/0x5d61c35B35b26605ECf7789e3D3F773b4d29961C\r\n\r\n For some reason token tracker comes up an\r\nas 'presale has not started yet. To my understanding the token tracker should have been the name of the project. When I click into token tracker it gives me a very weird total supply where as the total supply for the project is 100M (the private sale contract clearly does not demonstrate that). \r\n\r\nYou can see the discrepancies yourself between both links.\r\nBelow is the Contract \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/BakeryTools/Contracts/blob/main/crowdsale.sol\r\n\r\nWill be much appreciated to identify the issues thank you \r\n\r\nCompiler 0.8.2 \r\n\r\n<!-- Tell us what version of OpenZeppelin Contracts you're using, and how you're using it: Truffle, Remix, etc. -->\r\n\r\n**üìù Details**\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the problem you have been experiencing in more detail.
