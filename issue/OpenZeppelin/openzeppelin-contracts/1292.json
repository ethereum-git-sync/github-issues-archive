    "body": "I think we should distinguish between two problems in the discussion.\r\n\r\nThe exact problem we ran into is that `Whitelist` implemented its whitelist with a `Role` assigned to the whitelisted accounts. When we tried to migrate to the newer `Roles` library, we realized that it would imply that whitelisted accounts could add other accounts to the whitelist, which was not a feature of the previous `Whitelist`.\r\n\r\nThe other problem is more conceptual. For roles in general, we reasoned that it makes sense for role bearers to add the role to other accounts because it was already possible to do it either off-chain (a user doing a favor to another user, or even providing a paid service) or on-chain (by transferring ownership to a forwarder contract); you are already trusting these accounts to begin with. Does the same reasoning make sense for a whitelist? I'd say yes, but it feels weird intuitively. So this made us think that maybe the design of `Whitelist` was ignoring the reality that whitelisted accounts can effectively give access to whitelisted functionality to other accounts. We thought this could result in insecure contract design by users of OpenZeppelin.\r\n\r\nAs far as implementation goes, we can easily add a `whitelister` role, and a set of whitelisted accounts that the whitelisters can modify. What is unclear is if this feature ever makes sense when designing a contract.\r\n\r\nThe one thing that is clear is that whitelisted accounts should never be able to remove other accounts from the whitelist, whereas it is probably reasonable for whitelisters to have this ability.

    "body": "Just to make sure we're on the same page, kyc / aml checks require an address to be whitelisted before it can own any tokens (ie in a _regulated_ ICO or a _regulated_ asset-backed token / security token). This process involves the investor (user who wants to purchase tokens) to verify their identity and source of funds, at which point their address will be added to a whitelist (by the contract owner / operator). This is required by most (probably all truly) regulated tokens and is getting stricter.\r\n\r\nSo in our case, the kyc / aml required is extremely strict (fully regulated in Switzerland). We verify our users identity with a kyc / aml check done by a 3rd party specializing in this. Once this process is complete, the final step is we add them to our on-chain whitelist.\r\n\r\nOnly we can add / remove an address to this whitelist. Otherwise bad things can happen (ie a person gets whitelisted and then whitelists all their friends, etc...) Open zeppelin's implementation of this before 2.0 rc was perfect for us.\r\n\r\n> When we tried to migrate to the newer Roles library, we realized that it would imply that whitelisted accounts could add other accounts to the whitelist, which was not a feature of the previous Whitelist.\r\n\r\n^ Definitely a no-go for this use-case.\r\n\r\nI do expect this will be a very common use-case and get more and more common. It's simple enough to do on our own, but seems appropriate for this library to me at least.",

    "body": "Great @nventuro \r\n\r\n> should a whitelister be able to remove an address from the whitelisted set?\r\n\r\nyes, this functionality is required by regulators because in certain cases an address needs to be removed (ie a person is added to an anti-money-laundering (AML) 'blacklist', or a user's passport has expired and they haven't / won't update their kyc info)\r\n\r\n> pre-2.0 rc, a single address (the owner) was in charge of adding and removing addresses from the whitelist. Would it be fine for this address to also be able to designate new whitelister addresses, with these same powers?\r\n\r\nit sounds like a really nice feature for there to be multiple `whitelister` addresses with power to add / remove addresses to whitelist. although a `whitelister` being able to add / remove other `whitelisters` sounds like something we probably wouldn't want for our use-case, and would override. I'd have to think about it a bit more, but seems a bit too much power to give a `whitelister` and we tend to stick with least-privileged permissions.\r\n\r\nthat said, I understand it works with what you have in `Roles` best. and really if we only have one address (our address) as the `whitelister` this isn't a problem anyways and we have exactly what we had pre v2.\r\n\r\njust incase it's interesting, here is our `Whitelist.sol` pre v2\r\n```solidity\r\npragma solidity 0.4.24;\r\n\r\nimport \"openzeppelin-solidity/contracts/ownership/Claimable.sol\";\r\nimport \"openzeppelin-solidity/contracts/access/rbac/RBAC.sol\";\r\n\r\ncontract Whitelist is Claimable, RBAC {\r\n  function grantPermission(address _operator, string _permission) public onlyOwner {\r\n    addRole(_operator, _permission);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  function revokePermission(address _operator, string _permission) public onlyOwner {\r\n    removeRole(_operator, _permission);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  function grantPermissionBatch(address[] _operators, string _permission) public onlyOwner {\r\n    for (uint256 i = 0; i < _operators.length; i++) {\r\n      addRole(_operators[i], _permission);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  function revokePermissionBatch(address[] _operators, string _permission) public onlyOwner {\r\n    for (uint256 i = 0; i < _operators.length; i++) {\r\n      removeRole(_operators[i], _permission);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```",
