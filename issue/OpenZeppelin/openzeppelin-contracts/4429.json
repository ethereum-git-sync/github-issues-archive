  "body": "Why does the nonce increment every time a contract uses a permit?\r\n\r\nConsider the case where i sign a permit for a contract to use 10000 of my token X within a deadline of 1 year.\r\n(Maybe it's a bid on an NFT for example)\r\n\r\nThe next day I go on a different dApp sign a permit for the same token X and the dApp uses it immediately.\r\n\r\nNow the permit i had signed before (which was valid for a year) is suddenly invalid.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nI think the _useNonce  function should be turned public and it is up to the user to call it if he wants to cancel all his previously signed permits.\r\n\r\nTo me this would make a lot more sense.\r\nOr am i misunderstanding something?",
