If we want to do it to save gas is a different and also valid question. I wonder how much gas it saves?",

    "body": "Coming back to @kindex \r\n\r\nFirst of all, thank you for your issue. It really got us thinking and re-reading the ERC multiple time. We come to agree that the ERC is not clear, and that your comment is really pushing our interpretation of it.\r\n\r\nOur analysis is:\r\n- If someone calls `approve(...) external` multiple times, we should be emitting the event multiple times\r\n- If `_transfer` is called, regardless of how it was called (safe/unsafe/by operator), we should reset the approval to 0. It is not clear if an `Approval` event should be emitted on top of the `Transfer` event (this is really unclear)\r\n\r\nYour proposal would improve gas usage, but it would also break the first bullet point. It might be possible to improve event emission without breaking this, but it would require a non-trivial change of the codebase, for example changing the parameters of the internal `_approve`. This would be a breaking change for people building on top of this contract.\r\n\r\nWhile we do care about gas costs, the complexity and the backward compatibility of the codebase are also very important, and we feel like it might not make sense to change things right now.",
