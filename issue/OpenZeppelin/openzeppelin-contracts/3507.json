This is also a hint that this change is a breaking one and should be published no sooner than with a major version of OZ.\r\n\r\n**🔢 Code to reproduce bug**\r\n",

This is an intrinsic limitation of the EVM that just doesn't have a simple solution. And the code is very extensively documented so users understand what this function does and what it doesn't do.",

I've searched for a similar issue, but none was about zero length and switching to `codehash`.\r\n\r\nI agree that it's impossible to make `isContract` bulletproof and I understand the direction the project took.
