On this front, making the claim ownership function `payable` and direct msg.value to transferring owner would be neat).",

    "body": "We removed `Claimable` at the time when we introduced roles for more granular access control. We left `Ownable` because it's still useful for quick and dirty tests, but we think most contracts should use the granular control provided by `AccessControl`.\r\n\r\nWe considered making `AccessControl` roles claimable, but in the end we settled for a design that doesn't have a `transfer` function for roles. There is only `grant` and `revoke` which can be invoked by admins, aside from `renounce`. It's hard for me to see where the grant and claim pattern would make sense in this design.\r\n\r\nI would love to hear everyone's thoughts on this though, I may be mistaken. The people that want to use `Claimable`, have you seen `AccessControl`? Have you decided against it for your own projects? Please share your experience!",
