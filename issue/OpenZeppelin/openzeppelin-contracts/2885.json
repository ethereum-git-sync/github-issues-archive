    "body": "If I understand correctly @zgfzgf's claim is that it is a problem for a successful proposal to remain unqueued indefinitely, and that there should be a period during which it can be queued, after which it would become expired.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, @zgfzgf sees it as a problem that it's not easy to determine the life span of a proposal, and observes that it may be wrong to execute a proposal after other proposals.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWe'd encourage users to add a queue period if they find it important, but we don't see it as a general need. And we also don't think that execute proposals out of order is necessarily a problem, so we will not be opinionated about it. Governance is a critical component and I think we should expect governance operators to be responsible and execute their proposals in a timely and orderly manner.",
