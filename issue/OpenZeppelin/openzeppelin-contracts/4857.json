  "body": "**üßê Motivation**\r\n- Reduce the gas consumption of function `Math.tryAdd`\r\n- Consolidate the output of function `Math.tryAdd`\r\n- Expand the usability of function `Math.tryAdd`\r\n \r\n**üìù Details**\r\n\r\nIn addition to the sum of two input values, this function returns an indication of whether or not the calculation is safe:\r\n- True if an overflow does not occur during the calculation\r\n- False if an overflow does occur during the calculation\r\n\r\nHowever, in the case of an overflow, it also returns the calculated sum as zero instead of as the actual (overflowing) result.\r\n\r\nThe implications of this are:\r\n1. Output redundancy, as both returned values provide the exact same information, namely - an overflow has occurred\r\n2. Output deficiency, as the 2nd returned value does not provide the overflowing result, which may nevertheless be useful\r\n3. Increased gas consumption\r\n\r\nMy point in bullet 2 above is that the information has already been calculated, so why not return it to the user and let them decide what to do with it? Perhaps you've decided to return 0 as some sort of \"safety net\" in case of erroneous usage by the caller of the function, but under such scenario, I cannot quite see how 0 would be \"safer\" than any other value.\r\n\r\nThis is [your current implementation](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/math/Math.sol#L25-L31):\r\n```\r\nfunction tryAdd(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (bool success, uint256 result) {\r\n    unchecked {\r\n        uint256 c = a + b;\r\n        if (c < a) return (false, 0);\r\n        return (true, c);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAnd this is my suggested implementation:\r\n```\r\nfunction tryAdd(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (bool success, uint256 result) {\r\n    unchecked {\r\n        result = a + b;\r\n        success = result >= a;\r\n     }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nGas measurement conducted as follows:\r\n- Compiler version 0.8.20\r\n- Optimizer enabled with 200 runs\r\n\r\nContract code:\r\n```\r\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: SEE LICENSE IN LICENSE\r\npragma solidity 0.8.20;\r\n\r\nabstract contract Contract {\r\n    uint256 public gasUsed;\r\n\r\n    function test(uint256 a, uint256 b) external returns (bool success, uint256 result) {\r\n        uint256 gasLeft = gasleft();\r\n        (success, result) = tryAdd(a, b);\r\n        gasUsed = gasLeft - gasleft();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function tryAdd(uint256, uint256) internal virtual pure returns (bool, uint256);\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract Contract1 is Contract {\r\n    function tryAdd(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal override pure returns (bool success, uint256 result) {\r\n        unchecked {\r\n            uint256 c = a + b;\r\n            if (c < a) return (false, 0);\r\n            return (true, c);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract Contract2 is Contract {\r\n    function tryAdd(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal override pure returns (bool success, uint256 result) {\r\n        unchecked {\r\n            result = a + b;\r\n            success = result >= a;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nTruffle test code:\r\n```\r\nconst Contract1 = artifacts.require(\"Contract1\");\r\nconst Contract2 = artifacts.require(\"Contract2\");\r\n\r\nconst MAX = web3.utils.toBN(1).shln(256);\r\n\r\ndescribe(\"test\", () => {\r\n    it(\"test\", async () => {\r\n        console.log();\r\n        for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {\r\n            for (let j = 0; j < 5; j++) {\r\n                await test(MAX.addn(i).mod(MAX), MAX.addn(j).mod(MAX));\r\n                await test(MAX.addn(i).mod(MAX), MAX.subn(j).mod(MAX));\r\n                await test(MAX.subn(i).mod(MAX), MAX.addn(j).mod(MAX));\r\n                await test(MAX.subn(i).mod(MAX), MAX.subn(j).mod(MAX));\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    async function test(a, b) {\r\n        const gasUsed = [];\r\n        for (const Contract of [Contract1, Contract2]) {\r\n            const contract = await Contract.new();\r\n            const receipt = await contract.test(a, b);\r\n            gasUsed.push(await contract.gasUsed());\r\n        }\r\n        console.log(`${gasUsed[0]}, ${gasUsed[1]} (a = ${a}, b = ${b})`);\r\n        assert(gasUsed[0].gte(gasUsed[1]));\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n```\r\nI've also tested with `[Contract2, Contract1]`, in order to make sure that the order of execution doesn't impact the results.\r\n\r\nTLDR gas measurement:\r\n- Your current implementation: either 117 or 131 gas per function call\r\n- My suggested implementation: 38 gas per function call\r\n\r\nIt is slightly surprising, since my implementation replaces your implementation's usage of `<` with `>=`.\r\nLast time I checked, the latter was slightly more expensive than the former (5 gas vs 3 gas).\r\nPerhaps it is your forcing of `0` which makes your implementation ultimately more expensive than my implementation.\r\nOr perhaps it is because you are not using the function-declaration's return variables `(bool success, uint256 result)`.\r\n\r\nOne important note to point out is that if you choose to accept this suggestion, then it will break any code which happens to rely on both returned value for detecting an overflow, i.e., `if (success == false && result == 0)`.\r\n\r\nAnd despite the fact that such logic is generally wrong, it should probably be emphasized in the related release notes.\r\n\r\nA similar approach can probably be used also for function `trySub` and for function `tryMul`.\r\n\r\nThank you :)",

Regardless of whether or not the correct usage is to rely on `0`. I'd expect the most popular use case of `tryAdd` would be to use both the flag *and* the value, otherwise just checking if it'll overflow with `bool overflows = a > b` would do the job.\r\n\r\nI like the idea, and the savings look promising. But either we wait until 6.x or release a separate version of `try*` called `unchecked*` (temptatively) so that people can \"safely\" use unchecked operations and mark the previoius `try*` as deprecated.",

Regardless of whether or not the correct usage is to rely on `0`. I'd expect the most popular use case of `tryAdd` would be to use both the flag _and_ the value, otherwise just checking if it'll overflow with `bool overflows = a > b` would do the job.\r\n> \r\n> I like the idea, and the savings look promising. But either we wait until 6.x or release a separate version of `try*` called `unchecked*` (temptatively) so that people can \"safely\" use unchecked operations and mark the previoius `try*` as deprecated.\r\n\r\nYes, this is exactly what I had in mind as well - in order to avoid breaking the current interface, you implement this in a new function on the current version, which you can name `safeAdd` or something similar, and on the next major-version release, you deprecate the current function - `tryAdd`.",

If you expect that to be the majority of the cases, then it makes sens to use the first syntax. I would not condemn a dev that understands the details of `tryAdd` and use that to save its users some gas.\r\n\r\nYes, I apologize, I've mistaken your original code for this:\r\n```\r\n(uint256 result, bool success) = tryAdd(x, y);\r\nif (result > 0) {\r\n    // do stuff\r\n} else revert(\"overflow\");\r\n```\r\nWhich is obviously erroneous handling for the case of `x` being set to zero and `y` being set to zero.\r\nI've mistaken your `require` statement for a `revert` statement.\r\nI suppose I just read it hastily, eager to prove my point :)\r\n\r\nBut in either case, this just brings a 4th argument (on top of the 3 which I have already mentioned), as to why it might be a win-win to move away from the \"embedded ambiguity\" (sort to speak) in setting the result to zero when an overflow occurs.\r\n\r\nLastly, in order to avoid the risk of breaking this expected behavior for existing consumers, see my suggestion above.\r\nTLDR: implement it in a new function on v5, and deprecate the current function on v6 (alongside appropriate documentation, including the differences between the two functions, in the contract AND in the release notes).\r\n\r\nP.S.: with regards to gas-saving, my suggestion refers to the **internal** improvement of the function, not to how one can handle the function's output in order to save gas (which appears to be what you've focused on at the end of your comment).",
