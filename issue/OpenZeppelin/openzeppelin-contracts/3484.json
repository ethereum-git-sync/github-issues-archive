The zero address indicates there is no approved address.\r\n    ///  When a Transfer event emits, this also indicates that the approved\r\n    ///  address for that NFT (if any) is reset to none.\r\n    event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _approved, uint256 indexed _tokenId);\r\n ```\r\n\r\n\r\n",
