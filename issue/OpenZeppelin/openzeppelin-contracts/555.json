  "body": "Hi @maraoz ,\r\nIts been quite a while since [Solium](https://github.com/duaraghav8/Solium) `v1` was released. It comes with significant improvements including automatic code fixing, new security checks for contract code and ability to configure rule behavior (like 2 spaces instead of 4).\r\n\r\nI'm raising this issue to simply make you aware, since v1 will significantly improve your workflow.\r\n\r\nAdoption is pretty simple:\r\n\r\n`npm i -g solium`\r\n\r\nGoing by your current `.soliumrc.json`, your new `.soliumrc.json` would look like:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"extends\": \"solium:all\",\r\n  \"plugins\": [\"security\"],\r\n  \"rules\": {\r\n    \"mixedcase\": \"off\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n(Although I should inform you that the mixedcase rule's bugs have been resolved)\r\n\r\nIf, for eg, you'd like to disable a security rule you don't agree with, simply add `\"security/rule-name\": \"off\"` inside `rules` object.\r\n\r\nRun normally using `solium -d contracts/` or `solium -d contracts/ --fix` to apply code fixes (wherever possible).\r\n\r\n[Usage docs](http://solium.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide.html)\r\n[List of Security Rules](https://github.com/duaraghav8/solium-plugin-security#list-of-rules)\r\n\r\nPlease do not hesitate in closing this issue if you feel its not currently a priority. However, I do recommend that you upgrade to further improve contract security. Feel free to ask me anything!\r\n\r\n(I can make a PR for this, but a dev must update their solium version on workstation too)",
