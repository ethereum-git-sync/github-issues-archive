    "body": "Thank you for taking the time to fix it. \r\n\r\nMay I ask about the rationale for the removal of the contracts? I am particularly interested in the `PullPayment` contract because, as far as I know, the pull pattern for payments should still be preferred to a push implementation as it prevents funds being locked by a misbehaving contract on the other end of the transfer or a malicious contract \"forcing\" a badly written auction contract to grant it the auction by not allowing higher bids.\r\n\r\nOne contract I am working on used the `PullPayment` contract from v4 and after updating to v5 I've had to reimplement it myself. Not a big deal, of course, but still an unexpected bump in the road with no motivation to be found.",
