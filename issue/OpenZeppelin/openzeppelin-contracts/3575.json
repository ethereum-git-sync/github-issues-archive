Tell us about it! -->\r\n\r\nIn the current token implementations of OpenZeppelin contracts, [only the ERC721 implementation contains the `supportsInterface(...)` function](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/d1b1e17d23cc28eecd07e411a461854988803aa8/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol#L52).\r\n\r\nERC20 does not contain `supportsInterface(...)` by default.\r\n\r\nI am not sure why this is the case, but my first guess would be the order that each of these ERC20 came up?\r\n> Looking at [ERC721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721#specification) specs, ERC165 is mentioned but not in the formal [ERC20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) specs.\r\n\r\n**üìù Details**\r\n<!-- Please describe your feature request in detail. -->\r\n\r\nWould it make sense to add `supportsInterface(...)` in ERC20, and make the contract inherit from `ERC165` as well? So that by default, both fungible and non-fungible tokens implementation from OZ library can be detected easily via this function?\r\n\r\nLet me know your thoughts @frangio @Amxx and I would be happy to make a brief PR if this feature request is accepted.\r\n\r\n<!-- Make sure that you have reviewed the OpenZeppelin Contracts Contributor Guidelines. -->\r\n<!-- https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md -->\r\n",

    "body": "Hello @CJ42 \r\n\r\nAs you point out:\r\n> Looking at [ERC721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721#specification) specs, ERC165 is mentioned but not in the formal [ERC20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) specs.\r\n\r\nERC721's interfaceId is widely known, and expected in all ERC721 implementation. You can therefore rely on it to check it an unknown contract is ERC721\r\n\r\nERC20's interfaceId is not widelly accepted, ERC20 is not required to implement ERC165, and (almost) no instance of ERC20 include it. This means that you either:\r\n\r\n- know for sure the contract implements ERC165, but then you also now for sure what the contract is, and that it is an ERC20 ...\r\n- don't know the contract, and can't rely on ERC165 to detect if it is an ERC20\r\n\r\nGoing back in time, it would have been nice to have ERC165 before ERC20 (among a LOT of other things we would change about ERC20 is we were designing it today). However we have to work with the existing ecosystem, and given that ERC20 doesn't include 165, it makes very little sens to suddenly add it.\r\n\r\nNote that if you want to add it, it should be very easy for you. We are just not going to make that choice for the user.",

It sounds non-standard and not conventional to not implement it on one of the three most used.\n\nEspecially as ERC20 is cited in the motivation section of the ERC165 standard itself.\n\nAlthought \"supportsInterface\" can always be faked (a dummy/malicious function implementation that can return \"true\" for certain interface IDs), it makes it more explicit. Otherwise it feels it's more \"assumed\".\n\nI would be interested to hear @frangio opinion on this too.\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31145285/230259047-ad52e2c4-d291-4f14-a71a-319e857b04ed.png)",

There's https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1363 (which is final and therefore safe to use) and there's https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4524.\r\n\r\nI would like to notify everyone that ERC-20 standard violates **common secure software design principles** ([source 1](https://kirkpatrickprice.com/blog/secure-coding-best-practices/) and [source 2](https://docs.oracle.com/en/operating-systems/oracle-linux/6/security/ol_desprinsc_sec.html)) that state:\r\n\r\n1. **Error handling is a must.** In ERC-20 there is no transaction handling for `transfer` function which means error handling is impossible.\r\n2. **Failsafe defaults / software must be secure by design.** ERC-20 is not secure by design and the \"default\" of `transfer` and `transferFrom` function is to allow action (transfer of tokens in this case) to be performed without checking for its correctness.\r\n3. **Allowing the user to make decisions related to the internal logic of the program must be avoided**. Token transfers to EOAs and to contracts work differently. Secure token standard must determine the transferring method automatically. ERC-20, ERC-1363 and other token standards prompt a user to make a decision on what transferring method to use and if the wrong method was chosen - it results in the loss of tokens for the user.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat @Pandapip1 calls \"safe to use\" resulted in a loss of [$201,690,000 worth of tokens](https://gist.github.com/Dexaran/40213a04ce46b394279ac7daa581ce87). \r\n\r\nHere is a description thread: https://ethresear.ch/t/security-concerns-regarding-token-standards-and-130m-worth-of-erc20-tokens-loss-on-ethereum-mainnet/16387\r\n\r\nHere is my old article on subject: https://dexaran820.medium.com/known-problems-of-erc20-token-standard-e98887b9532c#:~:text=ERC%2D20%20token%20standard%20contains,during%20the%20past%206%20years.\r\n\r\nHere is another article that describes how `approve & transferFrom` pattern must be deprecated and considered insecure as well: https://dexaran820.medium.com/erc-20-approve-transferfrom-asset-transfer-method-poses-a-threat-to-users-funds-safety-ff7195127018\r\n\r\n**As a security auditor I would not call something that resulted in a loss of $201M \"safe to use\".**",
