For these use cases I am proposing introduction of permissioned re-entrancy guard which facilitates this exact use-case. \r\n\r\n**üìù Details**\r\n\r\nCode for permissioned re-entrancy guard is at this location\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/18dew/6cfcc6eace110291df13c7be34e8c5eb\r\n",

    "body": "Hey @18dew, thanks for the suggestion. Indeed I can see use cases in which you'd like to have a `reentrancy` enabled, but it seems to me like a very specific use case that may not be used frequently.\r\n\r\nDo you have any idea of what is a common use case? It may also help us to design its implementation based on the most common uses",

In current state,  sequential calls where re-entrancy is enforced leads to creation of two distinct transaction to be done on chain.
