However, if the Governor is not the executor itself, it can't operate on those tokens except using the `relay` function.\r\n\r\nWe consider that all of these receive hooks can also validate that the Governor is also the executor, as in the `receive()` function:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n/**\r\n * @dev Function to receive ETH that will be handled by the governor (disabled if executor is a third party contract)\r\n */\r\nreceive() external payable virtual {\r\n    if (_executor() != address(this)) {\r\n        revert GovernorDepositDisabled(address(this));\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```",

    "body": "Hey @AnmolSirola, thanks for your interest!\n\nSure, the issue is result from [this discussion](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4261#discussion_r1211347491), we agreed that Governor has no reason to receive tokens if it's no the executor so we're thinking of a check like:\n\n```solidity\nrequire(address(this) == executor())\n```\n\nWe would require also a test for each error to accept the PR, you can instantiate an ERC721 and ERC1155 and use [hardhat exposed](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hardhat-exposed) (already installed in this repo) to call `$_safeMint` to the governor and trigger the expected error.\n\nNote that the target branch would be master but we're aiming to merge #4261 quite soon.",
