  "body": "@alcuadrado mentioned to me that our `TokenVesting` contract is not aligned with the usual requirements for vesting, so some potential users have had to write their own implementations.\r\n\r\nFor example, our contract does a \"continuous\" release of tokens, whereas the usual requirement is for tokens to be released in batches e.g. every month.\r\n\r\nWe should review the contract and make it conform to what users need.\r\n\r\nI'm a bit concerned that this will be a breaking change but we won't be able to get it done for v2.0. So perhaps we should look into adding any parameters that we need now, and implement support for them later. For example, for the issue I described above we could add a \"granularity\" parameter in the constructor (problaby a bad name) and for now require that it is always zero. Just a thought.",

    "body": "@rstormsf We actually want to keep the current model where there is one vesting contract deployed per schedule per beneficiary, and Colony's `Vesting` is quite the opposite since it is a central contract that is used for all beneficiaries. Do you see other problems with our current `TokenVesting` that Colony's contract solves?\r\n\r\nThe continuous release is the biggest issue with our current offering. We need the possibility to make it non-continuous because that's the way actual paper-based vesting contracts are signed. Those may, for example, vest monthly, i.e. release only at the end of each month.\r\n\r\nThe frequency is one of the parameters that we have to add, but we need to do some more research on the typical vesting schedules used and try to support them.

    "body": "I have something I'd like to share that might be of interest to this group.\r\n\r\nI have just completed implementation of a pretty sophisticated ERC20 contract for a full-featured vesting token. I rolled my own because what I've seen on the internet so far hasn't met our needs, which include many of the wishes expressed above. Our implementation is based on openzeppen-solidity as much as possible, and is built along the same guidelines of style and works harmoniously with it. I will be publishing this work on GitHub within the next day or so, and will post the link here for all to see when it's up. \r\n\r\nHere is a brief summary of its features and capabilities:\r\n- Simultaneously supports both revocable and irrevocable token grants. Use cases for this are token purchases (irrevocable) as well employee compensation plans (revocable).\r\n- At the time of grant, tokens are deposited into the beneficiary's account, but the non-vested portion is prevented from being spent. We like this model because it ensures the not-vested tokens are stored safely with the beneficiary and remain locked, with no possibility of unreleased tokens being accidentally spent or used for another purpose.\r\n- If a revocable token grant is revoked by the grantor, the beneficiary keeps the vested tokens, and the not-vested tokens are returned to the grantor.\r\n- Sophisticated support for a grantor role, which can be assigned to multiple accounts, creating the ability to form multiple grant pools of different types for different purposes, each with its own grantor.\r\n- Each grant pool may have its own uniform vesting schedule, which is applied to grants made to all beneficiaries from that pool. Restrictions can be set to parameterize the grantor's ability to set start dates, and a grantor expiration date can be set to automatically close the pool.\r\n- There's also an ability to create one-off grants, where each beneficiary can have a unique vesting schedule for its grant.\r\n- The vesting schedule supports start date, cliff date, end date and interval. If interval is 1, the grant vests linearly. If interval is a number like say 30, vesting bumps up every 30 days. There is a restriction that both the interval from start to the cliff and the overall duration must be an even multiple of the interval. This flexibility opens up many possible vesting patterns.\r\n- All grant-related dates are measured in whole days, with each day starting at midnight UTC time. This locks all vesting to the same clock, which will help with orderly bookkeeping. It also disallows absurd cases like grants that are 15 minutes long, etc.\r\n- There is a limit of one vesting grant at a time per account. A beneficiary can have multiple grants in effect on different terms simply by using a new account for each new grant.\r\n- Support for an address self-registration mechanism, and safe methods which will only transact with a verified address, to help prevent token loss through accidental bad data.\r\n- Enterprise-style support for roles and permissions, with mechanisms in place to prevent loss of ownership control or accidental transfer of ownership to an invalid address.\r\n- Full automated test coverage of the contract code written in nodejs.\r\n\r\nI am wrapping up loose ends with this work before I publish the source, but it will be soon. I am eager to receive any feedback and hear ideas for improvement that this group may have. Also, I hope many of you will find it useful, and can help me improve on it.\r\n\r\nThanks! \r\n- DJ",

    "body": "Wishes stated in the above conversation that are supported by my implementation:\r\n- Continuous vesting vs interval vesting are both supported (the shortest supported vesting interval is daily, which might be close enough to “continuous” for most applications that need it).\r\n- Uses SafeMath, and/or only works with range-restricted, checked values.\r\n- Supports both vesting schedule models: a unique vesting schedule per beneficiary or a shared vesting schedule for many beneficiaries (administered by a grant pool).\r\n- Tokens are automatically released at at regular interval, depending on what is specified in the vesting schedule. Can be daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, etc.) The grantor never has to take any action to release vested tokens.\r\n\r\nWhat’s not supported, which I saw mentioned above:\r\n- Doesn’t support múltiple simultaneous vesting schedules for one beneficiary. Implementing that looked to be messy and would have cost a lot of gas. Workaround is simply to use more ethereum accounts if needed, so one person can serve as multiple beneficiaries.\r\n- Implementation is rather large, so it doesn’t necessarily have a small attack surface. Best practices are used to minimize risk, however.\r\n- Doesn’t try to be a general purpose token, but instead assumes that the ICO/IEO project may not have implemented its ecosystem token or even fully know its requirements up front, and therefore tries only to be the token for managing grants. The expectation is that when the ecosystem is built later and it’s smart contract is ready, the vested/granted tokens would later be exchangeable/redeemable 1:1 for the project’s final ecosystem token. This also adheres to a software best practice called “the single responsibility principle”.\r\n\r\nEager to hear your feedback.",

Thanks.\r\n\r\nHello , I used the vestingvault contract but at the time of using addTokenGrant() , it throws an error of 'subtraction overflow' . I believe that is to say that owner does not have any token at the time of transfer to contract .\r\n`require(token.transferFrom(owner(), address(this), _amount));`\r\n\r\nbut I provided all 1 billion token to owner in ERC20 contract at time of deployment. My contract vestingvault.sol is at \r\n[https://github.com/ashishk74/Vesting](url)\r\n\r\nCan somebody kindly debug the issue ?\r\n",
