  "body": "Lots of security problems (including [the infamous TheDAO hack](http://hackingdistributed.com/2016/06/17/thoughts-on-the-dao-hack/)) can be prevented by using a pull payment strategy (as opposed to pushing payments with `send`).\r\n\r\nWe already have a simple [PullPayment](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/blob/v1.9.0/contracts/payment/PullPayment.sol) contract, but more comprehensive tools, documentation and examples are needed.\r\n\r\nA simple idea is to create a subclass of PullPayment that allows sending money to all pending payees at once.",

    "body": "Thanks for the suggestion @mardlin! I love the idea.\nIt's a very good compromise solution, because a \"cron job\" that dispatches all the payments would have a cost (owner of the cron job has to pay for all the gas for withdrawals), but it would improve Pull Payments UX by a lot for users!\nSo, the contract owner is probably motivated to pay for that gas cost. Maybe we could implement another version of PullPayments with a \"withdrawAll\" method? \n",
