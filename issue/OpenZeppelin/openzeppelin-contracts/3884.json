Improve the documentation by adding a big warning (this doesn't imply it's a documentation issue, people might still ignore it)\r\n2. Move it to `mocks`\r\n3. Completely remove it\r\n4. Keep it in the docs somewhere else written in the docs as an example\r\n\r\nMy intuition makes me feel that number 1 won't solve the issue long-term.

Here is the old Relay Hub contract (I think it's from GSN) on Rinkeby they used for gasless transactions: https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0xd216153c06e857cd7f72665e0af1d7d82172f494.
