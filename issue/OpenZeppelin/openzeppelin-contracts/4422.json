It's true that a user might be already in trouble if they don't fully understand how reentrancy works, but I also don't want to give people reasons to throw the `nonReentrant` everywhere without a reason because in such case, it would also increase the runtime costs of `external` functions accessing `view` getters.\r\n\r\nWe would need some data to evaluate better if there's a significative impact of users using unnecessary `nonReentrant` modifiers\r\n ",

If it wasn't then I'm sure mature tooling like slither would have fixed all their reentrancy false positive/negatives long ago.\r\n\r\n> adding it doesn't fully solve problems such as defensive try/catch on guarded functions\r\n\r\nok, can we talk about this, because as i understand, the proposed modifier completely solves the need to do this\r\n\r\nin what scenario does the view modifier NOT remove the need for an external consumer to defensively ping unrelated functions in the hope of spotting an error without unintended side effects?\r\n\r\n> The way I see it is that it's very easy for experimented users to build the view modifier on their own (they're already doing it afaik) than expect nonadvanced users to know when to use the modifier, so I'm leaning towards just making the reentrant status public.\r\n\r\nThe problem with this stance is that in defi it's the _end users_ that need to convince themselves that something is safe to put their money into, not just the code author.\r\n\r\nHaving and adopting clear standard approaches to mitigating known risks lowers the bar for _readers_ to understand whether something is safe or not.\r\n\r\nThere is value in being able to say \"you don't even have to care about whether reeentrancy is an issue here\" vs. \"you have to read every other line of the contract to figure out whether this line is vulnerable\".",

    "body": "> @Amxx i think in context \"why?\" is a reasonable response to \"they should\", could you give me a little more than a thumbs down so i can understand you better?\r\n\r\nThat not really related to the question at end (adding a modifier specificly for view functions), so I did not want to go to far in that direction.\r\nBut basically the discussion went:\r\n- (you) less-knowledgable devs should use this modifier everywhere\r\n- (me) they should start by learning what reentrancy is, and how to deal with it\r\n  - my underlying point is that understanding the common issues is an essential part of being a smart contract developper, and just blindly using a modifier everywhere is not a good option IMO\r\n- (you) \"why? should everyone also learn how to write assembly to avoid spending gas\"\r\n\r\nIMO, comparing \"learning what the common security issues are, and how to properly address them\" with \"gas goofing in assembly\" makes no sens at all. I've been in stil space since 2017, and I can tell you that one is way more critical than the other. I'm honestly wondered that people seem to care about gas usage more than they care about learning and applying security good practices.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSo going back to the initial discussion, my view is still:\r\n\r\n- Reentrancy is a real issue that leads to many hacks\r\n  - I still personnaly believe that this is the result of improper design, and invariant violations. In most cases using non-reentrant is the easy fix, not the right fix.\r\n- While I don't like the non-reentrant construction, I understand it can be usefull in some cases\r\n  - I still think in a majority of the case where its used its not needed, and it limits composability of contracts\r\n- Adding a variant of the modifier that is read-only will serve a very small number of usecases\r\n- **Adding a variant of the modifier that is read-only will create confusion as to what the difference is, and which one should be used:**\r\n  - lets say someone uses the \"non-view\" for two functions, one of which is view, he will get an error. Instead of using two different modifier, he may be tempted to use the view version everywhere, because that doesn't give an error. This would bring zero protection to a user that thinks he is protected\r\n- I VERY strongly think that recommanding users to use non-reentrant modifier everywhere is a terrible thing to do. I would strongly oppose any documentation change that goes in that direction.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSaid otherwize, my issue with a read-only nonReentrant modifier is that I'm worried about the confusion is will create in users mind. I care about the discoverability and clarity of \"what should be used when\". If the recommandation is \"slapping nonReentrant everywhere\", then that is no good to me.",

    "body": "@Amxx you misunderstand what i'm saying and so I think we're talking past each other.\r\n\r\n~~> * less-knowledgable devs should use this modifier everywhere~~\r\n\r\nI never brought up individual dev experience, and think it's a massive red herring and a waste of time to consider. Of course everyone should educate themselves on every issue to the best of their ability.\r\n\r\nWhat I meant was that even if someone did use it everywhere, who cares? I didn't say \"should\" i said \"we're not here to judge\". The only harm they caused is potentially some vague \"loss of composability\" which may not even apply to their particular protocol, there's no way of knowing without looking at what they're actually building in context.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm really talking about here is assurance vs. correctness.\r\n\r\nTaking the peanut allergy...\r\n\r\nChefs in a commercial kitchen are making food for _other people_ and yeah, in that case, most countries do have clear and conservative labelling laws, such as \"may contain traces of nuts\". Does that mean there are actually nuts in the food? no. It means the food production process is complex and despite best efforts, people make mistakes. If the kitchen as an org can't _prove_ that everything coming out of the facility is nut free, they can't say it is, because somebody might die.\r\n\r\nThe best in class tools available to devs (as far as I know) cannot _prove_ a contract is using the optimal combination of code patterns and guards, while still being safe. They throw up a lot of warnings like \"go look at this\" and can't actually understand guards, other than to do hacky things like hardcode a modifier name. So devs are in a position where even if they're convinced their code is fine, that code is handling large sums of _other people's money_ in a very hostile and very permanent environment, and that's a valid reason to want to be extra careful, even if it might seem ridiculous at times.\r\n\r\nI don't think it's productive to be passing judgement on devs who want to put guards on their code or not put guards on their code. Objectively there's cost/risk/benefit tradeoffs either way, and a guard is a useful tool in the toolkit. You lose something with guards and you gain something. The art of development is making enough of the right tradeoffs to provide something useful to people.\r\n\r\n2 weeks ago i flagged the 1700 eth conic hack as an example of read only reentrancy causing severe damages, this week I'll flag the issues in vyper reentrancy guards that led to ~$50 million drained on curve alone last week.\r\n\r\nSurely we consider vyper and curve devs experienced? Still, a faulty guard implementation coupled with insufficient test coverage wiped a lot of funds out. Having a rock solid reentrancy guard implementation is something useful. I'm sure a lot of devs would now feel less comfortable rolling their own modifiers, after what happened to vyper/curve.\r\n\r\n~~>  \"why? should everyone also learn how to write assembly to avoid spending gas\"~~\r\n\r\nI'm saying that OZ is full of examples where comprehensive safety is prioritised over gas (which is an approach I agree with for a library like OZ).\r\n\r\nIn this thread for this issue, the gas cost was raised as a potential reason to avoid guards in case people overuse guards and cause contracts to be too expensive somehow.\r\n\r\nThe gas cost of a guard is comparable to the gas cost of checking that an array index exists in `foo[i]` syntax, it's negligible. Or at least would not be the first place I would go looking to optimise gas, out of all the places we pay an overhead for redundant safety rails it's low on the list.\r\n\r\nThe point I was actually making is that I don't see gas as a major reason to either adopt or not adopt reentrancy guards.\r\n\r\n> When you use nonReentrant, you block a lot of composability. You lose a lot of features. IMO you are not really fixing the problem. Maybe in some cases that is the only thing you can do, but in many cases you can do so much better. Its not just about cost, its about composable design.\r\n\r\nOk but...\r\n\r\nOZ already provides a reentrancy guard. That decision has been made, to provide that tool in the toolkit. Given that it does exist, we should either make that tool the best possible version of itself, or decide to remove it.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that offering write-only reentrancy guards is an incomplete solution. Read only reentrancy is dangerous too, and there's no reason that a guard is any more or less valid for reads than writes.\r\n\r\nTurning the question around, if OZ already had both read and write guards, would there be a reasonable case for removing read only guards and leaving write guards in the codebase?\r\n\r\nThe point about composability can be largely resolved by offering keyed guards like vyper does. That way you only block the specific related functions that are incompatible with each other, rather than having a global block on the whole contract. I feel like that's an out of scope topic for this issue though...",
