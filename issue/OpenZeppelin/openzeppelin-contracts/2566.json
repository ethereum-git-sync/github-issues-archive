And again, pushing a with-deadline forwarder for adoption means pushing a without-the-other-stuff forwarder.\r\nAlso I believe that having multiple forwarder is a bad idea. IMO, there should be only one standard forwarder, and it should be available on all networks at the same address (just like 1820 registry). This means that it must be standardise, and while we are willing to participate, this standardisation is beyond our prerogatives.\r\n\r\nAs you seem very motivated, I encourage you to participate to discussion with the GSN team and the community (on https://ethereum-magicians.org/) to have a standard move forward.
