    "body": "I imagine this parameter is proposed as a way to catch, before it is proposed, a proposal that will be too big to execute. However, a proposal might be too big even with just one operation, if that operation is very expensive, so this check would be ineffective in that case. The number of operations is not really relevant and imposing an arbitrary limit may force a proposal to be unnecessarily split in two, imposing greater voting overhead.\r\n\r\nThe Governor needs to be resilient to a proposal that can't be executed. It should not and does not prevent the rest of the governance protocol from continuing to operate.\r\n\r\nA DAO should simulate proposals before creation in order to ensure that they are executable and produce the desired effects. A proposal that has too many operations should be caught at that stage.\r\n\r\nIf there is another reason to include this parameter please let us know.",
