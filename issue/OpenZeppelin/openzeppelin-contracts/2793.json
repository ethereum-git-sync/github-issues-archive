  "body": "**What**\r\nI would like to assist in creating or helping to create an OpenZeppelin implementation of an EIP-2535 diamond. \r\n\r\nThe [EIP-2535 Diamond standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535) will likely move to Last Call status soon and then become Final after the two week period if there are no major changes.\r\n\r\n**Introduction**\r\nEIP-2535 Diamonds is a standard for building modular smart contract systems that can be extended in production.\r\nAn introduction to it is here: https://eip2535diamonds.substack.com/p/introduction-to-the-diamond-standard\r\n\r\nThe standard was released in February 2020 but experience with it and feedback on it has accumulated since 2018 when [EIP-1538](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1538) was released. EIP-2535 is an improvement upon EIP-1538.\r\n\r\nThe current status of EIP-2535 is Review and soon its status will probably move to Last Call. \r\n\r\n[More than 20 projects](https://eip2535diamonds.substack.com/p/list-of-projects-using-eip-2535-diamonds) are using EIP-2535 and more are coming. \r\n\r\nSeveral [smart contract security audits](https://eip2535diamonds.substack.com/p/smart-contract-security-audits-for) have been done on the reference implementations.\r\n\r\n**🧐 Motivation**\r\nAn OpenZeppelin implementation of a diamond would be useful to people who want to use OpenZeppelin software with the diamond architecture. \r\n\r\n**Questions**\r\nAre there any questions or concerns I should address?\r\n\r\nIs a diamond implementation and my help of interest or wanted by the OpenZeppelin project and community? If so how should I/we proceed?\r\n\r\n",
