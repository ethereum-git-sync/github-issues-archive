  "body": "<!-- Briefly describe the issue you're experiencing. Tell us what you were trying to do and what happened instead. -->\r\nThis is a super small change : the [official Ethereum EIP721 documentation](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) maintains a slightly different order in function definitions from the [OpenZeppelin IERC721 definition](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/IERC721.sol). As a developer trying to validate the OpenZeppelin contract matched the official EIP guidelines side-by-side, it would be a better dev experience if the order of the function definitions were perfectly matched. \r\n\r\n<!-- Remember, this is not a place to ask for help debugging code. For that, we welcome you in the OpenZeppelin Community Forum: https://forum.openzeppelin.com/. -->\r\n\r\n**üíª Environment**\r\n\r\n<!-- Tell us what version of OpenZeppelin Contracts you're using, and how you're using it: Truffle, Remix, etc. -->\r\nVersion : latest. N/A for the rest of the setup\r\n\r\n**üìù Details**\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the problem you have been experiencing in more detail. Include as much information as you think is relevant. Keep in mind that transactions can fail for many reasons; context is key here. -->\r\nThe official EIP721 documentation defines the functions of the ERC721 Interface in a different order from the OpenZeppelin interface definition. This is a request for a small change to allow developers to scan the OpenZeppelin contract side-by-side with the official EIP721 a bit smoother. \r\n\r\nEIP721 order : Transfer > Approval > ApprovalForAll > balanceOf > ownerOf > safeTransferFrom(with Data) > safeTransferFrom > transferFrom > approve > setApprovalForAll > getApproved > isApprovedForAll \r\n\r\nOpenZeppelin IERC721 order : Transfer > Approval > ApprovalForAll > balanceOf > ownerOf > safeTransferFrom > transferFrom > approve > getApproved > setApprovalForAll > isApprovedForAll > safeTransferFrom(with Data) \r\n\r\n\r\n**üî¢ Code to reproduce bug**\r\n\r\n<!-- We will be able to better help if you provide a minimal example that triggers the bug. -->\r\nN/A - compare [EIP721 documentation](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) side by side with [OpenZeppelin IERC721 definition](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/IERC721.sol) ",
