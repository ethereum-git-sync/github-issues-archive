  "body": "**üßê Motivation**\r\n\r\nThis request is motivated by a need for new developers to get started with new work on Ethereum faster. There are so many videos and tutorials on how to launch an ERC20 contract in 15 minutes or less, but most of the time it takes a lot longer for new developers to launch the contract. That said, certainly experienced developers can launch new contracts in a couple minutes.\r\n\r\nBut the problem is that experienced developers are able to connect to the blockchain and launch code that executes. For new developers, there is a lot of learning, hacking, and debugging involved in connecting to the Ethereum network through Remix. I've read through the new developer documentation, but the problem is I can't install [hardhat](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/learn/developing-smart-contracts) on my machine because I don't have enough space. For example, using [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) can be very difficult because it isn't intuitive to understand: 1) how to create new files in remix; 2) how to launch code to the Ethereum network; or 3) what files are required for deployment. I was able to get a [contract](https://github.com/Bhaney44/converter/blob/main/Choice20/GR/Choice20.sol) deployed via Remix, but it isn't clear how to adjust the parameters to get the desired result and once I launched it, I left the IDE and now the environment is permanently corrupted.\r\n\r\nThat said, Remix is a state of the art IDE and a great technology, the purpose of this request to provide a simpler and easier method for beginners to launch an ERC20 contract. I've been reading through the [docs](https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#), but not finding some critical information I need to effectively start building, such as what the necessary minimum files are for deployment. I've also read through the [Open Zeppelin Contract](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol), which is extremely well documented and informative. But, I still don't have the necessary information to effectively use the code with Remix. \r\n\r\nIt's really easy to make new tools and technologies for experienced developers, but the challenge here is to create something easy to use for complete beginners.\r\n\r\n**üìù Details**\r\n\r\nMy request is for an easy to use and follow tutorial on how to launch the [Open Zepplin ERC20 Contract](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol) to both the Ropsten Test Network and the Ethereum Main Network using Remix. The tutorial should provide a step-by-step guide on how to open Remix, create the necessary minimum file structure, launch the code, and verify the asset creation on the blockchain. As I continue working on this problem, I am happy to contribute to the tutorial and sincerely appreciate any thoughts, ideas, feedback or suggestions. Thank you!\r\n\r\n",
