Tell us what you were trying to do and what happened instead. **Remember, this is _not_ a place to ask for help debugging code; for that, we welcome you in the [OpenZeppelin Slack Channel](https://slack.openzeppelin.org/).** -->\n\nOpening this in order to nucleate issues and PRs that will be addressed in the coming refactoring of crowdsales #744. The new version will add functionality while implementing some of the proposed changes. \n\n- [ ] üêõ This is a bug report.\n- [x] üìà This is a feature request.\n\n<!-- Please check one of the above by placing an x in the box. -->\n\n<!--\n## üíª Environment\n\nNext, we need to know what your environment looks like.\n\n- Which version of OpenZeppelin are you using?\n- What network are you deploying to? testrpc? Ganache? Ropsten?\n- How are you deploying your OpenZeppelin-backed contracts? truffle? Remix? Let us know!\n\n## üìù Details\n\nDescribe the problem you have been experiencing in more detail. Include as much information as you think is relevant. Keep in mind that transactions can fail for many reasons; context is key here.\n\n## üî¢ Code To Reproduce Issue [ Good To Have ]\n\nPlease remember that with sample code it's easier to reproduce the bug and it's much faster to fix it.\n\n```\ninsert short code snippets here\n```\n\n<!-- If your code is larger, consider linking us to a repo illustrating your issue. -->\n<!--\n## üëç Other Information\n\n<!-- List any other information that is relevant to your issue.
