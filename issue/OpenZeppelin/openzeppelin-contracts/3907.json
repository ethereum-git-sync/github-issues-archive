  "body": "**🧐 Motivation**\r\nit's hard to overall quantify the loyalty of an NFT holder in terms of time held and number of NFTs. that's where ERC721Loyalty makes it easy to integrate an easy to use Loyalty accounting system which can help in identifying the most loyal holders and unlocking new possibilities.\r\n**📝 Details**\r\nERC721Loyalty implementation which is an abstract contract that overrides _beforeTokenTransfer and adjust the loyalty struct  for the 'from' and 'to' addresses according to the transaction taking place: mint, burn or transfer. at anytime a user can call loyaltyOf(address) and get the seconds the tokens has been held by any user which can be used for governance voting and many other use cases which can unlock more use cases and unlock more scarcity to NFTs overall. \r\n\r\nI have already made a foundry project of the implementation, let me know if i should make a PR into ERC721/extensions\r\nhttps://github.com/codeislight1/ERC721-Holding-Accrual\r\n\r\n--Code--\r\n",
