  "body": "**üßê Motivation**\r\n\r\nThere will be a bounty for this feature on Gitcoin.\r\n\r\nThe motivation for this feature is to give NFT owners the ability to sell or trade their tokens without owning ether.\r\n\r\n**üìù Details**\r\n\r\nRight now, NFT owners can sell their tokens without gas by using a decentralized exchange (e.g., an exchange built on 0x Protocol). However, these exchanges require that the token owner sets approval in the ERC721 contract for their exchange contract. A user without ether can't set the approval.\r\n\r\nIf the ERC721 contract supported meta transactions for the setApprovalForAll() function, a user would be able to both receive a token and then sell it without owning ether because the exchange could securely set approval on the user's behalf. This feature could enable an improved on-boarding and user experience for people without ether who are interested in NFTs.\r\n",

For example, an exchange might pay the gas for the the approval transaction because they would make money on the subsequent sale of the token.\r\n\r\n@pvienhage Thanks for expressing interest in this issue. Two questions:\r\n\r\n1. Do you have any public smart contract code or smart contract auditing experience that I can verify and review? I'd like to check references for this bounty.\r\n\r\n2. Are you able to confirm that meta transactions for approvals and transfers in an ERC721 contract will achieve what I am looking for? That is, will these new functions give a new account with 1 token and 0 eth the ability to sell that token on a 0x decentralized exchange? I understand if you can't confirm, but I'm curious to know if my understanding is correct.",

    "body": "Hi Cyrus,\r\n(1) I've got a fairly large library of public things I have built here's a gist of some hyper optimized assembly I just wrote for spec256r onchain signature verification https://gist.github.com/pvienhage/19211ec45dde57168d6c13ff119f75c8 it isn't very readable solidity though haha. Here's a signature based CTF I wrote https://etherscan.io/address/0x7cd03C9f1D2dc95358B1992e9afc857aeaab45D5. I also have several public audits mostly under the Authio brand. Here's one of a decentralized exchange which implemented meta transactions for their internal ERC20 token https://authio.org/audits/coinvest-v3\r\n(2) So it is fairly straight forward to add methods which take signed data to preform the functions of an ERC720 contract on behalf of someone else. I'm 100% confident that I can write code which can do approvals and transfers for an account holding 1 nft and 0 eth, assuming someone with eth sends the transaction. I'm not sure how it will integrate with the current codebase of the 0x exchange, because I haven't really reviewed it.\r\n",

    "body": "@CyrusL  Hi, I have started drafting the code. Here is the specification of what I think would be the best solution to the problem: Edit the ERC721.sol contract in the tokens/ERC721 directory to contain the methods delegated_approve, delegated_approveForAll and delegated_safeTransferFrom which will take the same inputs as the non delegated versions plus a signer address and a signature. The signer will need to sign a nonce for their address hashed with the address of the token and the input data. Then the methods will behave as if the signer called them. I had initially proposed an extension of ERC721 but the mappings in the ERC721 are private so cannot be accessed directly by contracts which inherit from it and there are no internal approve methods.  \r\nIf this sounds good to you I can deliver the code, otherwise let me know and I can change what I will build. Thanks!\r\n ",

I hadn't seen the random salt method before but it could help with throughput and mean you don't need to do lookups for nonces from your offchain application. It's up to you as to which you'd prefer as I think either could work well :)",
