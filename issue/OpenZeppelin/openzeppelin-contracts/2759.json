    "body": "Correct, you and I have not discussed this previously, nor agreed that old versions of OZC should not be used. I went out on a limb and my assertion fails.\n\nIf there are arguments that old versions of OZC should not be used I should lay them out here. \n\nThe best supporting argument is: OZC depends on Solidity and Solidity specifically recommends that you should use the latest released version and other versions are not supported. (First page of Solidity docs.) This means if a bug is found (maybe a small one) for an old version then it is not guaranteed this will be published. (It might be but that is unspecified behavior.)\n\nSince OZC tells you not to modify OZC *at all* when using it, that means you should not modify the compiler requirements.\n\nLogically following, any OZC that does not compile under the latest Solidity is not supported upstream. And I argue that OZC should exclude these from any list of supported versions.\n\n---\n\nIf the policy is \"all versions are supported\" this is weird too. 2.1.3 is a hotfix and 2.1.2 is known bad. So how can we say 2.1.2 is supported? This should be marked bad. Binaries deleted and marked as deprecated in GitHub releases.\n\n---\n\nPLEASE NOTE everything above is side discussion. I have laid out arguments on some versions that should not be recognized as supported. Reasonable people might think that all, some, or only the latest version are supported, eligible for bug bounty, and known safe.\n\nSince multiple interpretations are possible, here I only wish that we can have an explicit, published policy. And this can possible be in the README, the bug bounty (if/when implemented) and the GitHub security page (if/when implemented).\n\nI hope we can agree a supported policy version is desirable. And as always I am very happy to discuss with you further, propose PRs and support any decisions here. \n",

    "body": "> Solidity specifically recommends that you should use the latest released version and other versions are not supported. (First page of Solidity docs.)\r\n\r\nWhat I can find in their docs is the following:\r\n> When deploying contracts, you should use the latest released version of Solidity. This is because breaking changes as well as new features and bug fixes are introduced regularly.\r\n\r\nI definitely do not read this as \"other versions are not supported\". In fact, in the past there have been bugfixes for versions that were not the latest: 0.4.26, 0.5.16, and 0.5.17 were all released after the next minor was already out.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI've updated our documents to clarify the policy. Hopefully it's clearer now. https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/commit/bbd68b721de37cdef11d9c06950d307d93f5bac8",
