Sure you have to be careful when dealing with time (or PRNG) and evaluate the risks of miners tricking it ... but many apps just have to deal with timings to work, and we think it's our role to address their needs by providing the best contracts possible (while also notifying them of the potential issues).",

    "body": "No, you can't arbitrarily lower the block timestamp. In the Ethereum yellowpaper, it states that a block timestamp must be greater than the parent block timestamp. That is the only constraint that is specified.\r\n\r\nThere is discussion in the two StackExchange links I shared that describe how (1) from a game theoretic standpoint, block timestamps will not usually have large error, however (2) there is nothing stopping a particularly determined attacker, especially one with a great deal of network influence, from arbitrarily increasing the block timestamp and having it accepted. The larger the potential payoff for doing so, the more likely this scenario becomes.\r\n\r\nYou could use block interval to determine if the timestamp has been forged far in the future, but of course block interval is not guaranteed to be within any specific time range either, so this can only be used for long timescales, and even then with very small but nonzero chance of forgery. (and even then you would have to look closely at the accuracy distribution of parent block timestamps given the behavior of clients in accepting or rejecting blocks).",
