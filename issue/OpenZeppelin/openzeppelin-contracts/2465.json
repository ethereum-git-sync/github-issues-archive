  "body": "There has been some discussion in https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2442 on whether to keep or remove `SafeMath` from the Solidity 0.8 release of the library. We don't seem to have consensus yet so I would like to continue the discussion and explore the arguments that are being made.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the discussion is that Solidity 0.8 includes checked arithmetic operations by default, and this renders `SafeMath` unnecessary. What is not under discussion is that internally the library will use the built in checked arithmetic, rather than the current manual overflow checks in `SafeMath`. The question is whether we want to keep `SafeMath` for other reasons.\r\n\r\n#### Backwards compatibility\r\n\r\nIt may be better to keep `SafeMath` to ease the transition from Contracts 3.x (Solidity 0.6-0.7) to Contracts 4.x (Solidity 0.8). If we remove it, users who update will be flooded with error messages that they will have to fix before they do anything else. They may want to try other interesting things in Solidity 0.8, and/or remove `SafeMath` progressively (for example making sure their tests continue to pass during the migration).\r\n\r\n@axic's counterargument:\r\n>Perhaps it is better biting the bullet by removing it, and that could trigger users to review the new semantics and use them properly (checked vs. unchecked). And also be aware of the gas implications.\r\n\r\nIt's true that using `SafeMath` function calls will be more expensive than just built in arithmetic. The idea would be that users should remove `SafeMath` once they're using Solidity 0.8. But should we force people to do this migration as soon as they jump on Solidity 0.8? If there was a way to _nudge_ them, such as a deprecation warning, I would agree that we should do it, but removing `SafeMath` entirely is a lot stronger and causes what seems like unnecessary breakage.\r\n\r\n#### Use inside `unchecked` blocks\r\n\r\n@Amxx [mentions](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2442#issuecomment-754551003) that `SafeMath` would be a way to insert checked operations inside `unchecked` blocks. This is an interesting idea. If we think this is a genuine use case it would not make sense to deprecate `SafeMath`.\r\n\r\nSeveral people seem to have reacted against this proposal and it would be great to hear more from them. (@mlntr @cruzdanilo @hrkrshnn @stvndf)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nPersonally I think we should keep the wrapper for backwards compatibility only, deprecated and planned to be removed in the next major release. This is motivated by an intention to keep breaking changes to a minimum. Even if we do not remove it, we can communicate this deprecation clearly and recommend users to refactor their code to remove `SafeMath` once they migrate to 0.8.",

    "body": "For the `SafeMath` inside `unchecked` block, here is the reason.\r\n\r\n\"Checked\" math, which is default in 0.8.0 is not free. The compiler will add some overflow checks, somehow similar to those implemented by `SafeMath`. While it is reasonable to expect these checks to be less expensive then the current `SafeMath`, one should keep in mind that this checks will increase the cost of \"basic math operation\" that were not previously covered. This is the case of variable increments in for loops.\r\n\r\nLets consider this piece of code\r\n```\r\nfunction sum(uint[] memory array) internal pure returns (uint result) {\r\n    result = 0;\r\n    for (uint i = 0; i < array.length; ++i) { result += array[i]; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor each element in the array, there are two math operations, one is `result += array[i]`, the other one is `++i`. Some people have raised the concern that the second operation does not need the check. An option is to do \r\n```\r\nfunction sum(uint[] memory array) internal pure returns (uint result) {\r\n    result = 0;\r\n    unchecked { for (uint i = 0; i < array.length; ++i) { result += array[i]; } }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nbut then you lose the overflow protection on array, so its not good. This is why you may want to do\r\n```\r\nfunction add(uint x, uint y) internal pure returns(uint) { return a + b; }\r\n\r\nfunction sum(uint[] memory array) internal pure returns (uint result) {\r\n    result = 0;\r\n    unchecked { for (uint i = 0; i < array.length; ++i) { result = add(result, array[i]); } }\r\n} \r\n```\r\n\r\nIn that particular example, the extra cost of the function might make the whole `uncheck` thing pointless, but if the core of the loop was to contain a significant number of math operation, only a few of which needs protection, then the `SafeMath` would be usefull. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThus my 0.8.0 `SafeMath` library would look like\r\n\r\n```\r\nlibrary SafeMath {\r\n   ...\r\n    function sub(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {\r\n        return a - b;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    function sub(uint256 a, uint256 b, string memory errorMessage) internal pure returns (uint256) {\r\n        unchecked {\r\n            require(b <= a, errorMessage);\r\n            return a - b;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    ....\r\n}\r\n```",

    "body": "> Perhaps it is better biting the bullet by removing it, and that could trigger users to review the new semantics and use them properly (checked vs. unchecked). And also be aware of the gas implications.\r\n\r\nI'm totally with this sentiment. But the only concerns I had while reviewing the new semantics about the inbuilt checks in 0.8 were that I could no longer specify revert reasons. If I imagine `SafeMath` is removed, then whenever I need revert reasons, I would need to maintain a library file with this logic in the project (and probably need to copy-paste the logic around next projects). And that's why I think it would be beneficial if this logic is available in OpenZeppelin, so I could just import it from there instead of extra copy-paste code in multiple projects. Also doing a good looking unchecked `i++` as in https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/issues/2465#issuecomment-756955545. \r\n\r\n`SafeMath` has been an essential piece of code in Solidity, it makes the math safe. But since 0.8, a `SafeMath.sol` file name seems ironic since it doesn't technically make math safe since it is already safe now inbuilt. If I would maintain a file for the above use cases, `Math.sol` sounds fine and compact.\r\n\r\n> Personally I think we should keep the wrapper for backwards compatibility only, deprecated and planned to be removed in the next major release. This is motivated by an intention to keep breaking changes to a minimum.\r\n\r\nI understand how frustrating it would be to see 100s or 1000s of errors in a project, I don't think there is a point partially upgrading to Solidity 0.8. But I think dedicating some time for the effort to completely upgrade to 0.8 should be worth it. And one can always stay on older version of Solidity until they block some time to work on upgrade to 0.8 in their project. If `SafeMath.sol` file exists in OpenZeppelin (for backwards compatibility) then people would procastinate changing SafeMath stuff for later. I'd like to suggest to remove this file and have another file with name like `Math.sol` or `BasicMath.sol` that contains just enough functions (like in last of https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/issues/2465#issuecomment-756955545) that helps developer to \"write better 0.8 code\" (and not keep old code as it is).",

    "body": "I fully agree with @Amxx points and comments. Migrating to 0.8 doesn't mean just removing usage of  `SafeMath` and replacing it with the native operators, but also adding new revert reasons. So something like\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nbalance = balance.sub(amount, \"Insufficient balance\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nwould turn into\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nrequire(amount >= balance, \"Insufficient balance\");\r\nbalance -= amount;\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut since checked arithmetic is no longer needed,\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nrequire(amount >= balance, \"Insufficient balance\");\r\nunchecked {\r\n  balance -= amount;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think the net effect is good: it allows for overall lower gas costs and highlights the actual error conditions. However, forcing this sort of migration on a user is too much of a burden. \r\n\r\nKeep in mind most codebases are not even on 0.7: if checked arithmetic is what convinced them to pull the trigger, then the migration is already non-trivial no begin with. And if people only upgrade once 0.9 comes with some other long-awaited feature (like the mythical Yul IR), this will only make moving forward harder.",

    "body": "Taking more of the developer point of view, we should also considered there are years worth of documentation that scare developers away from doing math themselves without using SafeMath. The absence of SafeMath will be disorienting to those developers and might require a bit of an educational push to properly inform users as to why it's now safe to not use safe math. \r\n\r\nPerhaps it could be moved to a deprecated folder which will be self-explanatory to users. \r\n\r\nAs a side note, I love the explicitness of safeMath. X.sub(y) is just a more pleasurable experience. Maybe we can keep it as syntactic sugar and build a transpiler...... (joking!) ",
