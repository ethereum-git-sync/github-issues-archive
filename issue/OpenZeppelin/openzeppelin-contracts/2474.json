  "body": "**üßê Motivation**\r\nWould like to implement an upgradable contract that is ownable instead of copying the ownable logic into an initializer manually.\r\n\r\n**üìù Details**\r\n\r\nIdeally there would be some kind of `UpgradableOwnable` or `InitializedOwnable` which is identical to `Ownable` but having its constructor replaced with an `initialize` method. Thus, upgradable contracts which are meant to be ownable could inherit `UpgradableOwnable` which no-longer has a constructor. \r\n\r\nI would have implemented this myself and made a PR, but it is unclear at this time where such a contract should live within the project or if such a contract should be implemented by replicating the contract code of Ownable while replacing the constructor with initializer logic.\r\n",
