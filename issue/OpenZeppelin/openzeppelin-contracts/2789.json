  "body": "**üßê Motivation**\r\n\r\nRecently, [EIP-2981](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2981) went to Final Status. It proposes a \"standardized way to retrieve royalty payment information for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to enable universal support for royalty payments across all NFT marketplaces and ecosystem participants\".\r\n\r\nWhile it is possible to implement your own royalty system overriding ERC721/ERC1155's `transferFrom` functions, I was wondering if it would make sense to support EIP-2981 as an alternative to minimize gas usage in deployment.  Plus, EIP-2981 would better support [optional royalty payments](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2981#optional-royalty-payments).\r\n\r\n**üìù Details**\r\n\r\nIf it makes sense to add EIP-2981 support to OpenZeppelin contracts, I think it could be a nice idea to make an interface ERC721HasRoyalties.sol and IERC1155HasRoyalties.sol to extend ERC721 and ERC1155 contracts.\r\n\r\n(P.S.: Since it has been recently finalized, I don't think many marketplaces are adopting EIP-2981 for now, but if this feature makes sense, I can keep track of it üòÉ)\r\n",

[Nifty Gateway](https://niftygateway.com/) being one of these parties. \r\n\r\n\r\nImplementing EIP-2981 is relatively low effort. You'd want to decide if:\r\n- You want contract level (global per ERC-721/1155 smart contract) royalty information or\r\n- Token level royalty information (each token has it's own individual royalty info)\r\nThese are the two generic approaches. \r\n\r\nPlease see this reference implementation: \r\nhttps://github.com/dievardump/EIP2981-implementation\r\n\r\nAlso here's a video that describes the rational: \r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTbcw0rhLto (thought I'm sure everyone here already knows why we need this standard)\r\n\r\nHappy to answer any questions wrt to implementation.

I see how that would help in economizing gas costs ‚õΩ\r\n\r\nI'd expect that most NFT owners wouldn't change this info after deployment. I did a non-exhaustive search on this [contract database](https://github.com/tintinweb/smart-contract-sanctuary) and it seems that many contracts expose an external `setRoyaltyInfo` function for changing the royalty. On the other hand, most of these contracts that are deployed on mainnet seem to call this function just at the start (examples: [1](https://etherscan.io/txs?a=0xf126EB8284110A37C18E726A7E3B9fc21e68e897&ps=100&p=2), [2](https://etherscan.io/txs?a=0x52CDBa4e119e101706DDF774Fe5696627Df0Bc31&ps=100&p=2)).\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "@robinportigliatti What do you mean by making `ERC721Royalty` enumerable ?\r\n\r\n`ERC721Royalty` is an `ERC721` extension, just like `ERC721Enumerable`, `ERC721Pausable` or `ERC721Votes`. Extensions can be combined, so you can easily inherit all 4 of these extensions if you want an ERC721 contract that is pausable, enumerable, that has the royalty mechanism and that can be used for voting. \r\n\r\nWhile users can opt-in, we don't want to force that. If someone wants `ERC721Royalty` but doesn't want to bear the high cost of enumerability, we shouldn't force that onto them.\r\n\r\nIf you want to know more about building a token contract with multiple modules, check out the [wizard](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/#erc721). Hopefully, it will soon include a toggle for royalties !",
