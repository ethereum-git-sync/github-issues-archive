  "body": "Contracts like ECRecover are very useful but don't need to be re-uploaded and re-verified by everyone.  Instead it would be nice if OpenZeppelin uploaded these contracts to the chain, verified them with all major block explorers, registered them in the various method registries, and made the addresses of these contracts generally available.\r\n\r\nTo facilitate integration, it would be nice if these contracts also had a \"header file\" available that was small and well documented (but without source code) that could be included in projects that will be using the contract.  These header files would, presumably, also come with the on-chain address of the contract baked in somehow (perhaps by network ID?)\r\n\r\nI don't know if it is possible, but would be nice if there was also a per-network lookup mechanism so I could do something like `ECRecover.lookup(network-id)`.  I believe there has been talk about getting something like network-id added to the EVM but I don't know what happened to that, so this may not be possible.",
