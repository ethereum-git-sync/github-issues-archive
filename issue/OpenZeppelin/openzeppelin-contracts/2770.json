    "body": "OpenZeppelin Contracts does not have dependencies and is a pure Solidity package, so it works with any Node.js version. For this reason I don't see the need to add this additional configuration on GitHub Actions, which will just add CI time and slow the contribution process unnecessarily.\r\n\r\nFor development, the repository builds fine on Node.js 12, 14, and 16, all the currently supported versions, because we keep our dependencies up to date. So I'm not sure what you mean by \"only builds with Node.js version 12\". Can you clarify?",

I think the best way to get that is to put it in the matrix.

Somebody should go fix each of these warnings. And by putting 14 in the matrix now (as a can-fail) you highlight some issues that other people can fix now (whether here or upstream). By the time OZC switches to a new Node version perhaps it will build without warnings from the get-go.",
