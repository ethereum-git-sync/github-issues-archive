  "body": "I would like to start a short discussion about a possible new contract at the lifecycle namespace, next to the pausable one.\r\n\r\nThe Pausable contract allows developers to pause a contract's functions, and later, if desired, unpause it. This means that in case of emergency, or if a bug is detected, someone can call the pause method on the contract and quickly disable all functions with the appropriate modifier.\r\n\r\nI would like to propose we add a **Revokable** contract, with its corresponding RevokerRole (exactly same design as the Pausable feature) that allows developers to permanently disable a contract if needed. This means, should a problem arise, they can simple revoke the contract and rest asured that in not way will that contract ever be unpaused.\r\n\r\nIn its workings, it consists of a Pausable contract without the *unpause* method.\r\n\r\nI have already written the code for the feature described, and later realized I had not opened an issue, so I created the PR so we can view the changes while discussing the feature. You can find the PR [here](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2037)\r\n\r\nA variation of this feature would be to consider the Pauser and Revoker roles as one, this is, a LifecicleController role, or rather some better name. This would mean that a signle contract can implement both Pausable and Revokable, for temporary and definitve disabling of the contract, but instead of having to manage two roles, one for each feaure, they could simply have a single role that is in charge of pausing, unpausing or revoking the contract.\r\nThis last part is rather controversial, but I think it's worth a short discussion about whether the role is supposed to enable pausing or managing the whole lifecycle.",

We may want to move this to the community forum (https://forum.openzeppelin.com/), as it is easier for the entire community to see and hence participate.\r\n\r\nAre you using Revokable contracts yourself or have you some examples of them being used?  Are there specific circumstances where a contract is permanently paused?\r\n\r\nUsing Pausable it is possible to set a contract as permanently paused with no ability to unpause.\r\nFirst an account with the `PauserRole` calls `pause` on the Pausable contract and then every account with the `PauserRole` calls `renouncePauser` until there are no accounts with the `PauserRole`.\r\n\r\nDo you think there is a need for revokable functionality beyond what can be done already with `Pausable`?",
