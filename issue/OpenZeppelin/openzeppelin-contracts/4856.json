  "body": "**üßê Motivation**\r\n`_burn` method used to be virtual but it was changed in https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4377. Some contracts deriving from ERC721 may need to perform additional logic before burning the token (e.g. emitting event in ERC-6239). Adding additional method may be confusing since some implementers may use plain `_burn` without extra logic. Is there any reason why `virtual` was removed or can it be restored in future releases?\r\n\r\n**üìù Details**\r\n- release: 5.0.1\r\n- can send a PR if needed\r\n\r\n<!-- Make sure that you have reviewed the OpenZeppelin Contracts Contributor Guidelines. -->\r\n<!-- https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md -->\r\n",

    "body": "Hello @outSH \r\n\r\nSince 5.0, `_burn` is an wrapper around the virtual `_update(address to, uint256 tokenId, address auth)`.\r\nIf you want to perform additional operation on burn operation, this is the one function you should override, as showcased here:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n    function _update(address to, uint256 tokenId, address auth) internal virtual override returns (address) {\r\n        if (to == address(0)) {\r\n            // do you stuff here\r\n        }\r\n        return super._update(to, tokenId, auth);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n",
