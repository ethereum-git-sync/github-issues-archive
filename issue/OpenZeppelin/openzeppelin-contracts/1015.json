    "body": "@shrugs Makes sense. Looks like I missed this part in the standard. \r\n```Solidity issue #3412: The above interfaces include explicit mutability guarantees for each function. Mutability guarantees are, in order weak to strong: payable, implicit nonpayable, view, and pure. Your implementation MUST meet the mutability guarantee in this interface and you MAY meet a stronger guarantee. For example, a payable function in this interface may be implemented as nonpayble (no state mutability specified) in your contract. We expect a later Solidity release will allow your stricter contract to inherit from this interface, but a workaround for version 0.4.20 is that you can edit this interface to add stricter mutability before inheriting from your contract.```\r\nI'm going to close this.",

    "body": "@robertmagier I've just checked the standard in its final form, and it still contains the section described above (see [here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-721.md#caveats). It references the [Solidity compiler issue #3412](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3412), where removing the error you encountered is described. From that discussion, however, it looks like it'll be a long time before the feature is implemented (_if_ they decide to implement it): I wouldn't expect it to come out before 0.6.0.\r\n\r\nSo, I'm not sure what's the right call. As it is, it looks like the only way to get those functions to be `payable` is to manually edit the original interface, which is of course not what we want. Could you please share some more detail as to why you need that function to be `payable`, so we can see if we can find a temporary workaround? Thanks!",

    "body": "@nventuro I think I am more than confused. Standard your linked is still describing function as payable. \r\n\r\n`   function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external payable;`\r\n\r\nHowever I think you are talking about mutability guarantees which says that you can implement payable function as non payable. This is what you did in your implementation - implemented those functions as non payable. This works for you, but @ImmuneGit  and I want to use your library but overwrite transferFrom function as payable.\r\n\r\nI also checked on Remix and it seems that there is really no good solution to it as you can't overwrite payable function as nonpayable and also it is not possible to overwrite nonpayable function as payable. \r\n\r\nBoth implemenations below will fail: \r\n\r\n```\r\npragma solidity ^0.4.24;\r\n\r\ncontract A \r\n{\r\n    function transfer() public   returns (uint) {\r\n        return 7;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract B is A {\r\n    function transfer() public payable   returns (uint)\r\n    {\r\n        return msg.value;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`browser/test.sol:13:5: TypeError: Overriding function changes state mutability from \"nonpayable\" to \"payable\".`\r\n\r\n```\r\npragma solidity ^0.4.24;\r\n\r\ncontract A \r\n{\r\n    function transfer() public payable  returns (uint) {\r\n        return 7;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\ncontract B is A {\r\n    \r\n    function transfer() public  returns (uint)\r\n    {\r\n        return msg.value;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`TypeError: Overriding function changes state mutability from \"payable\" to \"nonpayable\".`\r\n\r\nSo I think if you implement your function as payable then people who want to have as nonpayble will have a problem and same for opposite scenario.  \r\n\r\nThe only thing I can say in favor of implementing those functions as payable is that standard define them that way and that it will work for  me :) \r\n\r\n```\r\n function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, bytes data) external payable;\r\n function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external payable;\r\n function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external payable;\r\n function approve(address _approved, uint256 _tokenId) external payable;\r\n```",

    "body": "I do understand your use cases and would like OpenZeppelin to cater to them, so I'm reopening the issue to keep the discussion going and to consider different options for implementation. But to kickstart the discussion I'll share why our implementation's functions are not payable at the moment.\r\n\r\nFunctions being non-payable by default is a Solidity security feature that prevents people accidentally sending ether to contracts where it is unrecoverable. Developers have to be very careful when they make a function payable, and ensure that the ether that will enter the contract is somehow used or retrievable later.\r\n\r\nA custom ERC721 contract with payable functions can ensure the ether is not lost, e.g. by forwarding it somewhere. While OpenZeppelin can provide a base ERC721 implementation with payable functions, it can't provide a generic mechanism to ensure the ether is put to good use because it would be entirely implementation specific. Naive users of OpenZeppelin ERC721 would not be adding any such mechanism, and all those OpenZeppelin ERC721 tokens would become sinks of unrecoverable ether.\r\n\r\nThere are some things that come to mind that we could do, but the developer experience of using them would not be very good. Feel free to share any ideas!",

Not sure if there can be more than one minter per contract in this model.\r\n\r\n> Wouldn't it be easier to simply limit transfers?\r\n\r\nThe question is how much to limit them. They are considering alternative methods, such as burning part of the _time_ left for accessing a resource (think of a token representing a year-long subscription, transferring it could burn a few days out of it) but it'd be interesting to support ETH-based fees.\r\n\r\n",
