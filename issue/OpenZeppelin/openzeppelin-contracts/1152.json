    "body": "Hi @jmcnevin. The package was renamed to <code><b>open</b>zeppelin-solidity</code> in [1.9.0](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/releases/tag/v1.9.0). The `zeppelin-solidity` package has been deprecated in favor of the new one. Regardless, we are keeping the old package up to date until the 2.0 release of OpenZeppelin.\r\n\r\nThere is a deprecation notice when you visit the package or install it, suggesting to install the newer one. It was put up at the moment of the rename but for some reason was not showing up any more. I've already put it back in place, but I'm going to contact npm to understand why it was not showing up. Thanks for pointing it out.",
