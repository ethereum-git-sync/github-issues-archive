  "body": "<!-- Briefly describe the issue you're experiencing. Tell us what you were trying to do and what happened instead. -->\r\nI'm trying to use the `approve` method to allow addressB to send on my behalf. This is works, but when I switch to addressB and `safeTransferFrom`, I get `ERC721: transfer of token that is not own`\r\n\r\n`safeTransferFrom` checks `_isApprovedOrOwner` first which makes sense. Either owner or approved can transfer. https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/01f2ff1ba1220d7d3a0642014d30543bfcbb41ee/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol#L183\r\n\r\nBut when it calls `_transfer`, the require is more strict. It only allows the owner, hence the bug. https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/01f2ff1ba1220d7d3a0642014d30543bfcbb41ee/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol#L334\r\n\r\nIs this intended?\r\n\r\n<!-- Remember, this is not a place to ask for help debugging code.
