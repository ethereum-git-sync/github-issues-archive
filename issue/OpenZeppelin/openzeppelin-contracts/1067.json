    "body": "This error means simply that the compiler could not find the file you're trying to import and Truffle does not provide an import callback that could look it up on disk (and yeah, the error message could be better; see https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11413). You might have forgotten to install OpenZeppelin with npm or maybe `node_modules/` is in a location where Truffle cannot find it.\r\n\r\nIf you still have this problem I could help you solve it but given that this bug report is ancient now it's more likely that you already moved on and this should be closed instead :)",

The thing, what you shared doesn't reproduce anything unless we know what you did in  `<create new token contract and import open zepellin ERC20 interface>`\r\n\r\nI've personnally build many erc20 using both truffle and hardhat, which no issue. My guess is that either the our package is not installed, or you are not providing the right path to it.\r\n\r\nCould you share a link to a repo that contains your ERC20 contract, so we can actually have a look and try reproducing the issue on our side ?",
