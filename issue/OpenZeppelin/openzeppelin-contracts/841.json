It still feels to me like these are related organizations -- the Zeppelin members are the ones that have commit access here and they profit from auditing the code that is here. It will be inappropriate for the community to contribute to the bug bounty if only Zeppelin has commit access and they could fix their own bugs.\r\n\r\n# ATTACK VECTOR:\r\n\r\n1. Zeppelin maintains OZ as a high-quality code base\r\n2. Zeppelin allows a few specific bugs to enter OZ\r\n3. Zeppelin makes money on paid audits where they advise their clients to fix those bugs\r\n4. Zeppelin makes money from the community by fixing its own bugs\r\n5. The community is hurt because it pays for these bugs which OZ should not have committed in the first place\r\n\r\nI know what Zeppelin audits cost and I know the value of quality assurance on the code that is here. Either way, that is a business decision that Zeppelin needs to make.\r\n\r\n**But personally, I cannot support any blockchain project connected to a commercial entity where that commercial entity does not contribute to a bug bounty. And more specifically, the value of that project as a whole is equal to the size of the bug bounty.**",

    "body": "Hey @fulldecent.\r\n\r\nZeppelin and OpenZeppelin are deeply related. Zeppelin started OpenZeppelin. And Zeppelin contributes to the development of OpenZeppelin allowing some of us to use part of our work week to improve OpenZeppelin. But the point 2 of your attack vector fails because everything we do on this repo is transparent and we do it together with members of the community that are not paid by Zeppelin. We have a strict protocol of code reviews and a long period of testing before releasing a new version to prevent mistakes and malicious actions. If we deviate from that protocol, instead of making money it will hurt both Zeppelin and OpenZeppelin.\r\n\r\nWhat Zeppelin audits for it's customers is not the OpenZeppelin code. This has also been always transparent, and you can see more details here: https://blog.zeppelin.solutions/tagged/security\r\n\r\nThe idea of giving incentives for developers to audit and develop smart contracts is at the core of [ZeppelinOS](https://zeppelinos.org/) (which is also different from OpenZeppelin). The exact details of how that will look are still work in progress, so your proposals will be very useful.\r\nBut as @shrugs said, once that is implemented and ready to go, at Zeppelin we will continue contributing to OpenZeppelin in many ways. We believe this project is fundamental for every blockchain project, including ours.\r\n\r\npura vida",

    "body": "Attack vector point 2 is alive and well.\r\n\r\nOpenZeppelin advertised as having a ERC-721 implementation when it knew full well that its implementation was not compliant. You would know OpenZeppelin was working well if you saw this:\r\n\r\n1. Somebody reports a problem: ERC-721 implementation is incorrect\r\n2. OZ acknowledges that the problem is correct, pays them\r\n3. OZ puts a notice in README.md: DON\"T USE OUR ERC-721 IMPLEMENTATION, IT\"S BROKEN\r\n4. Proceed and fix it when you want\r\n\r\nBut instead, OZ is not financially responsible for bugs so \\#2 and \\#3 don't happen. Now the users of OZ are financially responsible for bugs which OZ knows exists.\r\n\r\nTrust me, I have researched the implementations in the wild on mainnet, many people have deployed applications which rely on the broken OZ code and they will be sad to find out it won't be compatible with MetaMask.\r\n\r\nEven now ERC-721 is still broken (after the ERC-165 fix). But I don't have time to report it.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\"What Zeppelin audits for it's customers is not the OpenZeppelin code.\" This is false. Some of (all?) Zeppelin's audit reports are published at https://blog.zeppelin.solutions/tagged/security\r\n\r\nHere is one example where the Zeppelin project performed a code audit and the target of the audit included OpenZeppelin code:\r\n\r\n* Audit report: https://blog.zeppelin.solutions/erc20-element-token-audit-2128b50e37cd\r\n* Audited code location: https://github.com/element-group/element-erc20-smart-contract/tree/6a7b48cec1aa8a823b7ec4a03adadc5ca9d22e29/contracts\r\n* Audited code commit: 6a7b48cec1aa8a823b7ec4a03adadc5ca9d22e29\r\n* Part of audited code which includes OpenZeppelin code: https://github.com/element-group/element-erc20-smart-contract/blob/6a7b48cec1aa8a823b7ec4a03adadc5ca9d22e29/contracts/ElementToken.sol#L4\r\n\r\nIt may not be obvious that `import \"zeppelin-solidity/...` refers to the OpenZeppelin code. But if you follow along the build script https://github.com/element-group/element-erc20-smart-contract/blob/6a7b48cec1aa8a823b7ec4a03adadc5ca9d22e29/flatten.sh#L10-L11 and then read the NPM module documentation at https://www.npmjs.com/package/zeppelin-solidity then you can see that this actually OpenZeppelin code.\r\n\r\nAnd also, Zeppelin does specifically recommend that customers use OpenZeppelin code. Here is one example: https://blog.zeppelin.solutions/coinfix-token-audit-c4a0e64190bf\r\n\r\n> The contract implements similar functionality to code found in OpenZeppelin’s SafeMath,Ownable (or Claimable) and Pausable. Reimplementing functionality instead of reusing public and already audited code can bring regression problems and difficult to find bugs. Consider removing the duplicate code from your repo and using the installed versions from OpenZeppelin.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is in stark contract to 0xcert. They have an ERC-721 implementation and they have a bug bounty for it. This is the correct way to do open source.",

    "body": "The Zeppelin brand is now dead. You can see the https://zeppelin.solutions website now redirects to https://openzeppelin.com.\r\n\r\nNow the company is broadly reaching out to recruit hires for roles with this team.\r\n\r\nAll of this is great. I'm glad to see the project is successful, and grad to see **we** are growing. This is a community project and I am invested here.\r\n\r\nThis again underscores the responsibility OpenZeppelin has to set a great example for all projects on our platforms. And again, a bug bounty, backed with cash from benefiting companies such as OpenZeppelin the company, should be a part of this.",
