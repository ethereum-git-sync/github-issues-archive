  "body": "From the 5.0 release audit, this recommendation was made and considered for next versions.\r\n\r\n> N-18 Lack of Inclusion of a \"Vesting Cliff\"\r\n>\r\n> A \"vesting cliff\" is a prevalent feature in vesting schedules. It defines a date before which no tokens can be released, despite the linear progression of the vesting schedule prior to that date. Even though projects can extend the contract to include this functionality, given its prevalence in vesting schedules, it would be beneficial to incorporate it into the default contract. This addition would help reduce potential implementation errors and enhance the utility of the default contract.\r\nConsider adding a cliffTimestamp input to the constructor. This timestamp could be used in a cliff() view, whose value should not exceed the end() time. In the _vestingSchedule method, if the timestamp is earlier than the cliff(), the totalAllocation should be set to 0.\r\n>\r\n> Update: Acknowledged, will resolve. The OpenZeppelin Contracts team stated:\r\n>> This variant will be considered for future development. We consider it an easy\r\nimplementation to be built on top of the VestingWallet.\r\n",
