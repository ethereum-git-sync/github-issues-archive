  "body": "## üéâ Description\r\n\r\nWhen using multiple crowdsale contracts to add features, it looks like there are some problems / conflicts.\r\nIt _may_ be due to the order of the inheritance, and the right order _may_ be incompatible with the linearization of the inheritance graph.  \r\n\r\n- [x] üêõ This is a bug report.\r\n\r\n## üíª Environment\r\n\r\n- Which version of OpenZeppelin are you using?\r\n1.9.0 freshly cloned to confirm the problem.\r\n\r\n- What network are you deploying to? Ganache? Ropsten?\r\nGanache\r\n\r\n- How are you deploying your OpenZeppelin-backed contracts? truffle? Remix? Let us know!\r\nTruffle.\r\n\r\n## üìù Details\r\n\r\nWhen building crowdsales, one may want to add some features.\r\nIn this case, I added `TimedCrowdsale, CappedCrowdsale, RefundableCrowdsale, WhitelistedCrowdsale, Claimable`.  \r\n\r\n1. **First problem :** \r\nFinding the right order is tricky and NOT documented. Let say you want to put `TimedCrowdsale` before `WhitelistedCrowdsale` :**_BOOM_** `solidity linearization of inheritance graph impossible`. \r\n\r\n2. **Second problem, the one that motivates this issue :**\r\nWhen testing the code, I had some weird `revert` going on while trying to buy tokens.  \r\nAt some point, I simply copy/pasted a sample contract in a fresh openzeppelin-solidity clone to confirm, and yes : the smart contract is unable to complete the tests from `WhitelistedCrowdsale`.\r\n\r\n```\r\n  1) Contract: TimedWhitelistedCappedRefundableCrowdsale\r\n       single user whitelisting\r\n         accepting payments\r\n           should accept payments to whitelisted (from whichever buyers):\r\n     AssertionError: expected promise to be fulfilled but it was rejected with 'Error: VM Exception while processing transaction: revert'\r\n\r\n\r\n  2) Contract: TimedWhitelistedCappedRefundableCrowdsale\r\n       many user whitelisting\r\n         accepting payments\r\n           should accept payments to whitelisted (from whichever buyers):\r\n     AssertionError: expected promise to be fulfilled but it was rejected with 'Error: VM Exception while processing transaction: revert'\r\n\r\n\r\n  3) Contract: TimedWhitelistedCappedRefundableCrowdsale\r\n       many user whitelisting\r\n         accepting payments\r\n           should reject payments to addresses removed from whitelist:\r\n     AssertionError: expected promise to be fulfilled but it was rejected with 'Error: VM Exception while processing transaction: revert'\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¢ Code To Reproduce Issue [ Good To Have ]\r\n\r\nEverything is in this commit : https://github.com/sebastien-kr/ozs-crowdsale-test/commit/dbab70b1e31b81feaaad36f32e8d7b3de8586413\r\n\r\nHere is what I did : \r\n\r\n 1. Clone `openzepelin-solidity`\r\n 2. Create `contracts/TimedWhitelistedCappedRefundableCrowdsale.sol` with the code below\r\n 3. Create it's `mock` and `test` files. (tests from WhitelistedCrowdsale)\r\n 4. Remove all other test files. Updated the readme.\r\n 5. Launch `npm install && npm test` and watch the test fail.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\npragma solidity ^0.4.21;\r\n\r\nimport \"./crowdsale/validation/CappedCrowdsale.sol\";\r\nimport \"./crowdsale/validation/WhitelistedCrowdsale.sol\";\r\nimport \"./crowdsale/distribution/RefundableCrowdsale.sol\";\r\nimport \"./crowdsale/validation/TimedCrowdsale.sol\";\r\nimport \"./ownership/Claimable.sol\";\r\n\r\nimport \"./examples/SimpleToken.sol\";\r\n\r\n\r\ncontract TimedWhitelistedCappedRefundableCrowdsale is TimedCrowdsale,CappedCrowdsale,RefundableCrowdsale,WhitelistedCrowdsale,Claimable{\r\n    \r\n    function TimedWhitelistedCappedRefundableCrowdsale(\r\n        uint _softCap, \r\n        uint _hardCap, \r\n        uint _startTime, \r\n        uint _endTime,\r\n        uint _rate, \r\n        address _wallet,\r\n        SimpleToken _token\r\n    ) public\r\n    Crowdsale(_rate, _wallet, _token)\r\n    TimedCrowdsale(_startTime, _endTime)\r\n    CappedCrowdsale(_hardCap)\r\n    RefundableCrowdsale(_softCap)\r\n    WhitelistedCrowdsale\r\n    Claimable\r\n    {\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## üëç Other Information\r\n\r\nIdeally I would have loved to check a bit further myself to see if there is something to do with the orther of the inheritance and / or find which ones are starting to fail the test... But at this point I think it needs someone that can take a fresh look and see the obvious out of it.  ",
