This means that anyone with that role will be an admin (be able to add and remove members) for all roles that don't have a set admin.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, assume a role has set an admin. If this admin role (call it `AR`) has not set its own admin role, the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE would be able to make themselves a member of this role, and hence a member of the administered role.\r\n\r\nIt follows that that the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE can become an admin for every single role, so it is not just default.\r\n\r\nThis recursion works on itself as well - even if the admin **of** the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE is changed, any member of the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE may recusively become an admin of the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, and hence add or remove other people.\r\n\r\n### Recommendation\r\nRemove this intricate construct by adding checks that `adminRole != \"\"`. This will ensure no default admin exists, greatly simplifying the contract's logic",

    "body": "Hello @hacker-DOM \r\nWhat you are seeing as a bug is in fact a well-thought-out feature.\r\n\r\nBy default, any role that is doesn't have an admin set is administered by the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`. That is what its all about, the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is plain and simply the default admin role.\r\n\r\nNow, for some reason you want roles A, B and C to manage one another, and not be administered by the default, you can do\r\n\r\n```\r\n_setRoleAdmin(A, A);\r\n_setRoleAdmin(B, A);\r\n_setRoleAdmin(C, B);\r\n```",
