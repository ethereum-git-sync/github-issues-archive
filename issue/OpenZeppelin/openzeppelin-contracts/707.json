  "body": "@martriay has noticed that `Approval` events are not sufficient to reconstruct the allowance status of an address, because allowance is silently modified (reduced) in `transferFrom`. In fact, even all of the ERC20 events together don't suffice either, because of the long-standing problem that `transferFrom` transfers are logged like simple `Transfer` events with no information on who the spender was.\r\n\r\nI want us to evaluate the possibility of emitting an `Approval` event in the `transferFrom` function to signal the reduced allowance, if it is ERC20 compliant. I also wonder if this can solve the problem of `transferFrom` being a \"silent\" operation, by emitting a recognizable sequence of `Transfer` and `Approval` events, but it shouldn't allow the token holder to simulate a `transferFrom`.",

    "body": "Here's an argument against, to make for a balanced discussion.\r\n\r\nThe ERC20 implementations around probably all have the problem that events are not enough to reconstruct allowance. Because of this, all applications will have to work around this by either polling or some other complex mechanism. What value would we be adding, then?\r\n\r\nIf an application is written specifically to interact with an OpenZeppelin ERC20 instance, and thus can safely rely on events only, it may silently become incorrect when plugged into a non-OpenZeppelin instance.
