  "body": "If I create a token that inherits from ERC20Detailed, I would also need to inherit from ERC20 to get the implementation, but since ERC20Detailed is not an interface itself, it should properly inherit from ERC20, not IERC20.\r\n\r\n**üíª Environment**\r\n\r\n2.0.0\r\n\r\n**üìù Details**\r\n\r\nThe standard way I would like to use ERC20Detailed would be to directly inherit from it as in:\r\n```\r\ncontract MyToken is ERC20Detailed {\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this doesn't get me all of the implementation of an ERC20 so I would also have to inherit from ERC20:\r\n```\r\ncontract MyToken is ERC20Detailed, ERC20 {\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis seems odd to have to inherit both, and, depending on how solidity does it, there are two versions of IERC20 inherited, one through ERC20Detailed and one through ERC20 itself. This doesn't seem right. All of the other subclasses of ERC20 (Mintable, Pausable, etc) inherit from ERC20, not IERC20.\r\n\r\nI would think that the code would just have to change from:\r\n```\r\ncontract ERC20Detailed is IERC20 {\r\n```\r\n\r\nto \r\n```\r\ncontract ERC20Detailed is ERC20 {\r\n```",
