This depends on the importance of the NFT.\r\n\r\nThis can be averted by simply checking the msgSender() has at least 1 NFT, \r\n```\r\n  require(_balances[_msgSender] > 0, \"Unknown owner\");\r\n```\r\nIf this is not a serious threat, maybe we can just put a comment here saying an attack is possible but not economical.\r\n\r\nOr perhaps there are other checks and balances I am aware of. I would like to know. Thanks!",

But you are also saying that by doing so, the attacker would \"making gas costs for operations on this NFT very high\". This last part I don't quite understand. \r\n\r\nHow would this attack be detrimental to anyone but the attacker himself?\r\n\r\nAlso, please keep in mind that this is an implementation of [a standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721). So maybe this issue reaches beyond our implementation.",
