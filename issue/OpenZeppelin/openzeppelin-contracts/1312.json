The `it can set reward` test fails because `sendReward` returns immediately, before the block including the transaction is mined. The balance of `this.bounty.address` hasn't been updated yet and the check fails.\r\n\r\n## üî¢ Code To Reproduce Issue\r\n\r\nI ran the test code against the RSK node and it failed consistently.\r\n\r\nI also verified that both of these changes make the test pass:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nit('can set reward', async function () {\r\n  await sendReward(owner, this.bounty.address, reward);\r\n  await advanceBlock();\r\n  const balance = await ethGetBalance(this.bounty.address);\r\n  balance.should.be.bignumber.equal(reward);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n```js\r\nit('can set reward', async function () {\r\n  await transactionMined(await sendReward(owner, this.bounty.address, reward));\r\n  const balance = await ethGetBalance(this.bounty.address);\r\n  balance.should.be.bignumber.equal(reward);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nI could send a PR if you want, let me know.\r\n\r\nThanks!",

    "body": "We've actually discussed that same thing very recently, since there are some minor differences between `ganache` and a real node (IIRC this caused a false positive [here](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1130#issuecomment-412565862) due to the default gas stipend not being the same, though I may be wrong). Improving our test suite so that it can be reused (and even exporting the test helpers as a separate package) is something we intended to work on [for 2.1](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/milestone/4), though that will probably have to wait until 2.2 (about two months from now).\r\n\r\nI'd hate however to have the test suite littered with `transactionMined` or `advanceBlock` in every single test case: isn't there a cleaner way of handling this?",
