  "body": "**üßê Motivation**\r\nThe current release contains [a warning](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/release-v4.7/contracts/utils/cryptography/MerkleProof.sol#L15-L18) that the library cannot distinguish between leaf hashes and branch hashes,  internal hash pairs could be interpreted as a leaf value. This means that in some scenarios, a user could potentially (falsely) create an inclusion proof for an internal hash pair.\r\n\r\n**üìù Details**\r\nI recommend introducing an explicit asymmetry between leaf hashes and internal hashes. One suggestion is to double-hash the leaf contents. For example, the [original `computedHash`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/release-v4.7/contracts/utils/cryptography/MerkleProof.sol#L57) in `processProof` could be replaced with `keccak256(leaf)` (with corresponding changes to the rest of the contract). This would ensure that the pre-image of leaf-hashes would by 32 bytes, while the pre-image of internal hashes would by 64 bytes, and therefore they cannot be confused with each other.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, to avoid excessive gas costs, perhaps a bit-manipulation asymmetry could be introduced instead. For example, the `computedHash` could be set to `leaf ^ ARBITRARY_NON_ZERO_CONSTANT`. This could be interpreted as a leaf-specific hash function, in line with the current recommendation, except developers would not need to implement it explicitly.\r\n\r\n<!-- Make sure that you have reviewed the OpenZeppelin Contracts Contributor Guidelines. -->\r\n<!-- https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md -->\r\n",
