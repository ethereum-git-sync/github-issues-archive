Tell us about it! -->\r\nMany new projects in crypto are distributing tokens or creating their business models on top of a reward distribution contract, as initially done by synthetix. There's currently no 'official' contract that could be used for that, and I think it would be a great addition to the open zeppelin library\r\n\r\n**üìù Details**\r\n<!-- Please describe your feature request in detail. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Make sure that you have reviewed the OpenZeppelin Contributor Guidelines. -->\r\n<!-- https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md -->\r\n",

IMO it's very RAW, it could be a bit better organized.\r\n\r\nI also ran into this [other codebase](https://github.com/taconomics/TacoCoin/tree/master/contracts/pools/core) which looks pretty well organized, although it seems like it was created with a different purpose in mind, but perhaps it could be adapted (Or perhaps it could be modularized to satisfy different needs)",

    "body": "@frangio just to make sure I understood the scope: We are trying to find an official way to distribute rewards among token holders in a transparent way. I am certain we can accomplish this with ERC721 + ERC721Enumerable + PaymentSplitter\r\n\r\nIn my implementation I extend ERC721Enumerable and use most of the functions of PaymentSplitter but remove `payees[]` and make `_totalShares` a function that returns the ERC721Enumerable's `totalSupply`. \r\n\r\nThis allows me to have two methods `release(tokenId)` and `release(account)` to distribute payment using `ownerOf` and `tokenOfOwnerByIndex()` internally. I also handle releasing any `_pendingPayment(tokenId)` on transfer or leaving it for future claim based on`_releaseOnTranser` prop which can be set in the constructor for `ERC721PaymentSplitter`\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if this is not in scope for this issue. I can definitely create a new issue for this. I think this extremely needed in the space for creators who wish to give back to their communities and I see a lot of external systems created to do this.",

    "body": "Hey, @frangio any update on this? I'm looking at building this exact thing for a P2E project that I'm involved with and would definitely appreciate being able to use an OpenZeppelin implementation instead of a custom solution. We're using OZ for our ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155 contracts already.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the implementation should aim for:\r\n* The ability to stake an arbitrary amount of an ERC20 token to a pool (i.e. create a staking position)\r\n* Increase/Decrease/Remove Staking Position\r\n* An ERC20 reward distribution mechanism, where each staker earns a share of the distribution proportional to their share of the overall pool -- ideally, the ERC20 you stake and the ERC20 you earn can be independent for enhanced staking reward flexibility\r\n* Be able to change the reward allocation, pause reward distribution, and other QoL admin functions",

    "body": "The approach described by @c194 would be great.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to consider, though I admittedly haven't thought this through, is to enable staking ETH itself, albeit since that would currently be going from PoW to a staking mechanism, maybe a wrapped-ETH for staking could be used for staking deposits.",
