  "body": "Hey,\r\nI noticed that the call to `finalize()` in FinalizableCrowdsale.sol is guarded by the modifier `onlyOwner`.\r\nUnless this finalizable action is meant to be optional, I can't really see any reason for it not to be open to the public to call to avoid the owner being able to block the token contracts state from progressing if needed.\r\nFor example, in the derived RefundableCrowdsale.sol crowdsale contributors can't process their refunds until the crowdsale has been finalized, which only the owner could do - hence the owner could block refunds (note - they would also block themselves from collecting the wallet ether).\r\nThoughts? Happy to submit a PR if consensus is that this should be changed.\r\nThanks,\r\nAdam",

    "body": "I def. see your point, but a couple of other observations:\r\n1) in the above, any action the owner may want to take after the sale finishes should be a part of the finalize function I think - the function doesn't take arguments so would need to encode all of the logic upfront but this doesn't seem unreasonable to maintain a trustless nature.\r\n2) if finalize needs to remain as callable only by the owner I wonder whether the refundable crowdsale contract should be implemented outside of the finalizable framework so that refunds can remain trustless (so be based purely on whether a crowdsale has completed, and if so whether or not it met its stated goal).",

    "body": "I agree with your first point. A trustless crowdsale should encode all necessary actions (such as further minting) in the crowdsale finalization. In that case, I think anyone should be able to trigger it.\r\n\r\nA derived contract can always add extra requirements to an inherited function. A specific crowdsale would be able to restrict finalizing to an owner by subclassing Crowdsale and adding a check, if so desired.\r\n\r\nI'd like to reiterate two points though.\r\n1. Allowing anyone to trigger finalization enlarges the attack surface of the contract.\r\n2. Full trustlessness is impossible. We aim for trust minimization.\r\n\r\nWhatever path we choose it's important that it be very well communicated. I'll think about it a bit more. What would you guys think about providing the less restrictive option (anyone can finalize) by default?",
