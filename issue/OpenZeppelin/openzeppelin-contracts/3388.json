  "body": "Hi all, I have a very simple feature request.\r\n\r\nThe idea is simple: **Give *ERC721* child contracts access to the `_owners` mapping.**\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nWhen extending the ERC721 contract, devs often create their own version of `_owners` mapping in their contract which essentially does the exact same thing: keep track of which tokenId belongs to which address and that ultimately results in two identical mappings for the same contract. \r\n\r\nI see prominent projects outright manually changing the `_owners` modifier from the source file before deploying their contract like [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0e9d6552b85be180d941f1ca73ae3e318d2d4f1f#code#F2#L31).\r\n\r\n### Details\r\n\r\nChange access modifier of `ERC721#_owners` from `private` to `internal`.",

    "body": "This has been asked multiple times before. Our state variables are private so we can make sure invariants are maintained. For example, the owners mapping shouldn't be modified without also emitting `Transfer` events, and we make sure of this by keeping the variable private and allowing modification only through the internal interface `_mint`, `_transfer`, and so on.\r\n\r\nIf these internal functions are not enough to implement a particular use case we expect to hear about it so we can consider extending the internal interface appropriately.",
