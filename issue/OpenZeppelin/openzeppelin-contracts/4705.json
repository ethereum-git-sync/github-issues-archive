Your only option here is to run another for loop before/after the `super._update(...)` call, but then you are wasting a lot of gas by cycling twice.\r\n\r\nI thought I could avoid this by copying the whole function body into my own contract and updating it (definitely not a clean solution, kinda hacky and risky), but turns out you can't do that because `_balances` is private, so you can't update that from a child contract.\r\n\r\nAt the moment I guess my only option is to copy the entire contract and tune it to my needs, but I think there should be a better way to achieve such a common goal.\r\n\r\nAm I missing anything here?\r\n\r\nThank you for your time.",
