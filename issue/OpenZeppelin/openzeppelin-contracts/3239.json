  "body": "**üßê Motivation**\r\nAside from just being more intuitive, the common use case to cover here is situations in which a proposal approval is needed to mint the first ERC20Votes tokens ever created. In such a scenario, a proposal may be `Proposal #1: Distribute first ERC20Votes tokens` while the quorum will be 0, and there will be 0 For, 0 Against, and 0 Abstain votes. \r\n\r\nThis situation will be covered by considering the proposal as succeeded when `againstVotes == 0`.\r\n\r\nPR for this: #3240\r\n",
