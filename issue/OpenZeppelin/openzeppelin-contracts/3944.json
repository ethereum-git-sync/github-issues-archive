  "body": "- The contract I'm working on currently: https://github.com/attestate/ERC4973/blob/master/src/ERC4973.sol\r\n- For EIP-4973, we've been partially using OZ's EIP implementations and now that we want to create compatibility with EIP-5192, our EIP-4973 implementation has to become compatible with EIP721\r\n- For that reason, I was planning to remove our custom implementation of accounting in EIP-4973\r\n- However, EIP-4973 mandates that a mint transaction is between the issuer and the receiver (as represented by the Transfer event) opposed to EIP-721's non-canonical mint transaction that is always between the zero address and the `address to`.\r\n- So since we've been implementing our own accounting and our own mint function, we were so far able to issue a Transfer event between the issuer and the receiver when calling our mint function: https://github.com/attestate/ERC4973/blob/30d542bc5d81a51834746b961dfc7ed3e75e1ef2/src/ERC4973.sol#L170\r\n- However, I'd now like to make ERC721URIStorage the parent class of my ERC4973 contract which would mean using OZ's mint function. But it hard codes the address zero: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/d59306bd06a241083841c2e4a39db08e1f3722cc/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol#L283\r\n- I cannot overwrite the mint function either as access to balances is set to private: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/d59306bd06a241083841c2e4a39db08e1f3722cc/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol#L33",
