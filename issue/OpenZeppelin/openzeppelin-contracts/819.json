  "body": "## üéâ Description\r\n\r\nI'm working on a PR to add a simple bonding curve contract (aka automatic market maker) based on Bancor formula. Here is the reference contract: https://github.com/relevant-community/contracts/blob/master/contracts/BondingCurve.sol\r\n\r\nI have a few questions about structure and dependencies:\r\n- [x] Folder structure ‚Äîwhere should this contract go? ```/token```? a separate ```/bondingcurve``` folder?  \r\n\r\nPlanning on adding a ```curation-markets``` folder width ```BancorFormula.sol``` and ```BondingCurve.sol```. Adding ```Power.sol``` function to the ```math``` folder.\r\n- [x] The contract depends on the ```BancorFormula.sol``` contract with some fancy tricks to compute fraction exponents and comes along with python folder to generate constants and test them: https://github.com/bancorprotocol/contracts/tree/master/solidity/python Do we want to include this in the zeppelin repo or is it enough to link out to it?\r\n\r\nExtracting the power function into a  separate ```Power.sol``` (licensed under Apache 2.0) file in the ```/math``` folder.\r\n\r\n- [x] Bancor has a .js test for BancorFormula.sol, so I assume we will want to include it: https://github.com/bancorprotocol/contracts/blob/master/solidity/test/BancorFormula.js   \r\n\r\nRenaming this to ```Power.test.js```. The file is very lengthy ‚Äî its iterating through all the constants generated via python ‚Äî do we want to keep it?\r\n\r\n- [x] license - Bancor code is licensed under Apache License v2.0 and OpenZeppelin is MIT, is there a conflict here? do we need some special notice when we use Bancor code?  \r\n\r\nAdding a an Apache 2.0 License and modification notice to the  ```BancorFormula.sol``` and ```Power.sol``` files with links to the Bancor repo. \r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\n- [ ] üêõ This is a bug report.\r\n- [x] üìà This is a feature request.\r\n\r\n## üëç Other Information\r\n\r\nSome background reading about bonding curves:  \r\nhttps://hackernoon.com/how-to-make-bonding-curves-for-continuous-token-models-3784653f8b17\r\nhttps://medium.com/@simondlr/tokens-2-0-curved-token-bonding-in-curation-markets-1764a2e0bee5\r\nand Bancor formula:\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3HPNP-GDn7aRkVaV3dkVl9NS2M/view  \r\n",

    "body": "thanks @Shrugs!\r\nOne advantage of a separate folder is to keep BondingCurve.sol and BancorFormula.sol close together\r\n\r\nOne more note:\r\nI could move the exponentiation ```power``` function from the BancorFormula into a separate contract in the math folder. This will make BancorFormula contract very simple (could even merge it into a single BondingCurve.sol) and all the complex python constants will live in ```power```. This will also make ```power``` usable in other contracts‚Äîfor example continuous inflation. ",

This may be another reason to hold off merging into Zeppelin repo and work on this in the dedicated one.",
