  "body": "### ERC20 token standard known issues.\r\n\r\nAll this tokens are affected: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/tree/master/contracts/token/ERC20\r\n\r\nHere you can find a full description: https://dexaran820.medium.com/known-problems-of-erc20-token-standard-e98887b9532c\r\n\r\nLong story short: there is no transaction handling implementation for `transfer` function in ERC20 standard (it is the flaw of the standard as it must enforce it - it is a critical feature).\r\n\r\nOn 27 Dec, 2017 there were [$4 million worth of tokens lost](https://github.com/ethereum/eips/issues/223) due to this flaw of the standard.\r\n\r\nOn 9 Mar, 2023 there were about $12 million worth of tokens lost.\r\n\r\nAs of today there are about $30 millions worth of tokens lost.\r\n\r\nSince the tokens are not recoverable the amount can only increase and in fact it WILL increase over time.\r\n\r\n**💻 Environment**\r\n\r\nRemix or whatever environment you may use to compile contracts.\r\n\r\n**📝 Details**\r\n\r\nUsers of ERC-20 tokens can lose their tokens.\r\n\r\nI suggest:\r\n\r\n1. Implement a special security check that prevents sending of ERC-20 tokens where they must not be delivered. In particular the `transfer(...)` function must not be used to send tokens to ANY contracts (because contracts rely on approve+transferFrom as a depositing pattern).\r\n\r\n```\r\n    function transfer(address to, uint256 value) public virtual returns (bool) {\r\n        require(!Address.isContract(to), \"ERC20: transfer to contracts must be performed via approve+transferFrom pattern\");\r\n        address owner = _msgSender();\r\n        _transfer(owner, to, value);\r\n        return true;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Add a corresponding paragraph to the documentation or code comments to warn the users and token developers about any potential issues. A warning that transferring tokens to contracts via `transfer(...)` func will result in a *deposit that will not be recognized by the recipient* i.e. the recipient CAN NOT KNOW that the deposit occured and it will not be credited as well as it can not be rejected by the recipient.\r\n\r\n3. Suggest implementing the `ERC20Rescure(...)` function in every contract which is supposed to work with tokens in order to extract any unintentionally deposited ERC20 tokens that were not recorded.\r\n\r\n```\r\n    // Rescue ERC20 tokens\r\n    function rescueERC20(address _token, uint256 _value) external {\r\n        require(msg.sender == ISoyFinanceFactory(factory).feeToSetter(), 'SoyFinance: FORBIDDEN');\r\n        // bytes4(keccak256(bytes('transfer(address,uint256)')));\r\n        _token.call(abi.encodeWithSelector(0xa9059cbb, msg.sender, _value));\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is relevant and it often happens. Rescue missions are necessary for ERC20 tokens. For example AAVE handled it already https://twitter.com/AaveAave/status/1633126370166575104\r\n\r\n**🔢 Code to reproduce bug**\r\n\r\nIt is a flaw of the standard, not any particular implementation so I suggest to add some features that may help to mitigate the consequences to some degree or at least lower the risks for end users.\r\n",

In practice it certainly doesn't because wallet devs are even less aware of an issue than contract devs.\r\n\r\nAnd it is certainly not possible to guarantee that all wallet developers in the future will always solve this problem. New wallets and new developers will emerge... so if the underlying technology has some sort of problems/vulnerabilities/security flaws - it will result in lost money.\r\n\r\n",
