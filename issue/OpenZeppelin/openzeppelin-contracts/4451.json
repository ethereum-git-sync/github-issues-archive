  "body": "### ERC20 token standard known issues.\r\n\r\nAll this tokens are affected: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/tree/master/contracts/token/ERC20\r\n\r\nHere you can find a full description: https://dexaran820.medium.com/known-problems-of-erc20-token-standard-e98887b9532c\r\n\r\nLong story short: there is no transaction handling implementation for `transfer` function in ERC20 standard (it is the flaw of the standard as it must enforce it - it is a critical feature).\r\n\r\nOn 27 Dec, 2017 there were [$4 million worth of tokens lost](https://github.com/ethereum/eips/issues/223) due to this flaw of the standard.\r\n\r\nOn 9 Mar, 2023 there were about $12 million worth of tokens lost.\r\n\r\nAs of today there are about $30 millions worth of tokens lost.\r\n\r\nSince the tokens are not recoverable the amount can only increase and in fact it WILL increase over time.\r\n\r\n**💻 Environment**\r\n\r\nRemix or whatever environment you may use to compile contracts.\r\n\r\n**📝 Details**\r\n\r\nUsers of ERC-20 tokens can lose their tokens.\r\n\r\nI suggest:\r\n\r\n1. Implement a special security check that prevents sending of ERC-20 tokens where they must not be delivered. In particular the `transfer(...)` function must not be used to send tokens to ANY contracts (because contracts rely on approve+transferFrom as a depositing pattern).\r\n\r\n```\r\n    function transfer(address to, uint256 value) public virtual returns (bool) {\r\n        require(!Address.isContract(to), \"ERC20: transfer to contracts must be performed via approve+transferFrom pattern\");\r\n        address owner = _msgSender();\r\n        _transfer(owner, to, value);\r\n        return true;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Add a corresponding paragraph to the documentation or code comments to warn the users and token developers about any potential issues. A warning that transferring tokens to contracts via `transfer(...)` func will result in a *deposit that will not be recognized by the recipient* i.e. the recipient CAN NOT KNOW that the deposit occured and it will not be credited as well as it can not be rejected by the recipient.\r\n\r\n3. Suggest implementing the `ERC20Rescure(...)` function in every contract which is supposed to work with tokens in order to extract any unintentionally deposited ERC20 tokens that were not recorded.\r\n\r\n```\r\n    // Rescue ERC20 tokens\r\n    function rescueERC20(address _token, uint256 _value) external {\r\n        require(msg.sender == ISoyFinanceFactory(factory).feeToSetter(), 'SoyFinance: FORBIDDEN');\r\n        // bytes4(keccak256(bytes('transfer(address,uint256)')));\r\n        _token.call(abi.encodeWithSelector(0xa9059cbb, msg.sender, _value));\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is relevant and it often happens. Rescue missions are necessary for ERC20 tokens. For example AAVE handled it already https://twitter.com/AaveAave/status/1633126370166575104\r\n\r\n**🔢 Code to reproduce bug**\r\n\r\nIt is a flaw of the standard, not any particular implementation so I suggest to add some features that may help to mitigate the consequences to some degree or at least lower the risks for end users.\r\n",

    "body": "> This is an issue with ERC20, but changing that behavior breaks more things than it fixes, because the resulting token won't be ERC20 compliant.\r\n> \r\n> Many alternatives have been proposed, mostly ERC223 and ERC777, they both have more issues than real benefit.\r\n> \r\n> Our code is following the standard, which ensures interoperability with DeFi. If another standard ever reach consensus in the community, we will implement it ... but so far all effort in that dirrection has failled.\r\n\r\nThe main problems of ERC-20 that ERC-223 solves\r\n\r\nLost tokens: there are two different ways to transfer ERC20 tokens depending on is the receiver address a contract or a wallet address. You should call transfer to send tokens to a wallet address or call approve on token contract then transferFrom on receiver contract to send tokens to contract. Accidentally call of transfer function to a contract address will cause a loss of tokens inside receiver contract.\r\n\r\nImpossibility of handling incoming token transactions / lack of event handling in ERC20: ERC20 token transaction is a call of transfer function inside token contract. ERC20 token contract is not notifying receiver that transaction occurs. Also there is no way to handle incoming token transactions on contract and no way to reject any non-supported tokens.\r\n\r\nOptimization of ERC20 address-to-contract communication: You should call approve on token contract and then call transferFrom on another contract when you want to deposit your tokens into it. In fact address-to-contract transfer is a couple of two different transactions in ERC20. It also costs twice more gas compared to ERC223 transfers. In ERC223 address-to-contract transfer is a single transaction just like address-to-address transfer.\r\n\r\nEther transactions and token transactions behave differently: one of the goals of developing ERC223 was to make token transactions similar to Ether transactions to avoid users mistakes when transferring tokens and make interaction with token transactions easier for contract developers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nERC-223 advantages.\r\n\r\nProvides a possibility to avoid accidentally lost tokens inside contracts that are not designed to work with sent tokens.\r\n\r\nAllows users to send their tokens anywhere with one function transfer. No difference between is the receiver a contract or not. No need to learn how token contract is working for regular user to send tokens.\r\n\r\nAllows contract developers to handle incoming token transactions.\r\n\r\nERC223 transfer to contract consumes 2 times less gas than ERC20 approve and transferFrom at receiver contract.\r\n\r\nAllows to deposit tokens into contract with a single transaction. Prevents extra blockchain bloating.\r\n\r\nMakes token transactions similar to Ether transactions.\r\n\r\nERC-223 tokens are backwards compatible with ERC-20 tokens. It means that ERC-223 supports every ERC-20 functional and contracts or services working with ERC-20 tokens will work with ERC-223 tokens correctly. ERC-223 tokens should be sent by calling transfer function on token contract with no difference is receiver a contract or a wallet address. If the receiver is a wallet ERC-223 token transfer will be same to ERC-20 transfer. If the receiver is a contract ERC-223 token contract will try to call tokenReceived function on receiver contract. If there is no tokenReceived function on receiver contract transaction will fail. tokenReceived function is analogue of fallback function for Ether transactions. It can be used to handle incoming transactions.\r\n \r\nThere is a way to attach bytes _data to token transaction similar to _data attached to Ether transactions. It will pass through token contract and will be handled by tokenReceived function on receiver contract. There is also a way to call transfer function on ERC-223 token contract with no data argument or using ERC-20 ABI with no data on transfer function. In this case _data will be empty bytes array.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reason of designing ERC-223 token standard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a description of the ERC-20 token standard problem that is solved by ERC-223:\r\n\r\nERC-20 token standard is leading to money losses for end users. The main problem is lack of possibility to handle incoming ERC-20 transactions, that were performed via transfer function of ERC-20 token.\r\n\r\nIf you send 100 ETH to a contract that is not intended to work with Ether, then it will reject a transaction and nothing bad will happen. If you will send 100 ERC-20 tokens to a contract that is not intended to work with ERC-20 tokens, then it will not reject tokens because it cant recognize an incoming transaction. As the result, your tokens will get stuck at the contracts balance.\r\n\r\nSource: https://github.com/Dexaran/ERC223-token-standard",

It allows for the safe transfer of tokens to both contract wallets and externally owned accounts (EOAs) without the risk of lost tokens.\r\n\r\nIn the ERC-223 standard, the transfer function is modified to include an additional parameter, data, which can be used to pass additional information to the receiving contract.

If the contract implements a token fallback function that can handle the data parameter, it will receive and process the tokens correctly. If the contract does not implement a fallback function, the transaction will revert, preventing the tokens from being lost.\r\n\r\nERC-223 provides a more secure and flexible alternative to the traditional ERC-20 token standard, specifically when interacting with contracts. It ensures that tokens are not accidentally lost due to improper transfers to contracts that cannot handle them.\r\n\r\n",

This would make the transfer function stop working when transfering tokens to smart contract wallets.\r\n\r\nAnd `transfer` shouldn't be used to transfer tokens to contracts. The documentation of ERC-20 standard states that approve+transferFrom pattern is used for depositing funds. So all devs who rely on depositing ERC-20 to contracts rely on `transfer` function are doing it wrong and its their problem.\r\n\r\nRelying on what you shouldn't rely on is a security issue that can result in millions of dollars loss - which in fact already happened.\r\n\r\nIf you want to deposit funds to contract - you can just send them via `transferFrom` yourself. The sender of the transaction can `transferFrom` the tokens from his own wallet similarly to how the contract can pull tokens in.\r\n\r\n>I would love to provide a \"rescue\" function that works out of the box, but such a function needs to ensure it doesn't allow stealing tokens that actually belong to the protocol. The example implementation provided does not guarantee that at all.\r\n\r\nImplementation must be contract-specific.\r\n\r\nIf your contract calculates how much tokens were deposited then the difference between \"how much a contract thinks is deposited\" and \"how much a token contract thinks is on `balanceOf(...)` of the contract\" is in fact the value that can be ERC20Rescue'd",
