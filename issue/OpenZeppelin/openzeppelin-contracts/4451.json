  "body": "### ERC20 token standard known issues.\r\n\r\nAll this tokens are affected: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/tree/master/contracts/token/ERC20\r\n\r\nHere you can find a full description: https://dexaran820.medium.com/known-problems-of-erc20-token-standard-e98887b9532c\r\n\r\nLong story short: there is no transaction handling implementation for `transfer` function in ERC20 standard (it is the flaw of the standard as it must enforce it - it is a critical feature).\r\n\r\nOn 27 Dec, 2017 there were [$4 million worth of tokens lost](https://github.com/ethereum/eips/issues/223) due to this flaw of the standard.\r\n\r\nOn 9 Mar, 2023 there were about $12 million worth of tokens lost.\r\n\r\nAs of today there are about $30 millions worth of tokens lost.\r\n\r\nSince the tokens are not recoverable the amount can only increase and in fact it WILL increase over time.\r\n\r\n**💻 Environment**\r\n\r\nRemix or whatever environment you may use to compile contracts.\r\n\r\n**📝 Details**\r\n\r\nUsers of ERC-20 tokens can lose their tokens.\r\n\r\nI suggest:\r\n\r\n1. Implement a special security check that prevents sending of ERC-20 tokens where they must not be delivered. In particular the `transfer(...)` function must not be used to send tokens to ANY contracts (because contracts rely on approve+transferFrom as a depositing pattern).\r\n\r\n```\r\n    function transfer(address to, uint256 value) public virtual returns (bool) {\r\n        require(!Address.isContract(to), \"ERC20: transfer to contracts must be performed via approve+transferFrom pattern\");\r\n        address owner = _msgSender();\r\n        _transfer(owner, to, value);\r\n        return true;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Add a corresponding paragraph to the documentation or code comments to warn the users and token developers about any potential issues. A warning that transferring tokens to contracts via `transfer(...)` func will result in a *deposit that will not be recognized by the recipient* i.e. the recipient CAN NOT KNOW that the deposit occured and it will not be credited as well as it can not be rejected by the recipient.\r\n\r\n3. Suggest implementing the `ERC20Rescure(...)` function in every contract which is supposed to work with tokens in order to extract any unintentionally deposited ERC20 tokens that were not recorded.\r\n\r\n```\r\n    // Rescue ERC20 tokens\r\n    function rescueERC20(address _token, uint256 _value) external {\r\n        require(msg.sender == ISoyFinanceFactory(factory).feeToSetter(), 'SoyFinance: FORBIDDEN');\r\n        // bytes4(keccak256(bytes('transfer(address,uint256)')));\r\n        _token.call(abi.encodeWithSelector(0xa9059cbb, msg.sender, _value));\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is relevant and it often happens. Rescue missions are necessary for ERC20 tokens. For example AAVE handled it already https://twitter.com/AaveAave/status/1633126370166575104\r\n\r\n**🔢 Code to reproduce bug**\r\n\r\nIt is a flaw of the standard, not any particular implementation so I suggest to add some features that may help to mitigate the consequences to some degree or at least lower the risks for end users.\r\n",
