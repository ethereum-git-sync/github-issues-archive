But the ERC4626 contract does not initialize this token with name and symbol.\r\nIt would be more intuitive and easy to understand if the token name and symbol are initialized together with the ERC4626 directly.\r\n<!-- Describe the problem you have been experiencing in more detail. Include as much information as you think is relevant. Keep in mind that transactions can fail for many reasons; context is key here. -->\r\n",
