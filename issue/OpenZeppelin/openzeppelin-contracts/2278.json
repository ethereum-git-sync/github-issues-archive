Thank you so much!\r\nHowever, one item in particular when it comes to ERC721s is the `tokenURI` and its **lack** of change-ability.  \r\n\r\n**📝 Details**\r\nMove the `_setBaseURI` method away from inside the `initialize` method, and into its own `public virtual` method, with a check for the `MINTER_ROLE`.\r\n\r\nThis would mean a new token would need to have `setBaseURI` called separately from the `initialize` method (👎 ), but it would allow for future changes (👍 ) if so desired.\r\n",

    "body": "My thoughts are that to allow for future changes, developers wanting to use `baseURI` for automatic token URI generation can either use a URI that they control such as `https://mydomain.com/api/token/` which can be pointed to the implementation of their choice or they can add a mechanism in the smart contract (with appropriate access control) to allow changing it.  This may or may not be the `MINTER_ROLE`.\r\n\r\nIn the two ERC721's I have been involved in, one was designed to use a domain approach, the other had a function with access control to change the base URI.\r\n\r\nPlease note that `baseURI` can be set in the constructor/initializer or it can be set to an empty string `\"\"`.

    "body": "Hello @EvilJordan, thanks for suggesting this!\r\n\r\nThe Presets are meant to be usable as-is and ready to deploy to mainnet, but they naturally don't cover for all possible use cases. The idea is to provide a working initial version that can be extended by users to develop their custom solution (like @abcoathup showed in the comment above).\r\n\r\nWe often say that Contracts' code should not be copy-pasted, and Presets might be the only exception. If you find you want to be able to change the base URI, but also have different roles for pausing and pausing, the sensible thing to do is to grab the Preset's code and modify it to suit your particular use-case. In that sense, they are also acting as a sort of example of how to put different modules together.\r\n\r\nHope that helps! I'm closing the issue since we won't be alterting the Preset's code.",
