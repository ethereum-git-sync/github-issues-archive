  "body": "**üßê Motivation**\r\nWhen going through the process of learning the new governance code, I deployed an ERC20Votes token, minted it to myself, but was surprised to see no checkpoint was created. It was only when I looked into the tests did I find out I had to first delegate them to myself. \r\n\r\nIs this intentional? Should we have ERC20Votes token auto delegate to whomever mints them?\r\n\r\nFor context, the ERC20Votes `_mint` function looks like this:\r\n```javascript\r\n    function _mint(address account, uint256 amount) internal virtual override {\r\n        super._mint(account, amount);\r\n        require(totalSupply() <= _maxSupply(), \"ERC20Votes: total supply risks overflowing votes\");\r\n\r\n        _writeCheckpoint(_totalSupplyCheckpoints, _add, amount);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nIt calls `_writeCheckpoint` with `_totalSupplyCheckpoints`, but for voting, the right one would be `_checkpoints[account]`\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/e6f26b46fc8015f1b9b09bb85297464069302125/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC20Votes.sol#L172\r\n\r\nWould it make sense to also add:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n_writeCheckpoint(_checkpoints[account], _add, amount);\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo we could have a checkpoint right when the token is minted to a user?
