  "body": "When scheduling a transaction using the `TimelockController`, one is required to provide a `salt` to distinguish otherwise identical transactions. The `salt` parameter is not emitted in the `CallScheduled` event which makes it impossible to recover. Yet `salt` is required for executing the scheduled transaction transaction, ~~even though it isn't necessary and more gas efficient if `id` is used instead~~.\r\n\r\n**💻 Environment**\r\n\r\nOpenzeppelin v4.5.0  / hardhat\r\n\r\n**📝 Details**\r\n\r\n`salt` is missing from the `CallScheduled` event: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/458697be32f41946e1ab66e946c7cf373c79577d/contracts/governance/TimelockController.sol#L35\r\n\r\n`salt` is required for the `execute` & `executeBatch` calls: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/458697be32f41946e1ab66e946c7cf373c79577d/contracts/governance/TimelockController.sol#L267\r\n\r\n~~Instead of `salt` the `execute` methods should be consuming the hashed operation (`id`) directly, since that id is readily available via event data.
