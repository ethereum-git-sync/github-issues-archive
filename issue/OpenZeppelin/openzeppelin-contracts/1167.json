You can look at the 2.0 milestone and related issues/PRs [here](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/milestone/3). There will probably be a blogpost soon describing what 2.0 entails.\r\n\r\nThat said, OpenZeppelin code has been around for quite a bit and is used by multiple projects, so I'm not sure what sort of extra 'verification' you're expecting. Small issues like this don't really affect the smart contract code, but rather the maintainability of the project.\r\n\r\nBy the way, if you're interested in upgradeability, take a look at [ZeppelinOS](https://zeppelinos.org/), which tackles that issue head-on.",

Does everybody do it with Truffle?\r\nBecause clearly, if they use the Solidity compiler, then they must copy OpenZeppelin files into their project, in the same way that I do it.\r\n\r\nWould you know of any way to combine the installation of OpenZeppelin via `npm`, and the compilation of the contracts via `solc`?\r\n\r\nThanks",

    "body": "@nventuro:\r\n\r\nThank you for your quick response.\r\n\r\nI use:\r\n1. `truffle test` (preceded by `truffle compile`) along with `ganache-cli` for testing.\r\n2. `solidity-coverage` along with `testrpc-sc` for a full coverage report.\r\n3. The output of `solc` (abi and bin files) for contract-deployment and contract-interaction via web3.js v1.x directly (in opposed to the previous two, where web3.js v0.x is used indirectly).\r\n\r\nFor #1 and #2, I even implemented a NodeJS script which starts the Ethereum node (either `ganache-cli` or `testrpc-sc`) and then runs the test (either  `truffle test` or `solidity-coverage`). The script is connected in the `package.json` file, so all I need to do after installation is `npm test 1` or `npm test 2`.\r\nThis script also has the advantage of being OS-agnostic (platform-independent).\r\n\r\nWhy did I choose to use `solc` for the actual deployment and interaction?\r\n\r\nWell, first and foremost because it generates bin and abi files, while Truffle generates json files.\r\nAnd since I would ultimately need to publish the abi files, I figured I may as well go along with `solc` for this purpose.\r\nSomeone insinuated to me earlier today that I could extract bin and abi from the json, but why should I bother with having to \"auto-script\" that?\r\n\r\nSecond, as you mentioned, Truffle testing relies on the Mocha framework. I could use it also for contract interaction, but that's not the purpose of Mocha, is it?\r\nTruffle deployment (via `truffle deploy` or `truffle migrate`) does allow me to deploy the contracts without going via the Mocha framework. However, I have found their deployment syntax to be very cumbersome, and not very convenient for use.\r\n\r\nThird, Truffle is still stuck on web3.js v0.18.4 for some reason.\r\n\r\nFourth, AFAIK, the development of `solc` has forked at some point from the initial branch which targeted Windows an Ubuntu, to a branch which targets MacOS.\r\nSo while using Truffle leaves me \"in the dark\" about which compiler is used for compiling my code, using `solc` doesn't (I download an explicit version for my OS).\r\nOf course, this is not ideal, since I am possibly testing my contracts with one compiler version, and then deploying them with another.\r\nBut this way, at least I know exactly how my deployed code was compiled.\r\nAlso, `truffle compile` yields a different output when executed twice on the same input, which makes it hard for me to track changes in the binaries.\r\n",
