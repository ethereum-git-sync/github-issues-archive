  "body": "<!-- Briefly describe the issue you're experiencing. Tell us what you were trying to do and what happened instead. -->\r\n\r\nThe `ERC20Wrapper` contract is designed to create \"wrapped\" tokens based on some **underlying** ERC20 token. This should expose the basic properties of the underlying token wrapped on a one-for-one basis.\r\n\r\nHowever, the `ERC20Wrapper` contract does not expose the result of the underlying token's `decimals()` method in its own `decimals()` implementation. Instead, it inherits the standard implementation from `ERC20.sol` which is hard-coded to simply output `18`. Hence an underlying token can have a different `decimals()` result than its wrapped counterpart.\r\n\r\nIn practice it is, of course, very unusual for tokens to have `decimals() != 18`, but in practice it can pose a problem for front-ends that respect the `decimals()` field of a token and expect its wrapped counterpart to use the same value. Somebody could create an ERC20 with weird `decimals()` and then the UI for wrapping would receive a different decimals value from the wrapped and underlying tokens. This could cause strange math errors that would confuse the user, and convince them that the wrapped token was malfunctioning. \r\n\r\n<!-- Remember, this is not a place to ask for help debugging code. For that, we welcome you in the OpenZeppelin Community Forum: https://forum.openzeppelin.com/. -->\r\n\r\n**üíª Environment**\r\n\r\n<!-- Tell us what version of OpenZeppelin Contracts you're using, and how you're using it: Truffle, Remix, etc. -->\r\n\r\nLatest (in Git)\r\n\r\n**üìù Details**\r\n\r\nIf this is worth fixing (and I don't know), the main issue here is with tokens that don't implement a decimals() method. This edge-case would need to be handled, but doesn't seem like a big deal.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the problem you have been experiencing in more detail. Include as much information as you think is relevant. Keep in mind that transactions can fail for many reasons; context is key here. -->\r\n\r\n**üî¢ Code to reproduce bug**\r\n\r\n1. Make a token that has decimals() != 18\r\n2. Create an instance of an ERC20Wrapper based on this token.\r\n3. Call decimals() on the original and underlying, they won't be the same.\r\n\r\n<!-- We will be able to better help if you provide a minimal example that triggers the bug. -->\r\n",
