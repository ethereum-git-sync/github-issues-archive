  "body": "**🧐 Motivation**\r\nThe current flash loans implementation suggests to burn the fee of the flash loan with no easy way for implementers to override this default behavior. e.g. If the token is capped, this leads to shrink the total supply over time [considering the fee is higher than 0].\r\n\r\nThis behavior is not well documented and the Wizard doesn't consider this.\r\n\r\n**📝 Details**\r\nI would suggest to implement two strategies for the flash loan fee processing. Where implementers explicitly set the right strategy for their use case.\r\n1. BURN: The loaned amount and the fee amount get burnt (current implementation).\r\n2. HOLD: The loaned amount get burnt and the fee amount get transferred to the contract itself (address(this)).\r\n3. CUSTOM: The fee amount to be transferred to different address (Breaks the trust?)\r\n",

    "body": "This is a great point. We need to decide how we will expose this functionality. Am I right that we can simply model this as the ability to customize the fee receiver? We can say that if the receiver is 0 the fee is burned, and otherwise the fee is transferred to that account. So we could add an internal virtual function that people can override to customize:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nfunction _flashFeeReceiver(address token) internal view virtual returns (address) {\r\n    return address(0);\r\n}\r\n````\r\n\r\nRegarding @Amxx's concern about implementation, we if the receiver is zero we can burn it all together.",
