  "body": "**üßê Motivation**\r\nI recently wanted a way to restrict function calls for each user by some time. That's when I was searching if there was a utils contract in OpenZeppelin contracts, but I didn't find one. So I decided to make one and contribute here.\r\n\r\n**üìù Details**\r\nI have created a repo with the contract and documentation on how to use it. You can find the repo [here](https://github.com/RedHeadphone/CallRestrict). I've added tests to verify the logic of smart contract. I would like to know your opinions and suggestions (if any) on this util contract. If everything looks good, I can make PR adding Call Restrict.\r\n",

    "body": "Hey @RedHeadphone, the idea is interesting. We're currently also discussing [an `AccessManager` implementation](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4121) that might be suited for what you want to do.\r\n\r\nThere are still some open questions, but the particular use case of count/timestamp is not supported in the current design. We'd love to hear why you think that use-case could be important.\r\n\r\nIf we decide to support it, I'd say any access restriction should fall into our Access Control category, therefore added to the AccessManager.",

    "body": "Yeah, access control seems correct place to add call restrict functionality, as for important use-case of it can be restricting admin to withdraw funds within same year from a fund raising contract.
