    "body": "Okay right, that works, but its appearance is far from ideal. For example I have an abstract contract called Unruggable, which inherits from Ownable2Step. Therefore, when inheriting Unruggable, I also have to import Ownable and invoke Ownable(msg.sender) in the constructor, without a clear justification. In my opinion, it would be preferable if Ownable2Step had a constructor that automatically called the Ownable constructor and passed the account argument through.",
