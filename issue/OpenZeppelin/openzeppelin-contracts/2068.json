  "body": "We're [redesigning our open-source processes at OpenZeppelin](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/redesigning-openzeppelin-open-source-processes/2048), aiming to boost transparency and increase community participation.\r\n\r\nPart of that effort is **giving more visibility on our medium term goals**, both to set expectations for our users on upcoming features and improvements, and to provide clarity over our priorities to contributors that want to help improve the library.\r\n\r\nAt a high-level, we're going to be focusing on the following goals:\r\n * Migrating to Solidity v0.6\r\n * Implementing New Features by the Community\r\n * Reducing Library Complexity \r\n\r\n## Migrating to Solidity v0.6\r\n\r\nAs the industry advances and new practices and standards evolve, we’ll need to do some work to keep our status as the go-to library for Smart Contracts, including staying up to date with the latest releases of the Solidity language.\r\n\r\nSolidity v0.6 was released in December 2019, and we expect the community at large to migrate their code to it over the next couple of months: many users [are already](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/protocol/issues/815) [waiting for](https://github.com/energywebfoundation/origin/pull/409) [us to](https://github.com/statechannels/monorepo/issues/808) [support it](https://github.com/razor-network/contracts/issues/19).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the migration to v0.6 is not straightforward: it requires the [design of new features](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8141) and documentation to guide users through the process. We’re in close contact with the Solidity team to try and find approaches that will simplify the transition.\r\n\r\nWe expect to have an **initial beta release by early February** with iterative improvements based on user feedback. The aim is for the **final release to be out in early March**.\r\n\r\n## Implementing New Features by the Community\r\n\r\nAs the space matures, new developer needs come up. We’ve identified **two highly requested initiatives**, for which we’ve seen the need in both security audits and user requests. These are expected to be largely community-driven.\r\n\r\nThe first one is the **ERC1155 token**, a new standard that is gaining popularity as a successor to ERC20 and ERC721. We already have an [initial draft of the code in our repository](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2014): we’d have to work on adding test cases and documentation.\r\n\r\nThe other candidate is a library for **fixed-point arithmetic**. This comes up a lot in DeFi, and rolling a custom solution can be very tricky. There are some open-source projects we can leverage here, notably [Fixidity](https://github.com/CementDAO/Fixidity), a library developed by two community members, used by [PoolTogether](https://www.pooltogether.com/), and audited by Quanstamp.\r\n\r\nWe plan on relying on help from the community for implementing these initiatives. Both are reasonably well-defined and scoped, and are great options for experienced developers willing to collaborate with the library. On our end, we will provide support to the implementers and review their solutions.\r\n\r\n## Reducing Library Complexity \r\n\r\nWe experienced some friction during 2019 when deciding which new things to add to the library, which led to an overall reduction of community activity on the repository. We believe this is related to Contracts’ goal not being clearly defined, and to the complexity of the library.\r\n\r\nWe’ll perform a number of **breaking changes on the v3.0 release**. The contracts will be less coupled to each other, thus **lowering the barrier for new contributions** for both developers and reviewers, and making maintenance easier.\r\n\r\nIn concrete terms, we’re planning on:\r\n\r\n### Decoupling the Default Access Control Library\r\nContracts currently provides Roles, an opinionated Access Control solution which works for most scenarios. It also provides ERC implementations built on top of it (such as ERC20Mintable). However, we have seen that many users prefer to use their own access control libraries. To cater for them, we will ship all ERC extensions without an integrated access control solution, though making it easy to combine them with Roles. This will also improve maintainability by reducing the number of contracts in the library.\r\n\r\n### Unifying ERC Extensions\r\nEvery ERC implementation in Contracts has multiple flavours and extensions. For example, ERC20 is complemented by ERC20Detailed, and ERC721 by ERC721Metadata and ERC721Enumerable. We will unify some of these optional extensions into a single contract to reduce the complexity of the code.\r\n\r\n### Removing Crowdsales\r\nCrowdsales were one of the most popular features of Contracts during the ICO craze of 2017 (back when the library was called zeppelin-solidity!). Fortunately, this is no longer the case. We have seen a decline in the usage of Crowdsales, and decided to remove them from v3.0, given the complexity of migrating them to Solidity 0.6. They will still be available on v2.5 in Solidity 0.5, and we encourage our community to fork them to migrate them to Solidity 0.6 if there is interest.\r\n\r\n### Providing Out-Of-The-Box Contracts\r\nTo cater for beginner users, we will add a set of ready-to-use standalone contracts for the most popular combinations of ERC extensions, such as a preminted ERC20, or a mintable ERC721. These will not cover the entire space of possible combinations, but we hope will serve as guides for new combinations that our users want to build.\r\n\r\nThis means the library will be much smaller and leaner, only providing the tools required to build a larger system, complemented by a small set of out-of-the-box contracts.\r\n\r\nFor technical reasons, **these changes will be part of the v3.0 release** (along with the Solidity v0.6 migration).",
