CTR or GCM should be preferred to it\r\n- GCM is better than CTR/CBC+HMAC (can be parallel; harder to misuse)\r\n- GCM has AAD\r\n- GCM is the only mode included in TLS v1.3. They've dropped all CTR/CBC ciphers!\r\n- If ETH non-wallet apps are using encryption, they should definitely be using GCM, not CTR/CBC\r\n",
