This would indeed make it easier for users to sync with the upstream eth2.0-specs repository, especially when specific phases are still under development.\n\nI will make sure to pass this feedback along to the appropriate team so that they can consider implementing this improvement. Your input is greatly appreciated as it helps us enhance the user experience and ensure better synchronization with the latest specifications.",
