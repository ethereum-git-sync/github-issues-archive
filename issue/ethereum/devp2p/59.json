RLP, SSZ, SOS, SSS, each with differing types of design goals and differing clarity in design goals.\r\n\r\nRecent convo with @Felix Lange (fjl) we agreed that ethereum/devp2p should be the label for 'all things p2p' in Ethereum. Do we agree with that , and if so, I would like to kick off some effort to consolidate and focus these groups- eg: by moving the different draft specs under ethereum/devp2p and having all the stakeholders converse there.

Anything concrete like the wire protocol was meant to be an issue in the eth2.0-specs repo.
