  "body": "Hi I'm trying to understand the discv5 but got some questions.\r\n\r\nAfter learning I noticed in discv5 all of the p2p applications shares the same DHT, the bootnodes in the DHT seems an all-in-one nodes set, it records not only ethereum node, but also bsc nodes, polygon nodes and even the nodes which are not blockchain applications, while in the other side, when a new joiner node tries to connect to the network through the bootnodes, the `FINDNODE`/`NODES` response seems won't do a pre-filtering, the new node itself need to filter the result based on its own chainID or other attributes.\r\n\r\nSo the first question is, assuming if I spawn up a new chain and fork the geth client, I don't need to setup my own bootnodes right? can just use the hardcoded ones in geth client, that ones are meant for ethereum but actually they can serve any other p2p nodes.\r\n\r\nSecondly, are the static peers configured participate in node discovery? i.e. my nodeA configures a nodeB as its static peer, will nodeA send `FINDNODE` to nodeB to request its neighbors?",
