  "body": "So I am currently looking at the discv5 spec, and I notice that if a node wants to advertise a specific topic it needs to `REGTOPIC` on that specific node. I wonder if it makes sense to advertise topics in the ENR as an array of topics that MUST then be added to the topic table for a specific node. This would allow nodes to already add their peers to the topic table for the most important topics and allow for further adding other topics using the `REGTOPIC` command.",
