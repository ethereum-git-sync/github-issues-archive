  "body": "We seem to use both the `x` and `y` component of the curve point created by ECDH:\r\n\r\n> `ecdh(pubkey, privkey)` creates a secret through elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman key\r\nagreement. The public key is multiplied by the private key to create a secret ephemeral\r\nkey `eph = pubkey * privkey`. The 33-byte secret output is `y || eph.x` where `y` is\r\n`0x02` when `eph.y` is even or `0x03` when `eph.y` is odd.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the [crypto library](https://github.com/pyca/cryptography) used in Trinity just gives us the `x` component. I assume the same is the case for OpenSSL since the Python library is just a wrapper around it (I haven't confirmed this though). Given this assumption is correct, is there a reason for using both `x` and `y`? ",
