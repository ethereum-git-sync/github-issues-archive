  "body": "It would be nice to access Ethereum data in a peer-to-peer way using a web browser. This is not possible today, and Ethereum service providers fill this role instead.\r\n\r\nThe Ethereum network and its full nodes use the [eth](https://github.com/ethereum/devp2p/tree/master/caps/eth.md) protocol, and this protocol is inaccessible to the browser by design. This is because eth is a tit-for-tat system. Browsers cannot give any meaningful data back, and can generally not serve other clients in a meaningful way. There are workarounds for everything of course, but I'm quite happy we don't have to deal with browsers in the Ethereum core network.\r\n\r\nWe also have [les](https://github.com/ethereum/devp2p/tree/master/caps/les.md), which is a client/server protocol and includes incentives. LES should work in the browser, but doesn't.\r\n\r\nIn its current form, LES is incompatible with browsers because it uses the RLPx protocol. But LES doesn't need RLPx and would work just as well over HTTP. It would be nice to have an implementation and spec for LES over HTTP, specifically using HTTPS.\r\n\r\nThe LES specification doesn't define how servers are actually found, it just describes the interaction between a single client and server. This is OK for the RLPx-based version of LES because it can use the discovery protocols we have. But those protocols are also incompatible with the browser. I think the right solution for this problem would be a server discovery protocol specifically for browsers.",

    "body": "A practical system which has already solved these issues is [IN3](https://in3.readthedocs.io/en/develop/ethereum.html) (formerly known as Incubed). Their system is different from LES because it removes the need to synchronize and validate the header chain, focusing only on the retrieval of state and receipts via HTTPS. \r\n\r\nIn IN3, access to the data is provided by HTTP servers which are registered in a smart contract. The servers receive payment in some way and also have a deposit, which can be slashed when the server provably misbehaves. Slashing is performed by other servers with access to the real chain.\r\n\r\nDiscovery of the servers is handled by performing a blockchain query through 'bootstrap nodes', giving the client access to the complete list of all servers.",
