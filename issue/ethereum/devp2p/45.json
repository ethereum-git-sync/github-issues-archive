    "body": "Raúl from the libp2p team here 👋 \r\n\r\nA bunch of thoughts:\r\n\r\n* libp2p features a kademlia DHT implementation with slightly different behaviour. Currently this is used by many projects including IPFS and Polkadot (with their rust-libp2p impl). \r\n  * We're working on other DHT implementations as well, such as [Coral](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-coral-dht). \r\n  * There's a DHT research group in Protocol Labs tackling several aspects such as security, routing, scoring, etc. \r\n  * Some ideas for improvements:\r\n    * Collection of ideas: https://github.com/libp2p/research-dht/issues/6\r\n    * Secure disjoint path lookups: https://github.com/libp2p/libp2p/issues/44\r\n    * Data structures: https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-kad-dht/issues/194\r\n  * By adopting libp2p, we hope the efforts we're investing to improve DHT lookups, security, connectivity, etc. will benefit Ethereum as well.\r\n\r\n* RLPx handshake (ECIES) and SecIO share similarities. I collected my thoughts here: https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-secio/issues/7#issuecomment-415031903\r\n\r\n* ENR (Ethereum Name Records, https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-778) could be materialised via the Interplanetary Record System. Spec here: https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/IPRS.md\r\n\r\n* Multiplexing can be handled by Yamux. We support `ls` messages to list protocols (thus playing the role of wire-level HELLO in devp2p), then through a single connection, any number of virtual streams can be opened for each protocol/conversation.\r\n\r\n* We currently don't send `DISCONNECT` messages. Some discussion taking place here: https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/issues/238\r\n\r\n* For integration with other languages (e.g. python, C++, Java, etc.), the [libp2p daemon](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-daemon) is under active development these weeks. This is a standalone process which allows local processes to interact with remote peers through libp2p, using simple Unix sockets and shared memory transports (in the future). Implementing bindings in other languages is straightforward. In fact, there's already a [Gerbil binding](https://github.com/vyzo/gerbil-libp2p/), and other folks have expressed their interest in contributing Java and Python bindings.\r\n\r\nThere are probably many other relevant topics that don't spring to mind right now, but I will be watching this issue. I'm excited to help the Ethereum community through this journey wherever needed ;-)\r\n\r\nP.S. If you need to chat with me, you can find me in the #libp2p Freenode IRC channel (nick: raulk), or in the Ethereum Sharding Gitter ;-)",

I was thinking Ethereum Node Records would be stored in the DHT somehow, but I don't think that's the intention, so the connection isn't clear to me now.\r\n\r\n> The idea is to be able to cross-connect the systems on the network level. If I understand IPFS correctly there should be a way to address content stored in other systems. I just thought it might be possible to make Ethereum a system like that. You could fetch blocks this way, for example.\r\n\r\nThis is a neat idea. IPLD allows traversing different data types stored in IPFS (including ETH blocks). See https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipld-eth/blob/master/plugin/README.md. Currently one needs to import blocks manually into IPFS, so it would be helpful to have ETH clients with IPLD/IPFS capability push blocks onto IPFS real-time, or expose an IPFS/IPLD protocol so that other IPFS clients can pull data from them by advertising themselves in the IPFS DHT.",
