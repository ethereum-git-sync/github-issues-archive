  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nDiscv5 currently uses the `ip`/`ip6` fields in an ENR's in order to send UDP traffic.\r\n\r\nThe PING and PONG packets allow external IP discovery for nodes. Nodes receiving a PONG can update their ENR based new IP information received from it's peers. \r\n\r\nIt was pointed out to me that in some circumstances, (e.g AWS), traffic may be outgoing on a particular gateway which refuses incoming traffic. The IP-based discovery suggested in this protocol does not accommodate such setups. \r\n\r\nOne idea would be to optionally use a `dns` field inside the ENR. Node's receiving ENR's with a `dns` field would connect via the `dns` field rather than the `ip` field. Potentially, we could allow static ip's in the `dns` field also, or make a `static_ip` field separately. \r\n\r\nCurious about thoughts on this / other ideas of handling such scenarios. \r\n\r\nI wonder if there are possible ddos attack vectors where users can spam the DHT with records which have `dns` entries that point to a victim IP. \r\n\r\n",

    "body": "The way we handle it in go-ethereum is like this: \"ip\" and \"ip6\" fields are determined in multiple ways depending on configuration. The local IP discovery based on PONG happens by default, but the predicted address is overridden if a UPnP or NAT-PMP capable gateway is found or if the user specifies an explicit address (i.e. using `geth -nat=extip:<IP>)`. \r\n\r\nI think ENR shouldn't care too much about where the IP comes from. Implementations should just try to find the real IP. I can make this more obvious in the spec by saying that the IP discovery through PONG is optional. \r\n\r\nRegarding the \"dns\" field, it does sound like a DoS vector to me because we can't verify it properly in the client. That said, we do want to support Tor onion addresses eventually, which has a similar problem. But these will never be supported in the discovery. The discovery protocol should always require the IP.",
