    "body": "Pretty much the same ```talk``` packet type, I was thinking that it would be great to hand out multiple talk responses per talk request, and we'd leave the app level talk handler to decide on whether it needs to send out single or multiple response packets, Depending on the protocol identifier. Protocol may still limit the number of outgoing response packets per request (4 seems like a great number, like ```Nodes```)\r\n\r\nI thought that this would be a nice addition because we cannot send much data in a single talk request (1280 constraint on size)\r\n\r\nAn example scenario: For designing a rendezvous kinda node for fast bootstrapping or traffic optimal bootstrapping for light clients, it would come in handy. \r\nYes, we may still rely on other protocols and get the ENR's externally and dump in our node table.\r\n\r\n",
