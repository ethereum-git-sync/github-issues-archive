  "body": "I have been spinning up new nodes regularly and connecting to a boot-node. As I spin up new nodes, I create new identities and connect to a boot-node via the same public ip. \r\n\r\nThe bootnode's DHT gradually fills with a number of nodes all of the same IP (mine). Eventually I have a node running, and when the bootnode searches for peers, it goes through it's DHT and tries to connect back to me using a number of different node-ids. \r\n\r\nThe issue is that I cannot determine if the node connecting to me, is expecting me to have a different node_id that what I actually have. In fact I see the request coming from a different node_id than what the boot-node has. I therefore treat this as a new peer and try and WHOAREYOU it. \r\n\r\nIs there a smarter way of addressing this kind of thing? Have I missed some trick in my implementation to prevent this? Ideally with a large set of peers, older nodes would get kicked from the DHT and this could just be an artefact of a low-valued DHT",

    "body": "Idea for fixing this: we can use a cheap MAC function and key it with the destination node ID.\r\nRemove the XOR and send src-node-id in clear text followed by the MAC value.\r\n\r\nExample using [siphash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SipHash) MAC:\r\n\r\n    tag = src-node-id || siphash(dest-node-id[:16], \"discv5\" || src-node-id)\r\n\r\nThe length of `tag` here would be 40 bytes since it is the concatenation of the 32-byte source ID and 8 bytes of siphash output. The recipient would compute the MAC using its own node ID as the key. It can determine which node ID sent the message by simply reading the first 32 bytes of `tag`.\r\n\r\nThis achieves two things:\r\n\r\n- When the destination node ID is wrong, the recipient will compute the wrong MAC and ignore the packet because it doesn't match.\r\n- Adding the protocol name into the MAC means we can use this tag construction to reliably distinguish whether an incoming packet belongs to discv5 or to any other UDP protocol on the same socket.\r\n\r\nThe downside is that src-node-id is sent clear text. One could argue it's not much of a secret with the XOR-based tag we currently use though.",
