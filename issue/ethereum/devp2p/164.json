  "body": "This issue is a proposal to bring back plain `id-nonce` in a `HANDSHAKE` packet. `id-nonce` is sent by remote peer during handshake process in a `WHOAREYOU` packet.\r\n\r\nIn discv5.1 this field has been removed from the `HANDSHAKE`. \r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\nPlain `id-nonce` allows for a sanity check on whether remote peer accounted `WHOAREYOU` packet (received and parsed it) before sending `HANDSHAKE` or not.\r\n\r\nOne may send the same packet twice (with some timeout) to trigger signature verification. First message is treated as random packet and initiates the handshake with egress `WHOAREYOU` message. The second message arrives disregarding the `WHOAREYOU` that was sent and is treated as `HANDSHAKE` and triggers signature verification.\r\n\r\nThe worse attack scenario could be played with help of relatively cheap [spoofed vps](https://www.clientvps.com/service/spoofed-vps). One may be constantly sending the same pair of messages from multiple identities in parallel (DDoS) causing multiple signature verifications at a time.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nAn optimal solution from @fjl that does not increase the size of the `HANDSHAKE`:\r\n\r\n> there is a good way to address this without increasing the handshake packet size even more: just replace the `src-id` with `id-nonce`.",
