  "body": "The encoding of [ENRs](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-868) is defined as RLP. However, ETH2 clients don't have the necessity to support RLP _per se_, and ETH1 don't need to support SSZ _per se_.\r\n\r\nWe appear to have a mismatch that either:\r\n\r\n1. Makes one side \"cave\" to the other.\r\n2. We migrate ENRs to a neutral third-party serialisation format with ample pre-existing support in all programming languages (e.g. Protobuf).\r\n\r\nAnother possible direction would entail making ENRs themselves encoding-agnostic, e.g. by prepending a [multicodec](https://github.com/multiformats/multicodec/).\r\n\r\nWhile in theory that would enable the ENR standard to cater for both ETH1 and ETH2 natural encodings, in practice it would end up segregating discovery networks -- which is an undesired effect, i.e. ETH1 nodes would ignore SSZ-encoded ENRs, and ETH2 nodes would ignore RLP-encoded ENRs.\r\n\r\nThoughts?",
