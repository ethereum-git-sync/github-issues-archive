  "body": "During the YOLOv2 breakout call, it was decided that the eth wire protocol doesn't fully define all objects that a particular version expect. For example, the transaction is defined as follows:\r\n\r\n> Transactions (0x02)\r\n> `[[nonce: P, receivingAddress: B_20, value: P, ...], ...]`\r\n\r\nIt would preferred for the specification to fully document objects such as this.
