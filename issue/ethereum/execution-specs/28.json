Some nodes MAY decide not to enable JSON RPC if the genesis block calculation has not been done yet |\r\n\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this issue is to collect consensus for the specifications as described; please respond with a comment or ✅; I will collect your responses and keep track of consensus between clients. For example:\r\n\r\nδ1) ✅\r\nδ2) ✅\r\nδ3) ✅\r\nδ4) ✅\r\nδ5) ✅\r\n",
