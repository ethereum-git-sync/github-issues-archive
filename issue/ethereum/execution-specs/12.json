  "body": "There was no dissent in moving EIP-2681 forward during ACD 101. The problem is, what does that mean? With the separation of EIPs and network upgrades, \"Final\" doesn't mean mainnet.\r\n\r\nTypically this isn't a major issue, because we can use the upgrade tracker and once its scheduled in an upgrade it is recorded during that transition. But EIP-2681 sets a limit on account nonces retroactively from genesis. My guess is that a modification should be made to the Yellow Paper as it is the most canonical spec for Ethereum?\r\n\r\ncc: @axic, @MadeofTin, @Souptacular",

    "body": "I suppose we can close this. I think this plays into the long term vision of moving to and eth2-like spec definition for ethereum. In that case, this question is trivial: just update the spec. Today, it is less trivial because \"Final\" on an EIP doesn't mean included on mainnet. But retroactive changes are confusing because they aren't included in a fork, so it's unclear how to signal that they are \"canonical\".",
