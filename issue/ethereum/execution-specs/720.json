  "body": "Hi!\r\n\r\nStarting in the Frontier specification, the `apply_body` function in the specification (`spec.py`)  keeps track of how much gas remains until the block's gas limit is hit by referencing the block gas limit in a variable called `gas_available` ([here](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs/blob/master/src/ethereum/frontier/spec.py#L393)) and then subtracting the gas consumed by each transaction in a loop ([here](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs/blob/master/src/ethereum/frontier/spec.py#L422)). At the end of the processing, the final amount of gas consumed in the block is calculated by taking the full gas limit of the block and subtracting `gas_available` from it ([here](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs/blob/master/src/ethereum/frontier/spec.py#L438)). Here's the line:\r\n```python\r\ngas_remaining = block_gas_limit - gas_available\r\n```\r\nJust looking though the logic shows that this is not the gas _remaining_, but rather the gas _spent_. This isn't a bug - the Yellow Paper (page 5, second column in [this](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf) copy) states that `gasUsed` is the parameter that should be returned:\r\n\r\n> gasUsed: A scalar value equal to the total gas used in transactions in this block; formally Hg.\r\n\r\nThis means the correct value is being returned, just that it is named something a bit misleading. A quick spot check of other forks makes it look like this naming convention persists across all forks.\r\n\r\nI would recommend renaming `gas_available` to `gas_used` in accordance with the variable's name in the Yellow Paper.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that this issue is neither about an incorrect specification nor incorrect documentation - the specification is returning the correct value, and this is about a naming convention in the code, as opposed to docstrings or docs; as such, a blank issue was used.\r\n\r\nI would happy to PR this if that would be more helpful.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
