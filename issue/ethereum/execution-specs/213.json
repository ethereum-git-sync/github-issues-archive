  "body": "The JSON RPC specification in this repository has different goals and requires different processes than the core protocol specification. I propose that we move it in a separate repository, similarly to how [eth2.0-specs](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/) and [eth2.0-apis](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-apis) are structured. \r\n\r\nThis repository would hence be only used to maintain the set of Core EIPs that each network upgrade consists of, the specification for devnets and potentially an executable version of the Yellowpaper/eth1 spec. \r\n\r\nMoving the JSON RPC spec to a separate repository would also allow us to have a better process to update the spec. As mentioned [here](https://github.com/ethereum/eth1.0-specs/pull/212#issuecomment-861128564) and [here](https://github.com/ethereum/eth1.0-specs/pull/212#issuecomment-861420062), we could move the JSON RPC spec to have branch-based releases.
