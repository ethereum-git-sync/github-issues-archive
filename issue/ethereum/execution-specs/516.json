    "body": "@SamWilsn @petertdavies I investigated this issue. \r\n\r\nSome tests in the following family of tests use ~3.6 GB of memory\r\n\r\n`stStaticCall/static_Return50000` (multiple tests)\r\n`stQuadraticComplexityTest/Return50000` (multiple tests)\r\n`stStaticCall/static_Call50000` (multiple tests)\r\n`stTimeConsuming/static_Call50000` (multiple tests)\r\n\r\nI guess the root cause for such high memory consumption is the fact `child_evm` creating opcodes like `staticcall` are recursively called 50000 times in these tests. Since we do not clean up the child_evm's until the very end of a these, these children start piling up in memory.\r\n\r\nOne solution would be to optimise the `collect_touched_accounts` function which uses these child evm's at the end. But we might end up with some very \"non-spec-like\" code.\r\n\r\nAn alternative (much simpler) solution would be to make Github Actions run on a single thread. Since accuracy is more important on CI than speed, I believe this is a valid trade-off. We can still run tests in parallel while running locally.\r\n\r\nAltough some of these \"high memory\" tests existed in Byzantium and Constantinople, many more have been added in Istanbul making it more likely that the workers crash after Istanbul. It might also start getting worse as we move towards `Berlin` and `London`",
