    "body": "@poojaranjan why do you find the board easier than looking at a markdown file? Personally I've found the opposite ðŸ˜… ! Also, I like the idea of having a separate `.md` file per network upgrade so we can better track parallel upgrades and their relative CFI lists. Not a super strong preference, though. \r\n\r\nWith regards to what fields are necessary, I think the following makes sense:\r\n\r\n* EIP Number & name (with link to EIP)\r\n* AllCoreDevs issue where it is proposed for inclusion in a specific upgrade\r\n* CFI Acceptance (with a link to, ideally, timestamped Youtube, but at least the ACD call agenda)\r\n\r\nI don't think we should track the devnets / testnets / etc. in the same file, though: if something is in the devnet spec, then it's in. This way, if we decide to not move something from one stage to the next, we just don't add it to the next devnet spec, but can leave it as CFI for this upgrade. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure we should track CFI \"proposed\" and \"rejected\" EIPs, but that's a weak preference. Happy to go back and look at the ones we rejected for London already if people think that's valuable. ",

    "body": "> why do you find the board easier than looking at a markdown file?\r\n\r\n@timbeiko For client devs and implementers, `.md` format is good. It is what a [Meta EIP](https://eips.ethereum.org/meta) for an upgrade used to be. \r\n\r\nHowever, the project board provides high-level information with more visibility for the less technical community. eg.[ Eth2 Phase 0 board](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-pm/projects/1).\r\n\r\nHaving said that, I suspect major changes in the process coming up with **the Merge**.
