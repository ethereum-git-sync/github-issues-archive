  "body": "From @pipermerriam:\r\n\r\nCurrently, the `trie` implementation uses a `bytes` type for the sequence of nibbles, with the stated validation rules that each byte may be no larger than 15.  This requirement doesn't appear to actually be enforced **and** it would be ideal if the type definitions actually constrained the inputs via the type system rather than runtime validation.\r\n\r\nI would suggest using an `enum.IntEnum` for this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass Nibble(enum.IntEnum):\r\n    NIBBLE_0 = 0x0\r\n    NIBBLE_1 = 0x1\r\n    ...\r\n    NIBBLE_F = 0xf\r\n\r\nNibbles = List[Nibble]\r\n```\r\n\r\nNot only will this give you strong guarantees on anything that needs to take a `Nibbles` type as an input, but it also lets you have runtime validation for free\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef bytes_to_nibbles(value: bytes) -> Nibbles:\r\n    return [Nibble(v) for v in value]  # will raise a TypeError if the value isn't part of the Enum)\r\n```",
