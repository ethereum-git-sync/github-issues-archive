  "body": "In tests, the individual block fields for a test are meant to be primarily for human readability. The testing framework should look to retrieve the blocks from `rlp` wherever applicable. Although the json fields are almost always going to be consistent with the `rlp`, some cases have been identified where this may not be the case. See [test](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/blob/7c1ffe6e35962e52124ef6dab627f10308155a29/BlockchainTests/GeneralStateTests/EIPTests/stEIP3860/create2InitCodeSizeLimit.json#L167) where the `withdrawals` are missing from the block.\r\n\r\nUpdate tests to use the `rlp` wherever available and use the json fields only where there is no `rlp`",
