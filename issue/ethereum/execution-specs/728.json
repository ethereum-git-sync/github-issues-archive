There are two methods for this - 1. using git clone 2. download raw fixtures (using the `download_fixtures` function)\r\n\r\nWhile the former checks out the appropriate version of the fixtures, the latter does not. The `download_fixtures` only checks if the fixtures folder is available. This could lead to issues if the fixture version has been changed or the downloaded fixtures have been corrupted in some way. \r\n\r\nAt the same time, it might not be optimal to download the fixtures everytime, even when the correct fixtures are already present from a previous run. Some middle ground has to be worked out here.",
