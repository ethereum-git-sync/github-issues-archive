After Spurious Dragon, the behaviour was changed to the current behaviour, but empty accounts created previously continue to exist unless they are subsequently \"touched\" (see [EIP-158](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-158)). A mass [state clearing](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa43ebd8939d8328f5858119a3fb65f65c864c6dd) took place using this feature.\r\n\r\nThe spec needs to represent this behaviour correctly.",
