    "body": "@SamWilsn, @petertdavies, @gurukamath , may I ask something related to EIP-2929 implementation in the spec?\r\n\r\nI'm looking at EIP-2929, in particular [this part](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2929#parameters):\r\n> In particular, if a scope reverts, the access lists should be in the state they were in before that scope was entered.\r\n\r\nLooking at the execution-specs repo, I can't find the logic for that. IMO, should be [around here](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs/blob/master/src/ethereum/shanghai/vm/interpreter.py#L233-L235). \r\nFrom what I see, the `begin_transaction(env.state)` is only making a copy of the state (for a potential reversion, which is fine), but doesn't seem to include the access lists... so `rollback_transaction(...)` isn't indirectly doing that.\r\n\r\nMay be possible this behavior changed in a further EIP that I don't know, but from what I quickly checked in geth, I think they do this mentioned revert through their statedb-journal tracking as part of snapshoting.\r\n\r\n(Note: if we confirm there's something actually missing, we can create another issue. But first I want to confirm if that's the case).\r\n\r\n",
