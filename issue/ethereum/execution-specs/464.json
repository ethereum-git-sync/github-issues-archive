  "body": "Currently, the `calculate_block_difficulty` has slightly different function signature across forks. \r\nFor example, in Frontier, the function accepts the `block number` as one of the inputs whereas in the later forks, the `parent block number` is taken as an input and the `block number` is derived from it.\r\n\r\nI couldn't quite see a reason why this has to be so. We can probably standardise this function across the forks and also implement the `difficulty tests` that are available in the fixtures.\r\n\r\n@SamWilsn Do let me know if this makes sense. I can take up the implementation part of it.",
