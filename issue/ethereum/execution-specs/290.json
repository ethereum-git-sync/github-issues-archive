At a minimum, this represents a consensus change and each version should be a major version.\r\n\r\nSo London would be 7.0.0 or something.\r\n\r\nIf there is a change that is not breaking, possibly a a new optional way to compress data between peers, that would be a 7.1.0 release on top of that.\r\n\r\nI'm not exactly sure how the decisions are made for choosing the next hardfork. But if EIPs are added one at a time and the trigger can be pulled any time, then yes I agree a new 7.0.0rc1 is appropriate each time.\r\n\r\nBut if inclusions EIPs are just discussions and there is actually only one decision to launch to testnet, then maybe only need to release an RC every time there is a deployment on testnet.",

    "body": "I kind of disagree with major versions here, given the already prevailing use of \"Ethereum 2.0\". IMO it would be a bit more appropriate for spec versions to be, say, 1.x.y, pre-merge and then after the merge start using 2.x.y. This _seems_ to be what [eth2.0-specs](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/releases/) is using. \r\n\r\nAs for choosing the next hard fork, the process is listed [here](https://github.com/ethereum/eth1.0-specs/tree/master/network-upgrades). If you assume a certain upgrade is represented by the middle digit (e.g. 1.1.y), then perhaps we can increment `y` each time a change is made to either include EIPs in a devnet, or to move them to the network upgrade spec, with at most one release every 2 weeks aside from emergencies.
