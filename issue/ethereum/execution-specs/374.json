We shouldn't implement tests until the specs support the non-legacy tests (where stuff is likely to be tested).\r\n\r\n- [ ] Check compliance with condition d) in EIP 161\r\n- [ ] If the modulus sent to the modexp precompile is zero, the return value is zero of the same length as the modulus. The \"same length\" condition is untested.\r\n- [ ] A block is invalid if it contains a transaction which the sender cannot afford.\r\n- [ ] The difficulty adjustment is not integration tested as part of a larger block. This caused a bug in a version of #465 to not get caught by the test suite.\r\n- [ ] Log ordering is not tested.\r\n- [ ] MSTORE8 with value 0x0 is not tested.\r\n- [ ] Returndata clearing is not tested in failure cases of `CREATE`/`CREATE2`",
