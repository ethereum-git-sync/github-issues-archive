What *is* mentioned in both of those specifications is a `yParity` field that sits in a similar place in the RLP structure, but it's definition doesn't match that of the `v` value defined in either legacy transactions or EIP-155 transactions.\r\n\r\nGlancing at the code here, it appears you are just putting `yParity` into a property called `v`, but this will lead to a great amount of confusion since it doesn't actually match the definition of `v` anywhere (neither in the yellow paper nor in any EIP).\r\n\r\nHopefully the fix for this is as simple as a rename, but I'm not confident enough in Python being able to do rename refactoring to want to attempt a PR myself.",
