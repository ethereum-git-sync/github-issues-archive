    "body": "@SamWilsn the RFC style guide accepts both American and British spelling, as long as it's consistent within the document. It gives the edge to American spelling for clusters of documents with different spellings (see [3.1](https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-flanagan-7322bis-02.html#rfc.section.3.1) in the style guide). For that reason, I think we should go with the American spelling",
