  "body": "## Summary\r\n\r\nAdd a method, tentatively called `eth_baseFeePerGas`, to get the base fee of the next block.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nThe base fee of a block can be computed using some values from the previous block, like its base fee and the amount of gas used. The formula to do this isn't that involved so, in principle, clients could do it without the need to ask the node. But:\r\n\r\n- While the formula is simple, it's not trivial. It also involves integer math that clients could get wrong.\r\n- The formula involves some values like `ELASTICITY_MULTIPLIER` and `BASE_FEE_MAX_CHANGE_DENOMINATOR` that could change in the future (or even become dynamic values?)\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nI'm not sure about the name of the method. `eth_baseFeePerGas` seems good enough, and consistent with existing methods, but it could be misleading. One alternative is `eth_nextBaseFeePerGas` or `eth_nextBlockBaseFeePerGas`.\r\n\r\nI don't think this method should receive any params.\r\n\r\nThe return value would be just an `Integer`.",
