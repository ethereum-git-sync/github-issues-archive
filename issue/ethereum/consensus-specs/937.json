  "body": "The `Validator` object does not need to store `withdrawal_credentials`. Instead, we can have a stateless approach where withdrawal operations include a Merkle proof to a historical deposit via `historical_roots`. To make this safe we can check that `deposit.data.withdrawal_credentials == ZERO_HASH` for deposits to existing validators.\r\n\r\nThe general heuristic is that consensus storage is much more expensive than consensus bandwidth. This is especially true for `withdrawal_credentials` which is read exactly once. In the worst case we can save over 100MB from the beacon state.",
