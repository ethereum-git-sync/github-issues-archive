In addition to the above \"substantive freeze\" we abstain from disruptive cosmetic changes (e.g. significant renamings and refactors in `specs/core/0_beacon-chain.md`).\r\n\r\nSubstantive post-freeze changes will at minimum include:\r\n\r\n* Fixes to non-critical bugs found during the freeze\r\n* Change to BLS logic to comply with blockchain standards",
