  "body": "Potentially a case that could be a reftest:\r\n\r\n - network config has 16k validators\r\n - validator minimum is 5k (or importantly anything less than the bound for withdrawals scan)\r\n\r\nWhen the scan for withdrawals happens, the limit is actually a min of the length of validators vs. the sweep length, and importantly, the ending validator key is going to determine if there's a chain split (if a client stops once its scanned the list once, and only increments by that length, their next withdrawal index will be too low)\r\n\r\nIf there's less than a set of withdrawals, this gets fun, because your next validator key will be still incremented by the sweep length...\r\n\r\nSo (0 + 16k) % 5k = 1000 as next_withdrawal_validator_index...\r\n\r\nThis is covered in the spec, code, but it'd probably be nice to capture that case as a test.",
