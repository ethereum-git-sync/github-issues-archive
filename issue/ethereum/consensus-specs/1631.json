    "body": "@rauljordan Thanks for the answer. It seems like you are an optimist :-). I still think the protocol would be improved if we incentivized people to run slashers, so we don't rely on goodwill and have more than a single point of failure. Also because of the lack of incentive there is not much interest in running slashers, and as a result not many implementations (for example Teku doesn't have one). \r\nHonestly, I don't see the benefit of not rewarding the slasher slightly (1/8th of the slashing amount). The code simplification mentioned seems irrelevant.",
