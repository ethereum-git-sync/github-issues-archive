  "body": "              This actually has a strange side effect --- the shuffling for an epoch is no longer fixed at the start of the epoch as a slashing could remove a validator from a previously selected slot and *replace* them with someone else.\r\n\r\nThis isn't a deal breaker but likely breaks engineering invariants. We need to discuss with engineers and make sure to have specific tests for this (i.e. predict the epoch's shuffling, then move a coupel of blocks forward with a slashing for the next slot proposer, then show that the proposer changes)\r\n\r\nEDIT: this is directionally the test -- `test_slashed_validator_is_not_proposing_block` -- but I'd want it to be a multi-block test to ensure some epoch proposer shuffling cache doesn't become an issue. That is, have a block that does the transition into the epoch, have a block that adds the slashing, then have the block of the next slot that has the *changed* proposer\r\n\r\nThis might also likely have interactions with VC proposer duties API which might expect epoch stability. It might actulaly ripple into  a bunch of small things like that\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @djrtwo in \r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/consensus-\r\nfeesspecs/pull/3371#discussion_r1212357111_\r\n            I paid the fees on bitpay n I have transaction numbete n I have blockchain receipts for the transaction",
