    "body": "Hi guys,\r\n\r\n\r\nI am not sure about what I am saying, don't hesitate to confirm or not. In the inactivity period, validators that don't validate attestation see their score increasing. And it decreases if they did their job. What if a validator said he wants to exit during the inactivity period (or just before); it means the validator is still active for some epoch, but don't validate; so its score increase. He exits some epochs later, during the inactivity period (or not) and its score won't change (!=0). Since the score decrease only for eligible validators, the score for an exited validator different from 0 will be kept as is until he comes back as active. \r\n\r\n\r\nMy question is, **will the inactivity score be reset to 0 for the validator that is going to get the index of the validator that lived with a score != 0 when he registers ?**\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks guys !",
