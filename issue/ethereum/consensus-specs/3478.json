  "body": "Ages ago (in 2019 https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/1320), a huge refactoring introduced suite names.\r\n\r\nAt the time the BLS test suites were tagged with `suite_name='small'`, unfortunately I do not remember the origin of the name (cc @protolambda  and @asanso) as the full suite did not exist at the time (https://github.com/ethereum/bls12-381-tests).\r\n\r\nIIRC it was a minimal set of tests that implementations should pass for interop, was agnostic to minimal/mainnet and included SSZ tests as well but I may very well completely misremember.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/8a64a90103ccaa8f5df7aa271af770f811738529/tests/generators/bls/main.py#L514-L525\r\n\r\nThe KZG-4844 suite reuses the name `small` which AFAIK doesn't mean anything anymore in today's codebase.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/8a64a90103ccaa8f5df7aa271af770f811738529/tests/generators/kzg_4844/main.py#L522-L533\r\n\r\nThis is prone to confusion with the KZG minimal trusted setup as well.\r\n\r\nI propose to change:\r\n- bls 'small' to just 'bls' or 'crypto-bls'\r\n- KZG 'small\" to 'kzg-mainnet' or 'kzg-minimal' (depending on the trusted setup.",
