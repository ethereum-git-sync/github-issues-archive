If there will be a need in a new e.g. `hash128` type then implementers will have to update their code that runs `hash` type validation or use `bytes` type as a workaround.",

Whatever `N` would be reasonable to use. Each of those types is a static length type.\r\n\r\nCurrently, spec describes only three `hash32/96/97` and validation is strictly tight to those three.
