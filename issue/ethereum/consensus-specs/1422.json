Since the signature and pubkey are 96 and 48 bytes respectively, only declarable with `bytes[...]`\r\n\r\n- `bytes32` is a special vyper type, see https://vyper.readthedocs.io/en/v0.1.0-beta.13/types.html#bit-wide-byte-array\r\n- `bytes[WITHDRAWAL_CREDENTIALS_LENGTH]` may not be consistent with a `bytes32`, but seems more consistent with the other parameters. Also, it is more readable in my opinion.\r\n\r\nRE changing the `bytes32`: I think it's worth it to keep the final parameter `bytes32`, as it's a widely used type, always 32 bytes as a root, and clean to convert to an uint256 or `bytes[X]` where needed.\r\n\r\n@hwwhww Do you have an opinion here?\r\n\r\n",
