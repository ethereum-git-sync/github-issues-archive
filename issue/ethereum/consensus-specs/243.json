Something like\r\n```\r\nthis_epoch_boundary_attesting_balance = sum([get_effective_balance(v) for v in this_epoch_boundary_attesters])\r\nprevious_epoch_boundary_attesting_balance = state.latest_attesting_balance\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n# At the end of epoch transition\r\nstate.latest_attesting_balance = this_epoch_boundary_attesting_balance\r\n```",
