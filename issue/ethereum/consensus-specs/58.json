This means that the 0th block in the chain might be a block from any slot _at or after_ the slot at `GENESIS_TIME`.\r\n\r\nAlthough this is not a \"genesis block\" in the sense that it is entirely predefined, it does need some exceptions to be properly handled in the current framework\r\n\r\n- the 0th block will have no parent so the entirety of `ancestor_hashes` will be `0x00`\r\n- If `ancestor_hashes[0] == 0x00` then there is no parent. In this case, do not allow any attestations to be included in the block and do not impose the parent proposer attestation requirement on the block.\r\n- There is no parent so `get_new_recent_block_hashes` does not have the appropriate params and should be called with `get_new_recent_block_hashes(old_block_hashes, -1, current_slot, 0x00)`\r\n- `update_ancestor_hashes` should not be called\r\n\r\nThere might be a couple of other things. Just dumping this here and will make a more detailed PR soon.",

I think we will just have the first block in the chain be an exceptional block that doesn't have a parent and is proposed by whatever proposer shows up at their assigned slot.
