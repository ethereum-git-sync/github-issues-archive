  "body": "**Motivation**\r\n\r\nDue to cryptography being closely tied to mathematics, there is sometimes a tendency to use one word variables like `z`, `x`, `y` for conciseness. In and of itself, its not a bad thing, however since code being written usually copies this verbatim, it makes the code harder to read and maintain.\r\n\r\n**Suggestion**\r\n\r\nRemove one word variables from the public API of cryptography modules. ie anywhere a non-cryptographer needs to read the code, there should be descriptive words to describe the meaning of arguments.\r\n\r\n**Reference**\r\n\r\nExample of this is `z` and `y` used [here](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/a45627164d34ddb60acca385e2324835fc14ca5c/specs/eip4844/polynomial-commitments.md#verify_kzg_proof) which propagates to the precompile",
