  "body": "`to_little_endian_64` [states here](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/deposit_contract/contracts/validator_registration.vy#L34) that it's inputs always fit 64-bits. To me it seems this is technically not true, albeit very unlikely to every be exploited.\r\n\r\nThis helper is used for two values: `deposit_count` and `deposit_amount`. There is an assertion for `deposit_count < 2^32-1`, however none for `deposit_amount`.\r\n\r\nThe only way to overflow `deposit_amount` is by sending a transaction with value larger than `2^64-1 * 10^9` (in wei), which is unrealistic, but given the contract already has a couple of assertions, probably the cost of an additional one wouldn't be a problem.\r\n\r\nIs this just a) missed; b) intentionally like this; c) or I have messed up something?",

    "body": "Since the amount passed to the `to_little_endian_64` function is in Gwei,  2^64 means ~18 billion (~ 10^10) Ether, which is greater than the current supply ~110 million Ether.   \r\n\r\nWe discussed this during audit/formal verification and let it pass due to the infeasibility in mainnet conditions.\r\n\r\nThere used to be a `assert deposit_amount <= MAX_DEPOSIT_AMOUNT` but this was removed in favor of allowing deposits higher than `MAX_DEPOSIT_AMOUNT` (32 ETH) as an acceptable input (the user can just top-up balance even if this bound was in place).\r\n\r\nFortunately, even in the case that the depositor does deposit `>= 2^64` ETH, `to_little_endian_64(deposit_amount)` will return (the little endian representation of)  `deposit_amount mod 2^64`.  So, the depositor will lose funds rather than minting funds.\r\n\r\nI'm not opposed to adding an `assert deposit_amount < 2^64` but also don't necessarily want to disturb the FV unless we open it up for other reasons.",
