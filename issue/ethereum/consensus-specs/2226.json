    "body": "Currently some clients drop attestations that are received before the block to which they are attesting. This raises a bug in which large stakers performing as per the specs propose a block and immediately attest to it (it may be with different validating keys and on different committees). If all the aggregators in the committee are from these clients, the attestation is likely to be missing. There is currently an open issue on lighthouse for example here https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/issues/635\r\n\r\nThe suggestion here might increase the likelihood of this bug occurring until this issue is resolved in lighthouse (and possibly also nimbus)",
