A block at time T would commit to the crosslink committee at time T + 4 epochs, and to the persistent committee at time T + 9 days, so you can just hop forward through the \"use a Merkle path from a block to determine the public keys for a future block, verify the signature of the future block, repeat\" technique. This is good news because it really reduces the complexity of a light client; we're talking about ~200 kb per ~9 days in the worst case, and there's ways to improve on those numbers.",

In particular, it was only safe to mix in active_index_roots because it can only change on slower timescales than RANDAO. If someone in some protocol version/iteration/fork decides that some action concerning validators should take immediate effect, it could compromise RANDAO.",
