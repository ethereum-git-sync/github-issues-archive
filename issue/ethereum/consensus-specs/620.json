  "body": "### tl;dr\r\n\r\n> The problem is that if `state.validator_balances` has been updated since `previous_epoch` (which i imagine it has), then we are now using the wrong balance.  Surely, the intention was to use a snapshot of validator_balances from previous_epoch, right?\r\n\r\nAt the time this issue was created, the [latest version of the spec](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/fd5c3ee8b5c11c1b65d37c95ccc98027a333ae6f/specs/core/0_beacon-chain.md) defined `previous_total_balance` like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef get_effective_balance(state: State, index: ValidatorIndex) -> Gwei:\r\n    return min(state.validator_balances[index], MAX_DEPOSIT_AMOUNT)\r\n\r\ndef get_total_balance(state: BeaconState, validators: List[ValidatorIndex]) -> Gwei:\r\n    return sum([get_effective_balance(state, i) for i in validators])\r\n\r\nprevious_total_balance = get_total_balance(state, get_active_validator_indices(state.validator_registry, previous_epoch))\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn other words, the `previous_total_balance` is calculated by passing the `active_validator_indices` from the `previous_epoch`.  These indices are used to return the `state.validator_balances[index]` for each active validator from the `previous_epoch`.",

    "body": "You are correct in that the balances from the previous epoch can be marginally affected by the next epoch and can have minor effects on safety margins. This is noted in the spec via the following:\r\n\r\n> Note: previous_total_balance and previous_epoch_boundary_attesting_balance balance might be marginally different than the actual balances during previous epoch transition. Due to the tight bound on validator churn each epoch and small per-epoch rewards/penalties, the potential balance difference is very low and only marginally affects consensus safety.\r\n\r\nWe could keep the current and previous balances at the cost of having two balance arrays, but at a cost of hashing/state size",
