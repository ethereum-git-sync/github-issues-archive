  "body": "While refactoring Lighthouse's op pool I noticed something slightly surprising about fork versions.\r\n\r\nThe `Fork` object contains three fields:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass Fork(Container):\r\n    previous_version: Version\r\n    current_version: Version\r\n    epoch: Epoch  # Epoch of latest fork\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd `get_domain` uses its `epoch` argument (if provided) to select between the two `Version`s:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef get_domain(state: BeaconState, domain_type: DomainType, epoch: Epoch=None) -> Domain:\r\n    epoch = get_current_epoch(state) if epoch is None else epoch\r\n    fork_version = state.fork.previous_version if epoch < state.fork.epoch else state.fork.current_version\r\n    return compute_domain(domain_type, fork_version, state.genesis_validators_root)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis seems problematic in that if there have been 2+ fork version changes on the same chain (as could happen with multiple hard forks), `get_domain` will incorrectly use `state.fork.previous_version` to determine the domain of all messages prior to the most recent fork, even if those messages were signed against a different fork version. This would mean that double block proposals and double attestation votes from before the 2nd latest fork would not be slashable.\r\n\r\nI haven't been able to think of a concrete attack that exploits this property, but it's late on a Friday and I might come back to it. It seems like the slashing conditions applying to the current and previous forks correctly prevent an attacker from constructing a new finalized chain with a long-range attack, but maybe there's some wiggle room if the main chain is weak in the period before the 2nd latest fork.\r\n\r\nIs this a known property of the spec?",
