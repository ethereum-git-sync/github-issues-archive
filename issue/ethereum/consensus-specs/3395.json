Eventually I had to run https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/issues/3304 to deal with a Py03 module error. \r\n\r\nThis made me wonder if dockerizing the spec tests could make them easier to interact with. Each version could be a container that you pull and run locally, which would have a specific python version and the respective packages that we know work. Just an idea, but if there is value here I would be happy to explore :-)",
