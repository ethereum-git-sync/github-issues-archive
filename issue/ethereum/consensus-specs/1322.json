I'd imagine we want to include these penalties otherwise there is an implicit floor on the amount of slashings needed before any collective penalty kicks in.\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "The actual expression is:\r\n\r\n```\r\npenalty_numerator = validator.effective_balance // increment * min(sum(state.slashings) * 3, total_balance)\r\n```\r\n\r\n`validator.effective_balance // increment` equals 32, and it gets multiplied by `min(sum(state.slashings) * 3, total_balance)` before being divided by the total balance. So it seems like the penalty would be zero when the total slashings are under 1/96 of the total balance, though note that there's still a 1 ETH base penalty that slashed validators would have to pay in this context.\r\n\r\nSo I actually think it's fine as is, all it means is that penalties are rounded down to the next whole ETH, but if we want we could decrease `increment` from 1 ETH to 0.01 ETH to get more accuracy.",
