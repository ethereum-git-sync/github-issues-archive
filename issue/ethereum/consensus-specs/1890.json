If slot duration drops to 8 seconds, hour and year would have their epoch count doubled (and become ~68 minutes and ~388 days, respectively) and the other units would keep their current epoch count (ethereum day ~= 18.2 Earth hours, ethereum week ~= 6.1 Earth days, ethereum month ~= 24 Earth days).",

However, if it's 500 or 5000 epochs, you have to think every time how long that is. It is a day, a week, or a year?\r\nFor many minor technical points, that might not matter. For example, how long is a custody period? That isn't too relevant to the typical staker. However, for example for challenge periods, it suddenly really matters in human terms, because as a staking operator, I really want to make sure I can never be offline for longer than that period. It thus helps having terms that make this clear, and at least to me, being able to talk about an \"Ethereum week\" or \"Ethereum quarter\" does that much better than \"2^11 epochs\".",
