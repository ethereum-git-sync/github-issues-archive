We can avoid the O(n) operation by just summing the two lengths of each individual list.\r\n\r\nI'll admit this is a fairly minor issue and if there isn't enough support we can just close this issue :) I would imagine this won't be an issue, even as we use this code in the executable spec or testing.\r\n\r\nIf we want to take this optimization now (e.g. we could also wait until official spec freeze and then make a quick pass on this type of stuff), then I'm happy to make a PR.",
