(The balances of active validators change every epoch, whereas the rest of the registry changes infrequently.)\r\n- [x] 2. <s>**Historical justification bitfield**</s>: Merge `previous_justified_slot`, `justified_slot`, `justification_bitfield` and `finalized_slot` into a bitfield that grows by one bit every epoch. (Cleaner, more flexible.)\r\n- [x] 3. **Latest RANDAO mixes**: See https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/issues/295.\r\n- [x] 4. **Placeholders**: Add placeholders for proofs of custody and VDFs. See #145 and https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/commit/c8efdc743133d0af1a34159ad5a47e1178293c3e.\r\n- [x] 5. **<s>Light-client friendly shuffles</s>**: See #323. Decision: Rework the shuffle function to be more local and put a notice explaining that the shuffle function may change.\r\n- [x] 6. **Delayed exits**: Add a new constant `MAX_SEED_LOOKAHEAD` (complementing `MIN_SEED_LOOKAHEAD`) and keep forced ejections in the validator registry at least `MAX_SEED_LOOKAHEAD` for the purposes of shuffling. This addresses a shuffle grinding vulnerability with forced ejections. See https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/pull/350.\r\n- [x] 7. **Timestamped activations and exits**: Allows to compute the validator registry in the past, and remove `shard_committees_at_slots` and `persistent_committee_reassignments`.\r\n- [x] 8. **More granular partial slashing**: Update `latest_penalized_exit_balances` on an epoch-by-epoch basis and flush old values.\r\n- [x] 9. **Fair partial slashing**: Compute partial slashing a fixed amount of time after an exit.\r\n- [x] 10. **Remove registry delta chain**: Remove `validator_registry_delta_chain_tip` in favour of `batched_block_roots`. (Can be removed when adding #403 functionality)",

    "body": "For (2) I don't think it's nearly that simple. `state.finalized_slot` being updated depends not just on the pattern of justified slots but also on what the `state.previous_justified_slot` was at the time it was updated. So I don't think we can get rid of `finalized_slot`. We also need `state.previous_justified_slot` and `state.justified_slot` to remember what was the `source` that messages were supposed to be using in the previous two epochs, and that's not something that can necessarily be figured out from a justification bitfield because the justification bitfield might change but the justification sources should not change.",
