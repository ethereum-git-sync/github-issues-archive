This is currently only about ~13 hours which requires liveness wrt justification in this period for the chain to continue to function. Oh no!\r\n\r\n## proposed solution\r\n\r\nAdd `previous_justified_root` and `current_justified_root` directly to state to eliminate this lookup to a potentially unavailable slot.\r\n\r\n(Thanks @arnetheduck for running your non-justifying chain for 8192 slots!)",
