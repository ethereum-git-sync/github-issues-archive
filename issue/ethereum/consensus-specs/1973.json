  "body": "### Issue\r\nJust found that some BLS-enabled tests are broken. (The CI is running with `--disable-bls` flag) Some issues showed up after I enabled BLS.\r\n\r\n####  \r\n(Leftover of #1937) Since `ShardTransition.shard_data_roots` is gerenated with `get_block_data_merkle_root`, `ShardBlockHeader.body_root` should also be generated with `get_block_data_merkle_root`. Therefore, the signing roots of `DOMAIN_SHARD_PROPOSAL` should be generated with the header includes this shard block body root.\r\n\r\n#1975 shows where we should use `ShardBlockHeader` to generate `signing_root`\r\n\r\nNote that it would make  **`hash_tree_root(shard_block.message) != hash_tree_root(shard_block_header)`**. If it is correct to do in this way, the question is: should we use `hash_tree_root(shard_block.message)` or `hash_tree_root(shard_block_header)` as **the shard block root**?\r\n\r\nShard block root is used as an identifier in many places. We may want to avoid having such a special case in the protocol. I wonder if there is a better solution to fix this trap. ðŸ¤” \r\n\r\n\r\n/cc @djrtwo @dankrad \r\n",
