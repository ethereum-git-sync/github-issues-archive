  "body": "The blob spam mechanism, as defined by https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/3244, opens up the possibility for a block producer to poison the seen cache of parts of the network and thus disrupting block propagation by introducing invalid blobs to *some* peers.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is likely that such block proposers will lose their block, the network will nonetheless have to do additional work by trying to recover the blobs and blocks from participants using high-latency messaging (`ByRoot` requests since gossip gets disabled).\r\n\r\nPotential control mechanisms include:\r\n\r\n* deprioritising blocks from proposers that spammed the network (in the spirit of proposer boost)\r\n* clearing seen cache when blob is determined to be invalid post-gossip-validation, thus allowing other blobs for the same block/index to propagate\r\n* introducing new slashing conditions\r\n* <your idea here>\r\n\r\nPrevious discussion:\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/3244#discussion_r1099159802\r\n* https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/3244#discussion_r1109155634\r\n* https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/3244#discussion_r1109157763\r\n\r\n",
