Further, we can put `amount` inside `DepositInput` because (unlike `timestamp`) it is known ahead of time and can be signed over by the `proof_of_possession`.\r\n\r\nThis would allow us to reduce to two objects for deposits: `Deposit` and `DepositInput`. (We could then rename `DepositInput` to `DepositData` for consistency.)",

Hooray for simplification.\r\n\r\n> We already discussed removing timestamp.\r\n\r\nTo clarify to those who weren't in the call, the original justification for timestamp was to put a time limit on deposit inclusion so that deposit receipts cannot be \"double-spent\". However, this is no longer necessary because we are forcing eth1 deposits to be processed in order.",
