  "body": "A rational validator may bypass the churn queue by voluntarily slashing himself if he's in a hurry to get his money. Because of partial slashing the validator only loses 1/32nd of its balance at stake in the best case.\r\n\r\nShould we replace `exit_validator` by `initiate_validator_exit` in `slash_validator` to avoid this queue bypass? This would also be a cleaner way of handling #785 and would simplify the validator state machine since all exits (voluntary exits, ejections, slashings) would go through the same exit pipeline stages.",
