It turns out that it is not required there because `state.previous_epoch_attestations` and `state.current_epoch_attestations` are already ordered by `inclusion_slot`.\r\n* To compute inclusion delay for incentivisation. This is not required because incentivisation can be done on a per-block basis with `process_proposer_attestation_rewards`.\r\n* In `process_proposer_attestation_rewards`. It's not required there because filtering by `inclusion_slot` is already done by looking at `block.body.attestations`.\r\n\r\nI think we can remove `inclusion_slot` from `PendingAttestation` (in addition to `custody_bitfield`â€”see #955).",
