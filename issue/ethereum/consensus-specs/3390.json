An alternative solution is just to add a comment about it. Given that optimistic sync is not part of the executable pyspec so it's okay.\r\n\r\nI prefer (1) here because it's more future-proof.\r\n\r\n/cc @paulhauner What do you think?\r\n",

    "body": "Although, the execution is always enabled for forks post-Bellatrix, and I can understand why we'd want to change the spec, i am curious when this situation occurs on practice? If EL returns `SYNCING` in response to the first block which is a child of a genesis block it must be something weird in EL clients setup or an edge case. There can be an edge case when genesis block has several children. In this case some ELs can response `ACCEPTED` when they receive non-canonical child of a genesis block and if CL switches to such a block after that it should apply it optimistically and a node can get stuck at this point if it's not allowed to switch to an optimistic mode.\r\n\r\nAlternative fix is to return `True` when the parent is genesis *and* current block has execution payload, i.e.\r\n```python\r\nif block.slot == GENESIS_SLOT + 1 and is_execution_block(block):\r\n    return True\r\n```",
