  "body": "Currently the Altair reference tests include generating genesis states which expect the sync committees to be filled with all zero public keys.  That means for the first two sync committee periods, there are no real validators in the sync committees and clients have to have special case handling to deal with public keys in the committees that don't match a known validator.\r\n\r\nWhile MainNet won't need to generate a genesis in Altair, future testnets likely will and being able to do so makes testing significantly easier.  It would be good to update the genesis generation process for Altair to calculate the current and next sync committees properly using the same approach as in the transition process.",
