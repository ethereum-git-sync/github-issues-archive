  "body": "Not every active validator may have an included attestation in the previous epoch (unlikely, but possible and enactable).\r\n\r\nNow if the rewards are calculated, the proposer is awarded, based on inclusion distance to all active validators. There is no known distance however for such an active (as in activated) but inactive (as in not attesting in previous epoch) validator.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n\r\nfor index in get_active_validator_indices(state.validator_registry, get_previous_epoch(state)):\r\n    ...\r\n    proposer_index = get_beacon_proposer_index(state, inclusion_slot(state, index))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should be checking if there was any such attestation, and only then get the proposer index based on the inclusion slot.\r\n\r\nIf you don't have attestations for an active validator, the chain gets stuck because of an error. Should be an easy fix however.\r\n\r\n",
