    "body": "It's the `Version=Version()` piece in the signature of `compute_domain()` that looks odd, because it suggests that `Version()` is a function that can be called rather than the default value for the type.\r\n\r\nFrom what you say above it sounds like the signature should be this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef compute_domain(domain_type: DomainType, fork_version: Version) -> Domain:\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich is without a default value and hence falls back to `0x00000000`; would you agree?  Or are there situations in which the fork number at genesis can be something other than 0?  Test nets, third-party forks, _etc_?  In which case it seems that a `Version()` function makes sense and returns the fork number at genesis (but would then need to be defined).",
