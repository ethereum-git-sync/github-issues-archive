  "body": "How will a beacon node's conformance to the networking spec impact a light client's and other non beacon node's ability to join the network? \r\n Specific questions/concerns:\r\n- beacon_block topic:\r\n  - how can a non beacon node join this topic AND not risk being disconnected if it can't currently perform the block validation?  Options:\r\n      - don't fwd blocks ðŸ¤·\r\n      - zk proofs?\r\n      - allow non beacon nodes to fwd without validating\r\n- req/resp:\r\n    - should beacon nodes drop nodes that do not implement all req/resp messages?  If so, this will impact a non beacon node's ability to participate. \r\n\r\nIn general all MUSTs should be reviewed through the lense of non beacon nodes.  If it is decided that the phase 0 network will not be non beacon node friendly, then we should consider how that will impact network tooling efforts.",
