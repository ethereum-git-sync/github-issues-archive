Setting it explicitly to `null` would simplify knowing if the fork is enabled or not without any additional context (that `u64::max()` denotes disabled). \r\n",

    "body": "Thanks Pawan. I was going to advocate for this too, because it differentiates between:\r\n\r\n1. The fork epoch has been set for this network, and it is `N`, and\r\n2. The fork epoch has not been decided for this network, but may be set to some value `N` in future\r\n\r\nLighthouse has been representing fork epochs as `Option<Epoch>` since we started working on Altair, so our `None`/`null` value was used to represent case (2). We were incorrectly treating `2**64 - 1` as case (1), i.e. a concrete epoch at which the fork would eventually activate. We're going to move to mapping `2**64 - 1` to `None` on (de)serialisation, which is probably what we should have done from the start. I think this should be backwards-compatible for us, and avoids changing the spec. The only thing I can imagine might be affected is the `/config/fork_schedule` endpoint, which will filter out the forks that aren't scheduled rather than returning them with `u64::max`.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: I think this issue can be closed.",
