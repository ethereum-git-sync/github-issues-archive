    "body": "hi @hwwhww \r\nI mean that in `compute_domain` if `fork_data_root` is `0x123456` (shortening length for simplicity) and `domain_type` is `0x0000` then the `domain` will be `0x000012` by appending `domain_type` to the front in hex. I believe this is what actually happens on-chain?\r\n \r\nHowever in little-endian format `fork_data_root` is `[0x56, 0x34, 0x12]` and `domain_type` is `[0, 0]` so the command `domain_type + fork_data_root[:-2]` will give `[0, 0, 0x56]` in little-endian format, which translates to `0x560000` in hex.

If `domain_type` is `[0, 0]` then when you convert the bytes to an integer in little endian this has the effect of multiplying by `2 ** 16`. \r\n\r\nHowever I think the effect that actually happens on-chain is to \"do nothing\".
