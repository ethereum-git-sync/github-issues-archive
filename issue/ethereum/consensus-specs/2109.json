We should have technical guidance on how to set up a validator. This should include a best-practice NTP setup. The best practice NTP setup should include a rule that the local time can never be changed by more than a very small number of seconds due to an NTP update. In practice, RTCs are quite good at keeping time over hours or days, so it may well be a good idea to make this threshold less than block time, say 3 seconds.\r\n2. Some hardware may not be able to keep RTC over restarts/power cycles. Also some users might run on an incorrect setup. Add a rule to the validator guide (?) that specifies that by default, a VC node should refuse to run if the latest database entry is older than 6h, indicating a long offline time *or* an attack via a time jump. To override this, the user has to give a command line parameter indicating the current time (so that overriding will not become the default). ",
