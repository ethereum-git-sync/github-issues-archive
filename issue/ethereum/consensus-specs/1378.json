  "body": "Dmitry Khovratovich has completed the audit of our proof of custody construction. The highlights are:\r\n\r\n- He improved the previous best algorithm for key recovery from the Legendre PRF to O(sqrt(p) log p) from O(p log p) previously. He published a paper about it [here](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/862.pdf). This is a nice improvement on the previous algorithms but not very worrying for us as his attack is only very effective for a very large number (O(sqrt(p))) of queries, whereas we expose a tiny number. For a smaller number of queries M, the time complexity resolves to O(p log M/M).\r\n - He found several problems that make the proof of custody independent from the validator keys by carefully crafting the blocks. This is indeed a problem of the construction I originally suggested, but he suggested a very nice remedy in the form of a polynomial Universal Hash Function that provably fixes this problem and stays very close to the current framework\r\n\r\nAudit report:[Legendre (7).pdf](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/files/3537084/Legendre.7.pdf)\r\nSuggested updated construction: [legendre_proof_of_custody_uhf.pdf](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/files/3551615/legendre_proof_of_custody_uhf.pdf)\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso: At Crypto'19, we announced some bounties for breaking the Legendre PRF that can be found here: https://legendreprf.org/bounties ",
