  "body": "Each configuration file has a duplicate `CONFIG_NAME` that can only result in conflicting values, and it makes it more difficult to consolidate the config files.\r\n\r\nDiscussion (@michaelsproul, @mcdee, @rolfyone): https://discord.com/channels/595666850260713488/710831784991916072/823906028600033351\r\n\r\n> there's this weird exception right now, the `CONFIG_NAME` variable is duplicated between all configs (and might be different for unknown reasons)\r\n\r\n> Why does CONFIG_NAME need to be in altair.yml?\r\n\r\n> Legacy choice, I think it can be removed. My intention was always to have unique variables, simple key-value, yaml compatible, and ability to consolidate into a single namespace easily (for compatibility with env vars)\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nI think it's valuable to not have duplicate variables, and avoid dependency on them before we introduce a stable version of the first fork (Altair). In the future we may consolidate the files into a single YAML, and client implementers may do this in their internal config representation already.\r\n",

    "body": "Right, so the `spec.CONFIG_NAME` is for making `with_configs` work. I think it's good to keep the current separate per-fork-per-config files so that we can compare them with the specs easily.\r\n\r\nA simple solution here, similar to ToC generation:\r\n1. Add makefile command `make merge_config` to create merged config files: `configs/merged/<SPEC_CODE_NAME>_<CONFIG_NAME>.yaml`.\r\n    - `phase0_mainnet.yaml`, `altair_mainnet.yaml`, `phase0_minimal.yaml`, `altair_minimal.yaml`.\r\n    - Each merged config contains the previous forks' config + current fork config.\r\n    - The merged file doesn't contain `CONFIG_NAME` field, but it checks if there are any conflicts (except for ` CONFIG_NAME`) between the atomic config files when calling the makefile command.\r\n2. Add a CI job to check if the merged config files are correct.\r\n3. Output these merged config files to test vector suite output files.\r\n",
