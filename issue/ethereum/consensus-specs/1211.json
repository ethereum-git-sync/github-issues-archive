  "body": "1. [x] 1. Consider removing the `List[ShardAttestation]` structure in a shard block header, replace with a single shard attestation (rationale: these votes are not used for finalization and the penalties for missing votes are light, so it's okay if more votes \"fall by the wayside\"; this increases simplicity and makes the shard attestation constant-sized)\r\n    * PR #1294\r\n2. [x] 2. Figure out persistent committee structure (per-slot committee size, how far attesters are expected to check availability/validity, are there penalties...)\r\n    * #1293 discussion, leaning to the simplest option\r\n3. [x] 3. Fix shard block size\r\n    * 16 kb target, 64 kb max\r\n4. [x] 4. Fix crosslink data function, deal with contiguous zero byte segments (see discussion at https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/issues/1194), also consider alternatives to directly putting SSZ serialized header into crosslink data (maybe express the header as chunks in the same order they would be in an SSZ partial?)\r\n    * PR #1278 PR\r\n5. [ ] 5. Determine if top-level EE transaction format influences shard data structure; if so implement any related required changes\r\n    * Instinct currently leans toward \"no, add it in phase 2 if needed\"\r\n6. [ ] 6. Formalize the notion of tight coupling (if a beacon chain includes a crosslink that points to invalid / unavailable shard block data, at what point does it become \"invalid\"?)\r\n7. [ ] 7. Figure out shard rewards, figure out how the portion of shard state used to save shard rewards works\r\n    * Not yet done. Pending agreement that making a minimal shard state that contains a list of reward balances for each period committee and syncing it into the beacon chain every period (day?) is a good idea.\r\n8. [ ] 8. Fix shard slot time\r\n    * 3 seconds (half of `SECOND_PER_SLOT`)\r\n9. [x] 9. Fix shard -> beacon chain lookback mechanics\r\n    * Need to decide between: (i) N slot lookback (eg. N = 4), (ii) one-epoch lookback and (iii) lookback to last finalized chain. I'm leaning toward (i) because otherwise light clients that use persistent committees would be unusable.\r\n10. [ ] 10.
