  "body": "In the screening `voluntary_exit`,  there is:\r\n```\r\n[REJECT] All of the conditions within process_voluntary_exit pass validation\r\n```\r\nBut it could be non-determinate, since there can be multiple branches, on each of which the informations can be different. For example, on branch 1:  index = 100 is validator one, branch 2: index = 100 is validator two. So which branch is supposed to choose to check the `process_voluntary_exit` with?\r\nShould we choose the local fork-choice branch? If we choose the fork-choice branch, should we reject the validator on another branch? IMO, we only reject the message if we are sure that the message is invalid, but in this case, the message can be valid since finally the other branch can be the canonical one.\r\n",
