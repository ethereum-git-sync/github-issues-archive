  "body": "# Issue\r\nDuring an inactivity leak it is expected that those validators that are participating optimally would see their balance unchanged whereas, those that are participating but not optimally will lose a small amount, and those that are failing to vote on the \"correct\" target are subject to a quadratic leak.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that due to some of the details of the calculations performed in `get_attestation_deltas` that an optimally participating validator would still lose some amount of capital. This is due to two minor details in the way rewards are applied\r\n\r\n1. Micro-incentives for FFG source, target, and head are scaled by `attesting_balance // total_balance`\r\n2. `max_attester_reward` for inclusion delay is less than `base_reward` due to the portion given to the proposer\r\n\r\nThese two sources of reward are less than `base_reward` even for an optimally participating validator during an inactivity leak. (1) is certainly scaled below the maximum for `target` and `head` because the chain is not finalizing and thus the `attesting_balance < 2/3 * total_balance`. (2) is always scaled slightly below the maximum regardless of the inclusion time due to a portion going to the proposer.\r\n\r\nDuring an inactivity leak, all active validators receive a `BASE_REWARDS_PER_EPOCH * base_reward` penalty with the expectation that an optimally performing validator's rewards will be perfectly balanced out by this penalty resulting in a net 0 affect on balance. As discussed above, the max reward for an optimally performing validator is less than `BASE_REWARDS_PER_EPOCH * base_reward`, thus they will lose capital.\r\n\r\n## Proposed solution\r\n\r\nWe could be more nuanced about the penalty applied here to ensure a penalty balancing scaled by the proper amounts, but that seems a bit messy.\r\n\r\nStill thinking on it.",
