  "body": "The networking spec introduced in #1328 relies on fine-grained, per-operation protocol IDs to univocally identify what operation a req/rep stream targets (negotiated and selected via multistream-select 1.0 / multiselect 2.0).\r\n\r\n> _[For background on the rationale, see the answer to question [\"Why segregate requests into dedicated protocol IDs?\"](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/d09d56bec8cec98e3d77a286c48972521dd2be96/specs/networking/p2p-interface.md#L649)]_\r\n\r\nTo efficiently advertise our supported protocol set on the discovery layer (discv5), I propose to introduce the concept of _protocol families OR protocol groups OR protocol suites OR protocol manifests_ that aggregate finer-grained protocols into a logical, versioned unit that can be advertised/enumerated efficiently on the ENR (max. size 300 bytes), e.g. `/eth/reqrep/attestation/v03`.\r\n\r\nAnother approach worth considering is bloom filters on the ENR, in order to compact advertisements in a probabilistic manner. Either:\r\n\r\n1. a single, flat bloom filter.\r\n2. one bloom filter per namespace, e.g. one bloom filter for `/eth/reqrep/attestation`, another one for `/eth/reqrep/slashing`\r\n\r\ncould potentially work well.\r\n\r\nSee the following discussions for context:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/pull/1328#discussion_r310403895\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/pull/1328#discussion_r310099975\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/pull/1328/files#diff-9e07d955515655364c9a5f28c94f5627R236",
