The problem is that if someone deposits 32 ETH and early on their balance goes down (even just a bit) then they will have to wait until their balance goes back up to 32.5 ETH (because of hysteresis) for the effective balance to become 32 ETH. This could incentivise some validators to make a second deposit which is not ideal.",

    "body": "Secondary deposits have rather limited use cases, due to the minimum deposit being 1 Ether.\r\n\r\nThey come in to play if your balance is in the range `(x+0.5Ξ,x+1Ξ)` for some integer value of `x` between 16 and 30, as you can carry out a top-up to get yourself above the latch point for the next effective balance increment.  For example, if you had a balance of 29.9Ξ (and hence effective balance of 29Ξ) then a top-up deposit of 1.61Ξ would result in a balance of 31.51Ξ (and hence effective balance of 31Ξ).  For any other situation I believe that the effective balance won't increase further than the the increase in balance.\r\n\r\nIn general, though, a staker that finds themself in this position (_i.e._ with a balance less than 31Ξ)is unlikely to be sophisticated enough to carry out this operation (unless there have been some serious finality issues).",

If someone were to use an attack that involved activating a validator and never participating, they would be penalized more quickly during that N+X period given an inflated effective balance for a short period of time.\r\n\r\nLikewise for the honest participant, if there is a liveness issue in that period, they will have a higher penalty.
