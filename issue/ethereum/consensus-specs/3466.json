  "body": "We propose to include FC filtering change into Deneb:\r\n* https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/3431\r\n\r\nThe change is mainly a two-liner accompanied with a tiny refactor, the PR also includes updates of tests affected by the change.\r\n\r\nAs it's coming from discussion of this change on ACDC [#114](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/830), clients don't support changing the fork choice logic at a specified boundary, so the best coordination we can reach without introducing additional engineering complexity is releasing client software with a new FC logic at the same time as Deneb release with potentially 3-4 weeks of two FC versions running on the mainnet.\r\n\r\nThis thread is created around a few related discussion points:\r\n* Inclusion into Deneb client releases\r\n* Merging the PR into consensus-specs and updating tests vectors\r\n* Enabling the change in one of upcoming Dencun",
