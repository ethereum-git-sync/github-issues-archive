So that the spec test vectors could match the client implementations. However, IMO, once Deneb is done, it's cleaner to have a post-deneb clean-up to get rid of the checks, i.e., revert it to the status-quo #3421 change in `phase0/fork-choice.md`. No fork is required for the clean-up because it only changes the older versions. Although it probably makes it more confusing. 😅\r\n",
