    "body": "I suspect Lighthouse would be OK with activating this rule change at a specified epoch. I believe all we'd need to do is wrap the old and new code around an `if epoch > activation_epoch` block. That might not be the case for other clients though (and that would be totally OK).\r\n\r\nIf the other clients are open to an epoch-based activation then I'd be open to trying it. I expect the status-quo of a loosely coordinated roll-out based on client releases would also work well, so I'm not opposed to that either.\r\n\r\nSo, consider my input to be a loosely held vote for trying a more tightly coordinated fork choice update.",
