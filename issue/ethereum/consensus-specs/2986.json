    "body": "It's probably also worth testing these with a single deposit and with the full 16 deposits. It can be useful to use batch signature verification since deposit signatures are usually valid but if any are invalid you have to go find the right one (which can be complicated by things like unparseable public keys).  One vs multiple deposits did wind up making a difference in Teku.",
