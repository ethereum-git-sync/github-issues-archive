  "body": "Rewards are currently [processed serially](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/core/0_beacon-chain.md#justification-and-finalization) which means that `base_reward(state, index)` can change from one micro-incentive to the next. My suggestion would be to always use the same `base_reward(state, index)` for rewards.\r\n\r\nMaking rewards processing commutative has various benefits:\r\n\r\n* Cleaner\r\n* More flexible and less brittle for developers\r\n* More opportunity for parallelism\r\n",
