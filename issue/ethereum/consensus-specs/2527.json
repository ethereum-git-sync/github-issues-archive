  "body": "On altair-devnet-0 we're getting some `SignedContributionAndProof` messages published with no aggregation_bits set. Currently Teku considers these invalid based on:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[REJECT] The aggregate signature is valid for the message beacon_block_root and aggregate pubkey derived from the participation info in aggregation_bits for the subcommittee specified by the contribution.subcommittee_index.\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut we should clarify whether the correct behaviour is:\r\n\r\n1. Publish an empty aggregate with the infinite signature (and thus verify the signature with `eth2_fast_aggregate_verify`)\r\n2. Skip publishing the aggregate\r\n\r\nSince there are no rewards for producing aggregates and an empty aggregate has no value, I'd suggest option 2 and just clarify that in the validator spec.",
