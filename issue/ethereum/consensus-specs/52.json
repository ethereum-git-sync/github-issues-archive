    "body": "What about:\r\n\r\n* Have the \"deposit contract\" on the PoW chain be *literally* a burn address (e.g. the address `0xE7H20` for \"ETH2.0\"). In particular, no `proof_of_possession`, `withdrawal_shard`, `withdrawal_address` or `randao_commitment` is provided, just ETH.\r\n* Introduce `SpecialRecord`s to use the burnt ETH (for registrations, for top-ups, etc.)\r\n\r\nThis potentially kills several birds with one stone:\r\n\r\n1) No PoW contract has to be written.\r\n2) The above issue with bad proofs of possession becomes a non-issue.\r\n3) The registration logic is decoupled from the PoW chain. In particular, upgrades to the registration logic do not require touching the PoW chain.\r\n4) The same infrastructure on the PoW chain can used for both registrations and top-ups.\r\n5) The registration logic being implemented fully on the beacon chain means it can be reused for \"internal registrations\" to solve issue 10 [here](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/issues/34). (IMO having ETH stuck for an undetermined amount of time after deregistration is far from ideal.)\r\n",

    "body": "I like how this naturally translates to keeping the same interface for shard chain deposits, but there are certainly some other complexities introduced as a tradeoff.\r\n\r\nWith the \"deposit\" contract, how does a validator utilize the eth1.0 ETH on eth2.0?  If we use the eth1.0 pub-keys as the \"right\" to utilize the burned ETH, then we need to support ECDSA-verify on the beacon chain to verify that the `SpecialRecord` is indeed related to eth1.0 account that deposited the eth.\r\n\r\nAlso, we'd be consuming SpecialRecords that point to successful TXs on the PoW chain rather than ordered logs from a contract on the PoW chain. This isn't radically different, but it introduces some required beacon chain accounting related to what has or hasn't been consumed from the eth1.0 deposit addr.",
