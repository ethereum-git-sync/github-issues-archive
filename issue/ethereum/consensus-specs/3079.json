  "body": "After #3068, the worst case behavior during withdrawals processing implies a complete scan of the full validator set on _each_ block.\r\n\r\nThere is some discussion in that PR that suggests even as is this worst case scenario is not a blocker but it would be nice to bound the length of the scan to have hard numbers on performance here.\r\n\r\nTo implement, we need to add a constant `MAX_VALIDATORS_PER_WITHDRAWALS_SWEEP` and add it to `get_expected_withdrawals` in that PR on the line that scans the validator set:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfor _ in range(MAX_VALIDATORS_PER_WITHDRAWALS_SWEEP):\r\n```\r\n\r\nI wanted to open this issue for discussion of this approach and also to get agreement on a concrete number for this new constant.\r\n\r\nI suggest `2**17` as it is a nice power of two and is around 1/4 of the validator set against current `mainnet` numbers.\r\n\r\nedit: It also seems fairer if we also advance the pointer to the last checked validator by `MAX_VALIDATORS_PER_WITHDRAWALS_SWEEP` in the event we don't have any withdrawals during a single sweep so would need another line or code or two along w/ the above to handle that",
