  "body": "The scenario is the following:\r\n\r\nAt slot 6, we included an attestation for slot 1. We advance through time all the way to slot 127. The next slot will be an epoch update. We start the slot processing by increasing `state.slot` to 128. Then we proceed through the functions until we pick out `previous_epoch_attestations = [a for a in state.latest_attestations if state.slot - 2 * EPOCH_LENGTH <= a.slot < state.slot - EPOCH_LENGTH]` - our attestation from slot 1 fits this criteria (`0 <= 1 < 64`). \r\n\r\nWe call `get_attestation_participants` which calls `get_shard_committees_at_slot(state, 1)` which computes:\r\n`earliest_slot_in_array = state.slot - (state.slot % EPOCH_LENGTH) - EPOCH_LENGTH` or `128 - 0 - 64 = 64`. \r\n\r\nsubsequently, `    assert earliest_slot_in_array <= slot < earliest_slot_in_array + EPOCH_LENGTH * 2` fires.\r\n\r\nrelated to #348, #92, #323\r\n\r\nc8efdc7\r\n",
