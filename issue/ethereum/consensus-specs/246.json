A historical block accumulator will go in the state instead.\r\n- [x] Order the beacon transaction kinds so as to minimise edge cases and attacks\r\n- [x] Cleaner naming\r\n- [x] Put all beacon transactions in a `body` for light-client friendliness\r\n- [x] Clean conceptual separation of the \"header\" (the six fields from `slot` to `signature`) and the `body`",

    "body": "> Clean separation of header and body, somewhat more light-client friendly\r\n\r\nI actually don't like this :cry: \r\n\r\nOur current approach is already very light client friendly because of how SSZ tree hashing works: if the header contains the body, then at hashing level the root of the body gets into the header as a 32 byte hash. So the status quo (plus making the `body` be a field of the block) is already exactly what @hwwhww is proposing :smile: \r\n\r\nI don't think (header, body) pairs are quite as light client friendly because to chain them together you still need to dig into the header to find out what the parent is, so the end result is that clients are downloading the same structure except the formatting is more complicated.",

    "body": "> Do we want an explicit \"header contains root of body\" structure, or for the header to just contain the body, as that has literally the exact same effect due to SSZ tree hashing? What are the tradeoffs here?\r\n\r\nIf we want to have an option to work with chain of headers as an alternative to chain of blocks then the structure with root of body in the header is the only possible way of achieving that. Downloading chain of headers instead of blocks could potentially reduce network load since headers have small and constant size.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, it's difficult to say whether chain of headers will be important thing or not. For example, it's used by eth1.0 fast sync algorithm to verify that chain that pivot block is part of is a valid PoW chain with correct genesis. This is essential thing for the fast sync, especially when chain data is huge. AFAIR, it takes about a half of an hour to download all headers and several hours to download bodies on the main net. Chain of headers is also used by a full sync to handle forks, hence, bodies are downloaded only when header chain passes reorg safe threshold.\r\n\r\nBut these examples are from eth1.0. And it's not necessary that beacon chain sync will use same approaches as eth1.0 sync does. And in my opinion it's too early to judge on correct block/header structure at the moment, this is more about architectural and design thing that depends on how these structures will be used by a beacon chain sync.\r\n\r\nBut, if we need to make such decision now it might be useful to keep an opportunity header chains and use header structure with body root in it. It may be changed back when there will be strong understanding that we don't need such feature.\r\n\r\n> Seems like the following gives us what we want as long as blocks can be served with a hash for `body` if requested\r\n\r\nWon't there be collisions in case of empty bodies or bodies with same specials that seems like a possible case.\r\n\r\nMaybe I am missing something but the only difference between this structure https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/issues/246#issuecomment-445101678 and plain old `BeaconBlock` is that `body` have its own hash and can be requested by that hash. But what about header though? Could it be requested without a body? Header hash calculation depends on `hash(body)` and verifying that peer responded with requested header would only be possible when body is downloaded. ",
