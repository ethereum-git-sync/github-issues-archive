  "body": "Currently the state transition function is per block, not per slot. By adding `slot` to the `state` we make the state transition per slot. This means:\r\n\r\n* Increased granularity in the `beacon_block_hash` (which should maybe to called `beacon_slot_hash`).\r\n* Attestations for different slots are differentiated with the `beacon_slot_hash`, avoiding risk of confusion.\r\n* The epoch boundary processing can happen at exact boundaries, which is cleaner than the current `while(block.slot - state.latest_state_recalculation_slot >= EPOCH_LENGTH)` logic.\r\n* If there are many \"skip slots\" in a row the transition function progresses instead of queuing work. For example, inactivity penalties can be applied with a greater granularity.",
