At [Attesting](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/validator.md#attesting) stage, `A1` choose **not** to broadcast their unaggregated (individual) attestation `attestation_1`.\r\n2. `A1` only includes their unaggregated `attestation_1` in the `aggregate_and_proof` they created.\r\n\r\nHowever, the chance that `attestation_1` gets included in the block will be decreased since the *other* aggregators will not involve `attestation_1` to their aggregate.\r\n\r\np.s. if we update the aggregator logic, it's related to https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-APIs/pull/15/",
