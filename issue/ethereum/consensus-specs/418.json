  "body": "Following up on this: https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/pull/392#issuecomment-452381326\r\n\r\nThe proposal is to use a single unit type for ETH/wei amounts across the spec. The idea being that as soon as such an amount enters the scope of the spec, we convert to Gwei and *then* propagate the value. Doing so eliminates an entire class of errors as we don't have to worry about unit conversions in any other computations.\r\n\r\nLooking at the Vyper code (ETH entry point) and the validator balances in the state, they already keep amounts in Gwei.  So the only places we would have to change are places where constants are being used (simply because they are in units of ETH).\r\n\r\nThe fix for this issue converts the ETH-based constants to Gwei units and removes the `_ * GWEI_PER_ETH` modifier used throughout the spec.\r\n\r\nHappy to make a PR if this gets enough support.",
