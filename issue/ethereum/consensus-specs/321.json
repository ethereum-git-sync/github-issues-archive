  "body": "Regarding `TARGET_COMMITTEE_SIZE`, the spec currently has a note as follows,\r\n\r\n> For the safety of crosslinks a minimum committee size of 111 is recommended...  The shuffling algorithm generally ensures (assuming sufficient validators) committee sizes at least `TARGET_COMMITTEE_SIZE // 2`.\r\n\r\nThe second part seems incorrect: `get_new_shuffling()` produces committees of size at least `TARGET_COMMITTEE_SIZE` (not divided by two).\r\n\r\nThe current value for `TARGET_COMMITTEE_SIZE ` is 256. In view of the first part of the comment, ought it be 128?",

    "body": "Nice catch! Making a PR\r\n\r\nMy ramblings to further explain:\r\n\r\nWith the current algorithm `TARGET_COMMITTEE_SIZE` ends up being the min and the committee size fluctuates at or above that min as a function of vset size, epoch length, and num shards. (until you get to below `EPOCH_LENGTH * TARGET_COMMITTEE_SIZE` validators at which the committees start to drop below the target.\r\n\r\nBy making `TARGET_COMMITTEE_SIZE` 256 we are being twice as strict for active validator size requirements to crosslink X shards per epoch than if we went with 128. and 128 still guarantees we are above the 111 from the blog post (until times of very small v set and thus decreased security anyway)",
