  "body": "Honest Validator spec states that the `attestation.custody_bitfield` should be a byte array filled with zeros. \r\n\r\nHowever, during per-block processing, when processing attestations we use `attestation.custody_bitfield` to get `custody_bit_1_participants`. These participants are later passed on to `bls_aggregate_pubkeys` to generate an aggregate public key. Having `custody_bitfield` set to all zeros, the `custody_bit_1_participants` becomes an empty list.\r\n\r\nFirst, `bls_aggregate_pubkeys` function seems to be undefined when there are no public keys, as in this case, because `custody_bitfield` was set to all zeros.\r\n\r\nSecond, during `process_attestations`, `bls_verify_multiple` is used to check the aggregate signature on the attestation, however, `bls_verify_multiple` currently takes two message hashes. One where `AttestationDataAndCustodyBit` has its `custody_bit` set to false and another with its `custody_bit` set to true. `bls_verify_multiple` require two aggregate public keys when passed two message hashes. Specifically, the message hash with `custody_bit` set to true requires the aggregate public key of Validators who had their `custody_bitfield` set, which in our case is none. This makes `bls_verify_multiple` to produce an assert.",
