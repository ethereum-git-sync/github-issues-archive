This is theoretically much cheaper because it reuses the attestation verification.\r\n- [x] Evaluate a possible change where each recipient needs to respond with a contiguous array of eg. 16 chunks instead of a single chunk. Currently, we have very low data efficiency for responses because we use a ~500 byte branch to reveal/verify 32 bytes of data, we can extend this to ~900 bytes to reveal/verify 500 bytes of data, a much more favorable tradeoff if the goal is to force revealing the entire block.\r\n- [ ] Replace the current mixing function for custody leaf generation (`hash(data, subkey)`) with a more MPC-friendly alternative",
