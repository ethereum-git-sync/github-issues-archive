  "body": "ebc136a\r\n\r\nWhen hashing containers using `SSZTreeHash`, it is currently specified that fields short be sorted lexicographically.\r\n\r\nThere are advantages:\r\n* generic solution\r\n* no mental overhead to decide where fields go, can focus on \"logical\" ordering in spec\r\n\r\nThere are a few downsides of this approach however:\r\n* Variable-length fields make offsets non-predictable even for fixed-length fields\r\n* Reduced possibility to group similar fields together, for example by data type, to exploit bulk operations \r\n\r\nAlternative approaches:\r\n* Manual ordering - enforce that hashing is done in same order as in spec, and control a good ordering manually\r\n  * Often coupled with a restriction that new fields are added at end for upgrades, to maintain soft compatibility with previous versions\r\n* Data-type based ordering - generally, these kinds of orderings group data by type, putting fixed-length fields before variable-length fields - this gives each field a fixed relative offset making it easy to look up. This kind of ordering also helps keep aliasing issues at a minimum.\r\n",
