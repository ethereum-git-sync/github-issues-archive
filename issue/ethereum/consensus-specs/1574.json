  "body": "In fork choice, I believe it's possible for `store.justified_checkpoint.epoch <= store.finalized_checkpoint.epoch`. As I understand it, this means that `filter_block_tree` will filter out all blocks.\r\n\r\nConsider that we're syncing a fork and in the later `SLOTS_PER_EPOCH - SAFE_SLOTS_TO_UPDATE_JUSTIFIED` slots of the epoch. During this time we sync through several epochs, where each epoch justifies and finalizes the closest possible prior epochs (i.e., perfect validator participation).\r\n\r\nAs we call `on_block` we're delaying updating `store.current_justified_epoch` because we're in the later slots of the epoch. However, we _are_ updating `store.finalized_checkpoint`. It follows that we could now have a `store.finalized_epoch` that is from a block several epochs _later_ than `store.justified_epoch`.",
