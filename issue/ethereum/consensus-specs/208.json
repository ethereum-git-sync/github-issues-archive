  "body": "In the SSZ spec, the container values are serialized with the following instruction: \r\n>The serialized values should be tightly packed.\r\n\r\nDoes that mean we should prefer to serialize integers with the smallest possible number of bytes? If yes, how do we know to deserialize the container?\r\n\r\nTake for example these 2 objects:\r\n```\r\n{\"a\":1, \"b\":65536, \"c\":32}\r\n```\r\nAnd:\r\n```\r\n{\"a\":1, \"b\":32, \"c\":65536}\r\n```\r\nIn the first case, the container would serialize a with one byte, b with 3 bytes, c with one byte.\r\nIn the second case, you would serialize a and b with one byte, and c with 3 bytes.\r\n\r\nI am truly confused by this sentence. Would it be possible to remove it from the spec?",

    "body": "Tightly packed in this sense does not mean to override the byte length of values by trimming zero bytes. It means that if it's a \"strange\" type like a `uint24` or a `hash2` to not pad these values out to more \"normal\" lengths like 32 bits or 8 bytes.\r\n\r\nI think the language is pretty clear that types of known length should remain that length.
