  "body": "# Issue\r\n`justified_head_state` which is used to get the active validator set for `lmd_ghost` is currently defined as \"the resulting `BeaconState` object from processing the chain up to the `justified_head`\".\r\n\r\nThis is correct in the \"happy\" case in which no slots were skipped between the `justified_head` and the epoch boundary that was justified, but in the case that slots were skipped between the head and epoch boundary slot (`% epoch_length == 0`), the justified head is actually the block from a prior slot but at the state at the epoch boundary slot. For example, if a block at slot 63 (epoch 0) is justified for epoch 1 (epoch boundary @ slot 64) in the case that there was no block for slot 64, then the state associated with this `(justified_block, justified_epoch)` tuple is actually the justified block from slot 63 transitioned through an additional slot to slot 64.\r\n\r\n# Solution\r\nDefine `justified_head_state` as \"the resulting `BeaconState` object from processing the chain up to the `justified_head` through the start slot of `justified_epoch`\"",
