In the case where the proposer does indeed propose a block at the slot they were designated and they had no previous skips, their `randao_layers` will be 1 and thus just one layer of the hash onion will need to be provided.\r\n\r\nThis is nice because it cleanly separated the per-slot operations and per-block operations.",
