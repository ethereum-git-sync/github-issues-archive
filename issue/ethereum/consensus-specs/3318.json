And thank you for this creative idea!\r\n\r\n[Peer Review] The only technical concern I have is that in 2008-2009 the Bitcoin's hashrate globally is 10MHash/s, today it's 400EHash/s which is 4e13 times more. If the hash rate of Poseidon increases as fast in that rate, it will be cracked in 100seconds in 15th year.  116586246y = 3.6766638539e+15sec\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @xinbenlv in https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/6327#discussion_r1161407782_\r\n            ",
