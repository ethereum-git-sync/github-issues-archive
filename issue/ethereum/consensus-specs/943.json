I guess I am unsure how many times exactly the base_reward can be applied, the block proposer reward is not obvious. Also relates to #944 -- is the number 5 exact there? Because I feel it's not.\r\n\r\n> Do you mean a formula showing how this is derived?\r\nI would even go as far as including a function that computes the expected rewards per time period.
