  "body": "Assuming a node has not received via gossip a block that has been imported by the majority of the network.\r\n\r\nBefore Deneb, a node can be aware of that block's root when:\r\n\r\n- it sees an attestation voting for it\r\n- it sees the next block building on top of it\r\n\r\nIn both cases it is likely that the node can lookup the block byRoot since both events signals that the block has been imported (probably) by the majority of the network.\r\n\r\nAfter Deneb, there will be a third condition:\r\n\r\n- it sees a valid blob_sidecar carrying the block header.\r\n\r\nThis third event happens way before the the other two, probably before most of the nodes has successfully imported the block.\r\nAnd this applies to blob_sidecars too.\r\n\r\nThus, while pre-Deneb, serving only fully imported blocks seems good enough for client missing them, in Deneb seems not be the case anymore.\r\n\r\nShould we let clients serve byRoot requests for blocks and blob_sidecars that have passed gossip but has not yet fully imported to allow early byRoot recovery?",

    "body": "I believe we are dealing with two types of blocks in this scenario:\r\n\r\n1.) Blocks that pass gossip validation but are yet to undergo the state transition function.\r\n2.) Blocks that have successfully passed the state transition function but have not yet been imported into the fork choice.\r\n\r\nWhile these considerations apply to both types, focusing primarily on the second type might be safer. However, it's important to note that after passing through gossip validation, the block will possess a valid signature and proposer index. Consequently, a malicious node would need to either sacrifice a block or risk being slashed to successfully execute any kind of attack",
