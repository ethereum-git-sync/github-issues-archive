These new subnets for the fork are maintained in addition to those for the current fork until the fork occurs. After the fork occurs, let the subnets from the previous fork reach the end of life with no replacements.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI have some doubts we need to do this in advance of 256 epochs before the fork:\r\n- node subnets will be changed in 256 epochs with 100% guarantee\r\n- we usually do it in like 2 epochs before the fork, for example, for sync committee subnets (though I've not found any constant for this in the spec)\r\n\r\nMaybe `EPOCHS_PER_SUBNET_SUBSCRIPTION` is not related to an advance meaning that we should subscribe as usual for `EPOCHS_PER_SUBNET_SUBSCRIPTION`  and do it in advance before the fork, but it's not clear with the current text. Maybe polish it a little? I'd just remove `at least EPOCHS_PER_SUBNET_SUBSCRIPTION epochs` part.",
