This is probably just an issue with cleaning up the Makefile, which I understand to be extremely low priority. Still, it's nice to eliminate any warnings if we can!\r\n\r\nThe appropriate solution is pretty easy, we should just pick one of the definitions. I can't really tell what was the intended purpose of providing two definitions (one has a forward slash, but doesn't seem to make a difference), so I don't have an opinion on which one we should pick.\r\n",
