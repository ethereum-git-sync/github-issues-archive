  "body": "It looks like the proposer score boost is not applied to ancestors of the boosted block, even during the boosted block's slot. Is this the correct behavior?\r\n\r\nThis is highlighted by the test scenario: `shorter_chain_but_heavier_weight`\r\n\r\nIn that scenario, during slot 3, there is a proposer-boosted block from slot three, as well as a late-arriving block from slot 1. The test expects the block from slot 1 to be set as head, even when they are tied in attestation weight (at zero). I'd expect the `get_head` method to incorporate the proposer boost and set block 3 as head.  ",
