This can lead to a dos vector in which Blocks are filled with junk specials causing an increased load on block size as well as state recalc time.\r\n\r\n# Proposed solution\r\n- Add constant `MAX_SPECIALS_PER_BLOCK` such that block validity requires `len(block.specials) <= MAX_SPECIALS_PER_BLOCK`\r\n- Check `SpecialRecord` validity (signature, format, etc) in block processing after checking attestation validity. Throw out block if any invalid specials\r\n- During state recalc, `ActiveState.pending_specials` are valid so just process the related state transitions rather than the signatures at this point.",

A slash should only be includable if the validator has not been already slashed, a logout should only be includable if the validator is logged in, etc. So we don't need explicit anti-duplicate rules.\r\n\r\n> What about specials of unknown type?\r\n\r\nI'm inclined to say ban them.\r\n\r\n> Is the length of SpecialRecord.data bounded?
