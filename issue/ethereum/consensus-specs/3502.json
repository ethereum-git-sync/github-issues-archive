But the 2 epoch difference between the finalized and the attested header is not good for the UX. Because there are 12.8 minutes between those two.\n\nHow about adding `justified_header` which is 1 epoch behind the `attested_header` so that the light clients can have the option to trust it or not based on their use case?",
