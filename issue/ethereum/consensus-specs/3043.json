  "body": "A number of spec modifications need to happen after discussions at devcon:\r\n\r\n1. Couple block and blob sidecar in a single gossip topic -- beacon_block_and_blob_sidecar\r\n    * Keep proposer signature on the sidecar to ensure a party cannot mutate OR we have to do the sidecar / blobtx KZG verifications\r\n2. Reduce `MIN_EPOCHS_FOR_BLOBS_SIDECARS_REQUESTS` to ~2 weeks or lower\r\n2. Clarify Blob availability requirement in fork-choice by specifying an `is_data_available()` check for importing a block\r\n3. Consider `MAX_REQUEST_BLOBS_SIDECARS` value\r\n    * Currently 128 which is a very large amount of data, but you only MUST respond to 1st\r\n    * Is this \"only first\" requirement (and the mirror to blocks by range) sufficient for load balancing or should teh value be reduced?\r\n2. TBD -- potentially reduce blobs per block down to an appropriate value after testing and simulations\r\n    * Note, this can be done now to something like 128KB/256KB if 1MB/2MB is blocking important testing\r\n5. TBD -- based on 4844 load tests and lighthouse episub tests, finish episub spec and *potentially* make it suggested or mandatory",
