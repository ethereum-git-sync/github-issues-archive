    "body": "This is an issue for the first block of every new cycle, not just when there's a large gap. It's a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem where the proposers for a new cycle are determined _after_ the first block gets processed, so the proposer for that first block isn't known when it's time to propose.\r\n\r\n@hwwhww brings up a good point, and I think there's two issues with the proposed solution:\r\n* `get_shards_and_committees_for_slot(_, s)` is no longer consistent, but is now dependent on whether or not `s` is the first block in the cycle. \r\n* `get_shards_and_committes_for_slot(_, s)` no longer works when `s` is the first block in a cycle and `s < last_state_recalculation`. \r\n\r\nThe proposed solution will require an additional bool in each block to specify whether or not its the first block in the cycle, and some additional logic to hold onto that one `[ShardAndCommittee]` object for one extra cycle.\r\n\r\nHere's another solution. Have `shard_and_committee_for_slots` contain 3 cycles worth of committees, and the following change:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef get_shards_and_committees_for_slot(crystallized_state: CrystallizedState,\r\n                                       slot: int) -> List[ShardAndCommittee]:\r\n    earliest_slot_in_array = crystallized_state.last_state_recalculation - CYCLE_LENGTH\r\n    assert earliest_slot_in_array <= slot\r\n    if slot < crystallized_state.last_state_recalculation + CYCLE_LENGTH:\r\n        index = slot - earliest_slot_in_array\r\n    else:\r\n        index = CYCLE_LENGTH * 2 + (slot % CYCLE_LENGTH)\r\n    return crystallized_state.shard_and_committee_for_slots[index]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAssuming 2^18 or 262144 validators, my quick math says that one cycle worth of committees takes up 770kb of space, and the `ValidatorRecord` array takes up 28MB of space. Therefore, adding an additional cycle worth of committees will increase the size of `crystallized_state` by about 2.5%. That's not trivial, so maybe not worth it.",

You could have a block that skipped an entire cycle and was at the next boundary.\r\n\r\nThis is a bug that runs deeper than we previously acknowledged. We should really only be using the randao_mix from the `last_finalized_block` rather than with the most recent blocks processed. Essentially, when we do a re-shuffling, no one should disagree on this new shuffling.",
