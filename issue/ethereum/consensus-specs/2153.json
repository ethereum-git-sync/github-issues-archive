  "body": "https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/v1.0.0/specs/phase0/validator.md#phase-0-attestation-subnet-stability\r\n\r\nTypically, the attestation subscriptions are handled by the beacon node, but the stability subscription is expressed in terms of \"validator\" - this implies that a beacon node running without any validators should not subscribe to stability subnets at all and beacon nodes with multiple validators should be subscribed to multiple stability subnets - what is the intent?\r\n\r\nIt seems reasonable that the spec instead mandates that each beacon node must be subscribed to _at least_ one stability subnet at all times, and may choose to subscribe to more, regardless of the number of validators it runs.\r\n\r\nThis avoids leaking information about how many validators are running on the node, keeps the enr stable and provides guidance for how to implement \"read-only\" non-validating beacon nodes.\r\n",
