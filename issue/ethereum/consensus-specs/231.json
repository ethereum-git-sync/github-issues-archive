  "body": "The current [SSZ specification](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/ff2551e754028260a619c1b538ac194568f1eff2/specs/simple-serialize.md#serializeencode) only specified that the integer length must conform to `int_size % 8 == 0`. It does not specify the maximum bit length.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Tree Hash definition says to [return the serialization of `uintN` when creating the hash](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/ff2551e754028260a619c1b538ac194568f1eff2/specs/simple-serialize.md#uintn-bool-address-hash32). If `int_size` is permitted to exceed 256, this will return more than 32 bytes for hashing.\r\n\r\nSo the question is: are we missing a constraint on the maximum bit length of an integer, or has the Tree Hash failed to account for intN where N > 256?",
