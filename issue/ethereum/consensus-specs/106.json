  "body": "The conditions for validator rotation says that all shard need to have a crosslink from a slot beyond `validatot_change_slot`, that means an attacker could potentially bribe validators of one shard to delay the rotation by not cross-linking. Especially in beginning, not all the shards are assigned to a committee per CYCLE_LENGTH. In that case, an attacker only needs to bribe MIN_COMMITTEE_SIZE * 2/3 validators to perform this kind of bribing attack. Should we loosen the validator rotation condition to 2/3 crosslink?",

    "body": "In the case in which the committee is simply offline, the quadratic leak handles this -- the offline portion leaks out until the committee can crosslink. We discussed allowing other committees to continue to crosslink so that the other shard chains do not get behind.\r\n\r\nAs for if the committee is overtaken by an attacker, they can either (1) prevent a crosslink if they have `> 1/3` or (2) crosslink in unavailable data if that have `>= 2/3`.\r\n\r\nAs the spec is currently written, (2) would require some sort of coordination out of band to fork and fix the data.  When we add data availability proofs and fraud proofs, checking and recovering from this can be automated. \r\n\r\n(1) would also currently require out of band coordination to fix. One viable alternative is to have the quadratic leak occur not only for offline participants but participants that don't agree with the majority. Another would be to change up the way we are doing reshuffling and potentially resample that one committee.",
