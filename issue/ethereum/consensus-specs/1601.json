  "body": "I didn't realize #1339 had been closed! Creating this issue for some fresh eyes. This is something I'd definitely like to revisit and maybe have auditors look at this month.\r\n\r\nSee #1339 for the original description of the issue.\r\n\r\nThe tldr is that without a `proposer_id` and a way for a quick signature verification on an incoming block, an attacker can create blocks with some amount of skip slots that require database look ups and state transitions _to even validate the proposer signature_. In the current case, that attacker doesn't even need to be in the validator set.\r\n\r\nBy adding the `proposer_id` we at least reduce the set that can craft such blocks to the validators and limit them to a 1 per slot allowance (due to [gossip conditions](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/issues/1595) and slashing conditions). This rate limit combined with peer scoring (and dropping!) at least begins to bound this problem.",
