    "body": "My understanding is that, technically speaking, we do want to enshrine the weak subjectivity period in the fork choice rule, especially in the context of \"surviving WW3\". Having said that, from a pragmatic standpoint it may be best to sweep this detail under the rug until phase 1+. Indeed, hitting the weak subjectivity period without finality is an exceptional condition which is a) unlikely to happen, and b) would likely be handled with manual intervention. My inclination would be to formally update the fork choice in phase 1 so as to not distract the launch of phase 0. Tagging this issue as phase 1 for now :)",
