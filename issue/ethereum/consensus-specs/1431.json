  "body": "As discussed with @JustinDrake and @djrtwo, the [honest validator guide](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/v0.8.3/specs/validator/0_beacon-chain-validator.md#eth1-data) requires that for a proposer to cast an `Eth1Data` vote, they must resolve `state.eth1_data.block_hash` to a block number.\r\n\r\nIt is not specified how to proceed if `state.eth1_data.block_hash` is junk (e.g. there's a dishonest majority or super-crazy-extreme eth1 re-org).\r\n\r\n## Suggestions\r\n\r\n1. As suggested by @JustinDrake simply cast a random vote. This breaks the eth1 linking (and therefore deposits), favoring liveness over safety. An extra-protocol fix will be required.\r\n2. Set `previous_eth1_distance` to some constant (4096?) and try to salvage eth1 linking.\r\n3. Fail block production, halting the entire chain.\r\n\r\nI prefer (1), primarily because it tends towards \"failing loudly\" instead of trying to recover a broken system (which may introduce weird scenarios, like a decreasing deposit count).",
