  "body": "SSZ has full support for lists, but only partial support for arrays (specifically, it can support arrays of bytes with `bytesN`). I'd argue we want full support for fixed-sized arrays. The reason is that fixed-sized arrays appear in various places where we do not want to mix in the array length. One example is when computing the `shard_data_root`, and another one appeared [here](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/pull/649/files#r258565227). Other examples include `latest_randao_mixes`, `latest_block_roots`, `latest_active_index_roots`, `latest_slashed_balances` which are all fixed size, and where including the data length is a nuisance.\r\n\r\nIdeally we want to use `hash_tree_root` over `merkle_root` pretty much everywhere, and support for fixed-sized arrays will allow this.\r\n\r\n(Side note regarding Go: In go we have \"arrays\" with the `[n]` notation for a fixed `n`. For example `[32]byte` would be the equivalent of `Bytes32`. We also have \"slices\" with the `[]` which have dynamic size. My suggestion is to define SSZ for slices *and* arrays.)",

    "body": "> Not sure I understand this 😂\r\n\r\nI was saying I was afraid that I'm putting more unnecessary requirements and make it a more complicated design in the early stage. 😆 \r\n\r\n> In theory a fork could change the state list lengths.\r\n\r\nIt seems we will need extra code to handle length extension. And the \"suture\" between the forks is less clean.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example\r\n\r\n```python\r\nstate.latest_block_roots[slot % LATEST_BLOCK_ROOTS_LENGTH]\r\n\r\n\r\nLATEST_BLOCK_ROOTS_LENGTH: 8\r\nafter processed block 15\r\nwhen processed block 16\r\n[root_8, root_11, ...., root_14, root_15]\r\n\r\nget_block_root(state, slot) can get block root between [state.slot - LATEST_BLOCK_ROOTS_LENGTH, state.slot) = [15-8, 15)\r\nget_block_root(state, 11) = state.latest_block_roots[slot % LATEST_BLOCK_ROOTS_LENGTH] = root_11\r\n\r\n\r\n####\r\nIncrease `LATEST_BLOCK_ROOTS_LENGTH` from 8 to 16\r\n\r\nLATEST_BLOCK_ROOTS_LENGTH: 16\r\nafter processed block 15\r\n[root_9, root_11, ...., root_14, ZERO_HASH, .... ZERO_HASH]\r\nget_block_root(state, slot) can get block root between [state.slot - LATEST_BLOCK_ROOTS_LENGTH, state.slot) = [15-16, 15) <--- oh no\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nWe would need to either (i) fill the missing empty spots in the new array in the fork slot or (ii) prevent the empty spots from being accessed before they are filled in the future slots.",
