  "body": "There seems to be a simple typo in the definition of the [genesis block](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/master/specs/core/0_beacon-chain.md#on-startup):\r\n\r\n```\r\n    'candidate_pow_receipt_roots': [],\r\n```\r\n\r\nshould be\r\n\r\n```\r\n    'candidate_pow_receipt_root': ?,\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would have opened a PR, but I don't know what the correct value is. I guess either the value at deployment of the deposit contract or the most recent one at launch of the beacon chain?\r\n\r\nThe root of the issue is probably that `block.candidate_pow_receipt_root` is very similar to `state.candidate_pow_receipt_roots`, so renaming one might be a good idea. It seems like the state contains actually `CandidatePoWReceiptRootRecord`s, so maybe `state.candidate_pow_receipt_root_records` could work?",
