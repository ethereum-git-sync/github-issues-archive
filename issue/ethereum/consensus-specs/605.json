  "body": "This is a heads-up that [the BLS spec](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/bls_signature.md) is likely to change. Many blockchain projects are converging towards BLS12-381 (Zcash Sapling, Chia, Ethereum 2.0, Filecoin, Dfinity, Algorand, etc.) and there is a strong desire for everyone to standardise on the fine details. This include standardising\r\n\r\n- hash functions (to G1 and G2)\r\n- generator points (for G1 and G2)\r\n- point serialisation (for G1 and G2)\r\n- possibly message hashing\r\n\r\nGiven that Zcash Sapling is already in production, one sensible approach may be to start from what Zcash has.\r\n\r\nDan Boneh and folks from Algorand have a [IETF draft](https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-boneh-bls-signature-00.txt). I encourage anyone interested in this discussion to email Sergey Gorbunov (sgorbunov@uwaterloo.ca) who seems to be leading the effort.",
