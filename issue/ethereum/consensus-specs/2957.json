I found it is more readable. üëç\r\n\r\n### Proposed suggestion\r\nWe can do some search-and-replace to make them **BOLD** quickly. However, the disadvantage is that it will introduce many diff lines.\r\n\r\nOpening this issue to track this nice-to-have. We can consider modifying it later, i.e., post-merge.\r\n\r\n",
