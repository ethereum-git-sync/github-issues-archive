  "body": "The spec says the following:\r\n\r\n> The registration contract emits a log with the various arguments for consumption by the beacon chain. It does not do validation, pushing the registration logic to the beacon chain.\r\n\r\nThis is reflected in the proposed Vyper PoW chain contract that does no checking.\r\n\r\nAt a minimum it would be good to check that `msg.value==DEPOSIT_SIZE`. This avoids a least a couple of issues:\r\n\r\n* If someone mistakenly sends a different value to the contract, their funds will be unrecoverable under the current scheme.\r\n* I could call `deposit()` 16384 times with 0 value and junk data, and yet start the Beacon Chain without a single genuine, committed validator.",
