  "body": "## Introduction\r\n\r\nThis issue details the JSON RPC API that is need on the shard chains in order to support an Eth1 execution environment. This will not be relevant until Phase2, but discussions should begin now.\r\n\r\n### Rational\r\n\r\nMigrating contract state to Eth2.0 is an essential step in the roadmap (not covered in this document), this requires backwards compatibility for existing developer tooling such as [ethers.js](www.github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js) and [web3.js](www.github.com/ethereum/web3.js). Otherwise all DApps currently utilizing Eth1 contracts would not be useable (i.e the web-apps would quite literally blow up).\r\n\r\n## API Specification\r\n\r\nThe specification for Eth1 can be found [here](www.github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC), and should be implemented 1-1. Naturally, this should be fairly trivial since most languages already have an existing Eth1 implementation, with a fully function JSON RPC.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that there is support for pub/sub (web sockets), although most providers and DApps should be checking for fallbacks, we should be implementing both the JSON-RPC schema and pub/sub.",
