  "body": "There has been more discussion about alternative blob/block gossip designs including the possibility of decoupling blocks and blobs in gossipsub. @arnetheduck suggested large bandwidth reductions could be achieved by only listening to blobs and downloading blocks via a decoupled by-root request. The reverse, gossiping blocks and downloading blobs by root, is structurally similar to what full DAS might look like. \r\n\r\nHowever, there are concerns about the potential for additional round trips of communication at each hop and the difficulty in knowing which nodes to request blobs from if blocks are gossiped without the associated blobs. \r\n\r\n[Episub](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/pubsub/gossipsub/episub.md) is another way we can decrease bandwidth by reducing the gossip amplification factor. We’re still trying to understand to what degree this will have an impact, so far it seems it may be more beneficial in larger networks, but these are difficult to run reliably in testing. A solution where we only gossip one of blob/block would still benefit from episub because of the bandwidth reduction on other/existing topics. \r\n\r\nIt seems like we will stick with coupling in the near term but it may be worth exploring alternative designs sooner rather than later in case bandwidth or network propagation times look suspect in testing. I think it’s also worth discussing which of these we are prioritising to what degree:\r\n\r\n- Minimising the number of worst-case block propagation times\r\n- Minimising average block propagation times\r\n- Minimising bandwidth increase caused by blobs",
