  "body": "4844 is being shipped in Deneb *without* slashing conditions on the p2p BlobSidecar message.\r\n\r\npeer-scoring cannot be performed in many cases (might/usually receive sidecar before block from that peer), but by and large, the effect of sending conflicting and invalid sidecars is that the proposer increases their risk of being orphaned. This, in most cases, is a distinct disincentive to spam the network. The primary reason one might leverage additional/invalid messages here is to either create and exploit temporary view splits OR to compound such messages with additional bugs to wreak havic (e.g. if there is a caching issue that creates and irreparable chain split).\r\n\r\nGiven these messages are not a part of the consensus and due to the impact of adding slashing conditions, it was decided to *not* incorporate any such slashable offenses in Deneb, but the conversation around if these should be added later continues to bubble up.\r\n\r\nThere are two types of potential offenses/slashings:\r\n1. Creating duplicate side-cars for a given slot/index. This is the most obvious anti-spam prevention and would lead to easy rules to follow and easy conditions to validate on-chain\r\n2. Creating invalid side-cars -- e.g. sidecars for indices beyond the amount of blobs in the block. This is a *much* more complex type of condition to encode in your anti-slashing DBs as well as to verify on chain.\r\n\r\nThe complexity and risks around (2) seem not a worthwhile path to go down.\r\n\r\nI am personally open to the discussion of (1), but by default, I am resistant to getting into VC anti-slashing DBs and coding this into the core consensus just due to the complexity, and as @dankrad noted, the additional risks it adds to running a validator and thus continue to disincentivize less professional players from validating.\r\n",
