  "body": "The current genesis logic (last changed [here](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/commit/34412130c5a8df907680649adbae58ae45f3c0bc)) has a configurable genesis delay but does not allow for genesis to happen at a configurable time.\r\n\r\nSupporting configurable delay and time can be done by replacing `genesis_time=eth1_timestamp + GENESIS_DELAY` with `genesis_time=eth1_timestamp + MIN_GENESIS_DELAY + GENESIS_ALIGNMENT - eth1_timestamp % GENESIS_ALIGNMENT`.\r\n\r\n**Example 1**â€”A testnet wants genesis at 12:00 UTC with 3+ days of delay. This is achieved with `MIN_GENESIS_DELAY = 3.5 days` and `GENESIS_ALIGNMENT = 1 day`.\r\n**Example 2**â€”Alignment can be disabled by setting `GENESIS_ALIGNMENT = 1 sec`, effectively falling back to the current logic.\r\n**Example 3**â€”We can restore the invariant that mainet genesis happens at 00:00 UTC by setting `GENESIS_ALIGNMENT = 1 day` and `MIN_GENESIS_DELAY` to a multiple of 1 day.",

But what we needed was a simplification (the previous thing was a little error prone), and something that would work for testnets (midnight UTC was not working for some main contributors). I still expect it to change in the future, and for these things to inevitably involve more community feedback. So I would hold off on changing it again for now, and wait for new feedback based on larger testnet launches.",
