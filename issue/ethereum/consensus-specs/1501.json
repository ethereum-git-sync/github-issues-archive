  "body": "Recently an explicit `slot` field was added to AttestationData.\r\nAccording to [validator spec](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/validator/0_beacon-chain-validator.md#attestation-data) `attestation.data.target.epoch` should be the same as epoch of `attestation.data.slot` (because they are calculated based on the slot the validator assigned on with Attester responsibility).\r\n\r\nHowever, neither [on_attestation](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/core/0_fork-choice.md#on_attestation) nor [process_attestation](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/core/0_beacon-chain.md#attestations) ensures that.\r\nWhich makes possible for a validator to create an attestation with `data.target.epoch` different from the epoch of `data.slot`. E.g. one can use previous or next epoch as a target (relative to data.slot).\r\n\r\nWe propose to eliminate the problem by enforcing the constraint by:\r\n- either adding `assert compute_epoch_at_slot(attestation.data.slot) == attestation.data.target` to both `on_attestation` and `process_attestation` methods\r\n- or removing `AttestationData.target.epoch` field (i.e. replace `AttestationData.target` with `AttestationData.target_root`). The target `Checkpoint` can be reconstructed based on the `target_root` and `compute_epoch_at_slot(attestation.data.slot)`. `AttestationData` will occupy a bit less space in this case.\r\n\r\nIt's not clear if there is any benefit of supplying attestations with inconsistent `slot` and `target.epoch` fields.",

    "body": "This could lead to a validator, or (some subset of) committee of validators, casting a vote for a previous (or next) epoch. Although they still couldn't vote twice in an epoch without committing a slashable offense, this could lead to strange issues in accounting at the epoch boundary. It is even more worrisome in phase 2 where this issue could lead to potential manipulation of crosslinks.\r\n\r\nWe want attestations to have explicitly the `Checkpoint` they are voting on, so I will add a conditional statement to the two functions to ensure that the justified checkpoint and epoch of the assigned slot match\r\n\r\n",
