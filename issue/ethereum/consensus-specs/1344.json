  "body": "Currently, in order to understand the exact economic implications of being a validator, a very careful reading of the spec is required in order to know what the exact risks and benefits are. We want to create more transparency around this issue by adding a visual calculator, that given a number of inputs will show what the individual validator stands to gain and lose.\r\n\r\nTarget group: Individuals running validators and economists analysing Eth2.0 incentives for validators\r\n\r\nTechnology: This should probably be a web app, ideally a node module that can either run standalone or be integrated into another app such as a validator client GUI to give more information to the user\r\n\r\nInputs:\r\n - Should be a number of sliders:\r\n    - expected online time\r\n    - cost to run validator node (electricity/hardware deprecation/cloud rental)\r\n    - cost of capital\r\n    - probability of failures that lead to penalties and/or slashing (equivocation, key reveals, incorrect custody bits, missing of custody deadlines, incorrect attestations (fraud proofs))\r\n    - probability of those failures being caught by a second \"don't slash\" layer that polices validator client outputs\r\n    - probability that these failures are correlated with other validators (fraction of other validators using the same client software)\r\n    - number of competing validators (with same settings or different settings)\r\n  - Ability to load custom configurations (mainnet, testnet, etc.)\r\n\r\nOutputs:\r\n - numerical outputs showing the expected returns with variance and total probability of slashing\r\n - a graph that shows expected profits and losses as a diagram per time period\r\n - a graph that shows long-term development of the initial deposit with this expected return\r\n - a graph illustrating total ETH inflation\r\n\r\nFurther ideas on how to improve this are very welcome, this is just an initial set of ideas. The goal should be a tool that can allow people to gain a good intuition on validator rewards and penalties.",
