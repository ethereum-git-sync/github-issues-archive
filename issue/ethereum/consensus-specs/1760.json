The main reason to keep it low is due to [size considerations](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19ZGbIFaIi5quIvpB3Aa3VRgurKPBG9NMrJB7LGMBwXI/edit#gid=0) (max ~33kb per `AttesterSlashing` when 4M validators), but in lower ranges of validators (say ~300k validators) this is more like ~3kb.\r\n\r\nThe other added benefit is that it takes half the amount of time to fully slash an attacker when a serious attack is found\r\n\r\ncc: @vbuterin for thoughts on upping the value of this constant ",
