  "body": "I just realized one `get_beacon_proposer_index` call could be saved by passing in `block` as the argument to `process_randao`:\r\n```python\r\ndef process_block(state: BeaconState, block: BeaconBlock) -> None:\r\n    ...\r\n    process_randao(state, block)\r\n   ...\r\n\r\ndef process_randao(state: BeaconState, block: BeaconBlock) -> None:\r\n   ...\r\n    # Verify RANDAO reveal\r\n    # proposer = state.validators[get_beacon_proposer_index(state)]\r\n    proposer = block.proposer_index\r\n```\r\n\r\nGiven we are late in the spec game, I don't have a strong desire to modify the spec to reflect such optimization and readability improvement. I just wanted to point this out because the client code could still use this change for lesser lines and/or minor speed improvement (e.g. one less look up)\r\n",

    "body": "I think we considered this a while back and decided that because `proposer_index` is validated in `process_block_header` that we can just safely derive it in `process_randao` and not modify the function signature.\r\n\r\nI think we were aiming to reduce the amount of changes and new testing when `proposer_index` was added to `BeaconBlock`, and using the derivation from the block header satisfied that.\r\n\r\nAgree that as long as `assert block.proposer_index == get_beacon_proposer_index(state)` from `process_block_header` has passed, then both ways of deriving the `proposer_index` are safe",
