    "body": "There are a lot of nodes that don't follow this and it's not ideal but not causing major issues. If the number of nodes with open ports is low enough it has two risks:\r\n\r\n1. The efficiency of the network is reduced - nodes will find it hard to find peers because the few that can be connected to are full, and everything has to route through those nodes.\r\n2. The nodes with open ports become a centralisation risk and, if there are few enough of them, become a possible point of censorship.  Plus all the attacks which require splitting the network become significantly easier.",
