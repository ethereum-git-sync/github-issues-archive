  "body": "We collect some diagnostics about the spec test generation in this function: https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/tests/core/pyspec/eth2spec/gen_helpers/gen_base/gen_runner.py#L41\r\n\r\nThis information is logged to STDOUT but is generally not persisted anywhere.\r\n\r\nIt would be helpful for various reasons to write the output of the run to a file along w/ the test artifacts.\r\n\r\nGiven that generators are generally separate (and very likely run in parallel), I suggest two steps:\r\n\r\n1) Just write a local file with the diagnostics to the top-level generated directory for the particular generator currently running.\r\n2) Consolidate all diagnostics into one accumulator (possibly writing to a shared file w/ a file lock like https://py-filelock.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ or something)\r\n\r\nWith this information, we can do things like ensure we don't elide any previously established tests between runs of the generator. We can also provide the expected number of tests which facilitates consumers working w/ the test artifacts.",
