The input name is indeed `sync_aggregate` though.\r\n\r\nCan we make this consistent, and just pick one or the other in all places? I like `sync_aggregate` more: since there may be many other sync committee related things, but the `SyncAggregate` is the exact type we are dealing with in block processing.\r\n",
