  "body": "It has been observed in mainnet that during certain voting periods, clients choose to vote on an already included `eth1data`. This ends up making the voting period redundant, as clients voting for an already included `eth1data` and its accompanying deposit count and root does not allow newer deposits to be included. \r\n\r\nThis ends up with deposits taking longer than expected(an additional voting period) to being included.  @ajsutton has also brought up the fact that currently in the spec: https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/validator.md#eth1-data \r\n\r\n```py\r\n    default_vote = votes_to_consider[len(votes_to_consider) - 1] if any(votes_to_consider) else state_eth1_data\r\n```\r\nWe default to voting for the `state_eth1_data` if there are no other viable eth1data votes. We should instead disallow `state_eth1_data` votes and mark them as invalid when each block proposer is tallying the current votes in the state. This is so as to prefer strictly progressing `eth1_data` rather than allowing block proposers to vote for an already included `eth1_data` tuple which is in the state. This will prevent a whole voting period from being wasted and deposits from being delayed to be included, which has been show to happen in certain voting periods in mainnet.\r\n\r\nThere is limited downside to including a change such as this due to the fact this will only disallow voting for an already included on `eth1_blockhash` , so this will always lead to progressive `eth1_data` votes from each period to the next.

Admittedly it's exceptionally unlikely to be anything but a random block root but it's very easy to pick voting for the current eth1 data when querying the beacon chain without needing to also query an eth1 chain.",

    "body": "So to circle back on this - there is an interesting case I'd missed previously.  The state `eth1_data` is updated as soon as the 50% threshold is reached, so the logic for excluding the current `eth1_data` from the votes to consider is actually a bit more complex - you ignore it until until it has reached 50%.  At that point either we've already voted in a new eth1 block or there's no chance it will happen this voting period (we've had 50% default votes).\r\n\r\nThis makes me very much on the fence about which approach is better.  Random is probably simpler now, but having tested our caching I do find it unfortunate that you can't tell the difference between \"my cache is missing a block\" and \"that validator doesn't have an eth1 endpoint configured\".",
