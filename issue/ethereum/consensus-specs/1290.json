So I am hesitant in declaring a hard fork-choice requirement that ignores these cases. I think @djrtwo may have a stronger opinion on whether or not to just trust the finalized checkpoint and never looking back. Maybe it can be translated into code otherwise, and then we can have the pruning on finalization.\r\n\r\n",
