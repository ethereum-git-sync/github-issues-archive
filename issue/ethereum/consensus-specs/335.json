  "body": "Currently, the proposer rewards for attestation inclusions are calculated as follows:\r\n\r\n> For each v in previous_epoch_attesters, we determine the proposer `proposer_index = get_beacon_proposer_index(state, inclusion_slot(v))` and set `state.validator_registry[proposer_index].balance += base_reward(v) // INCLUDER_REWARD_QUOTIENT`.\r\n\r\nAre we sure this is the formula that we want?\r\n\r\nOne possible alternative is a hard and universal rule that the proposer gains 1/32 of attestation rewards that occur during state execution of their blocks. This could make economic reasoning simpler, particularly around griefing factors and cooperation incentives, and the principle could be extended to other kinds of proposer rewards that get added later on if desired.",
