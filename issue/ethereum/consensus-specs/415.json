  "body": "Hi all,\r\n\r\nLooking at the following lines in proposer and casper slashings in block operations:\r\n\r\n```\r\nVerify that validator.penalized_slot > state.slot\r\n```\r\n\r\nand\r\n```\r\nFor each validator index i in intersection run penalize_validator(state, i) if state.validator_registry[i].penalized_slot > state.slot\r\n```\r\n\r\n`validator.penalized_slot` is only updated in the `penalize_validator` function, but this function is only used in the spec if the previous conditional passes. The code above will never run as `penalized_slot` will always be the default value of `FAR_FUTURE_SLOT`. Am I missing something?",
