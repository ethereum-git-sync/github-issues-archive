  "body": "Although the Python reference implementation is not supposed to be considered normative whenever it conflicts with the contents of the phase 0 spec, many of the algorithm definitions in the spec are presented via Python code.  I think it might be helpful for new or novice readers to have a brief explanation that such code is to be interpreted merely as definitions of algorithms rather than as code that must be used verbatim in implementations.\r\n\r\nI will create a PR with my proposed text additions.",
