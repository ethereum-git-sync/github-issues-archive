    "body": "Care to respond? Note also that using Substrate in implementations may increase time to main net (or may not if starting from scratch) but has advantages such as modularity, flexibility, integration of Wasm, libp2p, GRANDPA consensus, blockchain interoperability, automatic upgradability and governance. And yes while I recognize that automatic upgradability may have issues around disenfranchising node operators from governance, having it as an option to experiment with using Sybil resistant methods seems beneficial. Having modularity with Substrate makes it easier to experiment, deploy new testnets and main nets, etc.",

    "body": "Parity is currently building a 2.0 client in substrate. Although the promise of using substrate is high, they have had to make a few modifications to the underlying framework to accommodate for the 2.0 design (for example, being able to evaluate fork choice at slot boundaries rather than just when receiving a block).\r\n\r\nI have not done a deep dive on GRANDPA but FFG and GRANDPA satisfy many of the same design goals -- finality gadget on top of a chain, safety under asynchrony, and plausible liveness. FFG is well studied and understood by the protocol researchers designing 2.0 and is already integrated into the spec. I don't expect the consensus algorithm at this point to change without a powerful argument.\r\n\r\nIt is far more likely that we switch the consensus algorithm to a different family with more desirable properties in the long term rather than switching from FFG to another finality gadget. For example, CBC for the beacon chain is under R&D, and looks promising in resolving issues that arise between the finality gadget and the fork choice.\r\n",
