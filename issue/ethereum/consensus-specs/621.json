    "body": "(1) Agreed, censorship is a lot more difficult with attestation based fork choice.\r\n(2) Note that we _do_ provide a [proposer reward for including attestations](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/master/specs/core/0_beacon-chain.md#attestation-inclusion).\r\n(3) I'd expect block proposal to happen inside a client and a validator asks for `get_block_proposal(slot)` from the client. If the client does not provide this feature, then almost assuredly validators will not use their client. \r\n(4) agreed, but not sure the dis-incentive is necessary.\r\n\r\nI lean toward not penalizing empty slots. The honest and rational validator wants a healthy network that is continually finalization and progressing. I think this plus the positive rewards for creating a block are incentive enough.\r\n\r\n",
