  "body": "###  Issue\r\nCurrently, after running test generator, we will get the summary files:\r\n```\r\nconsensus-spec-tests/tests/diagnostics.json\r\nconsensus-spec-tests/tests/diagnostics.json.lock\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese files are good for analyzing the test cases. (Thank @ralexstokes!) \r\n\r\nBut we may not want to upload these files to `consensus-spec-tests` and the tarballs. Especially when the test vectors are not generated with only one command.\r\n\r\n### Solution ideas\r\n1. Generate these files to `consensus-spec-tests/` folder rather than `consensus-spec-tests/tests/` folder\r\n    - Pros: we can have clear files\r\n    - Cons: `\"--output-dir` is `consensus-spec-tests/tests/`, it feels wrong to jump out of the given scope.\r\n2. Ignore these files in the `consensus-spec-tests` repo and allow including these files in tarballs.\r\n    - Pros: easy\r\n    - Cons: no...? just client teams have to ignore it.\r\n3. No change. Just include the diagnostics to the `consensus-spec-tests` repo and tarballs.\r\n    - Pros: easy\r\n    - Cons:\r\n        - it creates extra git diff\r\n        - `diagnostics.json` may be confusing when we generate the test vectors in separate runs. However, it may not be a problem anymore once we have the generator CI/CD soon.\r\n\r\nI usually manually delete these files when I want to generate the tarball of a specific runner. But sometimes I forget. ðŸ˜… I'm inclined to solution 2.\r\n\r\n/cc @ralexstokes  @djrtwo",
