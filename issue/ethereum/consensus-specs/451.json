  "body": "@paulhauner brought up an important point we should clarify in the spec.\r\n\r\nIf you refer to the creation of a `ValidatorRecord` in `process_deposit`, the current spec provides a `0` for the `status_flags` field.\r\n\r\nThis issue requests greater clarity around how we should handle these flags to avoid consensus issues.\r\n\r\nIs this field nullable? It seems that the use of `0` indicates \"no status flags\" and the values `1` and `2` are defined as given. It is assumed that decoding a value greater than `2` is an error.\r\n\r\nHow should we handle `0`? In keeping with the Pythonic nature of the spec code, I suggest we either set `status_flags` to `None` if the intent is \"no status flag\" or explicitly define `0` as `UNDEFINED`, `NONE` or something like this.\r\n\r\nOther thoughts?",

    "body": "I'm okay with something like `DEFAULT_EMPTY_FLAGS`. These are bitflags that should be able to be set and unset. By initializing it to something non-integer, we don't have the ability to simply flip a bit to turn on a flag. Also beacuse `ValidatorRecord` is a state object, we need to keep this field defined wrt it's SSZ types. so `None` is a non-starter.\r\n\r\nthe next flags defined (if they do become defined) would be at `4`, `8`, `16,` etc for each subsequent bit",
