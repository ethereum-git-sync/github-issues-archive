  "body": "Background: https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/issues/3849\r\n\r\nThe spec declares that the domain for all deposits should be `[0, 0, 0, 0]`. Coincidentally, that is the same domain that is used as the `fork.current_version` for all the deposits tests.\r\n\r\nIn effect, this means that the tests do not cover the case where the client passes `beacon_state.fork.current_version` to deposit signature verification instead of `[0, 0, 0, 0]`.\r\n\r\nThis can be resolved by ensuring there is at least one deposit operation test where the fork versions are not `[0, 0, 0, 0]`.",

Although not strictly necessary, it avoids this kind of confusion in the future, and makes it easy to distinguish the data from logs/debug dumps, and eliminates the possibility of this bug.\r\n\r\nWe can set a high 1 bit in one, and not in the other, and reserve this bit for this purpose.\r\n",
