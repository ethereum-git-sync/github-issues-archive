The reason `epoch` is in this seed is to enforce a new seed at a reshuffling even in the event that entire epochs of slots have been skipped (i.e. in the unlikely event that randao mix stayed the same and  active index root stayed the same).\r\n\r\n# Proposed implementation\r\nadd `epoch` into the `hash` calculation in `generate_seed`.",
