  "body": "# Abstract\r\nThe goal of this issue is to start a discussion on whether abandoning `SimpleSeralize` and replacing it with `ProtocolBuffers` is a possibility, and whether this change should be adopted.\r\n\r\n# Motivation\r\nThe reason for proposing this, would be to reduce the amount of new standards created by `eth2.0` and fallback on robust technologies with already various implementations in the languages currently being used to build `eth2.0` clients.\r\n\r\n# Changes\r\n\r\nChanges to the specification would include changing all `DataStructures` to Protocol Buffer `proto`'s, this could also help reduce the requirement of implementation as anyone would be able to generate the data structures for their specific implementation from these `proto`s.\r\n\r\nThe `hash` function could remain as is, but the way it is called could be changed. Changing it to being called with the already `byte` encoded `proto`.\r\n",

That is from a spec many moons ago, so it's very outdated!\r\n\r\nProtobuf is marginally bigger on the wire than SSZ. You'd probably want to do some more analysis before you make a firm judgement on that, though.\r\n\r\nIf we really want to see gains from proto we'd make SSZ an encode-only format. Whilst that's probably cpu-cycles-optimal, I'm not sure it's meeting-project-deadlines-optimal.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I'm fine for either SSZ or protobuf across the wire -- I'm using protos for the node API so it's minimal effort for me to switch between them.",
