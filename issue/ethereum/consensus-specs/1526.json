  "body": "Opening this PR to collect the phase 0 remainders and work that can be improved as part of phase 1 test refactoring, along with phase 1 issues that need a start somewhere to make it organizationally work.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Attestations have additional custody bitfields, but then slashings need the participants data. The indexed attestation type changes and is difficult to make compatible between phases, or even similar enough to ease testing. See the open forked branch on top of the PR for an idea.\r\n- Penalties/rewards testing is not clean, an we should aim to improve it with related phase 1 changes: we fully cover it with other general tests, but not isolated well, so edge-cases are being overlooked:\r\n  - [ ] matching penalties/rewards\r\n    - [ ] matching head: penalty, reward, none, both\r\n    - [ ] matching target: penalty, reward, none, both\r\n    - [ ] matching source: penalty, reward, none, both\r\n  - [ ] proposer inclusion delay\r\n  - [ ] inactivity penalty\r\n- [ ] Shard transitions are looking like they could pose similar problems as the rewards: a large piece that is influenced by many different other factors. Let's try to isolate it better for testing.\r\n- [ ] Changed immediate-slashing custody spec needs more review, and should then re-start testing.\r\n",
