If this is the case then the `beacon_block_hash` in `AttestationRecord` is only used locally for the fork choice and does not affect anything on chain. Does this sound correct?\r\n\r\nOne possible addition is that voting on the `beacon_block_hash` that is included the canonical chain could provide a higher reward",
