  "body": "Hi there, I saw this \"Users need to make sure their validator doesn't have downtime or they risk a quadratic leak on their stake.â€œ  Is there a way for validator to suspend service due to maintenance ? Otherwise it is quite unfair to validator who want to switch server or do maintenance job. So during the suspension period, they won't get reward.\r\n\r\nThe original proposal would scare off lots of ordinary people who want to join validators team, which requires redundant validator client.  People using their own computer to validate may encounter power off, computer upgrade. This will happen even if people use aws. \r\n\r\n",

Otherwise it is a small penalty, similar order to rewards.\r\n\r\nIt will only have a very small impact if it only happens for a few hours or a day. I generally agree that this could deter a few people from becoming validators, and I think the impact of allowing say 1 day of downtime per year would be very small. However, it's probably not worth the added complexity.\r\n",
