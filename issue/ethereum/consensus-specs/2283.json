  "body": "Opening this Issue for tracked discussion of the idea.  \r\n\r\nSynopsis: \r\nTo encourage larger participation of securing the eth2 network by not discouraging for small outages.\r\n\r\nReason: Many people try to encourage single lone node operators.  Every day mom and pop shop, if you will.  However, as a single node operator, its not uncommon to be on your own with no support - as in local support \"hey can you turn my node back on\" style of support.  Individuals might take vacations, or have other emergency situations which prohibit access to a node which may go down during a short time period.  This can be stressful.\r\n\r\nIdea:  Waiving penalty for inactivity when the network is otherwise very healthy and not negatively impacted by a few nodes being down.  The exact thresholds would need to be discussed, but just as an example, if the network has 99% + participation rate, waive the inactivity fee for any inactive nodes. \r\n\r\nRambling:  I think it would help to encourage more participation by users who may otherwise feel limited by not wanting to be on call 24x7x365 .  A node dropping out when just setting out for a long vacation, or perhaps leaving town to take care of an emergency of any kind, just adds stress.  It may seem like a small penalty and users shouldnt worry, but regardless it is stressful, and while a day or two or three may not be a big deal, it does add up.  If users had the confidence of knowing that if something happens while they're out, they dont have to immediately rush home or find a way to take care of it ASAP.  Users could exit (during later phases) and re-enter, but there are other negatives that go along with that.  It would be more likely the user just exit, an skip the re-enter portion.  \r\n\r\n  There may also be a way to give a probationary period, though that would complicate the idea.  Perhaps if a node goes down, it does not incur a fee for the first 7 days so long as the network is otherwise healthy and not negatively impacted.  Just an idea, something that could be hashed out further.  The idea here is to start a discussion.",
