'labour' cost of operation needs factoring in.... (Opportunity cost and risk should be factored in too I guess.)\r\n\r\nAnd I'm assuming you're talking about costs for the setup and running of beacon nodes and not just validator clients - referring to: https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/issues/157\r\n\r\nEDIT: I don't think bandwidth on its own offers much as an indicator of total costs - unless it's v. high of course (and I'd guess only the top tier nodes could require high bandwidth).

If it is realistic to run 5-10 validators per “node” (maybe host is a better term here?) and the cost of additional validators is insignificant vs the cost of 1 (e.g. cost of compute resources for 1V is the brunt of the expense), then we should be able to estimate a cost and model out a viable interest rate accordingly.",
