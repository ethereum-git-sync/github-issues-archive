  "body": "[EIP-165](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165) provides a way for inspecting what interfaces contracts support.\r\n\r\nIts use is picking up across contracts, but to name one big user, ENS, which has been using it since its inception. I also expect more users since Solidity's next release will contain some language level features to facilitate it more.\r\n\r\nConsidering there may be a \"deposit contract proxy\" which implements signature validation, there may be even more usefulness for such a feature.\r\n\r\nThe main benefit I can see is promoting the use of standard interfaces, while it puts a really small burden on the contract. The only addition is a new function, `supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) -> bool`, which returns true in two cases only:\r\na) `interfaceId` equals to function selector of `supportsInterface`\r\nb) `interfaceId` equals to the function selector of `deposit`\r\n\r\n(We may need to consider whether the getter functions (`get_deposit_root` and `get_deposit_count`) are part of the public interface or not, if they are, the interfaceId of the deposit contract would be the xor of the three selectors. I considered them not part since the [specification only lists `deposit`](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/deposit-contract.md).)\r\n",
