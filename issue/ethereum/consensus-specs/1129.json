  "body": "- [x] 1. **Unify repos**: Move deposit contract to `eth2.0-specs` repo. See #1127.\r\n- [x] 2. **Remove `Eth2Genesis`**: Rely on a more flexible genesis trigger, external to deposit contract. (Also reduces line count from 140 to 120.) See also #1048.\r\n- [x] 3. **Remove `merkle_tree_index`**: See #1122.\r\n- [x] 4. **Cleanups**: Consistent comment formatting, linting, more comments, etc.\r\n- [x] 5. **Gas profiling**: Understand where gas is spent and check there is no significant wastage. See #1150.\r\n- [x] 6. (*post-freeze discussion*) **Formal verification**: Opcode-level formal verification to start in June by [Runtime Verification](https://runtimeverification.com/).\r\n- [x] 7. (*post-freeze discussion*) **Wait for BLS standardisation**: Various details (G1/G2 point serialisation ambiguity, cipher-suite bits, proof of possession standard, etc.) need to figured out before deployment.\r\n- [ ] 8. (*post-freeze discussion*) **Deployment address**: Agree on mechanism to generate deployment address (e.g. use CREATE2 or not), and clearly communicate to public. (Want to avoid scam/fake deposit contracts.)\r\n- [ ] 9. (*post-freeze discussion*) **Deploy early**: Deploy ahead of target Eth2 genesis, even if less than two clients are production ready. Suggested deposit contract deployment target: end of Q3 2019 (30 September). Suggested Eth2 genesis target: 3 January 2020 at 00:00 UTC (Bitcoin's 11'th anniversary).",

    "body": "No, there currently aren't issues tracking them, but I don't necessarily think there should be.\r\n\r\n8. I am hesitant to use `CREATE2` or at very least to define the salt ahead of time because it would allow someone to launch the \"official\" deposit contract ahead of time. This could lead to loss of funds if users use incorrect tooling that is not pointing to the correct address, uses the incorrect BLS standard etc. I don't see the benefit of using `CREATE2` and deploying later instead of just deploying the contract.\r\n\r\nMore generally, there is an argument to be made here that we should have a deployment procedure. These normally include constructer arguments for contract initialisation, compiler versions, and contract deployment order. The simplicity of the deposit contract means that aside from compiler version (`b13-hotfix`), these requirements are not relevant. Communicating the address with the public is the harder process and has been further complicated by the cancellation of all conferences.\r\n\r\n9. As @q9f stated, I think it is too soon to have this discussion.",
