    "body": "EIP-6466, SSZ receipts, is incredibly impactful for its small scope: it makes receipt-proving a lot more viable.\r\n\r\nCurrently EVM receipts just concatenate log events of completely different contracts, which means applications have no control over their ability to make their log event provable without the user having to prove a potentially multi-megabyte preimage (worst-case does not fit in EVM).\r\nThat said, merkleizing to separate log events, each with their contract address source as a mix-in, would also work for some use-cases. \r\n\r\nEdit: also, apologies for posting here, there's a longer thread of SSZ related comments here. Happy to move it all into eth-magicians forum if this isn't the right place.",

Geth is the only EL with an install base that can finalize a fake-valid block, so it would have to be the only one providing efficient `eth_getProof` access while processing `engine_newPayload` (before `engine_forkchoiceUpdated`).",
