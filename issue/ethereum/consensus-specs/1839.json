  "body": "Apparently, the `ETH1_FOLLOW_DISTANCE` of `1024` is greater than the default pruning history of the ETH1 clients. This leads to issues (e.g., ref https://github.com/PegaSysEng/teku/issues/1813) where ETH2 clients won't be able to read historical ETH1 data that has been pruned already.\r\n\r\nDefault pruning values:\r\n* Geth  `128`\r\n    ```\r\n\tbodyCacheLimit      = 256\r\n\tblockCacheLimit     = 256\r\n\treceiptsCacheLimit  = 32\r\n\ttxLookupCacheLimit  = 1024\r\n\tmaxFutureBlocks     = 256\r\n\tmaxTimeFutureBlocks = 30\r\n\tbadBlockLimit       = 10\r\n\tTriesInMemory       = 128\r\n\tBlockChainVersion uint64 = 7\r\n    ```\r\n* OpenEthereum `128`\r\n    ```\r\n    --pruning=[METHOD]\r\n        Configure pruning of the state/storage trie. METHOD may be one of auto, archive, fast: archive - keep all state\r\n        trie data. No pruning. fast - maintain journal overlay. Fast but 50MB used. auto - use the method most recently\r\n    --pruning-history=[NUM]\r\n        Set a minimum number of recent states to keep in memory when pruning is active. (default: 128)\r\n    --pruning-memory=[MB]\r\n        within this limit, and at least --pruning-history states will always be kept. (default: 64)\r\n    ```\r\n* Besu `1024`\r\n    ```\r\n      --pruning-block-confirmations=<INTEGER>\r\n                             Minimum number of confirmations on a block before\r\n                               marking begins (default: 10)\r\n      --pruning-blocks-retained=<INTEGER>\r\n                             Minimum number of recent blocks for which to keep\r\n                               entire world state (default: 1024)\r\n      --pruning-enabled      Enable disk-space saving optimization that removes\r\n                               old state that is unlikely to be required\r\n                               (default: true if fast sync is enabled, false\r\n                               otherwise)\r\n    ```\r\n\r\nEven with Besu's `1024` we would be always on the edge of getting this pruned right away once we need it.\r\n\r\nI would encourage the OpenEthereum and Geth teams to increase the default value to `1024`, however, there will be valid arguments against that, especially because in most cases they are retained in memory.\r\n\r\nForthermore -- and unfortunately -- it's not possible to customize this value in Geth. Meaning, to provide your own ETH1 endpoint for an ETH2 client, you would have to run an archive node or use a third-party client.\r\n\r\nWhat were the considerations leading to an `ETH1_FOLLOW_DISTANCE` of `1024`? Would it be possible to consider a lower follow distance, e.g. `512`? Shall we approach ETH1 client teams to bump defaults?",
