  "body": "Currently beacon chain blocks are hashed as monoliths. This is not friendly to light clients because beacon chain blocks could be quite large (as currently specced, `attestations` and `specials` are unbounded arrays of records).\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is to hash the individual fields in a `BeaconChainBlock` (of which there are 8) and then consider those as leaves of a Merkle tree. We then replace `ancestor_hashes`, `oblique_parent_hashes`, `justified_block_hash`, etc. with `ancestor_roots`, `oblique_parent_roots`, `justified_block_root`, etc.\r\n",
