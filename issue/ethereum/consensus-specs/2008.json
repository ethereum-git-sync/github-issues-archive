    "body": "> It looks like there isn't currently an application callback on identify\r\n\r\nThe Go Host API hides the IDService getter, but it's there if you cast an interface to access it. And that can then be used to actively call for identification on a connection, and wait for a response. The default host implementation forces identify to be enabled, and run a check on every dial and stream open. Without an option to disable it (at least without forking all host code, like I did in Rumor). There was a comment somewhere in the default \"basic\"-host implementation about it being faster to have identify run first, than doing negotiation otherwise.\r\n\r\nOnce the identification completes, it sneakily puts the identified info (keys `ProtocolVersion` and `AgentVersion`) into the generic keystore part (`/metadata/<base 32 peer id>/` prefix). The `ProtocolVersion` in go-libp2p is hardcoded as a constant to `ipfs/0.1.0` and warns about breaking IPFS before 2020, and with legacy/todo comments. And while the spec specifies that different major/minor protocol versions are strictly unusable together, I can't find the place where this is enforced on a connection. The agent version seems to be unused.\r\n\r\nIf we go ahead with this, I wouldn't mind to discuss a libp2p-identify update that improves on this situation, to make it user-friendly before enshrining it more.\r\n",
