  "body": "When applying proposer rewards within an epoch transition in `get_justification_and_finalization_deltas`, we need to get the proposer index from the _previous_ epoch. Right now there is an assertion in `get_beacon_proposer_index` that it has to be from the current epoch. This was added when we changed the sampling of proposer to be based upon balance because the balance can only be deterministically know in the current epoch.\r\n\r\nIf we remove the assertion, we can't guarantee that the proposer we fetch from the previous epoch is actually correct (although it will be 99.9% of the time).\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Proposer bonus\r\nif index in get_attesting_indices(state, state.previous_epoch_attestations):\r\n    proposer_index = get_beacon_proposer_index(state, inclusion_slot(state, index))\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef get_beacon_proposer_index(state: BeaconState,\r\n                              slot: Slot) -> ValidatorIndex:\r\n    current_epoch = get_current_epoch(state)\r\n    assert slot_to_epoch(slot) == current_epoch\r\n```\r\n\r\nGoing to bed. Will think about this tomorrow",
