  "body": "One recent major event that showed the strengths of Nakamoto Consensus for Bitcoin was the [CVE-2018-17144](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2018/09/20/notice/) flaw, which allowed for those who structure the block (pools) to include an invalid TX in a block that would generate more supply.\r\n\r\nThe flaw wasn't publicly reported for 2 years, and took the dev team about a day to patch it.\r\nOne certain reason why it was not exploited was due to only the pools being capable of doing so, and performing such an action would ruin their reputation as a reliable pool.\r\n\r\nWhat is there in ETH 2.0 to disincentivize exploiting this? What if Bob discovers a flaw and doesn't report it, and then scripts his validator to exploit it the moment it has the proper role to? \r\n\r\nIf there are major flaws that can go unnoticed for 2 years, he could easily just have a small percentage of validators and eventually get to the position needed to exploit it. \r\n\r\nIt can be argued that they'll risk losing the value of their staked ETH although if they're performing this secretly and carefully people might not find out until its too late, Bob also doesn't need to have a large amount of validator power to exploit it, he mainly needs to wait until his slot to propose in this case. \r\n\r\nWhat is there to detect a flaw like this? Bitcoin didn't have anything to detect it but we know it hasn't been violated. \r\n",

Multiple clients would certainly help in some way though.\r\n\r\nRegardless, the question was more about why _shouldn't_ a validator exploit a bug? If they have no liability as a validator and can guarantee that they'll have a position as a attester or valitdator during some slot, what is there against them from doing that? Nakamoto Consensus relies more on \"you shouldnt\" than \"you'll get punished\" and it certainly stood the test of time so far.",
