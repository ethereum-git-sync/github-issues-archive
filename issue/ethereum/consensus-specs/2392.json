  "body": "This paragraph in the [validator guide](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/v1.1.0-alpha.3/specs/altair/validator.md#lookahead) implies that sync committees can't be computed except at the period boundary:\r\n\r\n> Note: The data required to compute a given committee is not cached in the `BeaconState` after committees are calculated at the period boundaries. This means that calling `get_sync_commitee()` in a given epoch can return a different result than what was computed during the relevant epoch transition. For this reason, always get committee assignments via the fields of the `BeaconState` (`current_sync_committee` and `next_sync_committee`) or use the above reference code.\r\n\r\nHowever I don't think this is the case, because the sync committee indices  only rely on:\r\n\r\n1. The seed from the `base_epoch`, which is <1024 epochs back (we have 64k epochs of history in the `randao_mixes` vec)\r\n2. The active validators at the same `base_epoch`, which can be computed accurately at any epoch after the `base_epoch`\r\n\r\nFurther, the state transition _relies_ on recomputing the sync committees in arbitrary epochs: in [`process_sync_committee`](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/v1.1.0-alpha.3/specs/altair/beacon-chain.md#sync-committee-processing) a call is made to `get_sync_committee_indices`.\r\n\r\nThe reason for my deep-dive on this issue is that in Lighthouse we've implemented a cache for the committee indices, which can get recomputed at arbitrary points (e.g. if a state is loaded from the DB and lacks the cache it could be built anew). I just wanted to check that we're not missing something that would make this unsound.",

    "body": "> the sync committee indices only rely on:\r\n\r\nthat computation also relies on `effective_balance` which we don't keep historical record of in the `state`. this is the same as with the proposer shufflings and why validators should re-compute proposer shufflings every epoch (rather than say w/ 1 epoch of lookahead) -- its a small chance but the `effective_balance` *could* change enough to shift the shuffling.\r\n\r\nthis rationale inspired the note in the validator guide where you don't have any lookahead on the sync committee shufflings other than 1 sync committee period bc we track the \"next\" committee.\r\n\r\n>  the state transition relies on recomputing the sync committees \r\n\r\nthis may be a bug! we may need to do a 'pubkey to index' lookup here based on `state.current_sync_committee` rather than use `get_sync_committee_indices`.",
