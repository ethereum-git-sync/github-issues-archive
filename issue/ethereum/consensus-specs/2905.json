  "body": "There was some discussion  on #2862 around if *all* validators or just \"active and not slash\" validators should receive partial withdrawals. See discussion here for context -- https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/2862#discussion_r834511282\r\n\r\nI believe that it's easier to spec and test with *all* and not damaging, but I would like to hear more comments here.\r\n\r\nSome notes (from the linked to comments) about what happens when non-active and/or slashed validators get partial withdrawals\r\n* not-yet-activated && balance above 32 -- will be partially withdrawn immediately upon activation\r\n* slashed -- they cannot lose more than 32 eth (in most cases) so any excess will become withdrawn anyway\r\n* exited-but-not-withdrawn -- restricting this just adds additional complexity and testing on this condition for near zero value. the amount of load induced by partial withdrawals is bound and will almost certainly always use the max-per-epoch (assuming a minimum number of 0x01 credentials). So the cost on the system of these types of withdrawals is 0 and the impact on limiting other validators access to partial withdrawals is low.\r\n\r\nThe one argument that might be worth entertaining is that it restricts the set to just active validators that might have their balances changed via this mechanism which maybe makes some engineering assumptions easier. That said, i believe this is invalidated due to slashing to non-active validators and due to the inactivity leak given to slashed validators.",
