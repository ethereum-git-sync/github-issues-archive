  "body": "The current state transition function structure (as #1018 makes clear) is:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef state_transition(state: BeaconState, block: BeaconBlock) -> BeaconBlock:\r\n    # Process slots (including those with no blocks) since block\r\n    process_slots(state, block.slot)\r\n    # Process block\r\n    process_block(state, block)\r\n    # Return post-state\r\n    return state\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef process_slots(state: BeaconState, slot: Slot) -> None:\r\n    assert state.slot < slot\r\n    while state.slot < slot:\r\n        process_slot(state)\r\n        # Process epoch on the last slot of every epoch\r\n        if (state.slot + 1) % SLOTS_PER_EPOCH == 0:\r\n            process_epoch(state)\r\n        state.slot += 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice on the last slot of every epoch, i.e. when `(state.slot + 1) % SLOTS_PER_EPOCH == 0`, `process_epoch` is run before `process_block`. This is bad because the attestations (and other operations such as eth1 votes) in the last block are ignored by `process_epoch`.\r\n\r\nMy best guess is that we want something like:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef state_transition(state: BeaconState, block: BeaconBlock) -> BeaconBlock:\r\n    assert state.slot < block.slot\r\n    while state.slot < block.slot:\r\n        process_slot(state)\r\n        if (state.slot + 1) == block.slot:\r\n            process_block(state, block)\r\n        if (state.slot + 1) % SLOTS_PER_EPOCH == 0:\r\n            process_epoch(state)\r\n        state.slot += 1\r\n    return state\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice that we are actually quite constrained:\r\n\r\n1) `process_slot` must come first, to \"catch up\" the skip slots\r\n2) `process_block` must come before the final `process_epoch` as highlighted by this issue\r\n\r\nThe above two imply that we want `process_slot`, then `process_block`, then the final `process_epoch`.",
