  "body": "I'm suggesting that we add a maximum date (Dec. 15 2020) for the Genesis event. This would mean that eth2 genesis kicks off even if we don't hit the required minimum deposit amount (524,288 ETH) in the current spec.\r\n\r\nThe main reasoning for a minimum amount is to fend off gatekeeper attacks. However, the analysis for 524,288 was done with ETH price was at $80 and current distribution of stake on the eth2 side [looks good](https://beaconcha.in/validators/eth1leaderboard).",

Today I observe a universe of ETH holders that want to participate in genesis but simply need more time to determine their set ups or provider choice. Allowing 1 more month to deposit only makes genesis stronger. Lastly, the threshold should remain at 524,288 to avoid any discussions of a gate keeper attack. \r\n\r\nHappy to see this being proposed and discussed.",

I very much recall a hardfork that happened late December a year or so ago and many core developers were very unhappy about it. I would not underestimate how many people are tuning off end of December either and I personally care much more about core devs mental health than market sentiment around \"which year did ETH2.0 launch?\".\r\n\r\nI can guarantee that the week or two after it goes live will be very stressful for those closely involved, both devs and validators. Going live on December 15th could very well ruin a much needed vacation during one of the worst year in recent decades.",

    "body": "> However, the analysis for 524,288 was done with ETH price was at $80\r\n\r\nI also want to call this into question. ETH hasn't been $80 since 2017 and even at the lowest point this year the weighted-average price was $95.69 according to [CMC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/). Also, the USD is not the foundation of Ethereum's security; ETH is. USD crashing this year alongside a [42% M1 inflation](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1) should not lower our security standard; we should ignore the ETH/USD market in this decision. I suspect there is no thread discussing this threshold that values ETH at $80. The number seems to have been chosen to make the current insufficient balance seem sufficient by denominating it in USD, but when the real numbers are used the pseudo-threshold is no-longer met.\r\n\r\n> Depositing into a contract without knowing when it will launch is too abstract for many potential validators and keeping them on the sidelines.\r\n\r\nThis is a more compelling reason to set a deadline. The indefinite wait has unbounded opportunity costs. We are more likely to reach the threshold if there is a deadline.\r\n\r\nSetting the deadline will effectively set the launch date, and so the timing should revolve around validators and engineers instead of apparent popular demand.",

This affects the \"waiting for genesis\" logic, which is a known hot-spot for bugs. We've seen lots of mistakes in this area in the past; IIRC one team had a critical issue as recent as the Toledo launch.\r\n\r\n*If* we did do this, it will make a much more compelling argument to start the clients from a known genesis state instead of listening to the eth1 chain.\r\n\r\nMy preferred course of action is:\r\n\r\n1. Don't add a maximum genesis time.\r\n1. Leave `MIN_GENESIS_ACTIVE_VALIDATOR_COUNT` at 16,384 for the rest of 2020.\r\n1. If we haven't met genesis by 2021, drop `MIN_GENESIS_ACTIVE_VALIDATOR_COUNT` to a value decided then.\r\n\r\nI prefer this course of action for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n- It avoids making last-minute changes to historically buggy code.\r\n- For the community, the commitment to launch in 2020 if we get 16k validators is upheld.\r\n- For the developers, we don't force a major event to occur a week before xmas (Lighthouse already has core staff with leave scheduled on the 15th Dec).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this course of action means that we *might* get genesis on Dec 25th if someone(s) decides to drop a couple of hundred million USD into the deposit contract. This would be pretty terrible, but we already signed ourselves up for this and I find it hard to imagine that there's that much ETH out there wishing to ruin the developers holidays and launch Eth2 with a handicap.",

    "body": "> > However, the analysis for 524,288 was done with ETH price was at $80\r\n> \r\n> I also want to call this into question. ETH hasn't been $80 since 2017 and even at the lowest point this year the weighted-average price was $95.69 according to [CMC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/). Also, the USD is not the foundation of Ethereum's security; ETH is. USD crashing this year alongside a [42% M1 inflation]\r\n\r\nIMO price is not the only reason here. Another big reason is that many people do not want to lock a high risk/high return asset for two years.\r\n\r\nA typical investor will invest, say, 1% of the portfolio in crypto as high-risk/high-return asset class.  Then the investor will want to be able to sell the asset fast if a bubble forms.\r\n\r\nIf there is a crypto bubble in 2021 (which it may well be), and ETH goes up, say 4 times, then a 20% return may not be a good deal in exchange for not being able to sell at the peak of the bubble.  \r\n\r\nThe true ETH believers may not think like that, but for many of them, 32 ETH is simply too much money. An ability to create pools for small investors could have been added into ETH deposit contract.\r\n\r\nWe are adding such pools to SKALE.",

    "body": "@jdetychey Good idea, EF guaranteeing 1 Dec launch would eliminate all problems from changing node logic. That would be the best solution, assuming it's actually possible on the EF's side. I don't think exiting validation or giving funds to node teams is a necessary part - funding arrangements seem like something completely separate and complicate the idea. Ideally, EF would only spend staking income, I think, so it would be best if they continue validating on their own as long as possible.\r\nAt the current balance, EF would have 141k eth1 left till withdrawals become possible, which looking at past spending should be more than enough - a number that's certain to rise as people deposit.\r\n\r\nOne possible counterargument is centralization of validators - but any decentralization of validators at low eth numbers is a mirage. As long as entities with holdings large enough to take control exist, they can deposit and take control anyway, so large friendly entities not depositing change nothing in this regard. Therefore, I don't think it's a correct counterargument.\r\n\r\nOther eth whales also could also help guarantee the 1 Dec launch by publicly committing to deposit the difference up to their individual maximum before the cutoff date.\r\n\r\nedit: in addition, EF or other ethdev-related people/entities staking a lot of ethers could increase general confidence that a merge is going to happen in a reasonable amount of time.",

    "body": "We are trying to co-ordinate [hopefully] thousands of individuals, many of whom have never participated in testnets or staked and need to purchase hardware as well as get to grips with the very basics of ETH2. A \"come what may\" fixed launch date as proposed provides the community with a clear target to work towards. Humans will always say they need more time, but deadlines are motivating. In any case, it certainly makes the messaging and coordination around this enormous effort that much easier. \r\n\r\nIt will also prevent the economically driven dithering that many speculate is occurring, from continuing and adds an additional economic incentive (FOMO) for those that find that kind of thing helpful. It's possible that even the announcement of a date would precipitate an enormous surge in deposits and result in us reaching the original target anyway. \r\n\r\nIf you are going to do this then 15th of December is as good a target as any, and keeps us well within the EOY goal with a bit of room if something goes wrong. \r\n\r\n\r\n+1 ",

    "body": "I wouldnt set a maximum date. **Rather agree on a date where measures will be discussed** how to properly start the chain. For example, on Jan 1st 2021 Beacon Chain has not launched and barely any deposits are made anymore, so we sit together and think about lowering the minimum genesis validator count. If we agree on it, the chain might just launch with lets say 5000 validators which might be hit the following days. There is no necessasity of a maximum date.",
