Perhaps I'll bring it one step further: while a BLS implementation may be internal to the Beacon Chain spec itself, how the specific BLS library each implementer uses should handle all of the BLS arithmetic, meaning the Beacon Chain itself does not have to worry with much more than storing and comparing BLS pubkeys/sigs. Therefore: \r\n\r\nwhy are the BLS types defined as uint384's as opposed to bytes48 in the Beacon Chain spec? ",
