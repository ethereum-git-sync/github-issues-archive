  "body": "We should consider adding a type `Bigint`, which exists as a wrapper over `bytes` (itself a wrapper over `[uint8]`), except with the validity condition that it cannot have leading zero bytes (so as in eth1, 0 would be represented as `b''`, not `b'\\x00'`).\r\n\r\nThe immediate use case I am thinking of is generalized indices in [the light client spec](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/b91dfd6244f7196827a311d879aa29ad7eb83f05/specs/light_client/merkle_proofs.md) (the \"indices\" array should be `[BigInt]`, not`[\"uint64\"]` to be able to handle deep SSZ objects), but there are other possible use cases in the future, particularly if SSZ is used as an ABI for bigints for cryptographic operations, and also coin balances.",
