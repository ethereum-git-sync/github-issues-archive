  "body": "A super dumbed down way of thinking about beacon nodes vs validator clients is geth and geth attach. \r\n\r\nIn that regard, a beacon node (which will bear the bulk of work in the beacon chain) will be passing data onto validators who do their magic and pass it back. The incentive for running validators (which can \"attach\" to a local beacon node, or a hosted one) is clear - stake is in the system, and \"block rewards\" are added to a validator's balance (though I think it should be a separate balance, not to increase the vote and power of a validator the longer they are in the system). But what is the incentive for running beacon nodes if they can run without validators and (anyone's) validators can just connect to them? \r\n\r\n@JustinDrake ~mentioned something curious in his talk at Devcon - that Infura would be running beacon nodes~ (looks like maybe it wasn't him? Anyone remember who it was?). I understand from my discussion with @djrtwo that he may have meant superfull archive nodes that can serve rent-expired restoration purposes and also sync all shards all the time, and validators would then be connecting to such nodes, but regardless of the type of node that was implied there for beacon nodes, I don't see the incentive for running beacon nodes + validators as opposed to just validators and hooking onto someone else's beacon node. I see this as a replay of the problem we have now - too few people running full nodes with LES slots for light clients to attach to.\r\n\r\nSo I'd like to open up a discussion on beacon node incentivization. Am I missing something, has this been discussed somewhere? If so, I would appreciate if someone could point me to the relevant discussion.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\n- https://our.status.im/two-point-oh-the-beacon-chain/\r\n- https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs\r\n- https://hackmd.io/s/rJl05Lk6X#\r\n- https://notes.ethereum.org/s/BkSZAJNwX",

    "body": "Something doesn't sit right here. If we want validators running on smaller, weaker devices, then we're obviously aiming to decentralize staking and network security across their globe - including those in 2.5th and maybe 3rd world countries. They will almost certainly not be running Beacon nodes to connect their validator(s) to (cost, bandwidth, network stability) especially because privacy and ddos resistance goes out the window then. \r\n\r\nThe whole point as I understood it was to have Beacon nodes provided by _someone_ and others who want to validate to connect to them. This results in a public service provider and private validators as service consumers. If I'm running my own Beacon node to power my own validators clients (if I can afford to run a Beacon node) then validator privacy means nothing because someone taking down my Beacon node takes down my validators too. There should absolutely be a way to whitelist beacons and to connect to them round-robin or fallback-style, and if one of them is the validator's own node, that's fine.\r\n\r\nIt just doesn't feel attack resistant enough to have the validator run everything - not just their own beacon, but their own VDF ASIC too. It's a technical mess that excludes citizens from validation imo.\r\n\r\nEdit for @crsCR: [A discussion about node types](https://ethresear.ch/t/node-types-in-ethereum-2-0/3668) and [something else](https://notes.ethereum.org/ypOe_OtHTy-Vnx2IAHbKjA)\r\n\r\n<sub>Sent with <a href=\"http://githawk.com\">GitHawk</a></sub>",

    "body": "I don't think this is being discussed enough. On the latest 2.0 call, it was briefly touched on but all the discussion seems to have amounted to is \"We hope it won't be a problem\", which to me seems like the exact opposite of how things usually work in Eth.\r\n\r\nI would like to once again bring attention to this and ask for feedback from @vbuterin, @djrtwo and @JustinDrake who seem most knowledgeable on the topic.\r\n\r\nMy main concern is the creation of SaaS beacon nodes providing data to validators. These SaaS nodes can charge for this service if not directly incentivized by the network (the topic of this issue), but they centralize the new Ethereum heavily into Infura-like entities again. We could additionally incentivize validators to run their own beacon nodes, so that they get lower latency or whatnot, but this destroys the concept of validator privacy because attacking a validator's own beacon node (which is public) == attacking their validators, at least DoS-wise.\r\n\r\nAn alternative in this case would be having a fallback list of nodes provided by others to which the validator can connect in case the primary beacon node dies and thus would keep its liveness, preventing slashing despite the beacon node being DoSed, but there's an additional attack vector there in that everyone would probably have the same fallback list and thus in the event of network-wide DoS on a specific client, everyone would auto-switch to something like Infura, which is a problem if Infura can't handle it, is down, or is compromised itself and turned into a saboteour.\r\n\r\nOne way around this is implementing a way to whitelist a set of nodes that validators grab data from, go through them round-robin seeded by the RANDAO randomness, and make sure that every time the primary beacon node dies, the next one selected is truly random, but this again throws the concept of validator privacy away, and brings into question incentivization of beacon nodes.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I think this warrants further discussion and would kindly ask for feedback or clarification if I'm getting something wrong.",

Adequately? \r\n\r\nAnyways, you can only ask questions so many times without coming to the conclusion that a lack of answering means the response is in someways negative... Sorry, but I don't think relying on blind faith and altruism is going to suffice - if that's the plan. (Nobody seems to want to properly explain a different plan - if there is one.) \r\n\r\nAs a practical example, I run a node now but I don't hold any ETH and won't buy any to allow my validating PoS unless I judge it to be safe, relatively economically viable and ethically sound. Sooner or later, the realities (whatever they are) of validating the proposed ETH PoS will take effect - better sooner, IMO, for everyone's sake.",
