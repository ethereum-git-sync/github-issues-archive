  "body": "Hi folks,\r\n\r\nI'm poking around here looking specifically for rationales related to issuance rates. So far it appears the repo contains *only* specification, is that correct? Is there a different home for higher-level *design* (not just spec) that contains rationale?\r\n\r\nIMO having rationales in-repo would be incredibly helpful to ensure the spec & rationales are \"patched\" coherently. Would submitting a PR that starts a rationale doc be helpful?",
