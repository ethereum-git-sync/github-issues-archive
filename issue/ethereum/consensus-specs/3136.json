  "body": "**Problem**\r\n\r\nCurrently the point evaluation precompile does not require the input point and the claimed value to be reduced.\r\n\r\nSee: https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/a1e46d1ae47dd9d097725801575b46907c12a1f8/specs/eip4844/polynomial-commitments.md#verify_kzg_proof\r\n\r\n`bytes_to_bls_field` will take a a 32 byte array and will reduce it without checking if the value when interpreted as an integer is less than the modulus.\r\n\r\nThis introduces malleability concerns because the value for `z` and `y` are not fixed. I don't know of any complicated attack vectors except for assuming `z` and `y` are unique, though there is no reason to avoid it altogether and ensure that `z` and `y` are less than the modulus \r\n\r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\n\r\nOne solution is to introduce a new function named `reduced_bytes_to_bls_field` which asserts that the bytes given as input will be reduced.\r\n\r\n**Breaking Change Solution**\r\n\r\nAnother solution is to copy the Rust philosophy, which makes the `unsafe` operation more verbose.\r\n\r\nIn this way, we would change `bytes_to_bls_field` to assert that the bytes are reduced, then introduce another method named `unreduced_bytes_to_bls_bls_field` which will do the reduction",
