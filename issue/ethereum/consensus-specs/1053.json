  "body": "- [x] 1. **Executable spec**: Make the fork choice spec executable.\r\n- [ ] 2. (*post-freeze discussion*) **Maximum reversions**: Enshrine dynamic weak subjectivity reversion period into fork choice rule (\"second finality mechanism\").\r\n- [x] 3. **Slashed validators**: Decide whether slashed validators should be ignored or not. (Current inclination is to not ignore slashed validators.)\r\n- [x] 4. **Eth1 validity**: Explicitly require the Eth1 fork pointed to by `state. latest_eth1_data` to be valid and available.\r\n- [x] 5. **Manual forks**: Specify how manual forks are enacted and the corresponding interaction with `state.fork`.\r\n- [x] 6. **Genesis event**: Revisit how the genesis event is defined, especially if `Eth2Genesis` is removed from the deposit contract (see #1048). Formalise the genesis event in the fork choice rule.\r\n- [x] 7. (*post-freeze discussion*) **Flip-flop attack hardening**: Decide if there is anything actionable regarding [flip-flop attacks](https://ethresear.ch/t/beacon-chain-casper-mini-spec/2760/19).\r\n- [x] 8. (*post-freeze discussion*) **Revisit `SECONDS_PER_SLOT`**: Potentially increase to 8 or 12 seconds.\r\n- [x] 9. **Clocking**: Formalise the notion of an \"honest clock\", e.g. maximum drift from \"real\" time. Decide if there is anything actionable from [this research post](https://ethresear.ch/t/network-latency-based-clocks-and-their-limits/2053).\r\n- [x] 10. **Tie breakers**: Make sure the fork choice is always well-defined. In particular, check that all ties are broken. For example, \"Let `finalized_head` be the finalized block with the highest epoch.\" is not well-defined if there are two finalized heads with the highest epoch.",
