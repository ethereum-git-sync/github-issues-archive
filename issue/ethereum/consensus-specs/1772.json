    "body": "Hi @JuliusBrain \r\nGood question! Backgroud story: if we use `bytes32`:\r\n1. If input `len(withdrawal_credentials) > 32`, it's clear that EVM would throw an error.\r\n2. However, if `len(withdrawal_credentials) < 32`, EVM (or maybe the tooling?) would pad zeroes and it's still a valid input. Although it would throw other error from the on chain Merkle tree validation with `deposit_data_root`.\r\n\r\nBack to 2019, we didn't include `deposit_data_root` validation checks on chain. So we parameterized `WITHDRAWAL_CREDENTIALS_LENGTH` to do `assert len(withdrawal_credentials) == WITHDRAWAL_CREDENTIALS_LENGTH` check clearly.\r\n\r\nI'd say for the spec stability, it's fine to keep this check unless we want to fix some major bug then we can refactor it all together.",
