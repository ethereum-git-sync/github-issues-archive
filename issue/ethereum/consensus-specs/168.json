  "body": "On creation of a new account, an optional secondary account without the need of a key can be created with which a smart contract is attached. In the case of a forgotten password or lost key, the contract can restrict the usage of the secondary account so much that it would not be worth the trouble of using if it is not yours. An example would be to list two accounts that ether can be sent to and a very low maximum usage per week.  This is to keep funds from being completely lost and all this can only be determined on creation of the account and not in the aftermath including whether there is a secondary account or not. To keep anybody from transferring the funds of other accounts into other secondary accounts, if someone is in possession of their own private key and password, they can return those funds back to the primary account and send those funds all in one easy transaction.",
