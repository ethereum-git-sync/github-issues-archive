  "body": "I am studying the light client specs and have some confusion. I don't know where can I get explained and can only post my confusion here (sorry if here is not the appropriate place).\r\n\r\nFrom the [altair/light-client/sync-protocol.md](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/altair/light-client/sync-protocol.md#lightclientupdate) it seems that `LightClientOptimisticUpdate` and `LightClientFinalityUpdate` will be converted to `LightClientUpdate` and be processed in the same method. Why do we distinguish them? Especially for  `LightClientUpdate` and `LightClientFinalityUpdate`, the difference is that the latter does not have `next_sync_committee` and `next_sync_committee_branch`. Why can't we get the `next_sync_committee`, as it has been finalized? If so, then these type is the same.\r\n\r\nAlso, the doc [`altair/light-client/light-client.md`](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/altair/light-client/light-client.md) says\r\n\r\n> When `finalized_period + 1 >= current_period`, the light client keeps observing [`LightClientFinalityUpdate`](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/altair/light-client/sync-protocol.md#lightclientfinalityupdate) and [`LightClientOptimisticUpdate`](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/altair/light-client/sync-protocol.md#lightclientoptimisticupdate). Received objects are passed to [`process_light_client_finality_update`](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/altair/light-client/sync-protocol.md#process_light_client_finality_update) and [`process_light_client_optimistic_update`](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/altair/light-client/sync-protocol.md#process_light_client_optimistic_update). This ensures that `finalized_header` and `optimistic_header` reflect the latest blocks.\r\n\r\nThe `current_period` is computed from the clock and genesis block time. If these two values are correct then `current_period` is correct as well, and it will always represent the latest committee period.  So I think this case only includes `finalized_period == current_period - 1` and `finalized_period == current_period`. But why here it uses `LightClientFinalityUpdate` instead of `LightClientUpdate` to update `finalized_header` in storage?\r\n\r\nVery much appreciate it if someone could give some insight or provide valuable readings for better understanding.",
