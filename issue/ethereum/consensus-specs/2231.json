  "body": "There are a number of constants in the spec such as 'ALTAIR_INACTIVITY_PENALTY_QUOTIENT'.  Having the fork name first makes it slightly harder to parse mentally, as well as being less amenable to reading after sorting the constants by name.\r\n\r\nSwapping it around so the \"what\" goes first and the \"when\" comes after makes life a little bit easier, for example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nINACTIVITY_PENALTY_QUOTIENT: 67108864\r\nINACTIVITY_PENALTY_QUOTIENT_ALTAIR: 50331648\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's not a major difference, but I think the benefit of having it this way around will increase with the number of hard forks.",
