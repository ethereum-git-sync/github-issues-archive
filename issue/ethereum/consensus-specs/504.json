Most (all?) of these could be entirely avoided if we just have the `genesis_slot` start far greater than 0.\r\n\r\n# Proposed solution\r\nUse `chainstart_time` which is logged in `ChainStart` to seed the genesis_slot/epoch instead of a pre-defined `GENESIS_SLOT`.\r\n\r\n* pass `chainstart_time` into `get_initial_beacon_state`\r\n* define `genesis_epoch` as `slot_to_epoch(chainstart_time // EPOCH_LENGTH) + 1`\r\n* define `genesis_slot` as `get_epoch_start_slot(genesis_epoch)`\r\n* remove `GENESIS_EPOCH` and `GENESIS_SLOT` constants\r\n* clean up the ugly underflow workarounds ",
