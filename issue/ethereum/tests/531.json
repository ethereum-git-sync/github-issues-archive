  "body": "Hi @winsvega, have you ever thought about making releases on the tests repository, think these could already solve a lot of problems. This can be low-level, e.g. just doing tags on the GitHub [release](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/releases) page and adding some CHANGELOG entry, we are doing this over on our proxy [ethereumjs-testing](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-testing) library and have made good experiences with it.\r\n\r\nThis would have the effect that people stay a bit on board about what's going on (test format has changed, Constantinople tests for EIP xxx are ready,...), significantly reduces the risk of people using inconsistent states of the repository and would also help a lot to talk about problems (\"What release are you using?\" instead of \"I am referring to the library in state with latest commit xxx\").\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? I could also take on this job this I am doing this anyhow for the JS library mentioned above, but I am also happy with you taking on it if you want to have control over the process.",

    "body": "Hi everyone,\r\nhere is a proposal for release notes, I would leave this open for discussion and comments for 24 hours and then publish a tagged release. I think this will generally be a good way ensure to not do unintended releases and give @winsvega and others working on the tests the chance for some feedback (\"please wait, develop branch not stable\", \"please wait, would like to merge PR xx\",...), so I will stick to that concept and publish draft notes maybe here or within another dedicated issue.\r\n\r\nAfter some more thoughts I also think that I would like to weaken the initially proposed strict bi-weekly release schedule a bit and instead still do regular releases but within a period of 1-4 weeks. In some more dense periods (like atm) there might be the need for more regular releases, e.g. if the last EIP tests are merged, in other periods with low work activity doing a release after 4 weeks might be enough.\r\n\r\nDue to the nature of this library with more constant updates here and there on tests and less of really feature-centric events/large changes I would generally stick to a regular-release-concept.\r\n\r\nHere is a draft for some first release notes:\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Tag:** v6.0.0-beta.1\r\n\r\n**Title:**\r\nv6.0.0-beta.1 Release CW 43\r\n\r\n**Description:**\r\n\r\nThis is the first of a new regular series of test releases, which can be used to reference a static snapshot of the tests within your library. For a starter release notes will give an overall summary of the status of consensus ``Constantinople`` tests, a summary of recent noteworthy changes and an overview on release versioning. Subsequent releases will then provide a ``CHANGELOG`` towards the release before.\r\n\r\n### Constantinople Test Summary\r\n\r\n- ``EIP-145`` (Bitwise shifting): Tests for ``SAR``, ``SHL`` and ``SHR`` in [GeneralStateTests/stShift](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/tree/develop/GeneralStateTests/stShift) directory, blockchain tests analogue\r\n- ``EIP-1014`` (``CREATE2``): Various cases covered in [GeneralStateTests/stCreate2](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/tree/develop/GeneralStateTests/stCreate2) directory, blockchain tests analogue\r\n- ``EIP-1052`` (``EXTCODEHASH``): Tests not merged yet, open PR [#484](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/484)\r\n- ``EIP-1283`` (``SSTORE``): Dedicated tests in [GeneralStateTests/stSStoreTest](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/tree/develop/GeneralStateTests/stSStoreTest) directory also covering Ropsten consensus issue cases, blockchain tests analogue, generally refilled state tests with new ``SSTORE`` gas metering rules in PR [#511](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/511)\r\n- ``EIP-1234`` (difficulty): New ``difficultyConstantinople.json`` file and regenerated ``difficultyRopsten.json`` files in the [BasicTests](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/blob/develop/BasicTests/) directory, see PR [#518](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/518)\r\n\r\n### Library Changes\r\n\r\nBe aware that the format of BlockchainTests recently changed with the introduction of a new field ``sealEngine`` (values: ``NoProof`` | ``Ethash``), see related JSON Schema [change](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/commit/3be71ec3364a01fd4f2cb9b9fd086f3f69f0225c) or BlockchainTest format [docs](https://ethereum-tests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/test_types/blockchain_tests.html) for reference.\r\n\r\nThis means that you can faster-execute ``NoProof`` based tests skipping block validation. These tests nevertheless doesn't provide reliable values for ``PoW``-based block header fields any more (``mixHash``, ``nonce``), so make sure that you don't rely on the correctness of these values for the tests to pass.\r\n\r\n### Versioning\r\n\r\nLibrary releases will follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/):\r\n\r\n- major number updates every time there is a backwards incompatibility for test runners, eg~\r\n  - new fork rules\r\n  - backwards-incompatible change, like dropping the mixhash and setting `sealEngine=NoProof` (see these release notes)\r\n- minor number updates when new tests are added that are backwards compatible\r\n- patch number updates if an existing test is bugfixed\r\n\r\nHere is an example how a follow-up release line could look like:\r\n- v6-alpha - starting to implement EIPs, but not all EIPs are finalized\r\n- v6-beta - all EIPs finalized, but some tests still in progress\r\n- v6.0.0 - all desired coverage for Constantinople tests to be considered \"done enough\"\r\n- v6.1.0 - more coverage added\r\n- v6.2.0 - more coverage added\r\n- v6.2.1 - bugfix on one of the tests\r\n- v7.0.0 - change in test format output (if backwards incompatible)\r\n---\r\n\r\nPut some more thoughts in what would make sense as a concept for the tags. I've now chosen to prefix this with a HF abbreviation (``CO`` for ``Constantinople``) and then do versioned releases up to a ``CO-1.0.0`` version where tests are somewhat complete for the specific hardfork (in the Constantinople case probably once ``EXTCODEHASH`` tests are merged and tests for all EIPs have a somewhat sufficient level of coverage, not sure what the status is regarding this atm). Have no strong opinion on version number to start with, thought ``0.8.0`` might be appropriate but we can also do ``0.9.0``, don't mind.\r\n\r\nOnce work on the next HF has started one would switch to a new prefix and new starting version number, like ``XX-0.1.0`` once first tests referencing the new hardfork are merged. Think this tag concept fits better the nature of the library than a simple ``v0.8``, let me know if this (using a letter-based tag format) causes problems in versioning/caching/whatever I am not aware of.\r\n\r\nAs description this now has some overall description of late noteworthy changes + the Constantinople status, in subsequent releases I would give a summary of the stuff changed in between the releases, this is just as a starter.\r\n\r\nUpdate: have changed versioning for the draft and added on the release description along with the comment from @carver [down the line](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/issues/531#issuecomment-432849341).",

    "body": "@holgerd77 Thank you very much for jumping on this. :+1:  As someone who has implemented the Constantinople EIPs for Trinity I really appreciate your effort to make the process of upgrading the tests more pleasant. Currently, for me, upgrading the tests usually involves lots of digging through other client implementations to find out about the changes they had to implement to make things work (e.g. `sealEngine`).\r\n\r\nYour proposed release strategy, versioning scheme and release notes sound good to me. I will add though, that I think the process could be made even easier (for the maintainer) and more transparent (for everyone) if the commits to this repo would follow a commit message convention and then generate release notes automatically.\r\n\r\nHere's a [changelog from Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) that is 100 % generated based on the commits of the project. There's a simple [commit message convention](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/blob/a5505865ff3dd710cf757f50530e73ef0ca641da/conventions/angular.md) to be followed to allow the automatic generation of such changelogs. There are different tools that can generate these changelogs, one of them is [clog](https://github.com/clog-tool/clog-cli) (DISCLAIMER: I worked on that. Just recommending it because it has binaries, so no JS dependency)\r\n\r\nI see the main benefit of using such a convention + auto changelog generation on the maintainer side as it removes the tedious job of creating such changelogs by hand. It also eliminates human error. Also, by enforcing clean commits that contain a commit message that goes into such a changelog comes at the benefit of making it much easier for everyone else to look up commits and read about the changes they caused.\r\n\r\nAdopting such practice comes at the cost of putting a little bit more upfront work into forging meaningful commits and knowing Git well enough to not struggle with that (interactive rebasing etc) so I realize there may be hesitation to buy into such practice.  I just wanted to bring it up though, as I think it would greatly improve the whole testing story for a lot of people.\r\n\r\nAlso, **if** there's buy-in for that, I'm happy to help with the integration of a changelog generator.\r\n",

I'm totally on board that improvements need to come step by step.\r\n\r\n>This also very much requires meaningful PRs\r\n\r\nYes, basically means either contributors need to learn how to do it or maintainer need to rebase PRs on behalf of those people. Making it harder for external contributors to contribute is basically the main reason why we reject such policy in Trinity for now. That said, I guess the test repo has a more steady circle of contributors and less drive by contributors anyway.\r\n\r\n>so for now I have a strong tendency to not (yet (?)) follow this path and stick to a manual summary.\r\n\r\nI'm on board.

Paging in @pipermerriam and @carver as I know they have ideas to improve the testing setup as well. E.g. Having a structure for the expected account state (instead of just having a bare `state_root` hash) would be a great improvement to the test setup imho. \r\n\r\n\r\n",

It is a perfect example of how releases can help clients: they can update to the latest version that doesn't include Constantinople tests by upgrading up until just before the next major version number.\r\n\r\nAlso, it would be reasonable to do alpha/beta releases. So if Byzantium was v5, then next releases might be tagged like so:\r\n- v6-alpha - starting to implement EIPs, but not all EIPs are finalized\r\n- v6-beta - all EIPs finalized, but some tests still in progress _<- I guess any current release would be here_\r\n- v6.0.0 - all desired coverage for Constantinople tests to be considered \"done enough\"\r\n- v6.1.0 - more coverage added\r\n- v6.2.0 - more coverage added\r\n- v6.2.1 - bugfix on one of the tests\r\n- v7.0.0 - change in test format output (if backwards incompatible)",

    "body": "Hi everyone,\r\nhere is the draft for release notes for a new release, as announced previously I would leave this open for 24h and then do a release.\r\n\r\nMy idea for a release path towards a \"good enough\" ``v6.0.0`` release would be the following:\r\n- This release (with additional ``EXTCODEHASH`` and ``SSTORE`` tests still in the works by @winsvega and @hugo-dc as open PRs) will be another ``beta.x`` release, clients can nevertheless use this to for the first time to test all opcodes/EIPs from ``Constantinople``\r\n- Once these - and eventually some more tests - are merged, probably in 2 weeks or so, we can do a final ``beta.x`` release (we could also call this ``release candidate`` if we want to be super-precise), we can then give this a period of another 1-2 weeks to see if clients report problems with this\r\n- Then we can do a ``v6.0.0`` release, probably somewhere around early/mid December\r\n\r\nDoes this make sense? Comments on the release notes are also very welcome!\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nHolger\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Tag:** v6.0.0-beta.2\r\n\r\n**Title:**\r\nv6.0.0-beta.2 Release CW 46\r\n\r\n**Description:**\r\n\r\nThis is the second of a new regular series of test releases, which can be used to reference a static snapshot of the tests within your library. First release has been ``v6.0.0-beta.1``, see [release notes](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/releases/tag/v6.0.0-beta.1) from this release for an initial summary on the state of ``Constantinople`` tests.\r\n\r\n### Constantinople Test Updates\r\n\r\n- Added initial test cases for ``EXTCODEHASH`` [EIP-1052](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1052), see PR [#484](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/484)\r\n- More ``EXTCODEHASH`` tests, see PR [#544](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/544)\r\n- New ``SSTORE`` state tests and blockchain tests where an external call is overwriting/colliding with new ``SSTORE`` gas calculation rules, see PR [#535](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/535)\r\n\r\n### Test Coverage\r\n\r\n- New tests to cover cases where the result of an EVM opcode is written to a specified memory range and the result is shorter than the specified range, see PR [#538](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/538)\r\n\r\n### Library Changes\r\n\r\n- Added ``.idea`` to ``.gitignore``, see PR [#546](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/546)\r\n\r\n### Docs\r\n\r\n[Test generation docs](https://ethereum-tests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generating-tests.html) have been consolidated and integrated in the central ReadTheDocs testing documentation. \r\n\r\nWe also updated outdated parts on this doc section (see PR [#539](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/539)), so it should in principle now be possible to follow the guide and end up with a working test creation setup. There might still be some glitches, please let us know or submit a PR on [ethereum/tests](https://github.com/ethereum/tests) to if you stumble over something.\r\n\r\nOther changes:\r\n\r\n- New list with [clients using the library](https://github.com/ethereum/tests#clients-using-the-library) in README, see PR [#537](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/537)\r\n",

AngularJS does something similar, apparently.\r\n\r\nIt seems like it might be a good idea for trinity to do someday, but the reality is that it is very difficult to get contributors to write good, publicly-readable commit messages. (maybe even tougher to have them make manual entries in a changelog) So we punted on the idea until we can figure out that problem. For now, a manual changelog writeup is the best solution we have.\r\n\r\nI imagine the `tests` repo would be in a similar position. (Even if there are fewer contributors currently, we might aspire to have more, and end up with the same challenges)",

It also changed the format of some blockchain tests, [keys of \"0x\" are now \"0x00\"](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/547/files#diff-d31f2819c1febd4c8d673a15a8375af5)\r\n\r\n- #557 changes the format the the rlp tests, byte strings are now prefixed with \"0x\"\r\n\r\n### [EIP 1234](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1234)\r\n\r\n- #547 added a test for the difficulty changes. This adds the network `ByzantiumToConstantinopleAt5`, which is analogous to existing networks such as `FrontierToHomesteadAt5` and `EIP158ToByzantiumAt5`.\r\n\r\n### [EIP 1052](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1052)\r\n\r\n- #548 Added a test for EXTCODEHASH called on an account created in the same transaction\r\n- #549 added a few more tests for EXTCODEHASH and EXTCODESIZE on accounts created in the same transaction\r\n- #550 Checks that changes to an account's nonce, balance, or storage do not change the result of calling EXTCODEHASH\r\n- #552 Added another EXTCODEHASH test, what if it's run on accounts which have self-destructed?\r\n- #563 Another spectacularly detailed test case of EXTCODEHASH involving recursive calls and oog-induced revert\r\n- #566 checks that EXTCODEHASH returns a different result when the code changes\r\n- #568 adds a test for EXTCODEHASH; what if the contract being hashed self destructed while in the middle of a delegate call?\r\n- #569 calls EXTCODEHASH on an empty contract\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n\r\n- #551 tests for a Constantinople bug the fuzzer found in geth\r\n- #544 adds an RLP test, [courtesy of the mana team](https://github.com/mana-ethereum/ex_rlp/pull/17)\r\n- #561 changed some of the tests. There were some changes to `testeth` which made the previous tests impossible to regenerate. They were refactored but not in a way which should break any client.\r\n- #567 adds a Constantinople test Mana found when they failed to sync with Ropsten",
