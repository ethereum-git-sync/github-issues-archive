    "body": "Hi,\r\nthanks so much for this, these new releases are really great! 😄 \r\n\r\nOne small suggestion: I think it would be better to not do pre-releases at all but just do everything as a normal release. I realized lately that for us as a user a \"final\" release has very much low relevance since we just update from release to release and at the same time it is unfortunate with the pre-releases that this leads to having this super-old `v7.0.0` release displayed on the main GitHub page as the latest release. This will likely confuse people.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/931137/109481217-c71c8300-7a7c-11eb-9b66-b40327653dd9.png)\r\n",

    "body": "Ah, and as a side note: this suggestion is also influenced by the experiences from #692 where we (so you guys and me)were waiting for a final release for months, which made not so much sense since the clients needed to update the tests anyhow, being towards a \"final\" release or not.\r\n\r\nSo I guess it's not really worth to focus so much on final releases as I initially did, hardfork planning is often somewhat unpredictable and from my observation of the work here on the repo it is often hard or just not really possible to find a good  \"sweet spot\" for a final release.\r\n\r\nThis will likely be directly again the case with this planning for Berlin and London happening somewhat in parallel, so it might very well be the case here that we get into some repo state here where Berlin tests are not yet \"finalized\" but the first London tests need already to be merged in.",
