But if you also make changes to what is the correct format of configs, only some branches will work, only those where configs have the format corresponding to my retesteth version.\r\n\r\nIn other words, it would be better if the code parsing the configs is changed in sync with changes in configs themselves, would be simpler if this happens in a single repo (retesteth)",
