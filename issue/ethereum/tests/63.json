The \"or\" is important here. Sine this is a contract, the nonce only gets updated when it creates another contract. But the test case here will likely never happen. Because after creating a contract you dont know the secret key, only the public key. Only in a test we could create such a thing. So normally you will never receive a signed transaction from a contract with code.\n",
