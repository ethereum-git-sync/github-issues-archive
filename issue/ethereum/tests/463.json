  "body": "Currently re-filling test cases takes quite a while, so they are re-filled manually instead.\r\n\r\nIt would be better if we could detect when they need to be refilled automatically, and even better if this was done by the CI server for us automatically on every PR. I would settle for a way to automatically only refill tests that need to be refilled though.\r\n\r\nA simple solution: include (in the filled output) a hash of the original file. Check that hash before filling, and if it hasn't changed, then refill.\r\n\r\nAnother potential solution: track filled -> filler dependencies using a Makefile or the like. Have a CI server which does not wipe out the repository between test runs, so is able to track dependencies properly using timestamps. This is a bit more fragile.\r\n\r\nThis could also make an argument for reintroducing a `master` branch: devs push PRs to `develop` without filling tests, a CI server occasionally packages a release of the `develop` branch by filling tests and pushing to `master` branch.\r\n\r\nThoughts? @axic @pirapira @winsvega @chfast ",

That usually means that something in the postCondition section of the test has changed.

For this automatition is not needed as you have to manually set the post condition and verify that your test (precondition -> transaction -> postCondition check) is passing everything correctly. read retesteth docs on how to write your own state test: https://github.com/ethereum/retesteth/wiki/Creating-a-State-Test-with-retesteth\r\n\r\n",
