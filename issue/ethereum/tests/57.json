    "body": "@CJentzsch : Let's summarized just to see that I \ngot all correct: \n1. VMTest each new approached account will be in the post state \n   event if it was only `getBalance()` and no set so the all values will \n   remain zeroes\n2. StateTest only the account that actually do a `setBalance()` or `increaseNonce()`\n   or any other change are the only one who are going to be in the post in addition to \n   pre accounts.\n3. The real system behaves the exact way as the state testing. \n\nCan you say 1,2,3, are all correct ? \n",
