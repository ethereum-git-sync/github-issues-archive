  "body": "Hi, \r\n\r\nI’m Elias from Kakarot zkEVM (https://www.kakarot.org/).\r\nWe are currently building an EVM implementation in Cairo (https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1063), the provable Turing-complete language on which Starknet L2 (https://starkware.co/starknet/) is based. As Kakarot zkEVM is striving to become an Ethereum client, we naturally need to pass the Ethereum tests. As such, we would like to be listed in the repository.\r\n\r\nWe currently pass approximately 50% of the BlockchainState tests for the Shanghai fork (e.g. missing EIP1559 or precompiles tests) and are targeting 80% this year and eventually 100%.\r\nWe’re also looking to pass Hive tests in the future.\r\n\r\nIn the past year, we’ve built two implementations of the EVM:\r\n- The Cairo “Zero” implementation - https://github.com/kkrt-labs/kakarot - which was written in the first version of the Cairo language (lower level), started in October 2022.\r\n- The Cairo implementation - https://github.com/kkrt-labs/kakarot-ssj - started recently in the new version of the Cairo language (higher level, rust-like).\r\n\r\nAnd built a repository to run the ef-tests against our EVM without RPC mode, inspired by Reth - https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth. The stack works in the following way:\r\n- The underlying technology is the CairoVM,\r\n- The Kakarot EVM is a Cairo Program that runs on the Cairo VM.\r\n- We use a library imported from the Starknet ecosystem to manage the state.\r\n\r\nTest location: https://github.com/kkrt-labs/ef-tests\r\n\r\nThank you for your help,\r\nKakarot team.",
