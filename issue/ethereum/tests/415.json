    "body": "@pirapira any recent thoughts on this? I don't think we should do away with VMTests, but perhaps could limit their scope. It doesn't feel good to have KEVM have two versions of several opcodes, one just for VMTests.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the VMTests that only deal with VM-related stuff could remain (eg. arithmetic, local memory ops, program counter ops), and anything that deals with Ethereum-specific state could be translated into GeneralStateTests instead?\r\n\r\nI've become interested in this because I'm in the middle of refactoring the KEVM control-flow to make it more uniform to make doing proofs with KEVM easier (and also to support more uniform typed exceptions), but there are several spots where special cases are made for VMTests mode which are causing me headache.",

    "body": "So I have removed most of the dependencies of KEVM on VMTESTS mode (and disabled the relevant tests, which is coming to about 70ish now). One final issue remains, which is that the executing account's balance is asserted in the post-state of the VMTests. Because there is no transaction, there isn't a `gasPrice` to use, so a default `gasPrice = 1` is assumed.\r\n\r\nI think that the post-state of the account should not be asserted in VMTests (or anything related to network-state/non-vm execution). I do think that the VMTests should be making assertions about the `gas` itself, but that is already happening separately over the `gas` component of state directly. For now I will disable the post-state balance assertions in KEVM to completely remove the semantics dependence on VMTESTS mode.\r\n\r\nThis makes me wonder about post-state storage assertions though. When talking with @winsvega at EthCC, it seemed that the storage was used to make assertions about computation by doing the computation then asserting that the resulting storage had some form, and certainly the tests are written that way. If we're taking the \"separate the VM from the network state\" seriously, I think even `SLOAD` and `SSTORE` don't belong there. In KEVM it is easy to also make assertions about things like the local memory and stack, but I get the feeling it won't be super easy in other clients because they are probably already set up to be able to do state-dumps of network state, but maybe not VM execution state.",
