  "body": "Currently all blockchain tests are using mining to calculate the correct difficulty for the block. \r\nhowever we only need a set of tests for the difficulty rules and other tests could just skip mining and difficulty check. switch to noProof rules. \r\n\r\nthis should increase the speed of blockchain tests generation by x100 times.\r\n\r\nto test the difficulty we will be using new set of tests in blockchain tests format\r\nwhich will have genesis block != 0  so that we could test difficulty formula on any block number on any fork network rules.\r\n\r\n**The idea**\r\n- disable difficulty check on blockchain tests (swith to noProof)\r\n- enable difficulty check only if it is signaled by a special option in .json blockchain file\r\n- make genesis to have number > 0 so we could test the difficulty starting with higher blocks\r\n\r\n*an uncle from  <= genesis block number - 1 is not allowed. \r\n*any opcode calls to genesis block number -1 are not allowed\r\n\r\nor you could suggest the other format to enable / disable difficulty check on blockchain tests",

Cheating the genesis is easy, but then there are various internal invariants, that there is an unbroken chain of blocks all the way back to `0`, which makes the whole thing pretty unstable and ... weird...
