  "body": "In my work on adding full support for spurious-dragon to `ethereumjs-tx`, I have come across a handful of transaction tests that claim to be invalid for spurious dragon and later while the properties of the tested tx seem to be valid.\r\n\r\nFor instance, https://github.com/ethereum/tests/blob/develop/TransactionTests/ttRSValue/RightVRSTestF0000000a.json + https://github.com/ethereum/tests/blob/develop/src/TransactionTestsFiller/ttRSValue/RightVRSTestF0000000aFiller.json\r\n\r\nThe tx here does violate the pre https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-155.md conditions for the `v` property. As such we would expect it to be invalid on hard forks prior. However, the current test specified it should be invalid on all hardforks. It is not clear what condition of the tx indicate invalidity for spurious dragon or later.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the data from the test can be used to create a valid tx on geth.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have insight into what might be happening?
