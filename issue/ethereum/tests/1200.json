  "body": "it looks like the logic of coinbase touch (with mining reward) is a confusing one to many devs. \r\nwhy a state test has to perform blockchain logic of mining reward (in state tests it is 0) and then on <=EIP150 it results in empty account present in the state. \r\n\r\nthe question here is:\r\n### Should we remove coinbase touch on state tests? \r\n\r\n\r\nby the format state tests has 0 minign reward to focus on transaction rewards. and by name it has no blockchain logic. \r\nthis coinbase touch was introduced so only to be able to run state tests as blocks being imported in besu's RPC interface. \r\nsince besu does not support RPC anymore, this is just confusing in state tests.

I.e. do not apply any block finalization logic.\r\n\r\nHowever, the `t8n` sister tool is designed differently as it can request application of multiple transactions and it has `--state.reward` CLI argument with some special value of `-1`. I'd be happy to skip any block reward logic in `t8n` too but maybe that would prevent using it for actually building blocks.",

So do not reward coinbase block rewards.\r\n\r\nThe argument that block coinbase is still rewarded, but the reward is 0 eth, is that it can be easily debugged regarding gas costs. However, I would argue that if you have tx gas price of 1 wei and then just use the default block rewards, it is easy to spot how much gas is used by just looking at the number. Also, rewarding the coinbase 0 eth on all hardforks essentially puts a \"hardfork\" over the hardfork which is running which puts the block reward to 0 eth.",
