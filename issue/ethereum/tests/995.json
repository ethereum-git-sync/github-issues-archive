  "body": "Hi there,\r\n\r\nI have a State test format extension request. Currently there is no direct information about the transaction origin address in the State test format. There is however, `\"secretKey\"` field which represents EC private key and the origin address can be recovered from the private key.\r\n\r\n### Specification\r\nIn the State test format provide `\"origin\"` field with an address matching the EC private key in `\"secretKey\"`.\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nI'm developing a state test runner for my EVM implementation. I don't care about transaction verification and signing. It would be much easier to process transactions if information about the origin address is directly provided. Otherwise I need to depend on a secp256k1 implementation just to recover `secretKey` -> `origin`. Or I can try to guess the origin address from the \"pre\" state.\r\n\r\n### Backward compatibility\r\n\r\nI believe this change is backward compatible because none of the existing JSON fields is modified.",
