  "body": "We are just looking into analyzing some opcode behavior and performance in our VM and I've along tried to re-activate some previously slowly running tests we had excluded.\r\n\r\nIn the [vmPerformance](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/tree/develop/BlockchainTests/GeneralStateTests/VMTests/vmPerformance) directory there are both these tests `loopExp` and `loopMul`.\r\n\r\nWhile `loopExp` is running reasonably ok for us in under a second, `loopMul` takes for ages (48 Minutes !).\r\n\r\nI now had a closer look and saw that the number of iterations is just *dramatically* higher on `loopMul`. While `loopExp` is executing the highly used opcodes in the range of 1000s times (e.g. `PUSH` opcode 2145 called), `loopMul` is doing a completely other level with e.g. ~ 130 Mio (!) executions of the `PUSH` opcodes and other opcodes on the same level.\r\n\r\nIs this extremely high rate intended? Or is this an error/mistake in the filler code? Wouldn't something like at least 100x less executions (1 Mio or so) also be enough?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot! 🙏",

    "body": "Thanks, I know this is a stress test. There is just no gain in executing the same thing 130 Mio times. So 2500 seconds means > 40 minutes for a single test. This is just a waste of ressources and time, since 1 Mio executions or so would achieve the same thing.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to just quickly adopt these numbers?
