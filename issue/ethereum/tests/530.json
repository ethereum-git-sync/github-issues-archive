Then I can prepare a PR towards the docs with the changes.\r\n\r\nHave you seen the suggestion on releases https://github.com/ethereum/tests/issues/531? This would also help very much on stuff like this, since people then have a descent chance to follow up on release notes.\r\n\r\nOne way to do it would be to just do maybe bi-weekly releases not really tied to some major changes, this would already have the advantage to sum up the recent changes, one could also accompany this with a post on Reddit to raise some awareness every two weeks. Other way would be to tie releases to major changes (Constantinople EIP xxx tests ready, test format change,...). I would probably prefer the first version, seems easiest to start with and has some more regularity.\r\n\r\nRelease would just be an optional tagged release on GitHub, nothing published or something, so just an additional offer for people to stick onto this rather than some arbitrary commit snapshot, this would already give teams a more common ground to exchange on test problems.",
