    "body": "> evmone does not support rlp. Maybe some others too.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible for an ethereum mainnet EL client to not support rlp. Since evmone implements only the evm-part, they may pull it off, but it's definitely the odd one out. \r\n\r\n> all invalid rlp tests are moved to rlp tests.\r\n\r\nThat is good, because testing valid/invalid rlp is a much simpler proposition than testing validity of blocks. \r\n\r\n>  So the invalid blocks must be valid rlps just expected to be rejected.\r\n\r\nRight. Yes, definitely, exactly like If we were to describe them in `json`, then we'd have to use valid `json`. \r\n\r\n> Proposal is to parse block from test as invalid if it has expected exception other then that invalid block will have all the same fields in tests as a valid one.\r\n\r\nPlease clarify the proposal. Here is how I read it: \r\n\r\n> If the test has an `expected exception` field, then the block is supposed to be found `invalid`.\r\n\r\nBut I must be missing something, what am I missing?\r\n \r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Besu has their EVM code in a severable library, but our reference test code is still part of the whole ethereum client.  This is because some of the tests, as mentioned, depend on things like RLP and block validation which are not EVM concerns but block building concerns.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if there was a clear subsection of the code that was RLP and block free (GeneralStateTests is mostly there, if not completely) but I don't see Besu ever not running full block tests, and that makes block free testing moot.  So I would say Besu is neither in favor nor opposed to removing rlp from regular tests.",
