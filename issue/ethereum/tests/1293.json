  "body": "evmone does not support rlp. Maybe some others too.\n\nThe current blockchain tests that have invalid blocks describe invalid block as rlp field only. And valid block as rlp and its json decoding into transactions, blockheader, etc.\n\nSince long time tests now have expected exceptions, and all invalid rlp tests are moved to rlp tests.\nSo the invalid blocks must be valid rlps just expected to be rejected.\n\nProposal is to parse block from test as invalid if it has expected exception other then that invalid block will have all the same fields in tests as a valid one.\n\nAffected: custom test runner tools\nBackwards compatibility: legacy tests will break.\n\nQuestion to the teams is this easy to implement in tools, is it ok? Some code might be hardcoded to expect rlp section only. \n\nAlternatively can have invalid blocks transcripted but in a different way than valid. Putting the json transcription into sub json section for instance.",
