  "body": "[Mana](https://github.com/poanetwork/mana) had a few state tests that took us a long time to figure out how to pass. After doing some research, we discovered [this conversation in gitter](https://gitter.im/ethereum/tests?at=5b85004aff445156164b685f) that led us to understand that we needed to simulate adding a miner reward and cleaning up empty accounts after EIP-161. The PR introducing those changes to `mana` is [here](https://github.com/poanetwork/mana/pull/463).\r\n\r\nThe behavior is very unexpected based on the [current state tests docs](https://ethereum-tests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/test_types/state_tests.html) since there is no mention of that at all. \r\n\r\nCould we update the docs to include a mention of that or should the tests be changed so that they do not depend on simulating a miner reward?
