  "body": "Apparently this HF-centric release process from e.g here #686 doesn't work any more (maybe never was a good idea, not sure) with a potential Berlin release at  #692 now being open for months.\r\n\r\nI would therefore suggest that we reconsider the approach and just switch to a normal [semver](https://semver.org/) release model where we simply do breaking releases if some changes are anticipated to break anything in test runners (directly changes, test field additions/renamings, HF tests moved to legacy,...), minor or patch releases in other cases and move away from a HF-centric approach.\r\n\r\nAs a starter I can help a bit with this by bringing #692 up-to-date and re-label (so mainly remove the \"Berlin\"-centric view on this) so that we can have some basis here. This would then also be just a \"normal\" major release and no beta release or something. Maybe I can also further help a bit along the way with release notes when we plan to do an `ethereum/tests` update on the VM.\r\n\r\nThan it would be great if we can switch back to a more frequent release cycle with releases every 2-4 weeks, from a client perspective this is otherwise not helpful.\r\n\r\nWDYGT? ðŸ¤”\r\n\r\n//cc @qbzzt @winsvega @holiman ",
