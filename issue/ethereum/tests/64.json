  "body": "It looks as though the tests in `tests/TrieTests/trietest.json` are intended to be permuted, with deletions tacked onto the end to ensure that all bindings both added and deleted end up deleted. (Or maybe I'm wrong? I'm trying to follow along from e.g. [here](https://github.com/ethereum/pyethereum/blob/d442c114b694439a85a89bb3b06d5115243d3067/tests/test_trie.py).)\n\nThat works fine for most of the tests there, but not, i think for test `jeff` in the [current version](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/blob/4d37c1cea2ca2999e8dd442ee137c942755697f6/TrieTests/trietest.json) , which has two items with identical keys but distinct values, and whose key is not eventually deleted. \n\n```\n      [\"0x000000000000000000000000697c7b8c961b56f675d570498424ac8de1a918f6\", \"0x1234567890\"],\n      [\"0x000000000000000000000000697c7b8c961b56f675d570498424ac8de1a918f6\", \"0x6f6f6f6820736f2067726561742c207265616c6c6c793f000000000000000000\"],\n```\n\nSo the hash of the trie after permutations of operations are legitimately dependent upon which binding is updated last, I think.\n\nI apologize if I am (not unusually) missing something obvious!\n",

And thanks for the quick response!\n\nI'm trying to crib from you guys carefully, and and the [python](https://github.com/ethereum/pyethereum/blob/d442c114b694439a85a89bb3b06d5115243d3067/tests/test_trie.py) implementation seems to run these tests not just by applying each k/v pair in order, but also by permuting the order of those operations many times and expecting the same hash. So I've tried to reproduce that too.\n\nThe [c++](https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/blob/0ee53a19357021cfbc76438a9fb1be0521ae0174/test/trie.cpp) implementation seems to permute only the operations from the file [tests/TrieTests/trieanyorder.json](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/blob/4d37c1cea2ca2999e8dd442ee137c942755697f6/TrieTests/trieanyorder.json), which I think will have a similar problem running the test `foo`, as it has two different entries with key 'food', but distinct values, so the hash of the trie will depend on the order in which those insertions are applied.\n",
