  "body": "The ongoing RPC test run development require to run GeneralStateTests as if it was a blockchain test. because this is a correct way to simulate a state change. (setup state in the chain. send transaction to the client with that state. see the result. a transaction result is finalized in the block)\r\n\r\n**The issue:** \r\nAll General State Tests has poststate hash field having a hash of state calculated without mining reward. RPC test tool could not calculate post state of transaction execution (otherwise its a client) (but it could take mining reward into account and still check expect section conditions on balance changes)\r\n\r\nA client could not calculate the post state of transaction execution without mining reward. otherwise it is a test tool. \r\n\r\n**The solution**\r\nA solution would be to change actual hash of the \"hash\" field in generated StateTests to be the hash of state including mining rewards. \r\n",
