(0 blobhashes, create blob tx and so on, so we can generate invalid tests) but this is a big question because there are many checks to consider. ",

    "body": "Not sure what you are missing. You can supply an invalid tx, e.g. empty blobs, and t8n will reject it, and thus the output state root will not be modified by the tx. \n\nLater on, you can put this invalid tx into a statetest, and expect a well-behaving client to also reject it, and arrive at correct stateroot. \n\nThe t8n tool is not the one who decides what to include into a test, your test gen tool does that. T8n provides state awareness and evm execution: state transition. \n\n",
