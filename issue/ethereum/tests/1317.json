  "body": "Hi there! Sorry for bothering you. \r\nOn https://github.com/bluealloy/revm we're working on a shared stack between contexts (along with a shared memory already implemented). While discussing (https://github.com/bluealloy/revm/pull/816#issuecomment-1768652589) we thought that maybe we can reuse some bytecode from here as a stress test. \r\n\r\nIn particular, we're looking for a test where we go both up and down in depth; the more calls and stressful it is, the better.\r\nRight now, I've taken a look here https://github.com/ethereum/tests/tree/develop/src/GeneralStateTestsFiller/stCallCodes but they seems to do only a few calls (granted that I could have missed the good ones here). \r\nI also thought that some of these could work https://github.com/ethereum/tests/tree/develop/src/GeneralStateTestsFiller/stCreate2 (e.g. `Create2OnDepth1023.json`).\r\n\r\nIn general, I'm asking if you happen to already know what tests would be good for this purpose.\r\nThanks a lot in advance for the help! :pray: ",
