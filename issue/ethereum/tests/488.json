  "body": "I would like to propose renaming the strings we use to refer to the forks currently referred to as `\"EIP150\"` and `\"EIP158\"`\r\n\r\n- `EIP150 -> TangerineWhistle`\r\n- `EIP158 -> SpuriousDragon`\r\n\r\nMy motivation is as follows:\r\n\r\n- EIP158 is not even the correct EIP number as it was replaced with EIP160\r\n- Using the EIP to reference it is somewhat confusing as most forks contain multiple EIPs, TangerineWhistle just happened to be special in that it only contained one.\r\n- Naming consistency, Using the \"fancy\" names instead of their EIP numbers is more inline with how the other forks are named.",
