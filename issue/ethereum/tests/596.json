  "body": "Hi, I am currently implementing my own trie and I am testing it against your test data. I am not really sure where I can ask a question regarding this so I am going to do it here.\r\n\r\nMy implementation is having a problem when it comes to the \"hex\" test cases. I am wondering if I am misunderstanding there something. \r\nWhat does the hex value represent? Is it just a hex string? \r\n0x0123456789 Could be also written as 0x0123E6789 , since 0x45 = E in Ascii? \r\n\r\nI receive 77f413ac5ba5282e4a7c11350a643cae10ebb467539c358850b5d77be0a5734f as the result and not 285505fcabe84badc8aa310e2aae17eddc7d120aabec8a476902c8184b3a3503.",

    "body": "The problem has been solved :) \r\nIt actually works the same way. In case the key is a hex string, remove the 0x and transform the rest into nibbles. All fine. In case the value is a hex value, I just used `bytes.fromhex(value)` without the 0x in python. That worked like a charm too :)",
