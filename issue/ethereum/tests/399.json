We might need a new way to define expect section like   `>Metropolis ` means for all forks after metropolis. (although the gas price tend to change and it might be unreasonable. tell me what you think) \r\n\r\nA test that checks that staticcall is not executed before a certain point is a separate test case that should be compiled for all forks for all opcodes and check whether it works or not. @jwasinger  already done it for bad and correct opcodes. so it is done already. thus we do not need staticcall tests to be done on Frontier for example. (And we have like a hundred staticcall tests because it was merged blindly from all test cases that we had for existing call, delegate call scenarious)\r\n\r\n\r\n",
