    "body": "For example keyaddrtest.json it would be nice if v,r,s are strings since native Javascript JSON.parse can't handle such big numbers directly.\n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/8663298/json-transfer-of-bigint-12000000000002539-is-converted-to-12000000000002540\n\"The only safe way to handle integral numbers of this magnitude in JavaScript is to use a string literal or to break it down in another fashion (e.g. a custom numeric type or a \"bigint library\"). However, I recommend just using a string, as it is human readable, relatively compact (only two extra characters in JSON), and doesn't require special serialization.\"\n",
