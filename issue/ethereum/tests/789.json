For the scenarios above: \r\n\r\n> Run a transaction, and see if any wei disappear. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure how the testing framework is set up, but a stricter condition here would be that the amount burnt is `base_fee_per_gas` * `gas_used`. \r\n\r\n> Check what happens if we have a bunch of nearly empty blocks (gas_target >>> gas_used). The same transaction, with the same gas price, should give the coinbase more wei after such blocks because base_fee_per_gas gets lower when blocks are under utilized.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure this will actually result in a higher reward to the coinbase. If the `base fee per gas` ends up below the `max fee per gas`, then at most the coinbase should get `max inclusion fee per gas`, but if the `base fee per gas` goes even farther below, then it will start \"eating into\" the `max fee per gas`. We should test that if possible. \r\n\r\n>Check what happens if we have a bunch of overfull blocks (gas_target < gas_used). To do this, have a contract call that spends all of its gas (or almost all).\r\n\r\nYeah, I think ideally we should drive the `base fee per gas` all the way to its minimum with empty blocks and then back up to a fairly high level with large calls. \r\n\r\n> Create transactions of the new type (with max_inclusion_fee_per_gas and max_free_per_gas). See it is processed correctly, both in terms of how much it gives coinbase and the auction mechanism.\r\n\r\nAgain, I'm not sure how the test repo is setup, but I guess we probably need to test all the combinations of pre-1559 vs. 1559 transactions, both with and without access lists. \r\n",

    "body": "Quick trick to use all gas; just create a contract with the init code `0xFE` this asserts and consumes all gas.\r\n\r\nBugs on Aleut related to this EIP so far; (good test cases)\r\n\r\n- Blocks where `gasUsed > gasTarget`\r\n- Anything related to `GASPRICE` (GASPRICE PUSH1 0 SSTORE borked Aleut)\r\n\r\nWhat's also interesting is that the spec does not state if it is OK to use a Transaction where the gasLimit of this transaction is higher than gasTarget. There is no special exception which states that you are not allowed to send a tx with a higher gasLimit than current gasTarget, so theoretically it *could* be possible to have a block with a single tx which spends twice the gas target.",
