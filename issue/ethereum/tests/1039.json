On example was discussed under #941.\r\n\r\nThe goal would be to include cases with `v` values 0, 1, 2, 3, 29, 30 and a bunch of other random values, plus potentially those used with chainid based signing.\r\n\r\n`stPreCompiledContracts2/CALLCODEEcrecoverV_prefixedf0Filler` could be used to easily extend this test suite.\r\n\r\n(See also https://github.com/ethereum/yellowpaper/pull/860)",
