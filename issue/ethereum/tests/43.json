  "body": "the context is `TransactionContractCreation` in this test suite: \nhttps://github.com/ethereum/tests/blob/develop/StateTests/stInitCodeTest.json\n\nhere is the log of the execution: \nhttps://gist.github.com/romanman/bdfb109eb56a2cb456d7\n\nthe last op in the run is PUSH1 and than to finish the run it looks like\nRETURN been called, but if we look closely on the transaction\ndata `0x600a80600c6000396000 [f2] 00600160008035811a8100` the\n`F2` should be called and that `F2` is not a `RETURN` anymore since\nlast change. Well still can be the case that I am missing \nsomething, but will be happy for help anyway @CJentzsch \n\nP.S. also `TransactionCreateSuicideContract` has `F2` as expected `RETURN`\n\nThanks\nRoman\n",
