And this was probably the starting point for various clients to be implemented.\r\n\r\nIn everyday live this excitement cools down a bit ðŸ˜º since I have already spent countless hours figuring out the purpose of test cases (especially if one is not a fluent LLL reader) to get a grip where to start debugging.\r\n\r\nA simple comment on every test case would be extremely valuable here.
