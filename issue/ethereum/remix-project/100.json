  "body": "To use the latest Remix-ide, I downloaded the zipped binary(remix-f25a380.zip\r\n) of v0.9.2 from 'https://github.com/ethereum/remix-ide/releases/tag/v0.9.2' and tried it as an chrome extension using the instruction in README page.\r\nBut, I met the error saying the following.\r\n\r\n> Refused to execute inline script because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: \"script-src 'self' https://solc-bin.ethereum.org/\". Either the 'unsafe-inline' keyword, a hash ('sha256-pgsJPcGlKBQT9Hh4VxrLz8ULRtMuxa4owlK9JWk8sTA='), or a nonce ('nonce-...') is required to enable inline execution.\r\n\r\nThe problem was solved after I changed the <tt>manifest.json</tt> file located at the base directory of unzipped binary.  The last item of <tt>manifest.json</tt> file in the zipped binary was like this.\r\n\r\n`\"content_security_policy\": \"script-src 'self' https://solc-bin.ethereum.org/; object-src 'self'\"` \r\n\r\nI added 'usafe-eval' and 'sha256...' to the line.  And the chrome extension started to work correctly.\r\n\r\n`\"content_security_policy\": \"script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval' 'sha256-pgsJPcGlKBQT9Hh4VxrLz8ULRtMuxa4owlK9JWk8sTA=' https://solc-bin.ethereum.org/; object-src 'self'\"`\r\n\r\nI am using Windows 10 and Chrome v79.0.3945.117 which is latest version currently, and I think it is not the problem of OS.  \r\nAnyway I hope the fix would be reflected to the source of the Remix project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
