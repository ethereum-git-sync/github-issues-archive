    "body": "Yes, I am aware that there is some kind of learning hump we have to overcome, but my hope is that after that, everything is much smoother. If you do not remove the metadata hash and publish the metadata json, then (we still have to talk to tooling people there) you can resolve all the information (available functions, documentation, source, ...) by just supplying the address of a contract. If you delete the metadata hash you have to rely on centralized services like etherscan to provide this for you.\r\n\r\nTruffle stores the metadata json in the build artefacts, and while debugging the nondeterminism issue, I noticed that the \"build-info\" generated by hardhat also looks very close to a metadata file.\r\n\r\nBut yeah, we will talk to tooling people to make the metadata json more easily available.",
