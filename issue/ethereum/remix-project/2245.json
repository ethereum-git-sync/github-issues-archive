    "body": "> I am also facing the same issue\r\n\r\nI found a work-around of sorts for anyone looking for answers. It's not perfect, but it gets around the issue: use the 'localhost' workspace. (This requires the 'remixd' utility on your system -- npm install remixd)\r\n\r\nI downloaded the remixd package from npm and use that, this allows me to specify a folder on my system that remix can use. This way, when I'm writing files on remix, remixd is saving them directly onto my file-system. Then no download feature is needed since the files are there already. \r\n\r\nThe command works like this (I'm on linux, command might be a bit different if on windows): \r\n$>  remixd ./myProject https://remix.ethereum.org\r\n\r\nThis also works for existing solidity projects you might want to work on that are on your system, just point remixd at the existing project, then open remix IDE and choose the localhost workspace. If you have remixd active, remix will be able to see the directory you have pointed at and presto chango will put all the files in that directory into the remix IDE. (Be aware that remixd will also put a .deps folder that contains contracts imported, like openzeppelin files into it, and it will also make an 'artifacts' folder that will put all the compiled contract artifacts and ABI files into it as well, so you'll have access to the whole lot on your system)\r\n\r\nAgain, not a perfect solution, but it does work, and in my opinion this is simpler than having to download a package, unzip it, or reupload files back into remix one by one.
