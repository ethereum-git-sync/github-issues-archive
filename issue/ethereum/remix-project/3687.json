  "body": "Steps to reproduce the issue:\r\n1. Write a smart contract that does not have any `fallback` or `receive` function defined.\r\n2. Deploy the smart contract in Remix.\r\n3. Use the Remix UI to pass a low level interaction to the contract.\r\n\r\nExpected result: the transaction is sent.\r\n\r\nActual result: the transaction is not sent, and the UI shows an error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n'Fallback' function is not defined\r\n```\r\n\r\nScreenshot of the error:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29699850/236600638-077cea09-7c5a-4317-bc6d-d2d84665ff1a.png)\r\n\r\nWorkaround: add an empty `fallback()` function to the smart contract and redeploy the smart contract.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThere are some rare cases where a user would want to send manually written `calldata` to a smart contract that does not have any `fallback` function defined. For example, this is required to solve the CTF challenge: [Ethernaut 29. Switch](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/level/29). In this specific example, the smart contract code is already deployed to a testnet and a user may want to simulate the smart contract locally in Remix. So the workaround to modify the smart contract code is not optimal (because the local Remix version won't match the actually deployed bytecode).\r\n\r\nThe current UI design may also be misleading (there's no technical reason why the transaction can't be sent).\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if this restriction was removed. Maybe show a warning dialog that has a \"Send anyway\" button? ",
