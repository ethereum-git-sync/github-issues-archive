  "body": "Remix currently deploys UUPS proxy bytecode which was compiled from OpenZeppelin Contract 5.0 and uses Solidity ^0.8.20\r\n\r\nHowever, the bytecode https://github.com/ethereum/remix-project/blob/ba2113659b614628025ec20a2a1af5f7c7b7c621/libs/remix-core-plugin/src/lib/constants/uups.ts#L5 \r\nappears to be targeting `shanghai` and has PUSH0 opcodes which are not compatible with older EVM versions.\r\n\r\nWhen a user tries to deploy this UUPS proxy to an older EVM environment, they would get an invalid opcode error.  For example, this was [encountered by a user](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/trouble-deploying-uups-contract-with-remix-in-non-shanghai/38075).\r\n\r\nNote that OpenZeppelin Contracts 5.0 does not strictly require shanghai, and can be compiled with older target versions when more compatibility is required.\r\n\r\nRemix can precompile the UUPS proxy using an older target (e.g. `paris`) instead.",
