Remix use `ethers.js` to encode and decode parameters. So if `ethers.js` can support `function` type, Remix will support too.\r\n\r\nI'v already fixed this issue in brochain ide through `patch-package`. Check the image below.\r\n![image](https://github.com/ethereum/remix-project/assets/18543527/fafb8e4c-d039-4d9f-b9fd-084519803e21)\r\n\r\nI will submit a pr for `ethers.js`. After `ethers.js` merge my pr, and release a new version, remix can fix this issue by updating `ethers.js`\r\n\r\nAnd I have another question. Check the link below. What's this for? \r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/remix-project/blob/master/libs/remix-lib/src/execution/eventsDecoder.ts#L65-L70\r\n\r\nThese code seems like unnecessary, it's never be executed before until I fixed the `function` type issue, and it throw an error. Check the image below.\r\n![image](https://github.com/ethereum/remix-project/assets/18543527/08d02da3-06e7-4a27-bb5d-8359624f9b54)\r\n\r\nI suppose I can submit a pr to remove these code.\r\n\r\nBut I really don't understand why it throw an error. I understand I can't assign to a constant. But if the constant is an object, I should be able to assign the property. \r\n",
