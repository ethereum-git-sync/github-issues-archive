  "body": "All called contracts are stored in Remix, so these's no missing source code. But when debugging a transaction which includes a cross-contract call, the debugger loses track of where it is and does not follow the execution into the second contract. It does seem to be showing me the correct instructions and stack state, but with no visual indication that we've called into another contract. \r\n\r\nAlso, setting breakpoints in the second contract is of no help, as the debugger cannot seem to locate them and does not pause execution when they are reached. \r\n\r\nSince most meaningful real-world contracts rely on composition with other contracts (even a simple token wallet must interact with the token contract), this lack of cross-contract functionality makes the Remix debugger fairly useless.",
