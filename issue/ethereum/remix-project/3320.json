  "body": ":wave: Hello, `Remix` team. My name is George, and I'm currently a Frontend Engineer on the Web Extension team of [Trust Wallet](https://trustwallet.com). In the last couple of months, we introduced significant updates to our [web extension](https://trustwallet.com/browser-extension) in line with our values to support impactful Web3 technologies; we would like to contribute by adding an option for users to connect through Trust Wallet provider. \r\n\r\nOur web extension has reached hundreds of thousands of downloads, and we keep expanding. Many users request to connect with the Trust Wallet extension by default and face issues when multiple wallets are installed in their browsers. Currently, there is only the \"Injected Provider\" option which utilizes `window.ethereum`. When multiple injected providers exist, each can replace the other by writing to `window.ethereum` resulting in non-deterministic behaviors. Eventually, [EIP-5749](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5749) will be adopted, but until then, we need a workaround. Supporting multiple injected providers will require re-architecting some core parts of the app. This scope seems to be quite extensive and might require significant effort. However, we would like to propose a workaround by adding a new provider to the [`providerList`](https://github.com/ethereum/remix-project/blob/master/libs/remix-ui/run-tab/src/lib/reducers/runTab.ts#L122). This solution seems to work quite well, without require many additions to the codebase. \r\n\r\nThe result will be adding a new \"Trust Wallet Provider\" option as environment for users.  \r\n\r\n<img width=\"293\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-01-31 at 5 38 42 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118829911/215806254-7a249a7d-230c-441a-8d3b-1590d13c10f3.png\">\r\n\r\nIf TW is not installed or active, users will be notified accordingly.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1040\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-01-31 at 5 41 29 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118829911/215806725-1a8928a7-257f-4150-8b51-48b6bb58a78d.png\">\r\n\r\nWhat are the next steps?
