  "body": "(Remix-alpha, today)\r\nThis is what I see when I debug by transaction hash.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"371\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-08-18 at 11 06 09 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4785356/90490568-70d29d00-e147-11ea-8824-e05d909e203b.png\">\r\n\r\nSome transactions I can debug. For example, in the above case I deployed a contract through udapp and I could debug that deployment transaction just fine. But the second transaction (contract interaction) resulted in the above screen.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I cannot reproduce the exact same transaction with Remix's native compiler & deployer plugins, because I used  a custom optimization technique. But I tried the unoptimized contract version with Remix's native compiler & deployer plugins (not through udapp) and I could debug the transaction.\r\n\r\nThis is not the first time this happened - not being able to debug txns, but I cannot determine a pattern.\r\nDo you have an idea as to why this is happening?",
