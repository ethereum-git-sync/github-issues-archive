At the same time, I want to get the trace of the transaction, can we do that using geth? I have tried to use hardhat/truffle/ganachi, but it does not work (it seems like the framework refuses to send the reverted transaction, but we can forcefully do it on remix IDE).\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction attack1_int_overflow() public {\r\n      multiVulnToken.transferProxy(\r\n          address(this),\r\n          attacker1Address,\r\n          uint256(2 ** 255 + 1),\r\n          uint256(2 ** 255)\r\n      );\r\n      revert();\r\n  }\r\n```",
