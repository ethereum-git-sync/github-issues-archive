  "body": "I have a system that compiles without warnings. Deploying (locally with Javascript VM) works fine with Optimization: 200 turned on, and results in the EIP-170 error otherwise. With optimizations, both `[contract].json` and `[contract]_metadata.json` are generated in the `artifacts` folder and non-empty.\r\n\r\nI delete both of these files. Then I add a marginal amount of bytecode (e.g. add one line to an existing function or add a one-line new function) and the system still compiles and is deployable with Optimizations. `[contract]_metadata.json` is again correctly generated and non-empty. However, the `[contract].json` file is empty. This is unexpected behavior and causes an issue e.g. with running the [sample script](https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running_js_scripts.html#an-example-script).\r\n\r\nPS Unfortunately the system is not open-source so I can't share it. I also spent some time trying to replicate the problem with a constant-size deployment script that would generate non-constant-size runtime in order to emulate the EIP-170 error, however, I was no able to replicate it. Maybe someone else can find a sharable example?",
