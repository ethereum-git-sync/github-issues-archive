  "body": "I noticed that pretty much every time I compile a contract, I get this message:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncompilerMetadata is modifyingartifacts/C.json\r\n```\r\n\r\n![compiler-metadata-is-modifying](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/137030/136550182-5eb2ec24-c696-44bf-a2da-bb672cde215c.png)\r\n\r\nIt looks serious and the icon suggests that this is an error rather than something that's supposed to happen normally. I could not find any info about it other than [some questions from confused users on StackExchange](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/106449/compilermetadata-is-modifying-artifacts-name-of-contract-json). In the source I found this:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/remix-project/blob/6588aea69f8af4a69c2d6d8474db7898f503e37c/apps/remix-ide/src/app/files/fileManager.js#L506-L525\r\n\r\nFrom this it seems to me that it does not mean that something bad happened or that the user is doing something wrong but that simply some part of Remix has requested permission to modify the metadata file. I think it would be better to remove the error icon and perhaps also add text/link that explains what the message means and how the user is supposed to react to it.\r\n\r\nBy the way, the message disappears pretty quickly and is hard to catch. Even if there was a link in it, user does not have much chance to click it unless he's already expecting it to appear. It should stay up longer or be accessible in some more permanent location (maybe in the log window?).",
