Either we remove it or make it work\r\n- [ ] Also, in dropdown we still say `connect to Localhost` and on home tab we say `Access File System`\r\n- [ ] Switching to a workspace from Localhost seems messy\r\n- [ ] Recent workspaces gets messy while selecting a workspace after Localhost \r\n- [ ] I think we can still show the options to add scripts and workflow files even if localhost workspace is selected",
