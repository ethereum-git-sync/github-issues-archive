    "body": "@kot-begemot I was able to debug my issue by building my own state history scraper for my specific problem/contract (and so thankfully was eventually able to find my bug without needing a \"debugger\"). I did not ever get remix (or anything with similar functionality) working (though if I had a full node I think there is a good chance that it would have been possible by doing a recursive wget of the remix website and then modifying the JSON/RPC endpoint in the code to point at a local geth instance... I actually did this, but then realized that the debug_* API was only available with full nodes and I was running a light client).",
