More importantly, we lost the color cues that we were used to with the dark theme:\r\n1. Function names were green, data coming in the function was orange, and the code logic was gray, but now ALL of them are gray.\r\n2. for, return, if, etc, were orange and variables were blue, now ALL are blue.\r\n\r\nIf you simply put a theme with different colors for these code elements, this will make reading code much more efficient.\r\nThank you :D\r\n",

Is this still an issue for you?\r\n\r\nThe problem exists on 5 browsers on windows 10 for me, and its easier to reproduce on a dark theme. Put some comments down and then simply click on different lines, all the the lines blink slightly but the comments are blowing up.\r\n\r\nThank you for adding some colors to the code it really helps out. The function names are still gray, they should pop out with their own unique color, and maybe also the = sign. Thanks!\r\n",
