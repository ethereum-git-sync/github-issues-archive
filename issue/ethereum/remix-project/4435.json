  "body": "Hi!\r\n\r\nThere's a bug that can be reproduced in live web-version, but can't be reproduced locally.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Go to https://remix.ethereum.org\r\n2. Select any deployable contract.\r\n3. Set transaction value to `1` (any unit is fine).\r\n4. Press the contract Deploy button (any outcome is fine).\r\n5. Try to set transaction value to `1` again.\r\n\r\nExpected result: the value changes.\r\nActual result: the value stays 0 as long as you don't try other digits.\r\n\r\nThis bug was fixed in commit https://github.com/ethereum/remix-project/commit/7c5c00687c73dbc369cfc2f04e24df3cff63712c (no bug in this commit, but described buggy behavior presents if built from the previous commit), but it looks like it wasn't deployed to https://remix.ethereum.org?\r\n\r\nOther signs of stale code I noticed:\r\n* `react-dom` version on https://remix.ethereum.org is 17 (can be checked with React developer tools), however it's 18 in the repo.\r\n* there's commit https://github.com/ethereum/remix-project/commit/4fb76840c43c4a1d09485dfd08ff620a1ed3fc76 in master branch, which deleted `validateInputKey` function, which isn't in the repo for several weeks, but this function can be found in currently deployed file https://remix.ethereum.org/162.0.40.0.1704877784384.js",
