  "body": "We have launched our token to BSC and it was deployed through Remix at https://www.bscscan.com/token/0xc15e89f2149bCC0cBd5FB204C9e77fe878f1e9b2, with contract name `HUHToken`.\r\n\r\nFor our token to work with the special features (Reflection) there is the need to have previously deployed an instance of another contract called `RewardDistributor` which was deployed at that opportunity to address https://www.bscscan.com/address/0x1529b357c8559da530c6f26e80fb3ae16258c1eb.\r\n\r\nA month later we deployed both contracts again through Remix but now to Ethereum chain. For our surprise the address of the `RewardDistributor` at Ethereum chain was exactly the same address of the `HUHToken` at the Binance Smart Chain. How is this ever possible?\r\n\r\nTo our team the only reasonable explanation we could have found so far is that there might be a bug in the way Remix IDE decides the address to deploy the contract to. Despite the fact the addresses coincide across chains, the special features of HUH token on both Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain are working flawlessly.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if Remix team assesses the risks associated with this behaviour. In the meanwhile this potential vulnerability is not addressed we will favour other deployment tools instead of Remix due to safety concerns this situation has raised.",
