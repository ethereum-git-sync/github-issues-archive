  "body": "This was originally reported in Solidity, see https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11378#issuecomment-851037842.\r\n\r\nWe have received a bug report from @marco2357 who is experiencing weird, and non-deterministic behavior in Remix tests when the bytecode produced by the Solidity compiler has a particular size (I suspect it's the size just one byte below the Spurious Dragon bytecode size limit). The original report claims it's because the new `bytes.concat()` builtin but after a lot of debugging I'm pretty sure it's just the size of the bytecode produced by the compiler that triggers this behavior.\r\n\r\nIt also makes a transaction fail in remix-tests. I'm attaching instructions to reproduce it below. With remix-tests the repro requires raising the gas limit, which is now only possible by modifying Remix sources.\r\n\r\nI inspected the code and output produced by Solidity and I don't see anything obviously wrong in it which is why I think it might really be an issue in Remix or one of its dependencies.\r\n\r\n### Repro\r\nFirst download the source code attached in the original issue: [problem.tar.gz](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/files/6566358/problem.tar.gz). Then:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\nnpm install @remix-project/remix-tests\r\nnpm install tslib\r\n\r\n# Raise the gas limit by appending `opts.gasLimit.words[0] *= 20` in message.js\r\nsed -i 's/\\(function Message(opts) {\\)/\\1opts.gasLimit.words[0] *= 20;/' node_modules/ethereumjs-vm/dist/evm/message.js\r\n\r\ntar xfv problem.tar.gz\r\ncd problem/\r\nnpx remix-tests --compiler 0.8.4 --optimize true --runs 100 test/SellAtMarket_test.sol\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n```\r\n  1) TestSellAtMarket: Test small\r\n\r\n         error: Transaction has been reverted by the EVM:\r\n{\r\n  \"transactionHash\": \"0xf1a1d6b6841ccc8a5455829ea453e99e65340a0b0c5f13e2f7cf45f90c3a1015\",\r\n  \"transactionIndex\": 0,\r\n  \"blockHash\": \"0x69f7b7a30c97eb7f1bbea2c8e72b43677e395381e30f78d2edcc8411852b36b9\",\r\n  \"blockNumber\": 4,\r\n  \"gasUsed\": 5000000,\r\n  \"cumulativeGasUsed\": 5000000,\r\n  \"status\": false,\r\n  \"to\": \"0xf8e81D47203A594245E36C48e151709F0C19fBe8\",\r\n  \"events\": {}\r\n}\r\n         expected value to be undefined to: undefined\r\n         returned: undefined\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe error disappears if you remove or add even a single byte in any error message in the original source. Or if you change `--runs 100` to e.g. `--runs 200`, which reduces the size of the bytecode.\r\n\r\nI managed to reproduce it by replacing one whole function with a completely different chunk of source code that just happens to take the same amount of space in the bytecode (see https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11378#issuecomment-851037842) which is why I think it's all about the bytecode size.",
