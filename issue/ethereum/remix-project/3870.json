  "body": "I'd like to propose a vyper refactor, so that the vyper plugin has 1st priority support the same way solidity does. Vyper is a fantastic python based language which often performs better than solidity due to it's use of [static memory allocation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbc74oU94FM).\r\n\r\nI am willing to help sponsor this issue. The plugin should be able to:\r\n\r\n1. Support multiple Vyper versions (like solidity)\r\n2. Have a giant compile button (like solidity)\r\n3. Remove the local vs remote compiler option so it's intuitive for people to use (like solidity)\r\n ",
