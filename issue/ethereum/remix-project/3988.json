    "body": "Hi @Ozimuzor,\r\nSorry you are not getting contract flattening working correctly. Can you give us some more context on what you are doing? What environment are you in? Is it desktop remix or the web? Is your remix instance in a long lived tab? Is the contract on your file system via remixd? The more details your give us the better we can help.\r\nDo let us know as soon as you can.\r\n\r\nGod bless.",
