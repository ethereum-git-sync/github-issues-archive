([beta version link](https://docs.welldonestudio.io/code))\r\nHowever, we're hopeful that the Remix IDE will include Rust grammar/syntax checking as well as these other networks often use Rust to construct contracts.\r\nThe Monaco editor of the Remix IDE will thus have a Rust language server integrated into it. \r\nIf Remix IDE supports Rust, there will be a variety of Rust-based plugins accessible.\r\nCan we be permitted to contribute by creating this component?\r\n\r\nYour opinion is needed on Remix IDE's graceful transition to a multi-chain IDE!",

    "body": "@yann300  @joeizang \r\n\r\nHi!  we are testing the functionality of adding a Rust language server to the Remix IDE. The following is how we organized our thoughts.\r\n\r\n1. Use [rust-analyzer](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer) to develop linting and grammar checking techniques for the Rust language and generate a package using wasm-pack.\r\n2. Using the file included in the wasm package, I'll construct a rust-language-provider to be injected into the monaco editor [like this](https://github.com/ethereum/remix-project/blob/master/libs/remix-ui/editor/src/lib/providers/hoverProvider.ts).\r\n\r\nSince Chrome 92, we must specify the \"Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy\" setting in order to use SharedArrayBuffer in this procedure. ([Associated link](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/enabling-shared-array-buffer/)). Therefore, I believe we should change `apps/remix-ide/webpack.config.js` for this.\r\n\r\nThis is the predicament we are in, and I'm curious to see how the discussion over adding this feature is going! :)\r\n",
