  "body": "Since remix knows types of arguments that the contract's method expects it would be super useful if there were type-checks done before making actual calls. At the present moment it seems only basic checks are present (e.g. `number must be positive`).\r\n\r\nThe one that got me confused was calling a function that expects an address without putting double-quotes around it - no error is produced and some result is returned, however  an argument `input` is padded with `0`s differently in both cases\r\n![without quotes](https://i.imgur.com/yqf77sP.png)\r\nvs\r\n![with quotes](https://i.imgur.com/3BVwgAb.png)\r\n\r\nThis example is especially confusing because when attaching to an existing contract via \"At Address\" remix does not allow putting double quotes as it leads to incorrect result (note `0x\"0x...\"` in the result address)\r\n![extra_0x](https://imgur.com/XlI3REIl.png)\r\nso you'd infer you don't need double quotes around addresses.\r\n",
