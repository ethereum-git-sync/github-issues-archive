  "body": "I tried to compile a file that was using an older version of solidity and the compiler plugin tried to load an appropriate one.  But my internet sucks.  So I gave up waiting and switched to another .sol to compile with 0.8.11.  Which I though might be already loaded.  I got this error - I think from the 1st attempt at loading the compiler:\r\n<img width=\"299\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6050001/150254040-59b8660c-a8a3-439e-8985-8db6bd78eb63.png\">\r\n\r\nBut then I had switched to the next .sol file and the compile button is deactivated - probably because the error loading has not been cleared.  So I made this issue thinking that the situation was permanent - and mid-way or 2/3 the way through writing this issue the new compiler loads, the error is cleared and I can compile. \r\n\r\nBut the error should be cleared when I switched files in the editor so that I could see the compiler loading.\r\n\r\nThis was done on Chrome incognito window.
