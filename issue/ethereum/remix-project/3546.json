  "body": "Cloning makes its own workspace.   Workspaces can be initialized for Git.  But if you make a workspace with a template, its a bit painful to push it to Git (even outside of Remix) because of the hoops that github makes you jump through.  Its easier to make the repo on GitHub clone it locally and then fill it up.  But if you want to fill it up with a template, then you have to cut and paste between workspaces.  That is not a good workflow.\r\n\r\n- Of course as of this release 0.32, you can download a workspace or folder and then upload it to the cloned workspace.\r\n\r\n- Or we could try to have some Remix templates on github ready for forking which then get cloned down to Remix IDE.\r\n- Or we could have a \"move\" or \"copy\" option in the right click menu to move files or folders to another workspace.",
