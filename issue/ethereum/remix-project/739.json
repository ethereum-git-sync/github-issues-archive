Maybe the link to the repo can function both as a place to check the code and to the place to report an issue.  \r\n\r\nProbably we need at least 1 new field in the profile to accommodate this.\r\n\r\nWe also need a standardized place to place the repo location and issue creation.  \r\nOne possible location is in the plugin blurb in the plugin manager.\r\n\r\nEDIT: linked to https://github.com/ethereum/remix-project/issues/86",
