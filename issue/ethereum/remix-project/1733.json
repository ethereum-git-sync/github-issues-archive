  "body": "# Proposal\r\n1. Replace remix IPFS gateway `ipfs.remixproject.org` to Crust Web3 authed gateway(https://wiki.crust.network/docs/en/buildIPFSWeb3AuthGW)\r\n2. Pin to Crust Network with IPFS Web3 authed pinning service(https://wiki.crust.network/docs/en/buildIPFSW3AuthPin), Crust Network now is over **7000 IPFS nodes and 2100 PB IPFS storage volume** all over the world, which can make remix's solidity file more decentralized and distributed\r\n3. The blockchain cost from Crust Network will be covered by DCF foundation, so the cost for remix is 0\r\n\r\n# Additional context\r\n1. Uniswap is now using `Pin to Crust` in their DApp CD process(https://github.com/Uniswap/interface/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yaml#L58-L64)\r\n2. Polkadot is now using `Pin to Crust` in their DApp CD process(https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps/blob/master/scripts/ipfsUpload.mjs#L94-L99)\r\n3. The whole pinning service process shows in [here](https://github.com/crustio/crust.js/tree/mainnet/packages/crust-pin#workflow)",
