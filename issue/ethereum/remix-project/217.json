  "body": "Currently:\r\nWhen connecting to Web 3 provider - you put in the address of the provider.  If the provider address is incorrect, you get an error  in a toaster - and then you have to reselect web3 provider, the modal comes up but you've lost the the wrong address that you put in.  \r\n\r\nImprovement:\r\nIt would be better that the modal stays open until the connection has been made.  If the connection has not been made then the error should display in the modal and the user can update the address and try again.\r\n\r\nSo its to update the OK button - so that it doesn't automatically close the modal.  Closing the modal could be the default condition - but if another parameter is present - it could wait to close it.",
