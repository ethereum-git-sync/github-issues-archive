  "body": "When the contract is coded in Yul, it is impossible to use the \"At Address\" button to attach to a deployed contract address (the button stays disabled). The nasty workaround is to switch compiler to Solidity, open a random .sol file, compile it, then paste the address to \"At Address\" - the button then will turn active. Then you can switch back to the original Yul contract file and the button will stay active so you can click it and attach this way. This is wrong - if the Yul contract compiles well then the At Address button should turn on (when there is a valid address).",
