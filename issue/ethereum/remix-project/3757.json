  "body": "I had to reinstall my project folder and was trying to setup remixd and found the docs where not entirely accurate about how to get remixd and its dependencies (solc-select, solc, slither) setup. The way I had to get them to work was to setup a python environment ( should we recommend a newer python setup?), install solc-select using pip install, then use solc-select to download solc versions that matched the version in the ide. I then had to install slither using pip install and then I was ready to use remixd with my remix web instance. \r\nWe might need to update the docs so it is the accurate way to set this up.",
