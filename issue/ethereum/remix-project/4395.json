Then we wouldn't need to monkey with getting the backgrounds to work in all the themes and it would be clear which one is in the active state.\r\n\r\n- [x] As stated above , the warning text for the local compiler should be removed.\r\n- [x] The warning text of the remote compiler should be removed.\r\n- [x] In a near term update, a user will be able to choose the vyper version of the remote compiler - right?  But for now it is 0.3.10 - right?\r\n- [x] Clone Vyper lang repo needs a tool tip to tell users to go to FE to see the files\r\n- [ ] Other design features of the Sol compiler should be incorporated.\r\n- [x] The profile name should be Vyper compiler and the Vyper Compiler line with the logo should be removed.\r\n- [x] The documentation in the plugin needs to be in the remix-ide docs not the old Vyper plugin.",
