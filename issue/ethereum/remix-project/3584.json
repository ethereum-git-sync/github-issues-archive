  "body": "This bug occurs when a token based contract is compiled by right-clicking on the contract file without clicking on the file. When you click on compile in the context menu, the loading icon shows but the compiler isn't really compiling anything.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce this bug:\r\n- Create any token based contract (ERC 20 or 721 or 1151)\r\n- Right-click the contract without first clicking on the contract file and click on compile in the context menu.\r\n- You will notice immediately that the compiler will indicate its busy but will not really do anything.\r\n\r\nClicking on the Solidity compiler plugin shows no file was selected and nothing was compiled.",
