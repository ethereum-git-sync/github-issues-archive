Or at least to be able to load the forked chain and work on it individually.\r\n- [ ] Have a fork with anchors to go back to specific states.  So that while you are developing, you could say forget about the last 3 blocks or to set an anchor to always revert to specific points in the forked chain.\r\n- [ ] Connect a local DApp to the RemixVM",
