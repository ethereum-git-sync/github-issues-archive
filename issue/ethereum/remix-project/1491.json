  "body": "When using a link like https://remix.ethereum.org/?code=Y29udHJhY3QK, Remix immediately shows the code panel instead of the Home screen, which is nice but it still shows the file list in the sidebar. When I'm visiting such a link it's because I want to compile that single snippet so I think that it would be much more useful to switch the sidebar into the compiler mode.\r\n\r\nAs an additional improvement, being able to enable the auto-compile mode via URL parameter might also improve user experience.",
