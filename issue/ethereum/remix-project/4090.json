  "body": "The IDE constantly \"freezes\" for me, when I say freezes, I mean it won't let me send any more transactions through the send tab. I'm unable to interact again. I've tried through Metamask and Hardhat providers, also using the web and desktop version, both lock up on me.\r\n\r\n1. Connect or deploy contract\r\n2. Execute transactions on that contract\r\n3. Eventually interactions stop working, the console still shows \"call to...\" or \"transact to [Contract] pending..\" \r\n4. Only fix is to refresh website or restart desktop app\r\n\r\nNothing indicates that anything is failing in the dev console\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/ethereum/remix-project/assets/34221002/f808cd5e-c3de-42a1-a7f2-f02bcb77466f)\r\n",
