Seems to happen because of indexeddb quota but happens regardless of if you import 1 or multiple repos. Storage can be 10MB used or 20 MB used depending on repos imported but you'll still get the error in both cases. Can be simply reproduced by importing a zip file exported by remix. My zip file had 4-5 different workspaces/repos in it.",
