So, it is efficient to be able to seamlessly switch to Remix and use that contract also in the native plugins.\r\n\r\nDisadvantage: under the hood plugin setup. E.g. Pipeline initially had a proxy contract that needed to be compiled&deployed on the JSVM. You might not want to show these types of contracts (not user-targeted) in the Run tab, to avoid confusion. Or you might if you want full transparency on what the plugin does.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
