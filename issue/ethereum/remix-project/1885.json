  "body": "Currently, when there's an issue with solc-bin (like the recent #1882), Remix silently ignores the error and just presents an empty list of compiler versions to the user. I think it should instead show an error message somewhere to make it clear that something's broken. The message should give some details about what the issue is so that it can be reported in a useful way. E.g. if `binaries.soliditylang.org` is down, it should say that. It might also be a good idea to direct users to report it in the Solidity repository if the problem persists.",
