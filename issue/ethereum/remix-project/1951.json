  "body": "There is a campaign on YouTube right now promoting a scam where people copy and paste code for a \"front running bot\" that supposedly yields 15x BNB what you put in after 15 minutes of waiting. Almost all of the code is commented out and they are just importing a wallet address from another file stored on ghostbin.\n\nThis scam is obvious to anyone who can read the code, but it is geared at inexperienced users. \n\nRemix removes the the normal barriers one must navigate In order to get started writing smart contracts. This is great, but it provides a new route for scammers to trick people. remix is the pinch point for this scam. Without remix the scammers would need to instruct victims to set up a local dev environment, which would severely limit the success rate of the scam.\n\nScams lose their effectiveness when the victim is educated about the scam. This is why scammers usually instruct their victims not to talk to anyone.\n\nI'm adding this issue in the hopes that remix will implement a noticeable brightly colored pop up upon page load to inform people not to copy paste code they do not understand because it is a common fraud tactic. This simple popup with help to reduce fraud in the crypto community.",
