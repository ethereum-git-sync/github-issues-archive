    "body": "I was asked on Remix Game Day to describe my issue I had during the session. I sat down and tried to debug that. Apparently, seems like the issue was two conflicting extensions running in my browser: Frame and MetaMask - which is obvious that, 2 wallets should not be running at the same time. After I tried them running alone, I do not longer see any issues, and Remix is working just fine on MS Edge when I try to inject my Web3 wallet.",
