  "body": "In the deploy sidebar, you can interact with contracts. This nicely loads the contract metadata and shows you all the functions.\r\n\r\nHowever some of the types are hard to use.\r\n\r\nHere is a team shot of us celebrating after we finally figured out which combination of magic was needed to type into the box to call a function with an array-of-struct parameters. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"1512\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-06-14 at 10 16 25\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/382183/173722687-e0c31414-4a09-465d-b6a8-4937fe9faec7.png\">\r\n\r\nMoments later we forgot what was typed in there and I tried to screenshot it fast enough to make documentation for our team. I failed. \r\n\r\nP.S. What is the correct syntax to specify a bytes32 zero value? Is it \"\" or 0 or [] or 0x or \"0x\". This is a quiz!\r\n\r\nTyping into these boxes is a common source of frustration. Hopefully this can be 10x better with tooltip documentation.\r\n\r\nIdeally, it should not be necessary to know that programmers like to use square brackets to make literal array, or other nerd stuff, in order to easily use the deploy tools.",
