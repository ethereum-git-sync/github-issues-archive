What do you mean by **medium contracts**? \r\n\r\nWe also have an new release in about 10 days are soon to begin beta testing.  Would you be interested in helping us beta test?  If so, please fill out this form: https://t.co/ndmTkXHdhP or send an email to remix@ethereum.org   \r\n\r\nIf you can't help with the beta testing, please let us know more details about when the crashes occur and how much is stored in the File Explorer of Remix. To do that, load the DGIT plugin and in the 1st screen of DGIT, you'll see something like this:\r\n<img width=\"310\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6050001/155754870-40694125-7358-4d3b-9468-44eda531bb19.png\">\r\n\r\nPlease let us know the percentage of storage used.\r\nAlso let us know how many workspaces you have.\r\n\r\nThanks for you input!",
