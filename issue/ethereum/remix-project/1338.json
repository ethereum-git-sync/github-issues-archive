  "body": "## Overview\r\nThis is a feature request. \r\nAdd extra parameter to the URL when importing code from Github.\r\n\r\n## Issue\r\n\r\nRemix allows importing Solidity code from Github but it doesn't add an extra parameter to the URL after importing. This makes it impossible to create a link that people can use to open a code sample in Remix.\r\n\r\nOur team currently uses gists for that but it doesn't scale well when you have a large team. What happens is that multiple people own different gists and it makes it hard to have a centralized way to update different code snippets. Also, sometimes you need to update the code fast but the owner of a particular gist might be unavailable, on vacation, or even no longer working in the company. We need to fix that.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nImplement the same logic for importing Github code as gists by adding an additional parameter, such as`&github=https://github.com/documentation_repo/example.sol`. \r\n\r\nThe end result should look the following way: `https://remix.ethereum.org/#optimize=false&runs=200&evmVersion=null&version=soljson-v0.8.4+commit.c7e474f2.js&github=https://github.com/documentation_repo/example.sol`\r\n\r\n## Use cases\r\nThe best use case for this is the developer portal. Our team wants to update code samples once and make developers open them in Remix and load that code in our dev portal. In this case, we have to maintain only one version of the code which will be in the documentation repository.",

I think your solution will require encoding all of the code samples, which is not exactly what we're looking for and is not a scalable way for the long term. \r\n\r\nIt will actually require more work from us, like encoding each time after the code samples have been changed and replacing that value with a new one after each update. \r\n\r\nBut thanks for the suggestion anyway. I do hope you can figure out the way I outlined in the original issue.\r\n",
