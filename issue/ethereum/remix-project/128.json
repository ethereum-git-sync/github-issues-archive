  "body": "There's a UX flaw at the moment regarding the modal which allows to give or deny API access:\r\n\r\nWhen plugin A try accessing plugin B, the modal shows up and ask the user (the modal does not contain the name of the function being called from plugin B).\r\nEven if the user accept (without checking `remember this`), the exact same dialog reappear for the next call.\r\nThe content of the modal being the same, it is hard to understand why one has on to approve the same content x times. And thus the user will certainly ask himself \"what am I really approving?\".\r\n\r\npossible solutions:\r\n\r\n1) display in the modal the name of the function call.\r\nThat will imply modifying the \"remember my decision\", cause that checkbox works at the plugin level and is not fine grained to a specific call.\r\n\r\n2) keep the modal content as it is now, but \"motivate him\" to always accept / deny and persist the info, so the user is not spammed with \"same content\" modal. \r\nThat comes with:\r\n      - having the ability to see the list of function of plugin B (with function description).\r\n      - a clear and simple way of clearing the permissions (which are now hidden at the bottom of the plugin manager component).\r\n\r\nFor \"motivating\" user, we could:\r\n\r\n - remove the checkbox and make the accept button persisting the choice. The UI should make it clear that the \"accept\" is persisting for all subsequent calls.\r\n - keeping the checkbox but auto checking it by default and the label should be \"remember this decision for all the request made by <plugin A>\"\r\n - (we also have the possibility to display the function name in the modal, but that is less important then)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "When you want to use a plugin - you don't have the desire to use part or 5/6th of a plugin ( if there were 6 possible functions) - you want to use all or nothing.  I think it makes sense that it should ask one time if you want to use the plugin and all the things it wants to do.  1 modal per plugin is enough especially if we provide a list of the plugins functions in that modal.  This is basically what you are proposing in your point 1 & 2. & maybe point 3.\r\n\r\nI like that instruction in your point 3.  But I'd also add a link to the plugin manager docs - an updated plugin manager docs - where we explain this issue.\r\n\r\nIn (hidden by default) list of all the methods + description (if exists) of plugin B. - where would this list appear - in the modal - if you click on a box the functions appear?",
