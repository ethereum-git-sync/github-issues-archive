  "body": "Hi Remix project team.\r\n\r\nWe’ve seen the integration of Remix IDE and IPFS, e.g. to load source code from IPFS. A friend of mine and his team is creating a new decentralized storage network called CYFS and we love to make it support the Remix load source code. Could anyone give guidance on what’s the best way to start the discussion? \r\n\r\nCYFS recently [open-sourced its major repo on github](https://github.com/buckyos/CYFS). More documentations are upcoming. If you have any questions please let me know. I am happy to connect to the developer group.\r\n\r\n@xinbenlv\r\n",
