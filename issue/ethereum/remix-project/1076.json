They are checking address checksum and if it's invalid button At Address disables. So I you use https://ethsum.netlify.app/ for example you can get the address with the correct checksum (notice the capital letters in the new address) the button works. \r\n\r\nI think the pop-up in the button must reference something related to that or people wont find the solution. Thanks guys",
