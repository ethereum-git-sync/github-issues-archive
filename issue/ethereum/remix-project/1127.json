  "body": "I tried to compile some legacy contracts in Remix and noticed that compiler versions >=0.4.0 worked, but 0.3.6 did not. The loader just kept spinning.\r\n\r\nThe logs reveal the following:\r\n![Screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20340/115448488-ab7a6100-a211-11eb-9947-734a770fd5e6.png)\r\n\r\nI think the problem is that since 0.3.6 loads the wasm version it should also use the worker. Probably remix uses the worker for >=0.4.0 compilers, and not for older ones. I suggest to change that rule to >=0.3.6.",
