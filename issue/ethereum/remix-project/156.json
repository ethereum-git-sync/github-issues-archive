  "body": "Currently a maximum of 200 storage keys are preloaded when using `at address` to load a contract.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be inconsistent, because if for example function `f()` only reads keys which are part of those preloaded, then it will respond with the value matching that of the blockchain, while if `g()` reads keys outside, it can have different results.\r\n\r\nThis should be changed so that whenever `SLOAD` is attempted, it checks if the key was tried to be loaded via `debug_storageAt`, and if not, it will load it from the blockchain first.",
