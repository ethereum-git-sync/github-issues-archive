  "body": "Web3js released version 4 (fully on the TypeScript)\r\n\r\nIt will be great to move on to the new version.\r\n\r\nI've already started to do this. Here is [PR](https://github.com/ethereum/remix-project/pull/3951) \r\n\r\nI've finished integrating the latest version of wev3js@4x into remix-libs and tests passed. But I still have problems with some browser tests. As the project is huge and complex it would be better if someone familiar with all relations and connections inside the project would finish integration by fixing browser tests. From my side, I will provide any help you need from my knowledge of web3js@4.x library.\r\n",
