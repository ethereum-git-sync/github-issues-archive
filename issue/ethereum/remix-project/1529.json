If you click on Import all files, nothing happens.  If you try to view individual files by clicking on remixbackup, it just adds another `ignoring /` in the log but won't expand the node.\r\n\r\n[remixbackup.zip](https://github.com/ethereum/remix-project/files/7070254/remixbackup.zip)\r\n\r\n\r\nAttaching the zip file for your investigations.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8684037/131208469-0246d619-07c3-4b9e-a984-7fa4057971b2.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
