    "body": "What worked for me for [the above](https://github.com/ethereum/remix-project/issues/991#issuecomment-897204893):\r\n1. I was using remixd, and needed to:\r\n   ```sh\r\n   # get into an elevated interactive shell:\r\n   sudo -i\r\n   # (your password)\r\n   \r\n   # rather than installing \"remixd\" plain globally, I had to qualify it:\r\n   npm i -g @remix-project/remixd\r\n   \r\n   # ensure it's 0.5:\r\n   remixd --version\r\n   # should output >= 0.5.0\r\n   ```\r\n1. Launch the browser version of Remix:\r\n   - The [`-alpha`](https://remix-alpha.ethereum.org) version wasn't working for me, I had to use the [regular](https://remix.ethereum.org) version.\r\n   - Select the `Solidity Compiler` tab and choose your version from the `Compiler` dropdown **to produce the correct URL**.\r\n\r\n1. Launch remixd:\r\n   - I had to use the shared folder path `-s` flag _without_ spaces and _without_ quotes for it to work. If you have spaces in your path, I'd suggest renaming folders until there are no spaces and don't use double-quotes.\r\n   - I had to copy/paste the **exact** url, namely:\r\n     - with `https` at the beginning\r\n     - with the `optimize`, `runs`, `evmVersion`, and `version` params\r\n     - without a slash at the end\r\n     - e.g. `https://remix.ethereum.org/#optimize=true&runs=200&evmVersion=null&version=soljson-v0.8.7+commit.e28d00a7.js`\r\n   - Paste the URL into the remix-ide url `-u` flag _with_ double-quotes:\r\n     ```sh\r\n     remixd -s /absolute/path/to/your/shared/dir -u \"https://remix.ethereum.org/#optimize=true&runs=200&evmVersion=null&version=soljson-v0.8.7+commit.e28d00a7.js\"\r\n     ```\r\n\r\n1. Return to Remix and select the `File explorers` tab, change the `Workspaces` dropdown to localhost and click `Connect`. Make sure remixd shows at least the line:\r\n   ```sh\r\n   [INFO] <your locale datetime> remixd is listening on 127.0.0.1:65520\r\n   ```\r\n   among other lines, and that it doesn't return control to the terminal, it should look like it's hanging.\r\n\r\n1. I was able to then compile, select `Injected Web3` to use MetaMask and I was off to the races without open-zeppelin compiler version mismatch errors (despite also using solc < 0.8 as indicated by the error message).\r\n\r\nHope that helps. YMMV. Good luck!",

    "body": "I gave up on a smart contracts concluding that technology this cumbersome\nand aggravating is doomed to failure.\n\nOn Thu, Aug 19, 2021, 10:45 AM Shaun Lerner ***@***.***>\nwrote:\n\n> What worked for me for the above\n> <https://github.com/ethereum/remix-project/issues/991#issuecomment-897204893>\n> :\n>\n>    1.\n>\n>    I was using remixd, and needed to:\n>\n>    # get into an elevated interactive shell:\n>    sudo -i\n>    # (your password)\n>\n>    # rather than installing \"remixd\" plain globally, I had to qualify it:\n>    npm i -g @remix-project/remixd\n>\n>    # ensure it's 0.5:\n>    remixd --version\n>    # should output >= 0.5.0\n>\n>    2.\n>\n>    Launch the browser version of Remix:\n>    - The -alpha <https://remix-alpha.ethereum.org> version wasn't working\n>       for me, I had to use the regular <https://remix.ethereum.org>\n>       version.\n>       - Select the Solidity Compiler tab and choose your version from the\n>       Compiler dropdown *to produce the correct URL*.\n>    3.\n>\n>    Launch remixd:\n>    - I had to use the shared folder path -s flag *without* spaces and\n>       *without* quotes for it to work. If you have spaces in your path,\n>       I'd suggest renaming folders until there are no spaces and don't use\n>       double-quotes.\n>       - I had to copy/paste the *exact* url, namely:\n>          - with https at the beginning\n>          - with the optimize, runs, evmVersion, and version params\n>          - without a slash at the end\n>          - e.g.\n>          https://remix.ethereum.org/#optimize=true&runs=200&evmVersion=null&version=soljson-v0.8.7+commit.e28d00a7.js\n>       - Paste the URL into the remix-ide url -u flag *with*\n>       double-quotes:\n>\n>       remixd -s /absolute/path/to/your/shared/dir -u \"https://remix.ethereum.org/#optimize=true&runs=200&evmVersion=null&version=soljson-v0.8.7+commit.e28d00a7.js\"\n>\n>       4.\n>\n>    Return to Remix and select the File explorers tab, change the\n>    Workspaces dropdown to localhost and click Connect. Make sure remixd\n>    shows at least the line:\n>    [INFO] <your locale datetime> remixd is listening on 127.0.0.1:65520\n>    among other lines, and that it doesn't return control to the terminal,\n>    it should look like it's hanging.\n>    5.\n>\n>    I was able to then compile, select Injected Web3 to use MetaMask and I\n>    was off to the races without open-zeppelin compiler version mismatch errors\n>    (despite also using solc < 0.8 as indicated by the error message).\n>\n> Hope that helps. YMMV.
