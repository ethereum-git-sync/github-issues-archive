  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nCompilation errors and warnings are currently printed in a way that is not very readable. I think that fixing this would improve usability and allow users to better understand compiler output.\r\n\r\nRemix seems to be using the `formattedMessage` field from the Standard JSON output, which is really meant for console tools. Instead Remix should be using the individual components of the message, which are also included to allow tools to format messages their own way. `solc` itself uses that information to colorize the messages it prints to the console. In case of Remix colors would be nice too but as a GUI tool it has many more ways to make them more usable. For example it could make the source location a link and take the user to the affected line when it's clicked. Or it could hide included code snippets by default and display a button for unfolding them.\r\n\r\nOne more problem with printing the `formattedMessage` is that Remix seems to squash all the whitespace included in it. The compiler inserts this whitespace to align the `^^^^` indicators in the terminal. In Remix these indicators do not point exactly at at the right places in the included code snippets.\r\n\r\n## Compiler output\r\nA sample contract with a few bugs: (`C.sol`):\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract C {\r\n    function f() public {}\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract D is C {\r\n    function f() internal\r\n    override {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is what the output of `solc C.sol --color` looks like:\r\n![solc-compiler-errors](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/137030/133339180-eb132c51-2557-4d87-8d1e-2593612c5708.png)\r\n\r\n## Remix output\r\n![remix-compiler-errors](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/137030/133459907-a5645995-2fc5-43ab-808d-f7e6759171df.png)",

    "body": "Also, there's an ongoing discussion about whether the compiler should also provide already colorized messages in Standard JSON: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11507. These are mostly aimed at console tools though - for example colors would be represented using ANSI sequences and messages would still use whitespace for alignment. There are JS libs for converting ANSI sequences to HTML so I guess Remix could use it as a quick and dirty way to display prettier messages, but I think that reconstructing the message from components and making parts of it clickable/foldable is a better long-term solution.\r\n\r\nIf you think this would be useful to Remix though, feedback is welcome. Especially whether you think that ANSI sequences are a good way to do it.",
