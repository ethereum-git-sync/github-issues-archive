  "body": "I encountered a non-critical issue while using the Remix Beta IDE (https://remix-beta.ethereum.org/) that involves importing code from the \"@openzeppelin/contracts\" npm package. Here are the details of the problem:\r\n\r\nCreated a folder named \"src\" in the Remix Beta IDE.\r\nInside the \"src\" folder, I created two files\r\nBoth files contain npm imports, like this:\r\n\r\n    import \"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol\";\r\n\r\nWhen I initially pasted the code in the files, I encountered an error message indicating that the import could not be loaded. Unfortunately, I didn't save the exact error message, and I am unable to reproduce it by deleting all local storage. However, I observed that the error message mentioned something like \"deferring to ./ERC721.sol\".\r\n\r\nInterestingly, I noticed that the npm packages were being downloaded into .deps successfully, but the error persisted.\r\nTo troubleshoot, I switched from one file to the other and then switched back. After this switch, the error disappeared, and the import statements worked correctly in both files without any loading issues. It seems to resolve itself when switching between files. I hope this information helps in identifying and resolving the problem.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I am unable to reproduce the issue.",
