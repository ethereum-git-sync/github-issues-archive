They are checking address checksum and if it's invalid button At Address disables. So I you use https://ethsum.netlify.app/ for example you can get the address with the correct checksum (notice the capital letters in the new address) the button works. \r\n\r\nI think the pop-up in the button must reference something related to that or people wont find the solution.

    "body": "Hey guys - I'm currently having the same strange issue with Remix. I deployed a smart contract on a custom chain (`chain_id: 999`) and whenever I try to load it from address it does not load. However, if I first load the exact same contract deployed on Rinkeby (or any other public testnet) it loads and thereafter I change my injected web3 provider to the `chain_id : 999` and it also successfully loads the smart contracts. The RPC from the custom chain is working fine (I back checked this). I tried it with a couple of other contracts and sometimes even the public testnet contracts do not load. I've been using Remix for more quite a while and never experiences something like that.",
