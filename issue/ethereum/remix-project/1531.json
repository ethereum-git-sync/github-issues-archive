  "body": "Hi, I've been working on some unit testing for various string handling type functions, and the unit test I've written crash both remix and remix-alpha.\r\n\r\nI suspect a timeout, as I am testing the same long-running function, and the test completed when I only had one or two test, but when I added 6 or 7 of the same function with different parameters, it took a very long time, and then I got the Aw snap page.\r\n\r\nI have no idea why these tests are taking so long (seems like 20-30 seconds) its the sort of thing that would complete in 300ms in Javascript, but its a fair amount of string manipulation and loops, but I have no sense of why, really. \r\n\r\nIf it would be helpful I can supply the zip but it seems like it just what happens when you exceed some kind of timeout.\r\n\r\nI will upload if helpful.\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8684037/131240115-38fd1ab2-fd83-45de-8fe5-00bdaaa66ce4.png)\r\n",
