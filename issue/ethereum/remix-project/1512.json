  "body": "Stories for easier plugin development\r\n\r\n- A plugin dev wants to see the plugin(s) he is working on loaded each time the IDE loads\r\n- A plugin dev wants to choose if the plugin persists on reloading IDE\r\n- A plugin dev wants to delete a local plugin without reloading IDE\r\n- A plugin dev wants to easily see their locally loaded plugins without having to scroll up and down in the plugin manager\r\n- A plugin dev wants to debug plugin calls more clearly\r\n- A plugin dev wants to use duplicate names to test calls without modifying other plugins\r\n- A plugin dev wants to retry loading a plugin when it fails to activate\r\n- A plugin dev wants to see if the plugin handshake fails\r\n- A plugin dev wants a local plugin to be able to activate another local plugin\r\n\r\nPotential To do's:\r\n\r\n- [ ] store all locally loaded plugins in local storage and reload them when app manager starts. now it stores only 1 and doesn't load or activate it.\r\n- [ ] have a checkbox in the local plugin modal to allow the plugin to persist so that it is reloaded\r\n- [ ] have a delete button next to local plugins in the list, often plugins fail to load and then you are forced to reload IDE\r\n- [ ] have a separate list in plugin manager for local plugins so they can be easily deactivated/activated, this would increase dev speed a lot. When this list is empty you don't show it obviously. \r\n- [ ] have a reload button next to plugin that properly reloads, same as deactivate/activate\r\n- [ ] when a duplicate name is used a user can be prompted to deactivate the old plugin and use the new one instead, this would be very useful when developing on existing plugins.\r\n- [ ] add dev options to the plugin so console shows well formatted call data for the specified calls.\r\n- [ ] have debug settings for the engine in the IDE to allow easily debugging calls \r\n- [ ] Remove restrictions on activatePlugin calls when they are locally loaded\r\n\r\n",
