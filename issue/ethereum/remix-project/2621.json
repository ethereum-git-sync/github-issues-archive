  "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI use Ethereum Remix IDE to develop and test a contract. \r\n\r\nI have the following contract method.  In order to set contract owner you must first own the contract. If you don't, a revert with an error will occur.\r\n```solidity\r\naddress public owner;\r\n\r\nerror ErrMustBeOwner(address MsgSender, address CurrentContractOwner);\r\n\r\nmodifier mustBeOwner() {\r\n    if(msg.sender != owner) {\r\n        revert ErrMustBeOwner(msg.sender, owner);\r\n    }\r\n    _;\r\n}\r\n\r\nevent EventContractOwnerChanged(address OldOwner, address NewOwner);\r\n\r\n/**\r\n*   Set contract owner.\r\n*/\r\nfunction setOwner(address _newOwner) public mustBeOwner {\r\n    emit EventContractOwnerChanged(owner, _newOwner);\r\n\r\n    owner = _newOwner;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd I have the following testing script:\r\n```js\r\nit(\"test setOwner with foreign signer\", async function(){\r\n  const [owner, foreignOwner] = await ethers.getSigners();\r\n\r\n  // it's the same as \"await contract.deployed()\"\r\n  const ctrApi = await deployCtrHelper()\r\n\r\n  // set different owner\r\n  await ctrApi.setOwner(foreignOwner.address);\r\n\r\n  // test if different owner is actually set\r\n  let _owner = await ctrApi.owner();\r\n  expect(_owner.toString()).to.equal(foreignOwner.address);\r\n\r\n  // test if old owner can re-set the owner to itself\r\n  // it shouldn't\r\n  await ctrApi.setOwner(owner.address);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nI receive an error when contract method `setOwner()` is called 2nd time (aka when it reverts):\r\n> `Message: Error from IDE : overflow (fault=\"overflow\", operation=\"toNumber\", value=\"520786028573371803640530888255888666801131675076\", code=NUMERIC_FAULT, version=bignumber/5.5.0)`\r\n\r\nIs it a bug? Any ideas how to solve it?",
