    "body": "@drafish  Soo nooo thats the weird thing bro, i know theres front runner bots for scams but the contract was made by me and i deployed and ran it. My eth hasnt moved to any address its still there,. I created that contract and funded it, and ran it. Thats the weird part if it was a scam ive seen multiple examples where it transfers to the scammers wallet but this isnt  the case. The code clearly states ( send eth directly to the wallet of the person who deployed the contract and my address since i used injected web3 (metamask) my address was embedded in the code. Sooo you or someone said that they were able to \"run transactions and find the contract with the \"@ address. wasnt it you? You told me you were able to get to that point. The network congestion isnt MY issue. I didnt save the orginal contract i deployed my comp had an update and im dumb cleared the cache. It was up and i was able to run trasnactions and deploy and start. The weird thing is i copied the same code and tried to compile to the code to run transactions again but for some reason copying and pasting doesnt copy the same. Sooo i hope you understand. The eht is there it hasnt been touched or transfered since i deployed and ran it. All i need is to Compile the code and enter the contract address soo i can run the trasnaction of \"withdrawl\" didnt you tell me you coded it where it worked ? I need to get to THAT POINT. i have the page with the copy and pasted code. If you can get me to this point on the orginal remix-ehterium soo i can pull the eth i will give you $200 immediately as long before saturday. Like i believe it was you that did it. Soo please please if we can get to that point to where i can compile the data & run the withdrawl transaction and search by the contract address, @drafish  im 100% sure it was you. Let me give you the link of the Code i copied and pasted maybe you can point out the error but i know the scam going on but this is not the case the funds and eth are still in my contract and the coding  code states ( back to wallet address of contract creator something like that don't quote me on the exact formula but here is the link to the site that i copied and pasted the code. Im sorry i really dont mean to bother you but i will def pay you for you time and effort im reallty sorry and im mosst defitley never touching code ever again >.< i will pay you thanks again.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso dont know if this helps but this was in the code. My buddy did it i know theres those scams going around but this wasnt it. This was from a private group he was able to it but i need to get to the point where i can run trasnactions\r\nthis was embedded in the code \r\n\r\n\" \r\n     * @dev withdrawals profit back to contract creator address\r\n     * @return `profits`.\r\n     */\r\n    function withdrawal() public payable { \r\n        emit Log(\"Sending profits back to contract creator address...\");\r\n        payable(withdrawalProfits()).transfer(address(this).balance);\" \r\n        \r\n        ",

But instead of that, it only transfer 1 wei to another address. \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18543527/201007405-e3057cf0-33f8-47d3-bb5f-a2d93cb1cdc4.png)\r\nIs this your address? Did you change the scammer's contract code so that the contract will send ether back to your address?\r\n\r\nAnyway, I think I know why you can't compile your contract. It because you got the suffix of the contract's filename wrong. It shoud be `.sol` not `.eth`. Rename your filename and try again.\r\n\r\nNo need for money. Happy to help. @Dprice2413 ",

    "body": "Sooo you think it didn't compile because of the name ? If I rename it would\nthat fix it ?\nMy main issue is I literally copied and pasted the same code I used\noriginally and it wouldn't compile that's why I'm confused. I also do have\nthe contract address and transaction hash. I just wanna try thank you if\nthis works I'll pay u. Question if you read the contract I deployed would u\nbe able to distinguish what's the issue ?! Or idk it's weird if I copied\nand pasted the same exact code it should compile. I literally know the\nsteps that not the issue the problem is I copied and pasted like I did the\nfirst time and it won't compile and thags why I'm confused I entered the\naddress of the contract at address and because it wouldn't compile it\nwouldn't let me and greyed out\n\nOn Thu, Nov 10, 2022, 5:00 PM drafish ***@***.***> wrote:\n\n> Yeah, I understand what you say.
