  "body": "When debugging a failed transaction, the code jumps seemingly randomly.  For instance, it jumps from a function call to a line at the end of an uninvolved function in a different contract.  I don't know assembly well enough to verify that the line highlighted in the code window is in fact where the jump landed, but I can verify that it was a very large jump (01764->11223) when the actual function that should be called appears 20 lines above it in the same contract.  It also seems to jump at times when no function is being called, such as when creating a new dynamic array.  \r\n\r\nI'm using 0.5.17+commit.d19bba13.  \r\n\r\nIs this a known issue?  If not, I can put some thought into how to create an example of it.",

    "body": "Update:\r\nSome of the issue was caused by me replaying a deployment transaction under the assumption that it would reflect changes in the compiled code (which I figured out it doesn't when I noticed that the bytecode is hardcoded in the replay json).  After fixing that, I'm still left with some jumping, but since the code continues to proceed roughly the way I would expect, I'm guessing it's a visual artifact of the debugger.  I also notice that the function stack and locals are frozen at some early point in the code execution and don't update after that.  It seems to be struggling with stepping through/highlighting the code in other source files, but the functions stack and locals stay frozen even after it returns to the main source file.",
