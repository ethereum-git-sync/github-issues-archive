  "body": "Hello. I have run into an issue when deploying contracts using Remix. I came across this issue when I tried to verify a contract that I had (thought) I compiled with `optimization` enabled and `0` runs and was not able to verify it on Etherscan using `0` runs. I then tried to verify it with `200` runs and it worked.\r\n\r\nThis leads me to believe that there may be a bug when checking the value we input in to the `runs` input in https://remix.ethereum.org. Maybe it's just checking for `!runs` and defaults it to `200` when it is `0`.\r\n\r\nThis is causing issues because I can only compile and deploy my contract with 0 runs.",
