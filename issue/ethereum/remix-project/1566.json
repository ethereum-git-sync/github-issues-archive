    "body": "@djdenny56 actually thanks to their gitter chat: https://gitter.im/ethereum/remix?at=5dec986bd64a052fb6d6d4fe a few members explained a good workaround to import the compiler. \r\nWhat they suggested worked for me so let me share and then close this issue so others may benefit :) \r\n\r\n**To summarize:** \r\n\r\n1) Go here for a list of their custom compiler versions: https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/tree/gh-pages/emscripten-wasm32 \r\n\r\n2) Then paste the version you need after this url: https://binaries.soliditylang.org/ into remix\r\n\r\n3) So for example for version 0.7.4 this would be the URL: https://binaries.soliditylang.org/emscripten-wasm32/solc-emscripten-wasm32-v0.7.4+commit.3f05b770.js\r\n\r\n4) Then in remix go to the compiler tab, select (+) button above compiler and paste in the entire URL. \r\nIt will import that version compiler\r\n\r\nCredits to:  @PostMan56 & @zlex7 from Gitter chat for their solution\r\n",
