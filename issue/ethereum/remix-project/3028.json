  "body": "Etherscan Contract Verification plugin does not properly handle **failed verifications**. In the code it only clears the periodic check interval upon successful verification. However, if verification does not pass, it just keeps pinging and waiting for success regardless, effectively taking a toll on the Etherscan API key quota. This must be fixed (I had to manually clear `localStorage.receipts` store to make it stop)\r\n\r\nI am pretty sure there are many cases where people don't even notice this while Remix keeps pinging Etherscan for nothing.
