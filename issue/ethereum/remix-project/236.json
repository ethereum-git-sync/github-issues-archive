  "body": "comment from gitter\r\n`\r\n@yann300 @chriseth I'm running Remix as a Chrome extension but I'm getting destructive behaviour often when it starts up... It asks to overwrite local files with files from 'the cloud'. As an extension I have no idea what it thinks 'the cloud' is or where it stores these often older versions of my files but it does keep a set in local storage also. Regardless, I'm never sure which set are current and have on numerous occasions had days worth of work reverted by some older set of the same files.... Any ideas?\r\n`",
