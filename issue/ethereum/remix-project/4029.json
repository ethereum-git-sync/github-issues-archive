  "body": "I know that remix is already using discord. But I don't think discord is good for discussions about specific subjects. \r\n\r\nFor example,  someone asked a question on discord, and I answered it. Everything is good. But what if someone else ask a similar question one month later. I don't want to answer it again, but I certainly should not tell him to review the chat history on discord. I can just send him a link, if we first start the question on github discussions. Maybe he can find the answer by him self, if he search some keywords on github or google.\r\n\r\nSomeone may say that why don't use **issues**, why **discussions**. Well, issues can be used that way. In fact, people use **issues** as discussions a lot. But that's the fact before github developed **discussions**. Now we have **discussions**, why don't we separate discussions from issues.\r\n\r\nTo me, **issues** are more like tasks, you can execute it. Maybe it's a bug, or a feature request. You know exactly what to do, and no need to discuss with anyone else. You can add it to release projects and milestones.\r\n\r\nHowever, **discussions** is for something that is not so executable. People can ask questions and discuss features. You can't and don't need to assgin a discussion to someone. It's open to everyone. You can create an issue from the discussion when it came to a conclusion for specific feature request or bug or enhancement. Then you can assign the issue to someone.\r\n\r\nHere is the default categories of **discussions**\r\n\r\n- Announcements: Updates from maintainers\r\n- General: Chat about anything and everything here\r\n- Ideas: Share ideas for new features\r\n- Polls: Take a vote from the community\r\n- Q&A: Ask the community for help\r\n- Show and tell: Show off something you've made\r\n\r\nI really think remix should use it. @ryestew @yann300 ",
