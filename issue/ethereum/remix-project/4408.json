The top of the FE loaded with no files.  10 seconds later the clone came in.  This is not an unreasonable amount of time - but it looked like a but to me.  So a spinner would help here - or at least something saying that the files are getting cloned and will arrive shortly. \r\n\r\nand finally upon loading my 4th or 5th template, I found the warning in the toaster.  I totally missed the toaster because I was looking in the FE.  The warning needs to be in the FE\r\n",
