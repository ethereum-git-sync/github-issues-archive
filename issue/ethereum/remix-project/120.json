  "body": "When using remix with remixd to work on local files, it will sometimes claim that the file has been changed outside of remix (ie. outside the remix editor), this is not the case. And I don't remember it being like this before it became a plugin. \r\n\r\nPossibly all that is happening is that the internet connection between remix and remixd is being broken, although I don't think this should cause remix to think the file has been edited. I don't know how it works, but if a broken connection causes it to assume files have been changed, then that is wrong. The frontend should store a chksum of recent files, or something like that. If the connection breaks, it should just try again in a second, and only give up after some seconds.\r\n\r\nProblem is when it pops up that \"files edited outside of remix\" dialog, if you click outside it, it closes all your files - which I suppose is right, but it is very easy to do it by accident. Best tho if it did not \"give up\" so quick in the first place.",
