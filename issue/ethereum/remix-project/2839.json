  "body": "## Background\r\nThe core parts of the projects tooling seem to be far behind and it would be nice to upgrade them to be as close to the latest stable realease versions as possible. This is more an encouragement to form framework and cadence for how often we should upgrade and maintain our tooling. This will be influenced significantly by prevailing winds (security, performance and standardization).\r\nThe aim of this would also be to improve DX (developer experience) and not necessarily UX.\r\nThe target tooling / packages are:\r\n  + @nrwl/cli (nx and related packages) current version - 12.3.6 ---> target version should be latest -4 minor.patch release numbers\r\n  + node & npm current version 14.17.6 --> target version should be latest LTS version - 1.\r\n  + eslint and associated packages\r\n  + typescript\r\n  + dotenv\r\n There are a few packages that could be added for general DX improvements\r\n  + prettier & associated packages\r\n \r\nFalling behind on version numbers is normal for production builds of any software but we should agree on a tooling release cadance and if possible, automate the upgrade of packages as per this cadance.\r\n\r\n## Proposed Documentation\r\n  + @nrwl/cli integration with [circle ci](https://nx.dev/recipe/monorepo-ci-circle-ci) and [github actions ](https://nx.dev/recipe/monorepo-ci-github-actions)\r\n  + eslint and packages in nx [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEVNYmJ05Ew)\r\n  + prettier with nx [here](https://blog.nrwl.io/the-react-cli-you-always-wanted-but-didnt-know-about-eaa2494aab9e)\r\n  + nodejs version scheme [here](https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule)\r\n\r\n## More Context\r\nThis is an open ended issue that warrants discussions, policy making and should engender dialog for (especially) DX.",
