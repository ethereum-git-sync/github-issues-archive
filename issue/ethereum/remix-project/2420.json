  "body": "Hi\r\nI'm trying to debug tx [`0xd45111d7c22a4ba4a1cd110c8224859000fcb0cd5cefd02bd40434ac42a07be6`](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xd45111d7c22a4ba4a1cd110c8224859000fcb0cd5cefd02bd40434ac42a07be6) using the source code from Etherscan.\r\nSomeway in the middle the debugger crashes and the whole window just goes blank.\r\nI guess there are 2 issues here:\r\n1. Some bug causes the debugger to crash.\r\n2. When the debugger crashes it takes with it the whole app (I've experienced that a few times but only now I bother to report).\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n1. Open Remix\r\n2.  Set an Etherscan access token in the settings\r\n3. Set the environment to some mainnet provider (e.g. `https://rpc.ankr.com/eth`) \r\n4. Activate the debugger and load tx  `0xd45111d7c22a4ba4a1cd110c8224859000fcb0cd5cefd02bd40434ac42a07be6`\r\n5. Make sure the debugger loaded the source files from Etherscan\r\n6. Move the debugger slider to somewhere in the middle (try a few points in the middle if it doesn't crash immediately)\r\n7. The whole window will crash\r\n\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3751364/169704658-8246b4d4-6cd2-43bf-9fbc-873369d7c63d.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3751364/169704671-6533740a-7b5a-4b83-865b-975f54933cb2.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3751364/169704228-8de67542-4abf-4335-90a8-7e25644585f6.png)\r\n",
