I deploy contract successfully, however I cannot test it. When I click on \"Transact\" button, I expect MetaMask to popup or somehow to enter the value -- but it does not happen. It just says \"transact to contract xyz.newXyz pending\" but nothing happen.\r\n\r\nUsing Injected Provider - Bespoke (Neon EVM)\r\n\r\nThe browser is firefox.\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\nIt should ask / allow for value to pay in the transaction call.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**\r\n\r\nnothing happen",
