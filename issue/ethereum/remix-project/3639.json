The cors proxy of remix only works for git server which has public ip, like github and gitlab. \r\n\r\nIf I need to clone a repo located in LAN, I should use my own cors proxy which also located in the same LAN. There is no way to configure the cors proxy address, so I also need to replace it in code and start my own remix service. It will be much better if the cors proxy address is configurable. That's just a suggestion.  What I'm concerned now is how to deploy a cors proxy.\r\n\r\nI don't know what kind of setup you're talking about.

    "body": "I see your point too. Up to now I haven't been able to access bitbucket from remix. The cors proxy doesn't help. Gitlab yes, for cloning public repos, not private. Only GitHub works fully. So running this proxy wouldn't help. I will run some more tests. The safest way to go for you there is to use remixd or remix desktop. Either one. You'd be doing your git operations locally and not in remix. But I will do some more research. Running this cors proxy is simple in itself. You just run the npm package. We do it in a service. Nothing special about it. ",

Check the function below, located in `remix-project/node_modules/isomorphic-git/index.cjs` line 6243 ~ 6245\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18543527/236719354-22546b6c-2a81-4418-95a0-3fc0b39e7d06.png)\r\n\r\nThis is not right for bitbucket. Check the docs link below.\r\nhttps://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver0516/personal-access-tokens-966061199.html\r\n\r\nOnly need one parameter, which is the token. In my case, token is password. So I modified the function like this. \r\n```javascript\r\nfunction calculateBasicAuthHeader({ username = '', password = '' }) {\r\n  return `Bearer ${password}`\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIf the token is username, then it should be \r\n```javascript\r\nfunction calculateBasicAuthHeader({ username = '', password = '' }) {\r\n  return `Bearer ${username}`\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI tested it on the private bitbucket service located in the LAN of my company. It worked.\r\n\r\nI also tested on `https://bitbucket.org`. That didn't work. Still don't know why.",
