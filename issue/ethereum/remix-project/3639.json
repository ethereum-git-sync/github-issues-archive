    "body": "Yeah, some thing like local. The git server is deployed in the LAN of my company which can't be visited through WAN. I totally understand why the cors proxy of remix didn't work, because it can't access LAN. The cors proxy of remix only works for git server which has public ip, like github and gitlab. \r\n\r\nIf I need to clone a repo located in LAN, I should use my own cors proxy which also located in the same LAN. There is no way to configure the cors proxy address, so I also need to replace it in code and start my own remix service. It will be much better if the cors proxy address is configurable. That's just a suggestion.  What I'm concerned now is how to deploy a cors proxy.\r\n\r\nI don't know what kind of setup you're talking about.
