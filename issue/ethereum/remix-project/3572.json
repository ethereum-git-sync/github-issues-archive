  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nCurrently, the Move language lacks a comprehensive analyzer that provides code completion and linting features. This would greatly improve the developer experience and increase productivity when working with Move code. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI propose implementing a [Move analyzer](https://github.com/move-language/move/tree/main/language/move-analyzer) that integrates with the Language Server Protocol (LSP). This analyzer should provide:\r\n\r\n1. Code completion: Offer suggestions for variables, functions, modules, and other Move constructs as the developer types.\r\n2. Linting: Analyze the code for syntax errors, unused variables, and other issues that may cause problems at runtime or make the code harder to maintain.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nAn alternative would be to rely on existing Move tools and editor plugins. However, these solutions might not offer the full range of features provided by a dedicated LSP-based analyzer, leading to a suboptimal developer experience.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nImplementing this feature would significantly improve the overall developer experience when working with Move code, making it more accessible and efficient for both new and experienced developers.\r\n\r\nrelated: #3058 \r\n",
