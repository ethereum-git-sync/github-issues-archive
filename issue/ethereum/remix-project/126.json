  "body": "The compilation of a solidity contract collection starts with setting up a virtual filesystem in the form of a collection of files with paths and content. If you want to replicate a compilation, you are usually advised to use the metadata file generated at compilation time. If that is not available anymore, you have to recreate the layout of the files as they were at time of complication, so that the metadata hash and the relative import paths work properly. If you just want to recompile a small file, remix currently makes it hard to do so, because it prepends the `browser` prefix to every file in the current set. This is of course necessary to avoid file name with other source trees like the github gist or the github source tree.\r\n\r\nTo simplify this small use-case, remix could remove the `browser` prefix for newly generated files. I would assume that such a prefix is unexpected for the users (as opposed to the other prefixes), especially when the workflow is merely \"add new file, name file\" and does not include \"create directory\".",
