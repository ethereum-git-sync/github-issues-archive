    "body": "The `function()` syntax is not currently available in the human-readable ABI parser. Can you provide the topic for that event? My guess is you could probably replace the `function()` with `bytes4`, but I’m not sure whether they do that conversion when computing the topic hash.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to open an issue on ethers GitHub to track this. If changing it to a `bytes4` fixes this, I would probably recommend this as the solution for now, since adding parenthesis to the parser would complicate a lot of the LL(1) states, as the parser was hand-written.\r\n\r\nI may switch to a Jison-based parser in the future which would make these changes much easier, but does add quite a bit of overhead to the library.",
