  "body": "I'm looking over the chrome local storage for remix and how it stores the files locally, but I'm wondering if there is a way to decode this information to acquire: \r\n\r\n- Possibly all deployments to VM and what contract was deployed and when, similar to artifacts but for the Remix VM\r\n\r\n- Possibly versions of contracts saved, not sure what redundancy remix uses, but I'm assuming it saves changes in a chronological order so technically if you have access to all the local storage you can see the very first and last change right? How do you do this? \r\n\r\n- See when a contract file was created, or decode from local storage when X.sol was added to remix local storage? \r\n\r\n- How to see a record of historical deployments to remix VM? \r\n\r\n\r\nCan someone help from the remix team or someone familiar with how chrome stores local storage DB data to recover the metadata associated with remix local storage data?",
