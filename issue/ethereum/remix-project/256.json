  "body": "<!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->\r\nRunning the following simple contract in the Remix IDE on Ropsten works fine. But when Remix is connected to Ganache it results in a VM Exception that states that it ran out of gas. I played around with setting to gas price manually but it still ended up in the same exception. I know that this issue has been submitted before but I could not find a solution that worked for me. I also tried it with another local blockchain (testrpc) and it resulted in the same error. It seems to be a problem of the Remix IDE in combination with local testnets. \r\n\r\n````\r\npragma solidity >=0.4.25 <0.6.0;\r\n\r\ncontract EtherContract{\r\n    function send() payable public {}\r\n    \r\n    function getBack() public{\r\n        msg.sender.transfer(address(this).balance);\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    function getContractBalance() public view returns(uint){\r\n        return address(this).balance;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n````\r\n<!--- DO NOT PASTE ONLY IMAGES OF TERMINAL OUTPUT AS AN ISSUE --->\r\n\r\n<!--- WINDOWS USERS: Please READ all of the error / debug output and make sure that the issue \r\n      isn't due to you missing something before creating an issue.
