Then, when I tried to import `https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/[proper commit hash]/contracts/math/SafeMath.sol`, nothing happened. \r\n\r\nWith no way to delete the imported source file from the file explorer I was stuck. The current workaround (other than being more careful with imports) is to refresh the page, losing your current state. \r\n\r\npossibly related issue: ethereum/remix-ide#2332",
