  "body": "It seems that the debugger panel crashes when debugging a transaction with special types, in my case a function type.\r\nTo reproduce the issue, with this contract:\r\n```solidity\r\npragma solidity >=0.8.0 <0.9.0;\r\n\r\ncontract DebuggerCrasher {\r\n    uint256 public value = 42;\r\n    \r\n    event Log(uint256 value);\r\n    \r\n    function run() public {\r\n        function() view external returns (uint256) f = this.value;\r\n        emit Log(f());\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\none just need to deploy it, call the `run()` method, and click on _Debug_.  Stepping forward eventually crashes the Debugger, with those logs:\r\n```\r\nTypeError: e.type is null\r\n    solidityLocals https://remix.ethereum.org/main.js:2\r\n    [...]\r\nmain.js:2:1997109\r\n\r\nTypeError: Q.type is undefined\r\n    formatSelfFunc https://remix.ethereum.org/main.js:146\r\n    [...]\r\nmain.js:146:2978240\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems that the issue can be fixed by adding a `try / catch` [here](https://github.com/ethereum/remix-project/blob/ea3d3c41f0d867f9a18415ba282e113d144c3853/libs/remix-ui/debugger-ui/src/lib/vm-debugger/solidity-locals.tsx#L13-L43) as it was done in https://github.com/ethereum/remix-project/pull/1350",
