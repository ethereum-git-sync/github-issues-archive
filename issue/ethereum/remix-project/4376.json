  "body": "I am trying to deploy my contract on bloxberg testnet. I have written the contract on remix ide and built it. Now, I want to deploy it. I choose \"Injected Provider - Metamask\" and connect to my account. Next, I deploy the contract.\r\n\r\nI keep getting the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncreation of HelloWorld pending...\r\ncreation of HelloWorld errored: Error occured: Invalid params: unknown field `type`, expected one of `from`, `to`, `gasPrice`, `gas`, `value`, `data`, `nonce`..\r\n\r\nInvalid params: unknown field `type`, expected one of `from`, `to`, `gasPrice`, `gas`, `value`, `data`, `nonce`.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have also tried to deploy a \"HelloWorld\" contract to make sure that the error is not caused by my contract. This attempt also failed, therefore I believe the issue is not related to my contract.\r\n\r\nI have seen the issue #1282 and I wonder if there is a similar problem here. I also found [this section of code](https://github.com/ethereum/remix-project/blob/6bdf4b8864d8821592af7c57017fcaafb55bd3df/libs/remix-lib/src/execution/txRunnerWeb3.ts#L22) from the repository which looks like it is related to this but it's a code which is 2 years old and I am not sure if that could be the issue.\r\n\r\nMetamask version: 11.7.2\r\nI am using remix-ide on https://remix.ethereum.org/",
