  "body": "I recently ran all e2e tests locally. And I found some errors and also have some suggestions.\r\n\r\n## Errors\r\n### group_test script \r\nIn readme, there is a shell example.\r\n```\r\nyarn run group_test --test=debugger --group=10 --env=chromeDesktop\r\n```\r\nIt didn't work. I can't pass parameters through yarn. I need to use npm to run group_test script to make it work.\r\n\r\n### terminal.test.ts \r\nThere is a mistake in line 10\r\n```\r\n'Should execution a simple console command #group1 #group999': function (browser: NightwatchBrowser) {\r\n```\r\nI think it should be `#group9`.\r\n\r\n### nightwatch_local_ballot script\r\nThis script will not run `ballot.test.ts`, because it has been splited into groups, nightwatch will skip it.\r\nThere are many other scripts like this one.\r\n\r\n## Suggestions \r\n### name of test files  \r\nIn vscode, files will naturally group like this, which is good.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18543527/194826019-4f43597c-6489-45e9-9dda-c99d03cae97c.png)\r\nBut, there is a exception. Between `editor_group.test.ts` and `editor.test.ts`, there is `editor_line_text.test.ts`. This is not good. If we use camel case, this kind of situation can be avoided.\r\n\r\n### non_group_test script\r\ngroup_test script is awesome, but it won't work for non-group test files. So I think it will be nice if there is a non_group_test script for non-group test files.\r\n\r\n### script like nightwatch_local_ballot\r\ngroup_test for group, non_group_test for non-group. I think that will be enough. There is no need for script like nightwatch_local_ballot. A lot scripts can be removed. \r\n\r\n### etherscan_api.ts, plugin_api.ts, vyper_api.ts\r\nThe name of these test files does not contain `test`, and group_test script won't work for them. I know that is on purpose. It needs to start a local plugin service to run those tests. You want to sperate them from other tests that not need for additional service. That's why you write special shell script and run special test on CircleCI for each of them.\r\n\r\nBut I think that's not necessary, because it's the same situation like remixd. A child process for remixd will be started during the test, and it will be killed after the test. We can do the same to those three test files. \r\n\r\nI will be happy to submit a PR, if you like my suggestions.   @yann300 @Aniket-Engg @ioedeveloper @bunsenstraat \r\n\r\nI really learn a lot on this project. Thanks to all the team members of remix.\r\n",
