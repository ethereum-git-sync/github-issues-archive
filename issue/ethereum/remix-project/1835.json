  "body": "Hello. A very unfortunate thing happened. I was coding like since 5 or 6 hours when I turned off my PC. Obv i could do 100000 backups and have it solved but i believed remix was solid enough to not delete files randomly. Well, I opened my pc, loaded remix and my code is vanished. The sol file is there, but empty. All the others sol files are ok. Anyone can help? I lost hours of work due to a bug?",
