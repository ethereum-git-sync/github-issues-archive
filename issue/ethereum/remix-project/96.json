It also includes installation-related topics such as password authentication, proxy servers, SSL, and service management.\r\n\r\nWhen installing Remix-IDE, do not install as \"root,\" use a Node \"version manager\" to ensure compatibility, and note that Remix-IDE v0.9.4 requires a Node version from 10.13.2 to 10.19.0. \r\n\r\nHere is a basic example for installing the Remix-IDE server using \"nvm\":\r\n``` bash\r\n# ensure compatibility\r\nREMIX_IDE_VER=\"0.9.4\"\r\n\r\n# target node version, \"lts/dubnium\"\r\nNODE_VER=\"10.19.0\"\r\n\r\n# nvm installation location\r\nNVM_DIR=/opt/nvm\r\n\r\n# put nvm code there\r\ngit clone https://github.com/creationix/nvm.git $NVM_DIR\r\n\r\n# activate nvm (it is essentially all bash scripting)\r\nsource $NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\r\n\r\n# install target version of node\r\nnvm install $NODE_VER\r\n\r\n# add appropriate \"bin\" directory to PATH\r\nexport PATH=$PATH:$NVM_DIR/versions/node/v$NODE_VER/bin\r\n\r\n# install remix globally\r\nnpm install remix-ide@0.9.4 -g\r\n\r\n# start remix-ide server\r\nremix-ide\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou should now have a Remix IDE available for local use at http://localhost:8080. To serve it publicly and securely, consult the above-mentioned [Remix-IDE Server Installation](./docs/remix-ide-server-installation.md) guide.\r\n\r\n/// Move git clone remix remix-ide link instructions to \"developing\" section below\r\n\r\n## DEVELOPING:\r\n",
