  "body": "GM!\r\nWe are the DSRV-based WELLDONE Studio Team([https://welldonestudio.io/](https://welldonestudio.io/)), and provide web3 developer tools. \r\nWe are developing a multi-chain compiler plugin, and we have begun developing chains based on both the move and rust programming languages.\r\nWe are now working on offering an environment for Aptos contract developers to participate in hackathons utilizing Remix IDE and our plugin at the Aptos Hackathon in December.\r\nWe are now working on a compiler for Aptos, but in the long run, we will also work on a compiler for other move-based chains.\r\nBut nothing will be highlighted if you create a file with the`.move` extension in the current Remix IDE.\r\nSo, we'd like to add grammar so that the move language is highlighted; can you approve the PR if we open it?",
