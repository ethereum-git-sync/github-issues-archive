  "body": "When compiling in truffle in Remix the byte-size is different than the byte-size compiled in Truffle locally in Ubuntu. I noticed this when I was compiling my smartcontract which was about 23.85 kb while in remix it exceeded 24kb giving me warning. I don't know where it's adding 0.15+ kb from. Sorry I can't really share my smart contract but It's ERC721 Openzeppelin based. So I can't exactly know whats going wrong.\r\n",
