  "body": "### Problem\r\nTrying to use debugger using Injected Provider (MetaMask) with other networks (I'm trying with Hedera) apart from Ethereum mainnet and some of the most popular testnets, results in error because of Metamask itself. \r\n\r\nHowever when using networks like Sepolia with Injected Provider debugging is possible due to Remix using it's own internal VM.\r\n\r\nI suspect that this is because [detectNetwork](https://github.com/ethereum/remix-project/blob/master/apps/remix-ide/src/blockchain/execution-context.js#L73) method, which checks, if the `chainId` is the same as the hardcoded ones (Mainnet,Goerli,Sepolia,etc...) and if's not there, then network is set as `Custom`. This prevents Remix from using internal VM\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nAdd Hedera (Mainnet/Testnet/Previewnet/Local) in this IF statment or refactor and make a list of supported networks (which includes Hedera as well). As well as change whenever else is needed to make debugging possible.\r\n\r\n### Releated Issues\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/issues/21611\r\nhttps://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-json-rpc-relay/issues/2055",
