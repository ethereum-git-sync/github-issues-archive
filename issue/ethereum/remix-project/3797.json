  "body": "The etherscan plugin has this info modal pop up when hovering over the i icon.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"323\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/ethereum/remix-project/assets/6050001/2e0469ff-955d-45e1-bc03-88cb1ec855e6\">\r\n\r\nIn the proxy contract - at least in our docs, the implementation contract refers to contract that imports the eip 1967 - like the first contract below:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"295\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/ethereum/remix-project/assets/6050001/ea674a22-94d1-4ecb-bb28-d481be89f02c\">\r\n\r\nand the second is the proxy contract.\r\n\r\nSo the interface looks like it is for verifying both at the same time - but the i icon info reads like you need to verify that one before the proxy - but its not clear how to verify that first.   Or maybe I am getting confused by the It's a proxy contract checkbox.  Because the impementation is not the proxy contract - its the implementation - so it would get verified just like any other contract.\r\n\r\n## Process problem\r\nSo now that I have verfied the implementation  - like any other \"normal contract\" I then go to verify the proxy.  So I need to cut the contract's address out of the address box and paste it into the implementation box.\r\nFrom this:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"323\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/ethereum/remix-project/assets/6050001/8a5e894c-923f-48eb-8c50-e2f012a16bf1\">\r\n\r\nto this:\r\n<img width=\"310\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/ethereum/remix-project/assets/6050001/260dce7b-4357-4ced-9906-0bb3e2a5eac2\">\r\n\r\nand it worked!  ... I think.\r\n\r\n### Did it work?\r\nI have to know that I can go to the receipts page.  When I do I see this:\r\n<img width=\"433\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/ethereum/remix-project/assets/6050001/681ffe9c-c90a-4013-b4e2-ab77d29a49ec\">\r\n\r\nSo all is well - as long as I know that treat the implemenation contract like any other.  I was so excited to use the new proxy feature that it was very hard to convince myself that the 2 don't get verified at once.  And I had to read the Remix docs on Proxy contracts to double check.\r\n\r\nI will update this issue possibly with an updated tooltip.\r\n\r\n- [ ] the tooltip, \"Click to proceed\" is not needed and only adds noise to the page.\r\n\r\n",
