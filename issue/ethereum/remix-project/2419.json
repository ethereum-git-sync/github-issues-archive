  "body": "In cases when account creation isn't possible (e.g. public providers or providers who don't support account creation) then calling read-only (view/pure) functions fails with the following error `call to HelloWorld.greet errored: Returned error: invalid argument 0: hex string has length 0, want 40 for common.Address`.\r\nThe reason why it fails is because Remix sets the from address to an empty string as can be seen below:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3751364/169693992-f2500968-e517-40a2-a587-b485c61a167a.png)\r\n\r\nThis can easily be solved by using the zero address instead of an empty string, as seen below:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3751364/169693974-76559cb2-d5eb-4858-a955-adcdc1b49205.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\nI've used a simple 'hello world' contract to demonstrate the issue:\r\n```\r\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\r\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\r\n\r\ncontract HelloWorld {\r\n    string public greet = \"Hello World!\";\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe contract is deployed at `0x0076903247755aD241e4E23f050DB141aDc1C77F` at Rinkeby testnet.\r\n\r\n1. Open Remix\r\n3. Create `HelloWorld.sol` file and paste the code there\r\n4. Compile the contract\r\n5. Go to `Deploy & run` tab\r\n6. From environment choose `web3 provider` and set the provider to `https://rpc.ankr.com/eth_rinkeby`\r\n7. Load the contract from address  `0x0076903247755aD241e4E23f050DB141aDc1C77F`\r\n8. At the loaded contract click `greet`\r\n\r\nExpected behavior - a response with 'hello world' should be shown\r\nActual behavior - nothing happens and an error is shown in the terminal as shown below:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3751364/169694260-99b779cc-17a4-4064-92e6-dc851c148ef4.png)\r\n",
