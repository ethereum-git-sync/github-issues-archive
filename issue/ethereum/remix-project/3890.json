  "body": "We want to see `contractAddress, blockNumber, blockHash` in brochain ide. Remix does not show these three columns in terminal logs. So we add them like this.\r\n![image](https://github.com/ethereum/remix-project/assets/18543527/a2e87b52-4a75-4b11-950c-6db9571858a8)\r\n![image](https://github.com/ethereum/remix-project/assets/18543527/e97b51a6-a24e-4522-bbe7-dbddfb36703c)\r\n\r\nI suppose remix want to show contractAddress, it just get the property from the wrong object. Check the code below. It should be `receipt`, not `tx`.\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/remix-project/blob/master/libs/remix-ui/terminal/src/lib/components/RenderKnownTransactions.tsx#L43\r\n\r\nAnd forget about `regionId`, it's just a special column that only exist in brochain.\r\n\r\nI can submit a pr, if your team like my proposal.",
