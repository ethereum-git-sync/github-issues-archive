  "body": "It has become clear that in the current solc AST, `walk()` and `walkList()` do not fully walk a an entire solc AST tree. For example to descend into an `IfStmt` or `Block` you need to look at the `Statements` attribute. \r\n\r\nThis is why `walkFull()` was written. Also, in tracing those routines, there is a bit of inefficiency on each time walk is (recursively) called. At the Javascript level, the `walk()` function causes two callbacks of a node (caused by what probably was thought of as a type check in typescript, but in really is a _cast_ which doesn't check the type at runtime) .\r\n\r\nAlso in `walk()` at each iteration there is introspecting and possibly adjusting the callback parameter  via `manageCallback()`. If this is to be done it need be done only once. \r\n\r\nIn my opinion callback modification should be removed altogether. I understand it follows how things work in solc output selectors, but in my experience this isn't used that much to warrant adding it to the library. All of this can and in my opinion should be done by the provider of the callback. \r\n\r\nAnd the reason this inefficiency is mentioned and important is that traversing a tree should be fast and therefore not have things in it that are unnecessary or slow traversal.
