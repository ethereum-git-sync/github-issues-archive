  "body": "## Problem\r\nWell, it's good to see you guys bring prettier back. But it's not the time to add `pre-commit` hook yet. Because there still have many code that haven't been formatted by prettier, and pre-commit will cause unnecessary code change, and it will be difficult to review the real code change.\r\n\r\n## Suggestion\r\nHere is my suggestion. Pick up a time that everybody stop coding, and format all code once for all. Then you can add the pre-commit hook. And you should do this everytime that the prettier config has been changed. I mean you don't want to see any code change that caused by prettier when you are reviewing the code, right.\r\n\r\n@ryestew @yann300 @joeizang ",

    "body": ">One way we could solve this is to cause a code format first and make a commit comment indicating formatting change?\r\n\r\n@joeizang Do you mean that there are only two commits in every PR, and one for code formats, and other one for the real code changes, and you only review the other one, instead of review the whole PR?\r\n\r\nThis is a way. But you can't control the commits so good. What if you commit twice or more for the real code change. In that case, you have to review the whole PR. So I still think formatting the entire code base is the best way. Maybe next release, like v0.35.1",
