  "body": "## Problem\r\nWell, it's good to see you guys bring prettier back. But it's not the time to add `pre-commit` hook yet. Because there still have many code that haven't been formatted by prettier, and pre-commit will cause unnecessary code change, and it will be difficult to review the real code change.\r\n\r\n## Suggestion\r\nHere is my suggestion. Pick up a time that everybody stop coding, and format all code once for all. Then you can add the pre-commit hook. And you should do this everytime that the prettier config has been changed. I mean you don't want to see any code change that caused by prettier when you are reviewing the code, right.\r\n\r\n@ryestew @yann300 @joeizang ",
