  "body": "Right now `findNodeAtSourceLocation()` traverses an entire AST tree (las does its predecessor in `astWalker.js` did). \r\n\r\nMore efficient and better would be to revise this using `try`/`catch` with a custom error . There may a stigmatism in the JavaScript community around for this kind of thing, so I mention it here first. \r\n\r\nHowever this kind of use of `try`/`catch` happens quite frequently in other programming languages. For example Python uses it to stop Iteration, Ruby does something like this too (I am told) . \r\n\r\nThis was mentioned on Jun14 on the discord remix channel. ",
