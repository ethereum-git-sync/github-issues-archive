  "body": "Right now, when I try to call a function that has some sort of \"bad math\" or uses some token that I don't have enough of, it gives a very arbitrary `gas estimation failed` error.\r\n\r\n```\r\nGas estimation errored with the following message (see below). The transaction execution will likely fail. Do you want to force sending?\r\nThe execution failed due to an exception. Reverted\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be great if it gave a little insight into _where_ the issue was being made. For example, if I deploy this contract on Kovan: https://remix.ethereum.org/#version=soljson-v0.6.6+commit.6c089d02.js&optimize=false&evmVersion=null&gist=536123b71478ad4442cfc4278e8de577\r\n\r\nAnd then hit `requestVolumeData`, there isn't any insight into why it's failing. In this case, the contract needed to have some LINK it in. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Additionally\r\nMaybe another work around for working with oracles at least, would be to have a `Deploy and Fund` button, that calls `approve` on an ERC20 and sends the contract some token as well.\r\n",
