  "body": "The issue is this:\r\nwhen calling deactivatePlugin on the the engine manager it will it try to make a .call to the plugin to be deactivated, in case of a websocket plugin that has not been connected this will lead to an error, as the connection is not opened. This also applies to any plugin that has not successfully been activated or connected, as there is no communication. Sometimes a plugin can be active in the engine while there's actually no communication possible. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/remix-plugin/blob/c80ff04611a9181074995e5253b90c4a50dd1f47/packages/engine/core/src/lib/manager.ts#L195\r\n\r\nCreating a deactivatePlugin on appmanager solved part of this problem as it would just toggle the plugin. But toggling will reactivate it repeatedly. Having \r\n```\r\n                const isActive = yield this.isActive(name);\r\n                if (!isActive)\r\n                    return;\r\n```\r\nAs a check before toggling in Appmanager breaks e2e with URL loaded plugins. \r\nA fix in plugin is needed I think to avoid making unnecessary calls to the plugin if a call cannot be made. The assumption being that a plugin that's active or a websocket that's not active can be deactivated without permission.\r\n\r\n",
