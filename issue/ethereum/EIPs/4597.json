  "body": "Just out of curiosity, there are EIPs out there suggesting reducing the gas costs for calldata to help with L2 initiatives.\r\nThe thought seems to be that calldata is sort of ephemeral except on historical nodes, gas costs could be lower.\r\nIsn't part of the problem that people leave contracts consuming storage indefinitely on blockchain?  \r\n\r\nSo EIP-3529 killed off the mechanism disincentivizing leaving data out there forever, folks were abusing it as a mechanism for investing in gas, ie gas tokens to burn and get a refund.\r\n\r\nGas is supposed to decouple the price of eth from the cost of doing smart contracts.  Generally works well.\r\n\r\nIf contract memory was cleaned up, wouldn't it help with scalability too, as far as gas fees go?\r\n\r\nWhat about an idea requiring contract accounts actually hold a certain amount of eth as a balance based on the amount of memory they are consuming, and making non-view functions either non-operable unless more eth is placed into the contract, sort of like staking?  Or maybe all data is purged, including memory, after X amount of time of having not enough eth balance.\r\n\r\nHow many dead ERC-20 tokens are out there with many holders?  Is there a purpose?\r\n\r\nGas fees cover the cost of a transaction, and initial storage use in a block.   What about ongoing storage requirements?\r\n\r\nMaybe it is two different issues - transacting, block costs is on miners - and calldata plays into that.\r\nLong term storage is on node operators, which isn't incentivized - but that's OK because maybe if you are hosting a node you are actually using it for other benefit, storage for your own web3 project.   \r\n\r\nThere are a lot of initiatives focused on keeping data flowing into the chain - what about helping node operators?  Or is EIP-4444 also saying archive nodes won't be able to get calldata > 1 yr old?   So unless enough nodes are monitoring rollups, one would not be able to fully validate offchain transactions by standing up a new archive node, correct?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
