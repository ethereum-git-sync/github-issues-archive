  "body": "---\r\neip: <to be assigned>\r\ntitle: Non-fungible Data Token\r\nauthor: Ben <ben@ost.com>, Johann <@johba>\r\ndiscussions-to: https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/auditable-storage-passing/1722\r\nstatus: Draft\r\ntype: Standards Track\r\ncategory (*only required for Standard Track): ERC\r\ncreated: 2018-10-29\r\nrequires: ERC721\r\n---\r\n\r\n<!--You can leave these HTML comments in your merged EIP and delete the visible duplicate text guides, they will not appear and may be helpful to refer to if you edit it again. This is the suggested template for new EIPs. Note that an EIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your EIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `eip-draft_title_abbrev.md`. The title should be 44 characters or less.-->\r\n\r\n## Simple Summary\r\n<!--\"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.\" Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the EIP.-->\r\n\r\nSome use-cases require to have dynamic data associated with a non-fungible token that can change during its live-time. Examples for dynamic data:\r\n- cryptokitties that can change color\r\n- intellectual property tokens that encode rights holders\r\n- tokens that store data to transport them across chains\r\n\r\nThe existing meta-data standard does not suffice as data can only be set at minting time and not modified later.\r\n\r\n## Abstract\r\nNon-fungible tokens (NFTs) are extended with the ability to store dynamic data. A 32 bytes data field is added and a read function allows to access it. The write function allows to update it, if the caller is the owner of the token. An event is emitted every time the data updates and the previous and new value is emitted in it.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n<!--The motivation is critical for EIPs that want to change the Ethereum protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the EIP solves. EIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->\r\n\r\nThe proposal is made to standardize on tokens with dynamic data. Interactions with bridges for side-chains like xDAI or Plasma chains will profit from the ability to use such tokens. Protocols that build on data tokens like [distributed breeding](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-distributed-breeding-function/5264) will be enabled.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n```\r\npragma solidity ^0.5.2;\r\n\r\nimport 'openzeppelin-solidity/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol';\r\n\r\ncontract ERC1537 is ERC721 {\r\n  \r\n  event DataUpdated(uint256 indexed tokenId, bytes32 oldData, bytes32 newData);\r\n  mapping(uint256 => bytes32) data;\r\n\r\n  function mint(address _to, uint256 _tokenId) public {\r\n    super._mint(_to, _tokenId);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  function burn(uint256 _tokenId) public {\r\n    super._burn(ownerOf(_tokenId), _tokenId);\r\n    delete(data[_tokenId]);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  function readData(uint256 _tokenId) public view returns (bytes32) {\r\n    require(_exists(_tokenId));\r\n    return data[_tokenId];\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  function writeData(uint256 _tokenId, bytes32 _newData) public {\r\n    require(msg.sender == ownerOf(_tokenId));\r\n    emit DataUpdated(_tokenId, data[_tokenId], _newData);\r\n    data[_tokenId] = _newData;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\n<!--The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->\r\nThe rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made.

The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->\r\n\r\nThe data field is used either for storing data directly, like a counter or address. If more data is required the implementer should fall back to authenticated data structures, like merkle or patricia trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
