  "body": "### Motivation\r\n\r\nTo have consistent and simple way referring to EVM versions in clients and tools.\r\n\r\n### Specification\r\n\r\nA limited subset of semantic versioning ([semver](https://semver.org)) is introduced for EVM versions. Only a `major` and `minor` version numbers are used, `patch` level is omitted.\r\n\r\nIn the past, almost each hard fork made a breaking change (and thus introduced a new `major` bump) to the underlying EVM implementation, but this is not necessarily a requirement for future hard forks.\r\n\r\nThe past changes are versioned as follows:\r\n- `1.0` - Frontier\r\n- `1.1` - Homestead (+ EIP7)\r\n- `2.0` - EIP150.1c (\"all but one\", OOG changes)\r\n\r\n### EVM version identifier\r\n\r\nThe #154 proposal can be extended to include the above version numbers in a binary format. A straightforward way is to store `major` and `minor` as an 8 bit value each. Setting certain restrictions would allow to pack them into a single 8 bit value.\r\n",
