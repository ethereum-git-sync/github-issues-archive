  "body": "I hope this is the right place to discuss the feasibility of an idea that could improve performance and reliability of applications and services writing data in high frequency to the Blockchain.\r\n\r\nWe are currently working on a service where we write hash values in a storage smart contract on behalf of users (document notarization use case).\r\n\r\nThe problem that we are currently facing is that because of our transaction volume and the transaction pool limits, we have to cache and queue signed transactions. It occasionally happens that one transaction in the sequence is non-executable for various reasons (e.g. gas price too low). This means that all following transactions will not go through either and have to be signed again by the issuer. We managed to automate this process, but it creates too many moving parts for us.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if transactions of an account could be optionally executed without the nonce checking. This obviously creates the risk of replay attacks. But what if a transaction is fully idempotent, such as simply setting a variable in a contract to a value? \r\n\r\nA possible way of doing it (but not sure if it would work) could be to set the transaction nonce to a static value \"implicit\", meaning, that the number of the transaction could be derived from a previous transaction and/or determined by the miner (probably necessary if more than one \"implicit\" transactions would go into a block.\r\n\r\nAnother way could be to make use of account abstraction, as proposed in https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/86 and https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/208. The transaction sender could then perhaps define his own rules to validate the transaction and (hopefully) under awareness of possible consequences, can disable nonce checking.\r\n\r\nAssuming the transaction itself is fully idempotent, the only risk that I see is that an account's Ether balance could be depleted accidentally. I would however see the developer of the Dapp in the responsibility to make sure that this can't happen.\r\n  ",

    "body": "Bitcoin has something called [Child Pays For Parent](https://themerkle.com/what-is-child-pay-for-parent/) (CPFP) - That could work by adding it into miner software and as an option for the users in wallets. Basically you'd send a new transaction with `nonce of the unconfirmed transaction + 1` and pay a higher gas price that pays for both. Miners will see the new transaction and include both in a block to receive a reward. It might be a bit tricky for code executions, because it's not easily calculated whether the price covers the parent without running the transactions.",

Question is, what is the safest way at the application level to identify whether some transaction is missed or not? so that we can resubmit it. \r\nWe are thinking about wait for event triggered per transaction but making it full proof is the challenge. Any comment?",
