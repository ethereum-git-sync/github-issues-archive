  "body": "### Proposed Change\r\n\r\nEIPs numbers are meaninglessly sparse due to the numbering system being based on github PR number (which also increases when issues are open).\r\n\r\nWe're quickly coming to EIP 10k and have far fewer than 10k EIPs.\r\n\r\nThis sparsity makes it less clear the lime relationship amongst EIPs and the colloquial use calling EIPs by their number is going to become more and more cumbersome as EIP numbers lengthen.\r\n\r\nThis is also something of a (not critical) security flaw. Someone could easily open and close thousands of issues in this repo to push EIP numbering even farther.\r\n\r\nI recommend one of two options:\r\n1. From the latest EIP assigned, start assigning purely sequentially (+1) from there\r\n2. (controversial) Go back and fill in all of the gaps leading up to the latest EIP assigned. This hurts the meaningfulness of the time relationship between EIPs but is a nice use of a scarce resource\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nEDIT: Including ERCs, there are only 611 EIPs (thanks @timbeiko). This represents a 10x waste factor in the numbering system!",

It's nice to be able to tell that EIP-1153 is older than EIP-4844. \r\n\r\nThat said, I could see doing (2) as part of a larger change, e.g. splitting out the ERCs & EIPs repositories and having one of the two \"backfill\" while the other one continues incrementing. \r\n\r\nFor reference, as of today there are only ~600 EIPs, including ERCs, and the split seems to be roughly even between both categories.

It tells a history that's worth preserving.\r\n\r\nPreferably we can go sequential starting from 9000 instead of 10,000, to get some more 4 digit EIPs before we enter 5-digit territory. Note that the `EIPS` dir in the EIPs repo only has 614 files; we don't actually use that many EIP numbers. \r\n\r\nThat range of a 1000 4-digit numbers is precious, and can last a few years, at which point we might even start a different process (e.g. EL/CL spec approach), and use the 10,000+ range.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, then we can say [it's over 9000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiMHTK15Pik), easy to remember the new type of EIP numbering.\r\n",

It was updated last week I think, but it had an issue so we disabled it until it is fixed. Should be able to try it again soon.\r\n\r\nStrongly disagree on back filling gaps. The number -> time relation is valuable.

    "body": "> @SamWilsn Why should we wait for a special number?\r\n\r\nSome EIP/ERC authors want special numbers and may game, snipe and lunge to get them.  Automatic assignment will likely be abused so that some authors get the special number they want.  \r\n\r\n[UPDATE checking the code for the automatic assignment, it adds a random number so number gaming is much harder, so less need for a large gap, could just start at 7000] ~Starting at 10,000 and offering a mechanism to get lower numbers reduces the desirability of special numbers above 10,000.  Otherwise there needs to be a process where EIP editors can manually assign a number, but using sequential numbers means there are no spare numbers to assign to.~\r\n\r\n> @timbeiko  I think this is a whole other can of worms 😅 If we are to consider this, then IMO we'd want a much broader community consensus than just EIP editors, as it feels like auctioning off a \"public\" resource for \"private\" gain.\r\n\r\nI want to see high quality EIP/ERCs via a fast, smooth, relatively pain free process. Funds could go to EF, Protocol Guild or some other public body with a mission to fund further improvements to the EIP/ERC process and EIP/ERC editing long term.  I would be against any perception of private gains of public goods.",

GitHub did stop the bots within a few days, and removed the spammed PRs/Issues, but I cannot recall if they were able to fix the numbering of PRs/Issues that was incremented or not. Therefore, there is a chance that spam attack has affected the numbering.\r\n\r\nLastly, look up how Zcash does their ZIP numbering. I forgot, but I think it was neat.

Users don't need to care about numbers: they can call it fee burn or danksharding.\n\nFor protocol contributors, having the numbers helps be more succinct in communication, and put up several different proposals for a same feature, like was done for Withdrawals or SELFDESTRUCT removal. In these cases, using words may lead to more confusions than numbers. ",
