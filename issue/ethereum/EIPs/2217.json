  "body": "```\r\nTo come up with these updates gas costs, the performance of the ecrecover precompile was measured at 116 microseconds per ecrecover invocation. Assuming the ecrecover gas price is fair at 3,000 gas, we get a price of 25.86 gas per microsecond of a precompile algorithm's runtime. With this in mind, the pairing precompile took 3,037 microseconds to compute 1 pairing, and 14,663 microseconds to compute 10 pairings. From this, the pairing algorithm has a fixed 'base' run-time of 1,745 microseconds, plus 1,292 microseconds per pairing. We can split the run-time into 'fixed cost' and 'linear cost per pairing' components because of the structure of the algorithm.\r\n```\r\n\r\nhow to test performance of the precompiled contract on my own??Do you have any testing scripts?",
