But for the discussions-to field in the header, if you create a GItter issue, you have to edit it to update the EIP title with the number and the link on the EIPs website. I suggest adding the EIP number based on the PR number. But I guess it's not too much extra effort to change the EIP title after merging, while the link on the Gitter topic would need to updated from the PR to the EIP webpage anyway.",
