    "body": "Thanks for the insight @MicahZoltu. \r\n\r\nMy current thinking is that at the very least there should be a standard way of interacting with identities. For example, there might be many identity providers such as uport, but from my application/contract I shouldn't care what and how this identity is being sourced and I should be able to interact with it consistently. For example, a contract might want to request access to someone's profile picture and user name, different identity providers will probably store and handle that information in different ways, but I should be able to access that information and not a care about each providers specifics. I think, an EIP that defines how those interactions happen, how permissions to certain things are requested and granted, and how information gets passed back and forth is valuable, and would enable greater interoperability.\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "That is a good question that I don't know the answer to.  I suspect that you aren't alone in wanting a place where the community can discuss best practices, and at the moment this GitHub repo has the most highly-technical eyeballs on it.  I think something like a forum (e.g., Reddit) would be better for general discussions like this but I fear that something like `/r/Ethereum` would see all interesting discussion trolled by non-technical people or quickly buried.\r\n\r\nPerhaps that is why all of these best-practice EIPs are cropping, up... people are _looking_ for a place to talk about their ideas and don't have any other outlet that has the right subscriber base.  Anyone interested in starting up/moderating a community for this type of discussion (highly technical, best practices, shared standards, etc.)?",

    "body": "Just to clarify the OP (a year old) was aiming to have data dictionary which can be localized. Nothing to do with Identities, I think the title when changed (whilst good) might have been a cause for confusion.\r\n\r\nI see the point on \"you start\" and see if it catches on. But smart contracts are not easy to change, so if an initiative is started here, everyone can be aware of it and develop towards it. Also, all the tooling around can be built to support that in a \"generic\" way.\r\n\r\nRegarding moving technical discussions, proposals away from github, reddit, gitter, skype. I agree. Probably a single old style forum (well organized) could better for technical discussions. But that could be discussed in Reddit better.",
