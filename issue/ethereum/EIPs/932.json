  "body": "When sending a transaction, you should be able to include the expected hash of the transaction with the previous nonce. Doing so would prevent the transaction from being mined unless the transaction with the previous nonce and specified hash has already been included.\r\n\r\nThis adds security against replay attacks since a signed transaction with a specific nonce will only be valid if the previous transaction hash exists (I realize this protection is redundant given EIP155), and it also allows you to cancel a transaction and all the following transactions if the following transactions were sent with reference to their expected previous transaction hashes. \r\n\r\nFor example, I broadcast transactions A, B, C with nonces 0, 1, and 2 respectively using this feature. B references A and C references B. I decide I want to cancel transaction B and broadcast no-op transaction B' which has a much higher gas price and nonce 1. With this feature, A and B' are included, but C is thrown out because C referenced the transaction hash of B, which will never be included. Without this feature, C is not cancelled and can still be included.",
