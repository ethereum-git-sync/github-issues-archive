    "body": "I am weakly in favor of no. 1. I think that attaching a link to the (closed) GitHub issue is sufficient to continue the discussion. I propose that to avoid EIP editor work, it should be the responsibility of the EIP authors to migrate the links. However, I can see how this might be inconvenient, so if it could be determined that the inconvenience of migrating the discussion link is greater than the inconvenience/confusion caused by the presence of the issues,\r\n\r\nI am weakly in favor of no. 2, as the discussions-to links aren't even up to date. Most discussion-to links aren't marked as such (and #4431 is marked as discussions-to _despite_ the real discussions-to link being migrated to Ethereum magicians). However, I am weakly against the stale bot in general. I feel that every issue should be manually determined to be stale (and if the number of issues moves down to one page when no. 3 is implemented, this is very feasible).  \r\n\r\nI am strongly in favor of no. 3. Closing Final and Withdrawn EIPs is a no-brainer; they aren't going to be changed, so there's no discussion to be had. All discussion should be for a _new_ EIP that fixes/improves the older one. Stagnant EIPs should also be closed, as the links can always be re-opened if/when said EIP moves out of stagnant.",

Some discussions-to links have a lot of discussion, and just copy/pasting that into the body of a single message will make it much harder to read and link compared to current discussions.  The common case is that an issue receives a lot of discussion while it is actively being edited, but that eventually dies out.  I think if we simply close those issues (via (2) or (3)) the negative effects of this problem will go away and we won't have to do a bunch of work.",
