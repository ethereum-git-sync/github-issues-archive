  "body": "### Abstract\n\nThe goal is to support overflow detection in arithmetic functions. An overflow flag is introduced in the VM. This flag can only be set or unset by instructions and can only be read indirectly by programs.\n### Motivation\n\nOverflow detection can be accomplished by checking the inputs before the arithmetic instructions. This is what Solidity does currently (see this extensive thread: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/796). This proposal would make these checks cheaper.\n### Specification\n1. The overflow flag is unset at the beginning of execution.\n2. Every arithmetic instruction (`ADD`, `MUL`, `SUB`, `DIV`, `SDIV`, `MOD`, `SMOD`, `ADDMOD`, `MULMOD`, `EXP`, `SIGNEXTEND`) unsets the overflow flag at the start of execution.\n3. `DIV`, `SDIV` sets the overflow flag if the divisor is 0.\n4. `ADD`, `MUL`, `EXP` sets the overflow flag if the result was truncated to fit into 256 bits.\n5. `SUB` sets the overflow flag when the second argument exceeds the first.\n6. `SDIV` sets the overflow flag when `- 2**255` is divided by `-1` (highest bit set _div_ all bits set).\n7. `ADDMOD`,  `MULMOD` when the mod argument is `0`.\n8. `SIGNEXTEND` sets the overflow flag if the position parameter is `> 31`.\n9. A new instruction, `JUMPOF` (at 0x5c) is introduced. It takes one argument, the jump destination. If the overflow flag is set it will jump.\n\nTBD: define the overflow behaviour for the rest of the arithmetic instructions.\n\nAn alternative to `JUMPOF` could be introducing `PUSHOF` and using it with `JUMPI`. This could be useful if in the future more flags are introduced as they could be combined:\n\n```\nPUSHOF (overflow flag)\nPUSHSF (signed flag)\nAND\nJUMPI\n```\n",
