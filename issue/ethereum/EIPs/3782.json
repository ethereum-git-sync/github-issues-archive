  "body": "## Abstract\r\nThis standard introduces a smart contract interface that can represent a batch of non-fungible tokens of which the ordering information shall be retained and managed. Such information is particularly useful if `tokenId`s are encoded with the sets of `unicode`s for logographic characters and emojis. As a result, NFTs can be utilized as carriers of meanings.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nNon-fungible tokens are widely accepted as carriers of crypto-assets, hence in both [ERC721](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-721.md) and [ERC1155] https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1155.md), the ordering information of multiple NFTs is discarded. However, as proposed in [EIP-3754](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-3754.md), non-fungible tokens are thought of as basic units on a blockchain and can carry abstract meanings with unicoded `tokenId`s. Transferring\r\nsuch tokens is transmitting an ordered sequence of unicodes, thus effectively transmitting phrases or meanings on a blockchain.\r\n\r\nThis standard aims to combine the two and introduce the necessary functionalities for batch transfer and representation of logographic characters. As a result, a language system can be built on-chain for logograpic languages.\r\n\r\nFor non-logographic languages such as English, although the same standard can be applied, the marginal utility is minimal to be practically useful. However, for logographic languages, since a rich amount of meanings can be transmitted in just a few characters, this standard is therefore particularly valuable. Emojis are similar with logographs and can be included as well.\r\n\r\nA motivating example is instead of sending the two Chinese characters of the Great Wall `长城`, two NFTs with IDs `#38271` and `#22478` respectively can be transferred in a batch. The two IDs are corresponding to the decimal unicode of the two characters. The receiving end decodes the IDs and retrieves the original characters. A key point is the ordering information matters in this scenario since the tuples `(38271, 22478)` and `(22478, 38271)` can be decoded as `长城` and `城长`, respectively, and both are legitimate words in the Chinese language. This illustrates one key difference between this standard and ERC1155.\r\n\r\nIn-game characters, weapons, items can be represented by very few characters. Examples include `关羽` `(20851, 32701)` a famous fighter, `剑` `(21073)` a sword, `药水` `(33647, 27700)` a potion, and etc. On-chain gaming dapps can be largely enriched with elements by simply adopting this standard for players using logographic languages.\r\n\r\nBesides, in the eastern Asian culture, characters are sometimes considered or practically used as gifts in holidays such as Spring Feastival, and etc. The characters `恭喜发财` or `(24685, 21916, 21457, 36001)` can be literally sent as a gift to express the best wishes for financial prosperity. That said, logographs do possess the nature of an asset, which is well resembled by this standard.\r\n\r\nWhat is even more interesting is in that culture, people consider ancient teachings as treasures which are usually written in a concise way such that a handful of characters can unfold a rich amount of meanings. Modern people now get a reliable technical means to pass down their words, poems and proverbs to the future generations by sending tokens.\r\n\r\nOther practical and interesting applications include Chinese chess, wedding vows, family generation quotes and sayings, funeral commendation words, prayers, anecdotes and etc.\r\n",

    "body": "@abcoathup Hen Andrew, thanks for the question.\r\n\r\nERC1155 has `URI` and `ERC20` support which do not seem to fit in this scenario. To say it is for communication is really just for illustration purposes. Logographic characters are very similar to Lego parts and pieces, which can be collected, reused, reordered, reorganized and resent. A standard should be tailored for this type of tokens.\r\n\r\nRegarding gas fees, yes, it is ridiciously high on Ethereum, a possible solution is to build this on xDai, Polygon or even a dedicated sidechain.\r\n\r\nThe vision is for sure not for daily communication, nontheless, occasionally people do have the need of finding a more secure way, a more decentralized way, or a more censorship-resistent way of communicating. Besides, a logograph-based reward point system can also be built on top of this token system. This might be something unheard of in the English-speaking world, but we have been picturing this mentally for a while and there is a strong market need for this type of cross-business reward system. Imagine the points you earned on Amazon for buying books are logographs of books, which are then consumed for a discount in a book-themed park in Disneyland.",

At first glance it seems to me that there isn't a need to have an ERC specifically about tokenizing Unicode points, but the concept of a strictly ordered \"NFT of NFTs\" is very relevant. This might come from me misunderstanding the proposal, though. (This is pretty much an echo of @lightclient 's point immediately above.)\r\n\r\nCheers!",

Fortunately, those letters do not need to take additional storage on a blockchain at all. Currently, `tokenIds` are not utilized to carry meanings and unicodes can make use of this data field to represent logographical letters. \r\n\r\n> also, whats your idea to allow user to search for a specific character?\r\n\r\nEvents will be emitted if a batch of such tokens are being transferred. Searching can be easily done via the traditional database technologies.\r\n\r\nThis EIP is in the stage of collecting first round feedbacks. Suggestions and comments are more than welcome.\r\n",
