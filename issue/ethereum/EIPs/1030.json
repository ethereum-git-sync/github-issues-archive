  "body": "EIP: <To be assigned>\r\nEIP Title: Modify Contract Code at 0xfb4f9E002763b9D8A48EFcE8AB8A33e4d3bC9efC\r\nAuthor: Zheng Junyi\r\nType: Meta\r\nStatus: Draft\r\nCreated: 2018-04-24\r\n\r\n# Simple Summary\r\n\r\nAn old contract had 4 ETH locked up due to a bug in the code published on ethereum.org. The fund is provably mine, and completely unmoveable, and the bug renders an insignificant amount of Ether inaccessible.\r\n\r\n# Abstract\r\n\r\nAn early version of the contract at https://www.ethereum.org/crowdsale had a bug on line 35, where _balanceOf[msg.sender] = amount;_ which causes multiple contributions from the same address to be lost. I propose the addition of a function calling _selfdestruct_, changing the contract code at the address  0xfb4f9E002763b9D8A48EFcE8AB8A33e4d3bC9efC which it was deployed. This will allow the release of the funds to the beneficiary of the smart contract.\r\n\r\n# Motivation\r\n\r\nThis proposal is necessary because the Ethereum protocol does not allow the redeployment of contract code on a defined address, and there is no other simple way to enable the affected users and companies regaining access to their tokens and Ether. In opposite to previously discussed proposals, this will not change any EVM semantics and tries to achieve the goal of unfreezing the funds by a single state transition as specified in the next section.\r\n\r\nAlso, this was deployed 1 years and 3 months ago, so can be said to be an early participant in the exciting adventure that is Ethereum. With a coinvote of 48% in favor of EIP 999, I assume a sizeable minority of Ethereum ecosystem do not wish to punish a human error with irrevocable loss of funds. \r\n\r\nIn fact, just like EIP 999, this 4 ETH recovered will be used for pushing forward development in the space, via a donation to the Ethereum Foundation, which is also a registered non-profit, and likely cannot spend money on lambos.\r\n\r\nI've completely no idea how many people deployed the contract on main net like me, though I suppose a quick bytecode search might reveal it, but I'm really hoping it's not the absolute amount of ETH that matters, but the principle of recovery.\r\n\r\n# Specification\r\n\r\nThe code at the address will be replaced with one containing the following function\r\n\r\nfunction boom() { selfdestruct(beneficiary); }\r\n\r\n# Rationale\r\n\r\nThe approach involves minimal changes to the state, and does not break the existing EVM.\r\n\r\nThe total supply of Ether is neither changed nor does this proposal require the transfer of any tokens or assets including Ether. It is assumed that this change is aligned with the interests both of (A) me and (B) other people who actually deployed official test code on the mainnet. Lastly, the client-side implementation cost of this proposal is estimated to be low, involving a single change to the state. \r\n\r\nThe argument for Ethereum Recovery Proposals is really an argument for property rights.  In this case, property rights are in conflict with immutability. - @MicahZoltu\r\n\r\nBlockchain history is immutable, blockchain state is not. It's an important distinction. - @fredhrson\r\n\r\n# Backwards compatibility\r\n\r\nThis proposal introduces backwards incompatibilities in the state of the contract at 0xfb4f9E002763b9D8A48EFcE8AB8A33e4d3bC9efC. The Ethereum protocol does not allow the redeployment of code to the same address. To implement this on the Ethereum blockchain, it is recommended to add the necessary state transition in a future hard-fork at a well-defined block number, e.g., CNSTNTNPL_FORK_BLKNUM for the Constantinople milestone which is supposed to be the next scheduled hard-fork on the Ethereum road-map.\r\n\r\n# Implementation\r\n\r\nA sample implementation will be developed if the proposal goes through.\r\n",

    "body": "@zjunyi The ERP process isn't finalized, it is just a draft, but I believe it is good advice and a good process to follow none the less, and the most likely process by which you'll get this pushed through.\r\n\r\nAn issue _is_ the correct place if you want to start with discussion, so far you are following the recommended path quite well.  Kudos for you for doing your homework.  :D\r\n\r\nThe ERP process would make it so changes like this are incredibly low-cost for client dev teams, because they will (assuming they engineer for the ERP process) have a generalized mechanism for dealing with this class of problems.  Personally, I think that the ERP process provides a high enough barrier to entry that people will self-select out when the reward (amount being recovered) is too low.  Basically, the amount of work the author has to put in is _way_ higher than the amount of work client developers have to put in for each recovery, and that is how we draw the line, by letting users decide whether it is worth it to them or not.\r\n\r\nIf 4 ETH is worth it for you to go through all of the trouble of properly defining an ERP (including the required scripts, arguments, proofs, etc.) then somewhere below 4ETH is where we would draw the line.  Client developers would only need to verify your scripts/proofs (which should be easy for them if your ERP is of sufficient quality) and then include the state transition you supply in JSON format in the next hard fork.",

    "body": "As I have been arguing elsewhere (so sorry if you have seen this one before), the only governance process that I think really matters/is effective is one of forking.  Building a forking governance layer on top of a forking governance layer feels redundant.  I would be pretty strongly against a democratic governance layer built on top of the current forking governance layer because ultimately, the only way users have to opt-out of a democratic system is to fork, so we are right back where we started with people forking Ethereum.\r\n\r\nI'm far less scared of a fork than I think a lot of people are.  I think forking should be easy and should happen fairly regularly.  It is unlikely that, as the userbase of Ethereum grows, everyone will continue to agree on everything and so if forks aren't happening that to me signals that forking is too hard.  Bitcoin has seen a number of forks lately, and I think this is healthy.  While I still think Bitcoin has a ton of problems shared across all of the forks, I don't think its forking is the problem.",
