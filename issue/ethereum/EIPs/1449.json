Some highly capitalized tokens have following API:\r\n\r\nSome methods have no `returns(bool)`:\r\n```\r\nfunction transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public;\r\nfunction approve(address _to, uint256 _value) public;\r\nfunction transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public;\r\n```\r\nSome methods have `returns(bytes32)` instead of `returns(string)`:\r\n```\r\nfunction name() public returns(bytes32);\r\nfunction symbol() public returns(bytes32);\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Proposed Solution\r\n\r\nUse assebly to perform call and manually handle `returndatasize`: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1344",
