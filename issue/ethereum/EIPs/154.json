  "body": "A version identifier or EVM identifier should be added to the code of each contract to facilitate virtual machine upgrades and allow different virtual machines.\n\nWith upcoming breaking changes to the functionality of the EVM, it makes sense to add a field that represents the version or type of EVM that should run the given code. This would allow to introduce breaking feature changes without harming older contracts (breaking security changes like #150 would of course also affect older contracts). This is especially useful if we want to change the EVM due to performance reasons and could allow changing the gas costs of individual opcodes (because they can be implemented faster in that particular EVM) and even introducing whole new features of the EVM (like ewasm).\n\nAny time code is loaded and run (i.e. at a call, create or beginning of a transaction), the EVM version number is extracted from the code or that account and the relevant VM is started. If the EVM is not know, this results in an OOG exception.\n\nDrawbacks of this proposal are that we have to support older versions of the EVM, although this is a choice that is made during a hard fork: We can chose to drop older versions and handle that in the same way as it was done previously: Either compile old code to new code or just force the new rules on the old system.\n\nImplementation details:\n\nIf the code starts with `0xef`, the byte (ewasm uses four bytes) that follows this is the version number, both are ignored when executing the code. If it does not start with `0xef`, use the homestead VM, which is version number 0.\n",

    "body": "Is their already a decission if this is or some similar approach will be included and if so when?\r\nI'm asking because for a project of mine I need to write a contract code verifier that in the code specified to `CREATE` loads code with `EXTCODECOPY` and analyses it to ensure it does not include opcodes like for example `SSTORE` and if they do it aborts. If know a future hardfork includes a new opcode say `SSTOREBYTES` my verifier will not recognize it as store related opcode and approves the code, which would compromise not only all new contracts after the hardfork, which the verifier approved, but in my case it would compromise all the contracts that the verifier approved in the past.",
