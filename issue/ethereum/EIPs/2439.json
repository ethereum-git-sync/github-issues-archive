    "body": "Heya! Sorry for the delay... There was some discussion (I think on Twitter), about using reverse dot notation for vendor keys.\r\n\r\nI think the ones already suggested should remain (e.g. vnd.twitter), but going forward any service may use their domain name as their key, without any need to update this EIP. For some examples:\r\n\r\n- `com.gitlab.user`\r\n- `com.gitlab.project`\r\n- `com.peepeth.profile`\r\n- `io.keybase.user`\r\n- `com.reddit.profile`\r\n\r\nOf course, each service can decide how they want their hierarchal namespace broken up. Perhaps keybase simply wants `io.keybase`. But this allows each service to add additional categories.\r\n\r\nAlso, a service can use any fully-qualified name they own. So, peepeth may decide to use `eth.peepeth` (if they own it? I'm not actually sure) for example.\r\n\r\nWhat do people think? I will take a look and merge the above suggestions that don't conflict with this one next week and depending on what the discussions lead to, include the rest too.",

    "body": "Sorry to jump into the conversation so late. I think TextResolver is very interesting for many use cases where I am involved.\r\n\r\nHave you considered using for the names of standard keys the vocabulary of [Schema.org](https://schema.org/)? It is used heavily in other environments and it defines not only the names of many attributes for many entities, but also in many instances the semantics involved and the specific format for the values.\r\n\r\nFor example, here you have the attributes for **Person** (https://schema.org/Person), including of course name, address, birthDate, etc.\r\n\r\nAnother example is **GeoCoordinates** (https://schema.org/GeoCoordinates), where if you use **latitude** and **longitude**, the spec requires to use [WGS 84](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System) for their values.\r\n\r\nThis may reduce creeping of vendor keys for many use cases where they want essentially the same entity. Even in the cases where the entity is not in Schema.org, there is a defined process to extend the vocabulary, either to the base vocabulary or creating and industry-specific extension. For example, see here for the Automotive extension: https://schema.org/docs/automotive.html and here for Banks and Financial Institutions: https://schema.org/docs/financial.html.",

    "body": "> Shouldn't avatar be a contenthash (EIP-1577) rather than a URL?\r\n\r\nThis was never answered, and now that I'm actually using ENS a bit more I do feel pretty strongly that this should be the case.  I believe we should really be building things to be censorship resistant by default, and part of that means making choices that make censorship resistance the easiest path for integrators to take.\r\n\r\nBy having avatar be a URL, you can use `ipfs://...` but almost everyone who adds support for displaying an Avatar will add support for `http://...` and call it a day.  By using content hash instead, all of those apps will instead take the easy path of fetching from IPFS and/or a gateway, which allows users who desire censorship resistance of their ENS content to actually work properly.\r\n\r\nAs a prime example, the ENS manager app itself doesn't support `ipfs://...` because the easy solution was to just do `<img src=...>`.  If this was a content hash, that app would have instead done something like `https://ipfs.io/ipfs/<contenthash>`.  As is, someone who puts a censorship resistant URL in won't work even in the ENS app itself, while someone who puts in a censorable avatar URL will work great.",

    "body": "This is another reason I need to update it to allow dotted notation. There is often nested data you want to include, and you could imagine a solution similar to how namecoin's website did it back in the day, which is to allow a \"proof\" field.\r\n\r\nSo, for example, I want a `com.twitter.profile` of `\"ricmoo\"` and a `com.twitter.profile.proof` to be a url (on my twitter) to a tweet that verifies the two-way peg. So, you could imagine a `avatar.hash` which maps to the hash of the content. I'm still not sold on this idea though. I think we need something similar to `text` / `setText` for `bytes` / `getBytes`. A lot of data makes more sense as raw data, and let the key be in charge of specifying how the dat should be interpreted. In that same guise, the things currently handled by `text` could just be in `bytes`, and the keys are known the data should be used as utf-8 data for things like `com.twitter` and `website`.\r\n\r\nI have earmarked some time this week to catch up on this EIP and a bunch of other things I've been putting of way too long. Would love to get some active discussions this week.",

Essentially every application of said notation uses `com.website.handle.*` format.
