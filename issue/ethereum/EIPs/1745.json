  "body": "Given that blind auctions seem to have been chosen as the distribution method for several projects, such as:\r\n- [Ethereum Name Service](https://ens.domains/)\r\n- [TrigID](https://trigid.org/)\r\n- [Waifuchain](https://waifuchain.moe) (The project I'm currently working on)    \r\n\r\nand there's even an academic paper about them ([Verifiable Sealed-Bid Auction on the Ethereum\r\nBlockchain](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/704.pdf)), I think that it's clear that the community is quite interested in them and they are common in the ecosystem. Furthermore, given that most implementations of blind auctions are conceptually similar (process is usually split in three phases: bidding, revealing the hidden bids and picking the winner) I propose to standardise a contract interface for blind auctions. This would allow systems to operate with any blind auction contract, avoiding the problem of having to implement custom logic for each contract.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know your opinions/thoughts on the matter.\r\nThis issue will be the main discussion forum for the EIP draft to come.",
