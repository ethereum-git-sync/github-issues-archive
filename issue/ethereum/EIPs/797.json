Some of these include: ABI specification, NatSpec, secure private key storage in clients, RPC methods, etc.\r\n\r\nSince these have been specification efforts by many parties, it may look weird if someone creates an EIP with a single author and collecting all the authors may seem impractical. \r\n\r\nI propose to introduce an option that instead of a list of authors the EIP/ERC to contain only an `Editor` field listing the person(s) who created the EIP based on an original reference, which should be stated in the `References` section.\r\n\r\nI hope this would encourage people in the space, who might have not thought about this option given the issue with claiming authorship.",

    "body": "> Is it asking too much to remove the CC0 notice and allow the author to retain their copyright?\r\n\r\nShort answer is yes.  😄 This has been *heavily* debated in the past and there are some people who are staunchly against removing the CC0 requirement.  We could certainly discuss it again, though I suspect most of the people are kind of tired of debating it at this point.\r\n\r\n@axic Why not just rename the `Author` field to `Editor` or `Maintainer`?  Since EIPs are all CC0, the \"author\" really doesn't matter (since CC0 doesn't require attribution), and I feel like editor or maintainer would more correctly capture the role the person is playing in the EIP process.",
