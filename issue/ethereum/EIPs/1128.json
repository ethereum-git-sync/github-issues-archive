Pull request #1100 addresses that issue.</strike>\r\n\r\nHowever, one of the EIP editors (the people with commit access here) mentioned that #1100 is not urgent. There are no remaining complaints on #1100, it has EIP editor endorsements, but it is not merged.\r\n\r\nI reviewed the project README.md and was hoping to find something like \"our goal is to discuss and pass high-quality standards reflecting established best practices in the community.\" So I could tell this person that #1100 is urgent (because presently, standards are prevented from passing). Alas no such line exists, in fact, there is nothing in the README.md that explains why we are contributing here.\r\n\r\n**It is much easier to set expectations for each other in this project if we have a clearly defined goal. And we should state that goal in the README.md.**",
