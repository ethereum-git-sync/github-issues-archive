  "body": "Mainnet was forked into Matic, Fuse, Celo, Pepo, and probably more.\r\n\r\nIt would be good in the future to join back all these chains into single ETH2 chain. It seems impossible to do this with existing forks, but I think we could do something with possible future forks.\r\n\r\nI propose to investigate the following:\r\n\r\n1. Create a standard like `address flexible` in Solidity for addresses that would be moved across chains possibly changing one address into another address simultaneously in all variables of the entire chain (we may need to change them, because there are often different balances on _the same_ address in two different chains; can we work around of this in another way?)\r\n\r\n2. Think what to do for example if a new address is created out of two addresses with their joining and KECCAK.\r\n\r\nAnother possibility is to add extra bytes to address variables to identify the chain from which it was taken. This is however incompatible with existing byte layout (but Solidity syntax does not need to be changed).",
