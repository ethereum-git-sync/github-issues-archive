  "body": "Today, most web3-compatible browsers have a notion of watching tokens, usually to help a user watch their current balances of tokens.\r\n\r\nWhile it is possible to derive an account's token balances by walking the full history of the blockchain, this is especially impractical in the context of light clients, and so users are frequently instructed to \"add this token to your wallet\", to help their wallet identify tokens they care about.\r\n\r\nTo help ease this experience, I'd like to propose a new optional method to be exposed in web3-compatible browsers, `eth_watchToken`.\r\n\r\nThis method would take a single parameter, a JavaScript object with the following keys:\r\n\r\n- address (required): The address of the token to watch, as a hex-prefixed string.\r\n- symbol: A string representing the ticker symbol. Should be three characters. (Required if the token at the given address does not implement a public `symbol() returns string` method.\r\n- decimals: number, representing the number of digits to treat as decimals. (Required if the token at the given address does not implement a public `decimals() returns uint8` method.\r\n- name: string, representing the token's name. Optional.\r\n\r\nWeb3 browsers should then show some confirmation to the user, requesting their permission to track the given token.\r\n\r\nIf one of the options (symbol, decimals, name) differs from the result of the token's own public method, I'm not sure what's best, probably default to the page? Open to opinions here, for now this is undefined behavior for the proposed spec.\r\n\r\n### Valid error messages:\r\n\r\nValid errors I'd like to propose, for the sake of cross-client consistency, are:\r\n\r\n- `Problem prompting the user.`\r\n- `Problem tracking the token.`\r\n- `User rejected request.`",

    "body": "@Arachnid asked:\r\n\r\n> @kumavis why would the dapp need an rpc to communicate with the browser? It can do that directly via js.\r\n\r\nSorry for replying slow, this isn't a very urgent proposal.\r\n\r\nI'm not actually proposing a new RPC method, never once said \"RPC\" in the original post. Currently, the JS interface actually uses an API (the Ethereum Provider API, poorly documented) that passes very RPC-looking strings to their data provider (wallet). Something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nweb3.currentProvider.sendAsync({\r\n  method: 'eth_sendRawTransaction',\r\n  data: '0x012341343451341abcdef',\r\n}, callback)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this context, I am not suggesting RPC providers implement `eth_watchToken`. I'm suggesting *wallet providers do*. This would mean this method should not be available on RPCs (the same way I don't think `eth_sign` or `eth_sendTransaction` should be on the RPC, separation of signer from data provider), but these methods *should* be available on the `EthereumProvider` API.\r\n\r\nBy being on the `EthereumProvider`, JS abstractions like Web3, EthJS, or Parity.js would all be able to expose these methods in the ways they most desire.\r\n\r\nIt's unfortunate that we basically have to have this conversation whenever trying to iterate on the JS API, I'll try to write a general distinction post at some point and start linking to it when proposing provider (not RPC) changes.",
