  "body": "EIP-1155 chooses the arbitrary decision to use address 0x0 when burning/destroying tokens as well as when minting new ones.\r\n\r\n**0x0 is a very risky address** since external clients can in different (and buggy) scenarios send a false 0x0 when a variable has not been properly initialized, an error or exception not managed properly, a parse fail, ...\r\n\r\nAn alternative address like: `address( uint160( uint256( sha256(\"burn_address\") )))  ` will avoid this security risk as well as provide for cleaner and easier to read code.\r\n\r\nUsing an address (or set of addresses) based on a (set of) well-defined string/s can also allow for future enhancements of the API by adding new addresses with semantic meaning without breaking the interface.\r\n",
