DApps today are built primarily on the web because of the access to Web3 injections, but the user experience is lacking. Native apps provide a much richer experience. A MetaMask equivalent for native apps will help the developer community a long way.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nApp developers today need to maintain the private keys and keep pace with the changes happening on the Web3 libraries. A large majority of people have some ethereum Wallet installed on their phone which already maintains their keys and accounts. Why should every app developer have to re-invent the wheel by building the entire wallet stack into their app? By having a standardised AppLink app developers can leverage the existance of other ethereum wallets on the user's phone to sign and send transactions.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\nThe AppLink will be an URI of scheme `ethpay://`\r\n\r\n### Possible actions\r\n- `sign` : The wallet signs the data sent to it and redirects to a URI also specified in the request with the signature as a query parameter\r\n- `sendSignedTransaction` : The wallet signs a transaction and sends it to an Ethereum Node\r\n\r\n### Allowed parameters\r\n- `action` : may be one of `sign` or `sendSignedTransaction`\r\n- `to` : An Ethereum Address to which the transaction is to be sent. Required if action is `sendSignedTransaction`\r\n- `value` : Integral value of number of Wei to include in the transaction. Optional.\r\n- `data` : Data that needs to be signed. If action is `sendSignedTransaction` this should be hex encoded. Required if type is `sign`\r\n- `gas` : Amount of gas to be used in the transaction. Required if action is `sendSignedTransaction`\r\n- `gasPrice` : Gas price for the transaction. Optional. If not provided for action `sendSignedTransaction`, current gas price will be used.\r\n- `redirectUri` : The URI to which the wallet should redirect with signature after signing. Used only for action `sign`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\nThe URI based AppLinks will allow app developers to request signing of transactions without needing to use any external library.\r\nThe users will not have to trust the app developer with their private keys, since it is maintained by a separate wallet app they already use.\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\nA rough implementation of this protocol has been done using [Web3 1.0.0-beta](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js) on a [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) app. It uses [Infura](https://infura.io) as an Ethereum node.\r\n\r\nThe implementation handles App Links and a basic implementation of an ETH wallet.\r\n\r\nYou can find the [app's implementation here](https://github.com/madhavanmalolan/ethpay)\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\r\n",
