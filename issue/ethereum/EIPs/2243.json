  "body": "---\r\neip: 2243\r\ntitle: Stateless upgradable smart contracts for account addresses\r\nauthor: Anton Bukov <k06aaa@gmail.com>\r\nstatus: Draft\r\ntype: Standards Track\r\ncategory: Core\r\ncreated: 2019-08-17\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Simple Summary\r\n\r\nTransaction aggreagation is hard, one of the cases is #20 `approve` + `transferFrom` model, there were multiple tries including: #677, #827, #1003. They all fail because of complexity and requirement of checks on receivers side which can be forgotten. Many Dapps asks user to establish almost infinite `approve` once to interact with single transaction later, this opens dangerous flaws, recent example: https://blog.0xproject.com/post-mortem-0x-v2-0-exchange-vulnerability-763015399578\r\n\r\nI propose to allow users to upload *Stateless force-upgradable smart contracts* to account addresses. Since it will be stateless there is no problems with upgrades and migrations. Simple contract could be used for start:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncontract MyWallet {\r\n    modifier onlySelf {\r\n        require(msg.sender == address(this));\r\n        _;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function() public payable {\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function performCalls(\r\n        address[] memory targets,\r\n        uint256[] memory values,\r\n        bytes[] memory calldataArray,\r\n    )\r\n        public\r\n        onlySelf\r\n        payable\r\n    {\r\n        for (uint i = 0; i < targets.length; i++) {\r\n            (bool success,) = target.call.value(values[i])(calldataArray[i]);\r\n            require(success);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnyone will be able to group multiple transactions easily. No more infinite approves!\r\n\r\n## Abstract\r\n\r\nAllow accounts to deploy smart contracts to its own addresses. This smart contrcats should not do SSTORE, else it should revert.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nWe need a reliable way to group any transaction, even ERC20 `approve` + `transferFrom`.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nComing soon!\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\n\r\nComing soon!\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nShould not be a problem, let's discuss.",
