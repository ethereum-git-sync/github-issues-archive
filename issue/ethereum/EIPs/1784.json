  "body": "We are ready to develop blind auction projects based on blockchain. Blind auction means that the price of the user is hidden, and no one can be seen. Only after the end of the auction time, everyone can know their bid.\r\n\r\nTheoretical implementation scheme:\r\n\r\n1. Let smart contracts act as auction houses. When the smart contract is created, the public key and the private key are automatically generated. The public key is open to the public. The private key is stored in the contract, and the user is not visible.\r\n2. When the user makes an offer, obtain the public key in the smart contract for encryption, and chain the encrypted bid.\r\n3. After the auction time, the participants' bids will be published in the smart contract, and the highest bidder will get the auction goods.\r\n\r\nBut now there are some problems:\r\n\r\n1. Asymmetric encryption and decryption are not supported in the smart contract.\r\n2. All data stored in the smart contract is publicly available, including the private key stored in the smart contract.\r\n\r\nThe solution we hope:\r\nWe want to have a sandbox running in the TEE environment, which will generate a public-private key pair, and then our business program will obtain the public key and use this public key to encrypt the data on the chain, while the private key can only be accessed in the TEE environment. When decrypting, the data will be passed into the sandbox and automatically decrypted and returned to our business program.\r\n\r\nWe feel that this model of using smart contracts as middlemen can be used in many business scenarios and hope that ethereum will support this type of functionality.",
