    "body": "Actually, there is a legal equivalent to having multiple specification and that is the [condominum](https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20220706-europes-island-that-swaps-nationalities) where 2 powers can exercise dominion over the same physical space. The most classic is the Antartica Treaty where all signatories agree to suspend their claims (still pending). However, reading the actual EIP it seems that the 2nd label Specification seems to be misedit, what we in legal circles would consider a scrivener error or corruption between intent of parties and written down contract/smart contract.\r\n\r\nSo an **alternative to roll-back** when it is not debated and would be a unilateral action, is to define an extension of EIP-1 that when a supermajority vote consensus is a scrivener error, the final EIP-number becomes EIP-number minus (a version number according to the RFC standard, eg negative 0.1 for transcription errors, negative -1 for when the meaning changes. \r\n\r\n@drllau ...

    "body": "I haven't time to study this particular case right now but in general ...\r\n\r\nOur intent way back when, with  @Souptacular and @Arachnid, was that yes, Final is Final.  Why?  Because the Editors didn't change the status to Final until _after_ the EIP was on the mainnet, at which point it was too late to change the reality.In the case where the EIP failed to desc  ribe the behavior of the mainnet we allowed for Errata, but we failed to define an EIP section for those.  This might be the first time it has become an issue.\r\n\r\nWe now go to Final before we put code on the mainnet, but I don't think that changes much -- Final EIPs need to describe what is on the mainnet.  And we can \"deprecate\" an EIP, but that would only apply to future versions of the mainnet.\r\n\r\nSo I would say that if 712 is not yet on the mainnet it can be changed to reflect what we intend to go on the  mainnet.  If 712 is already on the mainnet, but the two do not correspond, then we need an Errata section to fix that.\r\n\r\n",

So we have that kind of consensus, and the right thing to do is fix this as an errata.\r\n\r\nYes, @gcolvin , it came to our consensus that at the current snapshot of 712 it's incorrect and unimplementable. It needs some form of fixing. Recognizing the unimplementability, three options I personally put on the table: \r\n- Option (1) Fix the EIP in the number of 712, *but* change status from FINAL to something else. \r\n- Option (2) Fix fix EIP, but give it a different EIP-number, e.g. EIP-5712 updates(supersedes) EIP-712. \n- Option (3) Fix EIP in the number of 712, but during the fixing time, keep status as FINAL\n\nI have no concern for option 1 or 2, but i held pretty strong objection against option 3, reason being it undermines our credibility of \"FINAL\". Reader shall not read and attempt to implement a \"FINAL\"-marked EIP only to realize it is undergone normative change - assuming the fixing will take weeks to finalize and verified. I hope I make my rationale and thinking process clear. We look forward to your guidance our OG @gcolvin ",
