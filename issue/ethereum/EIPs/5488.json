Whenever there are different views and conflicting proposals, the process of generating the outcome is the governance, it could be autocratic, democratic, dictatorship, other types or combination of types. One can only avoid governance in a place where there is no diverse views and highly homogeneous, or when no decisions needs to be made \"together\". In the Ethereum EIP and many open contributor communities, the key characteristic, both good and evil, is that contributors often hold different views, and hence governance can't be avoided unfortunately.\r\n\r\nIf you see that quit editorship didn't solve your problem, consider re-take your editorship? 👍 \r\n\r\n> \r\n> > IMO finalized is a trailing indicator of something else that is much more useful: what hard fork the EIP was included in.

ETC used to use the EIP process (not sure if they do anymore).  Generally speaking, if one believes that fork based governance is a good idea, we want as few systems to be \"fork specific\" as possible to encourage healthy community splits.  If one community gets to keep all of the associated development processes that has a very significant impact on the perceived legitimacy of the other fork.  Essentially, it creates an avenue for governance capture by allowing one more thing to be involved in the decision making process of which branch of a fork is legitimate.\r\n\r\nIn a perfect world, all processes would be generalized such that in a community split there are no assets/processes/resources to fight over as it is all generic.",
