Before we consider outputting actual SHA-3 hashes, we need to start making the current naming more accurate, especially in the most visible code such as Solidity's `sha3` function.\n\nFor Solidity, a new opcode isn't even needed: alias a new Solidity function to existing opcode, encourage use of new name by providing warnings in Solidity when `sha3` is used, then possibly eventually compiler errors when `sha3` is used in new Solidity code.  Below the surface, the same existing opcode is used by Solidity.\n",

The longer we wait the more code, libraries, and implementations will have to be updated because they have continued to re-use the same naming.  Let's create aliasing options to Keccak256 as soon soon as possible so that at least those cognisant of the issue can start tackling the issue in our own code and stop furthering the problem.  And to be honest, if there's anyone using these functions who _doesn't_ know on sight what Keccak256 is doing here when they see it, they need to learn that ASAP **anyways**, before they make a critical mistake because of it.\n",
