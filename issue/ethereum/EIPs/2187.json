Functionality for Tables\r\n  * Data-Import (e.g. automated population of tables based from different sources like db, other documents)\r\n  * nice: diagramming \r\n\r\n### Comments/Edits\r\n\r\nComments/Edits/Discussions\r\n\r\n  * should point to the origin in the document (e.g. from a sidebar)\r\n  * Discussions should be threaded\r\n  * Discussions/Comments/Edits should be solvable (disappear e.g. to archive, once solved)\r\n\r\n### Work-Flow\r\n\r\n* Ideally: contains a simple work-flow-engine\r\n* Allows for roles and permissions (Owner, Editor, Commenters, ...)\r\n\r\n### License / Costs\r\n\r\n* Should have 0 costs for any contributor\r\n\r\n\r\n## Candidates\r\n\r\n### Github (current medium)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n\r\n* PR work-flow not adequate for non-techs\r\n* PR work-flow can be annoying on documents (even for devs)\r\n* Discussion has no threading, sub-threads, sub-issues\r\n* Professional-Grade Documents not possible\r\n* Tables and other complex information difficult (within markdown)\r\n* ???\r\n\r\n### Google Docs (free)\r\n\r\n* To avoid to much theoretical talk: this can be actually be tried for a few EIPs, just to see how it works in practice. If it's bad -> move back.\r\n\r\n### Other Free Tools\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n### Commercial Tools\r\n\r\n* Professional-Grade Documents, build with Professional-Grade Processes\r\n  * can have cost for the Ethereum Foundation\r\n  * no cost for viewers / contributors",
