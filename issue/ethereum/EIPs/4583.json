Currently a beginners mistake thinking the button would detail the instructions or rules. Can the contract be upgraded, extended, or made not to expire?\r\nI reached out after following the contract logs from Etherscan. Any help would be greatly appreciated as I've been in search after seeing the pause to my account.\r\n![erc20](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96281913/146504888-8d3e9dae-4d64-47fe-9f2f-9ac07d8f576c.PNG)\r\n\r\n![contract](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96281913/146504585-d49ab473-2953-4a52-b993-5413ed759382.PNG)\r\n\r\n",
