  "body": "(Raised and discussed briefly in https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/5)\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nThe `eth_compile*` RPC calls are beyond the responsibilities of the `eth` API, which can be considered to encompass the core functionality of an Ethereum node. As Ethereum deals in low-level EVM bytecode, the API surface should also not expose anything relating to higher-level programming languages. Managing, maintaining, and updating compiler versions, flags, and produced ABIs adds additional complexity to implementation.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, having only calls for Solidity, Serpent, and LLL serves to unnaturally limit the usage of other EVM-based languages by giving those 3 an elevated status, potentially stifling development and adoption of new solutions.\r\n\r\nLastly, the `eth_compile*` family of methods is _not sufficient_ for certain use-cases in DApp development, as they don't allow pinning to specific compiler versions .\r\n \r\n## Action\r\n\r\nMark `eth_compileSolidity`, `eth_compileSerpent`, and `eth_compileLLL` methods as deprecated in the docs, and suggest usage of proper development tools instead.\r\n\r\nCompiler functionality may still be provided, but within node-specific RPC namespaces.",

    "body": "So, I'm just seeing this, and it looks like I'm way out of consensus, but count me as an objector.\r\n\r\nI've written a development and interaction tool (a plugin to `sbt`, the main Scala build tool) that currently relies upon JSON-RPC-based solidity compilation. ( It's https://github.com/swaldman/sbt-ethereum ) Obviously I'm grumpy that this will force some hassle and reorganization to use a local `solc` instead.\r\n\r\nBut, beyond that, I think this is a mistake, an unfortunate choice. Here's why.\r\n\r\nCurrently, most Ethereum development is focused on big dApps fronted by slick websites or mobile apps, funded by token sales, VCs etc.\r\n\r\nI kind of think that's surprising, and perhaps even unfortunate. After the DAO hack, Nick Szabo pointed out that maybe inherently experimental DAOs should start not as multimillionaire virtual VCs, but as local clubs between friends that might manage 10s or 100s of dollars in value.\r\n\r\nOne way to do that is to hire 3 smart contract developers, a mobile app developer, and 4 javascript developers to create DAOs-R-Us, Inc, and build a website that lets a group of friends define and customize a DAO via a pretty GUI and then interact with it by mobile app. But then the DAO experiments won't go beyond whatever DAOs-R-Us decides to offer.\r\n\r\nFor truly small, local experiments, there has to be a low-rent path to experimentation, deployment, and interaction with smart contracts that don't require such a huge range of skillsets.\r\n\r\nI'm really excited about the possibility of a culture of extremely simple, easy-to-tinker-with, command-line-interacted smart contracts, to be played with at (hopefully) low stakes. My hope was to encourage very small, simple smart-contract applications in the form of self-contained, transportable builds. My toolchain relies on JSON-RPC `solc` not because it's hard to wrap a local compiler, but because that way, a user can clone (or even download a zip of) a repository, run a script, and immediately compile and deploy smart contracts from the command line. I host a `json-rpc` node, so users will be able to compile and deploy with no almost ceremony at all. The only external dependency is a JVM (which Oracle makes easy for very modestly technical users to install without frustration), the rest of the environment downloads itself upon first execution of a wrapper script. Forcing users to get a local `solc` running and into ones path is a significant added barrier.\r\n\r\nObviously, if it's just me, who gives a f%$k. I can wrap `solc` myself in a network service and host that too. But \"suggest[ing] usage of proper development tools\" is a tacit way of saying that we as a community think that smart-contract development should be for professionals, not so much a thing for amateurs to tinker with. Maybe that's the proper lesson to learn from the DAO hack and other subtle, costly smart-contract mishaps. But I'd take an opposite view, that part of why we've seen such problems is that we've started by pretending there are professionals capable of building applications with large, complicated state spaces in a domain whose quirks we are all still discovering. I think we'd be better off starting with simple bespoke small-scale apps deployed by end-users.\r\n\r\nCompilation-as-a-service facilitates that. I thought it fortunate and foresighted that the JSON-RPC API included it, and am very disappointed it seems likely to be removed.\r\n\r\nMy alternative suggestion would be to modify the API so that one can query a JSON-RPC node for the languages it supports, and the supply the language name as an argument to a generic compile call. I agree that there is no reason to privilege the three earliest EVM languages, and it'd be ugly to have 20 `eth_compile_XXX` calls as people experiment and invent new ones.\r\n\r\nThanks all of you for the work you do making Ethereum the most interesting ecosystem on the planet.

    "body": "@swaldman As far as I understood the core issue here is that it's difficult for average user to have `solc` on their local computer for `SBT-Ethereum` to use and you want to provide easy out-of-the-box exprience for developing smart contracts. I agree this is exactly what the community needs.\r\n\r\nInstead of mitigating the `solc` installation woes with a remote compile, I'd suggest taking a different approach; As Scala needs to have a JVM and library dependencies in any case, just add a dependency to a JavaScript interpreter ([possible?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36764639/how-to-run-javascript-code-from-within-scala-jvm)) Then you can embed Emscripted JavaScript based `solc` in your local installation and call it directly from Scala.\r\n\r\nAs even [browser-solidity web](https://ethereum.github.io/browser-solidity/) browser HTML page can run it `solc` locally we should embrace integrating it natively to other programming languages too. No need to wrap `solc` as a remote service. \r\n\r\nsolc-js (also see solc-bin) https://github.com/ethereum/solc-js\r\n",

The fact is that an ethereum node operates at the level of EVM bytecode, and not at the level of smart contract languages and ABIs. It is unwieldy to impose a requirement to integrate EVM languages into the nodes themselves precisely for this reason. Whether or not we change the API to use a generic \"compile\" call, we'd still have to force the node to deal changing compiler versions with differing or updated ABI formats between languages -- such that outputs of `eth_compile('solidity', CODE)` would vary wildly from node to node. In my opinion, this is the complete opposite of a stable API.\r\n\r\nThe reason for suggesting proper development tools is that these will vary wildly from language to language and there's no sense trying to squeeze all of that into an RPC layer largely meant to interact with raw blockchain data itself. Using correct developer tools is something we want to teach amateurs to do as well: it's not as though students in their first Java class are told to invoke `javac` directly. Instead, we give them an IDE like Eclipse, NetBeans, or IntelliJ. Projects like Embark or Truffle make testing and deployment in the Ethereum world much more simple, and compilers which can be cross-compiled to JS or WASM are just as flexible if not more so than an RPC endpoint.

    "body": "@rphmeier So, I don't want to push this too hard. I think I'm a minority of one in a battle already lost. I appreciate your work.\r\n\r\nBut... it is possible to specify things, and ask implementations to live up to the specification. That outputs have been underspecified and there have been inconsistencies between nodes that have had to be resolved is a general issue with any evolving spec. The answer to that problem is to agree on a protocol for each language, and adhere to the protocol. I understand that from a node implementers' perspective, the whole process is an added annoyance. But, from at least some users' perspective (at least one this user, and the hypothetical people he hopes to interest), the functionality is useful. The annoyance is not for naught.\r\n\r\nI agree about improving toolchain. That's my project very precisely. The issue here is about providing the capabilities necessary to support a rich, performant toolchain with extremely low barriers to entry. Both truffle and embark are `node.js` projects that can make use of JavaScript `solc` natively. Since building and deploying binaries is often a platform-dependent hassle with dependency annoyances, without network compilation, we may be restricting the easy-ish-to-use toolchain to `node.js`. Maybe that's okay, but obviously as the writer of Scala-based tools, I object.\r\n\r\nRegarding @Smithgift's comment and light clients, if we were to adopt an API that could use the existing `eth_getCompilers` call to test the node's available compilers, that could return an empty sequence for very lightweight clients. Indeed, node implementers could opt out of dealing with compilation just by returning an empty sequence from that function, and sending back a \"language not supported\" error for any call to language-independent `eth_compile` function. So there need be almost no extra overhead at all. But nodes that wanted to provide the functionality could do so, in a standard way, and if there are more people like me out there (or people who like the tools we would build), non-support of popular languages might be a competitive disadvantage. Since this is an open-source world, probably the right thing for node implementers to do would be to define internal API for hooking in support for languages, allowing each language's enthusiasts to contribute implementations if they wish.\r\n\r\nYou are right @rphmeier that there is no logical connection between blockchain-related services and language compilation. Certainly, networked compilation could be handled by a separate service; that's a solution I'm likely to consider if I remain out-of-consensus here. But supporting compilation on nodes does make sense from clients' perspective, because clients will want to test and deploy what they compile. Clients will always need to be configured with a JSON-RPC endpoint, so it is a convenient service provider. Networked compilation elsewhere would mean a setting up on the server-side and then configuring for clients an extra network service.\r\n\r\nThe possibility of treating JavaScript/emscripten/WASM as a kind of universal virtual machine that all toolchain implementers would be expected to have available is interesting. It's kind of an empirical question. Will implementers of new languages find it a reasonable burden to follow in `solc`'s footsteps and compile to JavaScript? Are JavaScript interpreters sufficiently available across languages and sufficiently performant (in memory footprint as well as speed) to render this viable? I don't know. Again, it's an intriguing idea, one I'm likely to explore for solidity if `eth_compile` is really gone. But it strikes me as premature to rely upon this.\r\n\r\nThank you again for your work.",

Here: [How To Learn Solidity: The Ultimate Ethereum Coding Tutorial](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/solidity/)\r\n\r\nrelevant source code is here: https://github.com/Tectract/EthDeployer/blob/master/src/Deploy.js\r\n\r\nI generally think it would be really nice if the node implementation *included* the most recent solc, with or without explicit developer support on the node side, because it would make it a hell of a lot easier for people to actually compile their Solidity code, and I see ease-of-adoption as a major consideration for Eth to stay relevant in the face of competition right now.\r\n\r\nIf you guys make a decision to remove solc permanently, then I would suggest that you consider UPDATING THE DOCUMENTATION as part of that same ticket. Right now almost all the documentation on how to compile solidity code is outdated and it's very difficult for non-professional programmers to figure that stuff out.\r\n\r\noh yeah I also wanted to mention this issue, with a ton of confused people that went on for the last 2 years or so because of this problem, which is now considered closed (without resolution imho):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/3793",
