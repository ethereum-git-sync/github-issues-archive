  "body": "# Simple Summary\r\n\r\nA standard for optional global usernames to be queried by decentralized applications. \r\n\r\n# Abstract\r\n\r\nUsernames will be set as tokens, limited from a range of 4 characters to 15 characters. Once a username is acquired by an account, that username cannot be acquired by another account, unless bought by or transferred from the owning account. Each account may only hold one Global Identity Token (GIT) representing their username on Ethereum. \r\n\r\nAs to keep certain accounts anonymous, a GIT will be optional, in order to comply with privacy needs of users. \r\n\r\nGITs represent identification to an Ethereum account, by which a decentralized application can query for user identification, so as to replace an email. \r\n\r\nThe creation method of tokens may be up to discussion. However, it must be automated, yet accommodate competitive desire for any specific username. An auction style similar to .eth domain name acquisition may be considered, where individuals may bet on a particular username if in high demand. \r\n\r\n# Motivation \r\n\r\nStandardizing username querying in decentralized applications. Instead of multiple decentralized applications creating a name for each user, each stored on the Ethereum chain, usernames may be queried from the holdings of a user's account, similar to querying an NFT or ERC20 token, preventing unneeded storage on the Ethereum chain. \r\n\r\nIn previous iterations of the web, an email served as a means of identification, and the email password (and 2FA) served as means of ownership. Currently, Ethereum uses public and private key pairings for identity and ownership, however, a username may be a more legible, memorable form of identification. GITs which will be tied to a public key, by which ownership remains with the private key. GITs will serve as more legible, memorable alternatives to public keys, without replacing a public key for private, unidentified accounts. \r\n\r\n# Specification\r\n\r\nGITs are of `string` type, must be from 4 characters to 15 characters, and cannot start with a number. All letters must be lowercase on save. ",
