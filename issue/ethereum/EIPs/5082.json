We want to maintain credibly neutrality and not give number preference to \"friends of editors\".\r\n\r\n# Solution:\r\nWe do a one time auction of all unused EIP numbers between 1 and 5000 in the form of NFTs.  When a user wants to create an EIP, they can either get a number assigned to their EIP (following current or new selection strategy), or they can burn one of the NFTs just before their draft is merged and we'll let them have that number.\r\n\r\nThe proceeds would go toward funding EIP editors (specifically, funding to hire someone to replace me).  Additional things we could spend money on should the proceeds be particularly high:\r\n* Full time staff to work on process automation.\r\n* Fund development/enhancement/maintenance of the executable and consensus specs repositories.\r\n* White glove service assisting people with EIP authoring.\r\n* Authoring and maintaining of external resources related to upcoming Ethereum standards.",

Auctioning off those numbers now, while letting other EIPs keep theirs seems unfair.\r\n\r\nI don't think either of those are dealbreakers.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAs for the mechanism, if we go ahead with this, I think we should generalize it to work forever, not just the first 5000 numbers. Maybe we do a special auction for the unused numbers in the first 5000, however.\r\n\r\nI'd suggest dividing the EIP space into chunks of 1000. EIP numbers in the next chunk (so 6000-6999 at the time of commenting) would be available for purchase. Once the \"free\" counter gets close to that range, that chunk locks and the following one unlocks for purchase.\r\n\r\nOr... I guess we could just do it adhoc and deploy new contracts as we see fit?\r\n\r\n@Pandapip1 how would you feel about burning the NFT to use the number?",

ENS for EIPs makes a lot of sense to me.\r\n\r\nEither implemented as ENS subdomains (imagine we had `*.proposals.eth` or similar) or as an ENS-style top level resolver (e.g. `*.eip`), and there would be a fee to register a \"display name\" for your EIP that will point to it, this fee would go towards similar funding goals as mentioned above.\r\n\r\nFor example, instead of EIP-1559 we could register it and refer to it as `feemarket.eip` or `feemarket.proposals.eth`.\r\n\r\nEIPs that get merged will be permanently cemented with their display name (perhaps merged EIPs get a free display name if they don't have one), and ones that don't get merged need to be renewed to maintain.",

Happy to donate it to this effort.\r\n\r\nFor each of the existing EIPs, we should register and burn (send to `address(0)`) the corresponding number subdomain.\r\n\r\nI'd like to see an multisig of the EIP editors as the registrant and a contract as the controller.\r\nI'd suggest that the controller contract should allow anyone, at any time, to kick off a one-week dutch auction starting at some ridiculously high ETH price and decreasing linearly over the course of the week. The first person to press the \"buy\" button gets the domain, at whatever the current price is. I naively assume that this could probably be implemented with some minimal changes to the contracts that handle ENS' premium pricing after expiry.\r\n\r\nAfter the auction, the subdomains should follow the same pricing model as ENS domains, but the content should only be settable by the EIP editor's multisig.",

    "body": "> I'd suggest dividing the EIP space into chunks of 1000. EIP numbers in the next chunk (so 6000-6999 at the time of commenting) would be available for purchase. Once the \"free\" counter gets close to that range, that chunk locks and the following one unlocks for purchase.\r\n\r\n@SamWilsn I'm not opposed to auctioning off more numbers later, but I am hesitant to over-engineer for that.  The number of available numbers between 1 and 5000 I suspect will be enough to last us many years at the current rate of EIP creation, less if we assume some amount of acceleration of EIP creation but still quite a bit.  Also, I suspect we'll learn lessons if we do this once and we can apply those lessons to future auctions if we don't lock-in now.\r\n\r\nLastly, I am hesitant to auction numbers higher than the current PR/Issue number because that complicates the editor number assignment process.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n> @Pandapip1 how would you feel about burning the NFT to use the number?\r\n\r\nI was thinking today about maybe turning the NFT into a soulbound token upon redemption, so the author can retain it as a cool thing.  I'm not a fan of any of the current soulbinding EIPs as I feel pretty strongly that the \"soul\" should not be an Ethereum address but instead should be an NFT (e.g., an ENS name), but perhaps as part of this process we can work on developing a better soulbinding standard, or at least prototyping one.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n> I really dislike that. Since EIP process is based on BIPs, which is based on PIPs, which is based on RFCs I am not sure that the culture of selling numbers would follow the origins of the process.\r\n\r\n@radeksvarz Was there something specific about this proposal that bothers you?  I'm not personally a big fan of blindly doing as others have done just because they did it, but perhaps there is some reason that others haven't done this in the past that would apply to us?\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n> Ideally all EIP numbers would be obtained in the same way, so remove any EIP discretion on numbers being used from the EIP editors.\r\n\r\nI think it is important that creating an EIP is costless for someone who wants to.  I don't think we should develop a system that *requires* people to pay to create an EIP, which includes paying to buy a number.  I would be particularly worried about someone buying up all of the numbers from 1 to 10,000 and then you have a situation where EIPs numbered 10,000+ are second class citizens written by self-identified poor people.",

It was an attempt to reward contributors for getting their EIPs into FINAL status. \r\n\r\nMy thinking was that it be cool to recognize contributions to the Ethereum ecosystem through NFTs. \r\nThis idea, coupled with the possibility of the tokens being sold on the secondary market made for an interesting experiment. \r\n\r\nFor example, @fulldecent as a co-author on EIP-721, was able to mint an NFT representing his contributions to the original NFT specification: [here's the nft](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x5d96a22daae62e6c18dcdc32b5c102c317a0187a/100072100001) \r\n\r\nIt's most certainly more of a retroactive public goods funding model; which to be honest I haven't pushed very hard so I think it's still tbd if it's effective.

    "body": "> How much money is this trying to raise?\r\n\r\nUnspecified.  Ideally, enough that we can afford to pay one or more full time EIP editors and/or tooling developers for a substantial time into the future.  However, any amount would help toward partially achieving this goal.\r\n\r\n> How long is this auction for?\r\n\r\nUndefined at this time.  This issue is to just float the general idea.\r\n\r\n> The enforceable EIPs (e.g. JSON-RPC) have been moved out of this repo, will this cover those repos that contain EIPs now as well?\r\n\r\nMy assumption is that the keyholders for the assets would be some trusted set of people ethos-aligned with Ethereum and they would be used primarily to cover standardization costs (which would include executable specs, EIPs, JSON-RPC, etc.).  I wouldn't personally be opposed to excess funds being directed toward other ecosystem benefiting things tangential to that, but that complicates things so perhaps it is easiest to focus on \"standardization and change control processes\"?\r\n\r\n> Why can't the foundation fund this?\r\n\r\nCurrently, the Ethereum standardization process is not funded by the EF.  I don't know who is funding the development of the executable spec.  EIP editors are not funded at all.  I think someone was funding JSON-RPC standardization for a while but I believe they aren't any longer.  In theory *anyone* could fund any of these things but no one does at the moment.\r\n\r\nThe general idea here is that the EIP editors control an asset that some people value very highly, and the editors value very little.  Since we need funding, selling off that asset feels like an obvious way to address two problems at the same time.",
