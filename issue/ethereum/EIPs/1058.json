  "body": "A programmatic POW algorithm that can maximally utilize functions on commodity (widely distributed and readily available) GPUs limits optimization potential for a specialize mining ASIC.  An implementation of this idea is presented here:  https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/1057\r\n\r\nThis PR describes a fully implemented algorithm based on ethminer code.  It attempts to be permanently \"ASIC-resistant\" without the need for future small forks. The goal is to extend the runaway and allow for a gentle transition to Casper, minimizing network turbulence and maximizing time for Casper validation.  \r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any thoughts and comments.",
