So I felt I needed a proposal to use old tokens in commerce.\r\n To use various erc20 tokens for trading, you need a custom contract. However, a single wallet with a variety of tokens, and a mutually trusted store, can make transactions that are simple and efficient. The erc20 token is traded through two calls, `approve (address _spender, uint256 _value)` and `transferFrom (address _from, address _to, uint256 _value)`, but when using the wallet contract, `paySafe (address _shop, uint256 _item)`will be traded only in one call.\r\nAnd if you only reuse the store interface, you can also trade using `payUnsafe (address _shop, uint256 _item)`.\r\n\r\n## Simple Workflow\r\n![workflow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11692220/41841025-2ed6e024-78a2-11e8-9faf-2b43aeaa2303.png)\r\n",
