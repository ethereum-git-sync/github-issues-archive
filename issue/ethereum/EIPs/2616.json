While this is happening, you are free to use it (i.e. live in it). With current lending platforms on DeFi, you stake your tokens as collateral to borrow (other) tokens. While this is happening, those tokens are locked inside the platform with zero utility (e.g. you can't vote with them).\r\n>\r\n> This EIP solves this problem by giving the ability for someone to have a \"lien\" on your collateral while letting someone else (e.g. you) retain user-ship rights to it (e.g. voting on MakerDAO).",
