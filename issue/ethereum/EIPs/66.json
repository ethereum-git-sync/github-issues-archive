  "body": "The term \"contract\" is arguably a poor fit for the core building block of Ethereum (i.e., the account type / object on the blockchain). Because it's the name of that building block, we've wound up using it to refer to our simple applications, games, and other things that a far, far apart from contracts at law and possibly even the smart contracts, at least as Nick Szabo defined them. \"Have you checked out my tic tac toe contract?\"\n\nI propose we re-name it a \"snork.\" Like the things in the cartoon from the 80’s. It's fun. It's got nostalgic appeal. And, best of all, it's completely use case-agnostic and has no confusing legal connotations.\n",

We shouldn't harm Ethereum with language that has no inherent value besides uniqueness.\n\nIt also serves no good to break from the heritage of Nick Szabo's original idea of smart contracts.

    "body": "The best names are simple and obvious. Yes, there often is a need to \"brand\" things to make them unique, but that should never be used as the name of the underlying object. \n\nThat said, there is immense value from a developer and google search perspective to use proprietary and branded prefixes to help users find content through searches. The best example of this is Objective-C class names. The short prefixes for common things like NSArray, UITextField, etc... have always made google searches more successful.\n\nThis is not true for Android programmers searching for developer content relating to code. So perhaps it would be useful to use ETH as the standard prefix for any class name. Like ETHContract, etc.\n\nIf \"contract\" is too rigid and loaded with lawyerisms, I think \"Agent\" is a useful term for one aspect of smart contracts. Not a replacement for smart contract, but rather a more specific element. \n",

    "body": "\"No one knows what it means, but it's provocative. ...  It gets the people going.\" -- Chazz Michael Michaels. @obscuren Apologies for my clumsy and painfully dorky sense of humor. The goal here was to provoke discussion about an issue that, yes, I think we should all give thought to as the platform grows. Do I really think \"snork\" is a good name? No. Do I think \"contract\" is a suboptimal name? Very possibly. As a lawyer and CS guy, teaching folks from both those realms about Ethereum, I do witness the current, liberal use of \"contract\" confusing both communities. Worse, I see it preventing some from seeing the full power of Ethereum. I.e., they think it's just a new way to create clones of legal contracts, nothing more. That may sound dumb, but they hear \"contract, contract, contract\" and that's where their mind goes. Conversely, when I stick to \"application\" or \"program\" when describing what's on the blockchain (which is what I frequently do these days), it doesn't seem to...limit their imagination quite the same way. (Wish I had expressed it this way in the blog post.)\n",

Decentralization is a concept inaccessible to most.  To address decentralization head on- to the uninitiated- by calling contracts “dapp” or \"dapps\", or something similar, is to force an understanding of decentralization.  An understanding of decentralization by the average person is where we are evolving toward.  What’s happening here- ultimately- is for people to consider and understand \"a decentralized way of thinking\", and adopt a decentralized way of being.   The term \"dapp/dapps\" helps to move people toward this.  In one/two years the mainstream media could proliferate \"dapp/dapps/etc\" to the masses.  This word or phrase could help take the movement to the next level.   \n",

Those may be native applications, or WebView hybrid apps, or full web apps.   They may be installed via conventional app stores, or downloaded, or delivered via IPFS.   They may run standalone, or they may be hosted within Mist, or Syng, or MetaMask, or some other way.     Many dapps may actually have centralized elements, like conventional servers and databases, in addition to their decentralized elements.\n\nSo in short, dapps and smart contracts aren't synonyms.     I think that \"dapp\" will, for sure, be the term which the masses use and understand.   Or maybe they don't even give a toss about that distinction.   They just get some new apps on their phones, which are cool.    They don't care about the innards.\n\nNobody cared about the technology behind Uber.   They just enjoyed the user experience, convenience and utility.\n\nJust about any name you care to mention has been probably already been overloaded up the wazzoo already anyway.\n",
