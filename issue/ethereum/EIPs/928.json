  "body": "Hi folks,\r\n\r\ni am working on an EIP and reference client ( https://github.com/gitcoinco/ethavatar ) for a standard called **ETH Avatar**, which will allow members of the community to attach avatars to their ethereum addresses. (think gravatar, but for ethereum addresses). doing so would allow users to eyeball a counter party's picture and quickly confirm their ETH (or contract call) is going to the right place\r\n\r\ni read at https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md that\r\n\r\n> Vetting an idea publicly before going as far as writing a EIP is meant to save the potential author time. Asking the Ethereum community first if an idea is original helps prevent too much time being spent on something that is guaranteed to be rejected based on prior discussions (searching the Internet does not always do the trick)\r\n\r\nso i come here for public comment. does this already exist? does it add value? is it worth having me \"champion\" this EIP?\r\n\r\npersonally, i think this is where a standard has value:\r\n\r\n* the standard becomes more powerful the more clients integrate it\r\n* the more clients integrate it, the more users can visually 'eyeball' that they are sending ETH to the right place\r\n* the more users trust where they're sending ETH, the more they trust Ethereum.\r\n\r\n# demo\r\n\r\nhere is a working demo of the standard\r\n\r\nhttps://ethavatar.com (works on mainnet and rinkeby)\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gitcoinco/ethavatar/master/demo/demo.gif\" >\r\n\r\nyou can read more about the current initiative at https://github.com/gitcoinco/ethavatar",

Frame would be different, but the picture content would be what the human on the other end keys in on to see that it's you - couldn't this still be misleading?\r\n\r\nIn the attack scenario you articulated, you're right.. the framing solution provides protection against randomly fat-fingering the address.. but does it provide protection against an attacker stealing an picture / frame?\r\n\r\nI think if we make the procedurally generated frame mandatory (and mandatory to be generated by the address), then that buys us some protection since an attacker won't be able to generate an address that's exactly the one it's trying to spoof.\r\n\r\nI think in this scenario you'd have to set a community standard / user expectation that the 'frame' is what you look at to make sure the address is correct (or you just continue checking the address).\r\n\r\nI'm open to other ways of providing a visually verifiable data into the image.  Thanks for the feedback @yarrumretep !",

I would say that a single row of colors loses a lot of the functionality of the blockies.

The point of it was to add procedurally generated information but it doesn't work the same way as a blockie. \r\n\r\nIt think when #EthAvatar is #buitl out it should have a really easy way for someone to display something like this in their DApp:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2653167/37357794-ef44f440-26ae-11e8-8d0e-7cb48f184c5d.png)\r\n\r\nYou get the friendly picture and the visually identifying information all in one and it maintains the neat symmetry effect blockies have. I also want to reiterate that it's *very* important not to completely replace the blockie with the profile photo and #EthAvatar will want to steer DApp developers toward the combination. ",

This is very similar to the process of making a Telegram phone call where you get some magic emojis that represent a shared secret between you and the other caller. These emojis are created and overlaid at run-time and are not baked into the image, obviously. \r\n\r\nPerhaps the eth avatar website could generate those emojis, bake them into the image in the bottom left corner, and then software will take the address, encode it into emojis at run-time, and then humans just have to 1) assume they're using software that isn't trying to screw them over and then 2) just check that the emojis baked into the image match the emojis derived from the address.

We launched ethmoji.io yesterday where you can create your own unique avatars from emoji components. The layer combination of each ethmoji is guaranteed to be unique, and we even store the hash of the resulting image for every emoji to try prevent people from making emojis with unique layer combinations that end up looking identical to an already minted one. If you want to join our discord, we can discuss about this more (https://discordapp.com/invite/crFeaRj) ",

    "body": "Hey all, big fan of this concept—or at least making more metadata available for addresses you're interacting with. Like @leanthebean suggested, it'd be neat to pursue a collaboration between EthAvatar and [Ethmoji](https://ethmoji.io).\r\n\r\nAs a starting place, I'd suggest looking at the [ethmoji-js](https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/ethmoji-js) package, which was built to help developers integrate Ethmoji in ways that sound similar to what you're talking about here.\r\n\r\nI think it'd be great to develop a standard for contracts that provide (for a given address) both an avatar and a way of verifying an address via an image. It might be best to start working on those in parallel—or as two separate EIPs—because the image-to-identity mapping is far more challenging than an avatar standard. In the simplest form, the standard would just confirm the lookup method for turning an address into an image. If we agree on what that should be, then a developer could easily integrate with either EthAvatar or Ethmoji.",

The owners of those items get to set their own composition prices and get paid every time the items are used.\r\n\r\nBeyond fees, what do you think could be improved?\r\n\r\nSide note: I think this EIP should continue to be about avatars more generally, so maybe we should jump elsewhere to discuss ethmoji feedback?",

If not, I will send them a cold email.\r\n\r\nWe plan to support any ERC-721 token asset as an avatar, maybe we could fold them in in that context.\r\n\r\n> Yes, we take 1.25% from the price of successful sales of Ethmojis and a 5% fee on compositions.\r\n\r\nThough I feel strongly that the EIP standard should be free and open to use, if users want to use a third party provider to create an avatar that is special to them, and then submit them to this ETH Avatar EIP standard thats great.\r\n\r\n",
