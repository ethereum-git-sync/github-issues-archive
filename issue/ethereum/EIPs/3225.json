That EIP looks similar to a [previous attempt I had made too](https://github.com/ricmoo/distinguished-format-strings), but has some short-coming when I actually tried to use it.\r\n\r\nIt did not work well on hardware wallets and was hard to extend to different purposes but more importantly there were use cases it couldn't actually handle; case where you need to actually process data.\r\n\r\nFor example, to commit to ENS, you need to commit a hash of the `name`, `owner` and a `secret`. Which means description needs to be computed independently from the data, but both need the same inputs.\r\n\r\nThis is the main motivation for moving to a meta description of the data that can generate the data required, also having a chance to describe it from the parameters passed in.\r\n\r\n> I assume the reason for this is because of the thing in the rationale section about how it is hard to define a DSL language?\r\n\r\nYes, that's a concise way of saying it. :)",

    "body": "# Localizations\r\n\r\nA few ideas have been put forward, both of which change the signature:\r\n\r\n- (a) `eipXXXDescribe(bytes describer_inputs, string[] locales)`\r\n- (b) `eipXXXDescribe(bytes describer_inputs, bytes32 requested_formats) returns (bytes32 format, string description, bytes data)`\r\n\r\nThe idea of the first (a) is to pass in a string of locales, which the contract could then process in order, choosing the best match for the requested language, date formats, delimiter, etc.\r\n\r\n*Pros*\r\n- This is how many high-level language APIs work today for localization\r\n- Easy to understand\r\n- Simple for clients to use\r\n\r\n*Cons*\r\n- It is largely focused on the case of locale selection, and may not adapt well to other constraints\r\n- String comparison is already difficult enough in Solidity, and the way locale strings need to be processed has a lot of caveats that each developer would be responsible for (e.g. `zh` vs `zh_cn` vs `zh_tw`); and additionally if strings include mime-types or other constraints, string parsing is required\r\n- The ABI encoding for this is quite complex (but that is easily handled by helper functions)\r\n\r\nThe idea of the second (b) is to use a bitfield similar to the [ENS ABI support](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-205). Each bit or clump of bits can be used to encode some desired OR-ed feature or set of features. For now the value would be specified by the specification to be 0, but allows for expanding in the future. A given bit set may also consume some other bits in the field as a value, for example, maybe if bit 5 is set, then the locale is read from the 4 bytes in bits 96 through 64. The matching format is returned in the result. So,  for example, if you requested the format by \"markdown+english or plain-text\", and the contract only understood \"plain-english\" the returned format would be the format value for \"plain-english\".\r\n\r\nBasically it gives us space to add any feature we want in the future, while making sure current contracts can respond to current and future clients and the current clients can request descriptions from current and future contracts.\r\n\r\n*Pros*\r\n- Simple for contracts to process and clients to use\r\n- Easy to extend in the future to allow either mutually-exclusive or combinational options with optional additional properties\r\n- Can be used for many things, not necessarily just raw localization\r\n- With the returned `format`, we can (I'm pretty sure?) drop the mime-type from the returned description string\r\n\r\n*Cons*\r\n- In the case of multiple fallback locales, multiple calls may need to be made in the event the earlier locales do not match\r\n- Limited to 256-bits (although, some bit set could be used to indicate additional fields in the `bytes describer_input`)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe most important thing is that we have a way forward regarding forwards and backwards compatibility as new uses for this come up. I personally prefer option (b).",

Clients that do not support the version of the DSL would simply get back the `text/plain` description.",

Immutable contracts with an owner.\r\n\r\n(1) is arguably not too big of a deal because the contract could just delegate to an external contract, thus making the minimum code required for implementing this very small.\r\n\r\n(2) is a bit more compelling to me as there are a *lot* of existing contract wallets out there that may want to add support for this.  These contract wallets can execute arbitrary code (e.g., calling into a standardized global registry contract to register itself) but they cannot mutate their own implementation (for good reason!).  This also would mean that people in the future with Account Abstraction wallets who may get some generic AA wallet would be able to \"enhance it\" after the fact.\r\n\r\nSince all interactions are off-chain, the cost of the external call to lookup the target contract in a registry seems to be very worth it to me given even marginal benefits.",
