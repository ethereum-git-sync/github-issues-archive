  "body": "### **NOTE: This has been merged and is in Draft status. Please review https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-2309.md before commenting** \r\n\r\nHi there. I'd like to get a feel from the community about a new extension for the ERC-721 standard. \r\n\r\n**TLDR**: I'm proposing a batch mint extension that includes a standardized event which supports the creation and transfer of many  tokens at one time. I am not proposing how to implement a batch creation or batch transfer function, only the `BatchTransfer` event which would emitted when a group of tokens is created or transferred. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nERC-721 has great potential to create a digital representation for any unique asset in this world. New markets and jobs can be created with ideas that stem from creating digital representations of unique assets - either tangible, or digital. However, in its current form the ERC-721 standard is not scalable. Take this example: \r\n\r\nI sell lemons and have a farm with 10,000 lemon trees. I want to turn each lemon tree into a non-fungible token that people can own. Each person that owns one of my non-fungible lemon tokens will receive a quarterly percentage of each sale. The problem is that I would need to create each of these tokens individually - which will cost me a lot of TIME and MONEY. Wouldn't it be easier to mint 10,000 non-fungible lemon tokens at once while adhering to the ERC-721 standard? I think so. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\npragma solidity ^0.5.10;\r\n\r\n/**\r\n  @title ERC-2309: ERC-721 Batch Mint Extension\r\n  @dev https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/2309\r\n */\r\n\r\ninterface ERC721BatchMint /* is ERC721 */ {\r\n  /**\r\n    @notice This event is emitted when ownership of a batch of tokens changes by any mechanism.\r\n    This includes minting, transferring, and burning.\r\n\r\n    @dev The address executing the transaction MUST own all the tokens within the range of\r\n    fromTokenId and toTokenId, or MUST be an approved operator to act on the owners behalf.\r\n    The fromTokenId and toTokenId MUST be a sequential range of tokens IDs.\r\n    When minting/creating tokens, the `fromAddress` argument MUST be set to `0x0` (i.e. zero address).\r\n    When burning/destroying tokens, the `toAddress` argument MUST be set to `0x0` (i.e. zero address).\r\n\r\n    @param fromTokenId The token ID that begins the batch of tokens being transferred\r\n    @param toTokenId The token ID that ends the batch of tokens being transferred\r\n    @param fromAddress The address transferring ownership of the specified range of tokens\r\n    @param toAddress The address receiving ownership of the specified range of tokens.\r\n  */\r\n  event BatchTransfer(uint indexed fromTokenId, uint toTokenId, address indexed fromAddress, address indexed toAddress);\r\n}\r\n```",

    "body": "Good points @wighawag. Yeah unfortunately platforms/wallets would need to update to support the new event. Like you said, no way around it. It seems that either you will have to support a new standard, or a new event. Eventually the platform or wallet will need to update.\r\n\r\nI like ConsecutiveBatchTransfer. I will update to that. A token ID array would work for a lot of cases, but I think a consecutive batch transfer method has its place as the array will eventually fail. Not to mention you could complete a batch transfer in constant time rather than O(n) with the array. \r\n\r\nThanks for the comments.",

    "body": "I recently discovered this standard when my work-in-progress-NFT-marketplace's indexer failed to detect most of the items minted in the [GoonzSchoolPhotos](https://etherscan.io/address/0x36e5913bf48ccbd361875d09c0a20a4c144da896) collection, which emitted `ConsecutiveTransfer` events in its minting process.\r\n\r\nI'd previously viewed the fact that ERC-721 and ERC-1155 could not mint an NFT without emitting an event for each unique token or (in the case of ERC-1155) type of token as a sort of backstop against denial-of-service attacks. If someone wanted to flood my indexer with bogus NFTs, they would need to at least pay proportional gas to do so.\r\n\r\nHonoring EIP-2309 without limits feels impossible: for the gas cost of a single event, a collection could signal that it is minting a full `2^256 - 1` items. Conventionally, my marketplace would then try to collect the metadata for each newly-minted token that it sees. To prevent the `ConsecutiveTransfer` event from being abused to fill my metadata collection queue with `2^256 - 1` pending calls, the only reasonable solution I see is for a marketplace to truncate overly-large token ID ranges.\r\n\r\nIt looks like the [Chiru Labs implementation](https://github.com/chiru-labs/ERC721A/issues/310) has a limit of 5,000 on the size of an EIP-2309 range. That GoonzSchoolPhotos collection that brought this to my attention minted things in batches of 1,000. The OpenSea token ID range size limit is 5,000.",
