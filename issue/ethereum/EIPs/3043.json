  "body": "There should be an Ethereum \"operation\" to accomplish a call or transfer in a pre-determined future time (or block number).\r\n\r\nBy analogy with a well known ERC-20 approve vulnerability my method needs to be first called with a small (or zero) value and as soon as the transaction confirms with the new value.\r\n\r\nThe method is called by DAO accordingly voting. So the voting needs to set the value to zero (or small) value and after it is mined, anyone should be able to call the method again with the intended value (it is easy to make it callable by anyone by setting a boolean flag that removes `require()` checking the sender).\r\n\r\nBut if the organization is small, it may happen that calling it by anyone may be forgotten. Thus comes calling it in the future automatically.\r\n\r\nIt should be built-in into the blockchain rather than done by an external Web2 service for the clear reasons of reliability. (Also it would support settings arbitrary `msg.sender`, not the account of a third-party Web2 service.)\r\n\r\nNeed to store an enough value for gas beforehand. What to do with excess gas? return to the method sender after method invocation? donate to validators? burn?",

You have to address the fact that gas costs may differ between when the transaction was sent and when the transaction executes (or finishes executing). You also need to deal with figuring out the gas cost of storing that data indefinitely (until the triggering event occurs) and you can't just let individual nodes drop that data because it is part of state. You also will need to figure out how the concept fits into stateless Ethereum, and how that data is synced.\r\n\r\nThat the gas price may differ was addressed by me above: The sender should lend a big amount of ETH to pay for gas to the network at the time of sending transaction. All Ethereum state is store indefinitely, so no need to do something special about gas here. No idea about stateless.",
