  "body": "**Abstract**\r\nA contract size limit of 24kb was introduced by EIP #170 . To solve the following problem problem: \"when a contract is called, even though the call takes a constant amount of gas, the call can trigger O(n) cost in terms of reading the code from disk, preprocessing the code for VM execution, and also adding O(n) data to the Merkle proof for the block's proof-of-validity\". I think we can solve this problem while still allowing _infinite_ contract size.\r\n\r\n**Motivation**\r\nComplex dApps require complex smart contracts. I have seen a lot of dApp developers struggle with this and a lot of alternative solutions are being used like using delegate calls. Delegate calls reduce code readability while developing and while verifying source code on tools like etherscan. They also introduce another attack surface and added complexity.\r\n\r\n**Specification**\r\n1) The ethereum account array in state trie saves another element `codeSize` apart from existing 4: [nonce,balance,storageRoot,codeHash]\r\n2) Whenever a new contract is deployed, its size is stored in `codeSize` of the account object.\r\n3) If a contract is destructed, the `codeSize` should also be reset.\r\n4) opcodes like `CALL`, `DELEGATECALL`, `CALLCODE` etc should charge additional `X`(3?) gas per extra word if the contract code size is greater than 24kb.\r\n\r\n**Rationale**\r\nThe only reason why contract size was limited was to prevent people from exploiting the fixed costs. We can overcome this by making the costs variable. The `codeSize` element will help in calculating call cost before reading the whole contract and eventually throwing OOG. Merkle proofs will also be generated at fixed cost as we won't have to load the huge contracts from disk first. The `codeSize` should be enough.\r\n\r\n**Backwards Compatibility**\r\nWe don't necessarily need to refactor the existing account arrays as all the existing accounts have less than 24kb of code so no extra cost has to be charged from calls being sent to them. We can assume `X = 0` if it's not available. \r\nThis will mean that there are no backward compatibility issues.\r\n\r\nThis is just an early discussion Issue. I will create a properly formatted draft with specifications after getting some more feedback from the community.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/170\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/659\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Patricia-Tree#tries-in-ethereum",

That's a debatable point but I get why you think so.\r\n\r\nContract size increases due to multiple factors that don't really add to the complexity of the code. For example,\r\n1) Reason strings take a hell lot of space.\r\n2) Getter functions for ease of use of front-end devs or normal users take a lot of space.\r\n3) Solidity 0.5.0 produces larger bytecode than solidity 0.4.24 for the same contract with required explicit definitions.\r\netc\r\n\r\nObviously, the contract size also increases when you add functionality.",

    "body": "@maxsam4 I have a couple of arguments against that, if at least one of them is right, my amendment to your proposal should be fine.\r\n\r\n  1) Isn't the bytecode stored in some kind of Array anyway? doesn't that array have some size data at the first element (as per how arrays are generally implemented). If not, can't the levelDB implementations be slightly amended to store that?\r\n  2) There is still a _larger_ contract size limit based on the block-gas-limit. So even if the client had to fetch the whole contract to determine size, it _still_ would only have to fetch _one_ contract, (the attack that was used required hundreds or even thousands of contracts to be loaded). The \"slightly quadratic\" resources I think assumes the loading of many many contracts like this. If the client must only load 1, and that one already has a _moderately limited size_ this may no longer be an issue. However, I might be wrong about that because, as I understand it, an out-of-gas transaction _only_ applies to the current contract scope, and therefore a single transaction _might_ be able to `CALL` multiple contracts, even after the first one fails with an out-of-gas error. But at least, when the `CALL` fails, the client can release the memory used on that contract, BEFORE calling the next one, so I think again, that our problem is solved.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n",

    "body": "@zmitton Thanks for your feedback! I am afraid that neither of those solutions will work. Here are some of my thoughts\r\n1) It doesn't matter how the bytecode is actually stored. AFAIK, the EVM needs to generate proper proofs and hence the EVM needs access to either the size of the smart contract code or to the code itself. We can not standardize how the data must be stored under the hood (levelDB). We can just standardize what data we want. The data we want is contract size. If the implementations can modify their storages slightly to provide us with the required data without recalculating anything, that's great but we can't force it. The requirement of saving contract size available is not blocking this PR. That change CAN be done. Please refer to https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/removing-or-increasing-the-contract-size-limit/3045 to see what's blocking this. That stuff may not be applicable to ETC though.\r\n\r\n2) One contract can load multiple large sized contracts by creating external calls and passing low gas to them (using `.call()` in solidity). Memory is not the main concern here. Random disk read is. Disks are super slow and finding and reading data from them is expensive.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, on the ETC side, if you are not planning on increasing block gas limit by much then it might be best to increase the price of all calls, delegate calls etc by a fixed amount and remove the contract size limit. With 8m block gas limit, there is a natural limit of ~40 KB. On the ETH front, there are talks to increase the gas limit by as much as 300% so that is not an as viable solution.",

The consensus rule is that payment is dependent on bytecode length, and how that is implemented is up to the client. Caching the length data somewhere is simply an optimization, that can and (I would argue) _should_ be done by any production client software.",

    "body": "> But we don't need to force it. The consensus rule is that payment is dependent on bytecode length, and how that is implemented is up to the client. Caching the length data somewhere is simply an optimization, that can and (I would argue) _should_ be done by any production client software.\r\n\r\nThat's what the original proposal wants. However, you need to see the practical aspect as well. If the clients don't implement the optimization then it is ddos vector. Therefore, this proposal mandates the clients to implement this optimization. As with the gas mechanics, you set the price of any action to anything but the price is actually determined by practical costs. For some clients, the cost may differ but we try to pick a generic cost. Feel free to implement this however you wish in ETC but as ETH has so many clients, I think it is necessary to make this \"optimization\" mandatory so that all the current and future clients end up implementing it.\r\n\r\n> By the way, skimming through the link you posted, I don't think any of that stuff applies. It's mostly about Ethereum-specific design plans\r\n\r\nYeah, I felt that too.",

    "body": "ok thanks @maxsam4 I think I have a good understanding now. So I now realize that the difference mostly a backwards compatibility issue I was likely trying to avoid. i.e. having the extra field affects the tree hashing and therefore affects the root and therefore the consensus and is a hard fork. But of course changing the gas costs is a hard fork anyway, so it's all pretty similar. My way would affect a little less related software, but would make client implementation easier to screw up. Thanks for the ideas!",

A standard way to query a contract to discover and retrieve information about all functions exposed by it. This means an ERC1538 contract stores its ABI and the ABI can be retrieved from it.\r\n4. Enables an upgradeable contract to become immutable in the future if desired.\r\n> Adds another attack vector.\r\n\r\nWhich can be secured.\r\n> Makes intra contract calls more expensive.\r\n\r\nThis is not true.

Like it or not but most people can barely use the read/write feature in etherscan, they can't load a custom ABI and make web3 calls.\r\n\r\nThis is only true for lack of UI tooling. This standard actually provides better possibilities for UI tooling because it stores its ABI within it that can be retrieved. I am now looking for UI designers/programmers to help create user interfaces for ERC1538 contracts.\r\n> Makes it harder for beginners to verify the code and hence reduces trust.\r\n\r\nThis again is a tooling matter that can be remedied by user interfaces with support for ERC1538.",
