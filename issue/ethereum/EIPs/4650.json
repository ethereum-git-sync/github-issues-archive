  "body": "Current NFT standards such as ERC721, ERC1155 use a mapping of the NFT owner wallet address and the asset `tokenId` to store and resolve representation of ownership. In both ERC721 and ERC1155 when a new instance is minted/created a new record is added to the ownership mapping. To display an NFT knowing the `tokenId` the entry-point to the contract is usually either through a call to `tokenURI` or `uri`, both intended to return a `URI` that leads to the NFT metadata object. In observed NFTs implementations the full `URI` or a `fragment` of it can *sometimes* be controlled by the owner of the collection, but **never by the owner of the NFT instance (token)**. After the NFT instance `URI` is resolved to the metadata object, the scheme most likely contains `pointers` to the location of the NFT instance digital asset object (JPG, PNG, MOV ...etc.), mostly in the form of a `URI`. Owners of the digital asset object have no control over the `pointers` value as well, **making it impossible to fully own the asset lifecycle.**\r\n\r\n**Problem**\r\nNFT owners have no **control/ownership** of their NFTs digital objects **resolution path**, leading to incomplete ownership representation and potential security risk.\r\n\r\n**Potential Solution**\r\n* **Metadata reside outside of the contract:** NFT standards should include methods that allow assets owners to change the result of `tokenURI`, `uri` and equivalent to their own specified value.\r\n* **Metadata within the contract:** NFT standards should include methods that allow assets owners to change the digital asset media object `pointers` without affecting the rest of the NFT collection owner resolution path.\r\n**Original assets integrity verification:** The standard should include function(s) that help validate the authenticity of collection media objects. E.g a function within the collection could return a reference to an object `URI` or an object itself that help validate all `tokenURI`, and `uri` digital objects `pointers` content authenticity independently if it the location has been changed by its current owner.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\ncontract OwnableNFT  {\r\n    [...snip...]\r\n\r\n    // verify the sender is the owner of the token in the mapping\r\n    modifier onlyNftOwner(uint256 _tokenId) {\r\n        require(NftOwner(_tokenId) == _msgSender(), \"Ownable NFT: only token owner can change location\");\r\n        _;\r\n    }\r\n   \r\n     // Change the value of the digital object `pointers`\r\n     function changeURI(uint256 tokenId, string memory newURI) public view onlyNftOwner(tokenId) {\r\n         [...snip...]\r\n     }\r\n    \r\n    //  Returns assets integrity verification source \r\n     function collectionURI() public view (string memory) {\r\n         [...snip...]\r\n     }\r\n\r\n    // Reset URI to default location\r\n    function resetURI(uint256 tokenId, string memory newURI) public view onlyNftOwner(tokenId) {\r\n         [...snip...]\r\n     }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nthis way owners can have the digital asset whenever they want, or destroy it if so they deem. creators can keep a proof of ownership, and a verification process can be triggered to verify the digital media objects authenticity independently where it resides.",
