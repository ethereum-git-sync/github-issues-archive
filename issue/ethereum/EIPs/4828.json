  "body": "# Problem\r\nCurrently almost every on-chain exchange has their own interface to execute operations on exchange. Currently creating platforms supporting different on-chain exchanges is hard and supporting all of them is almost impossible since new on-chain exchanges also create their own interface.\r\n\r\n# Proposed Solution\r\nA standard interface to be used with current and future on-chain exchanges. Current exchanges can create a new smart contract with provided interface standard and future on-chain exchanges can support use the standardized interface.\r\n\r\n[Related Ethereum-Magicians Post](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/idea-a-standardized-interface-for-on-chain-exchanges)",
