That information should not be included or be part of the item itself.\r\n\r\nImplementing NFTs for real world items will require the addition of certificates, photos, signatures, etc. to prove the authenticity and the real value of the item represented by the NFT.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\nThis specification is an extension to ERC721Metadata:\r\n\r\n```\r\ninterface IERC721MetadataEnrichable is IERC721Metadata {\r\n    \r\n    event Enrich(address indexed owner, uint256 indexed tokenId);\r\n\r\n    function tokenEnrich(uint256 tokenId, string calldata hash) external;\r\n\r\n    function tokenEnrichedURIs(uint256 tokenId) external view returns(string[] memory);\r\n\r\n    function tokenEnrichedURIById(uint256 tokenId, uint256 tokenEnrichmentId) external view returns(string memory);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nevent Enrich: The event will be fired when the owner enriches a Token.\r\nowner: Only the owner address can enrich a token.\r\ntokenId: The tokenId of the enriched token.\r\n\r\nfunction tokenEnrich: Allows the user to enrich a token.\r\ntokenId: The tokenId of the token to enrich.\r\nhash: The hash of the data stored, this will be attached to the base URI defined by ERC721Metadata.\r\n\r\nfunction tokenEnrichedURIs: Allows the user to extract the list of URIs to the documents attached to the token.\r\ntokenId: The tokenId of the token to extract the list of URIs.\r\n\r\nfunction tokenEnrichedURIById: Allows the user to extract the URI to the document stored in the list of enrichments by index.\r\ntokenId: The tokenId of the token to extract the URI.\r\ntokenEnrichmentId: The index of the enrichment to extract.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\nThis proposal does not affect the compatibility ERC721Metadata or any other standard.\r\n\r\n## Test Cases\r\nTest cases for an implementation are mandatory for EIPs that are affecting consensus changes. Other EIPs can choose to include links to test cases if applicable.\r\n\r\n## Reference Implementation\r\nIf there is interest on this the reference implementations will be published. At this moment, https://stellarnft.xyz has an implementation of this as explained in the site.\r\n\r\n## Security Considerations\r\nThe current proposal only enables the token owner to make enrichment, this is due to the fact that fake could drop the value of the NFT. \r\n\r\n",
