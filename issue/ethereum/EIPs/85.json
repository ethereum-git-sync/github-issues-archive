  "body": "After discussions in https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/84 the community seems to have settled on using the [BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki) standard for Ether HD wallets. The HD path there is\n\n```\nm/44'/60'/a'/0/n\n```\n\nwhere `a` denotes the Account and `n` is the `n`-th generated address. \n\nFor Ethereum Tokens it would make sense IMO to use BIP44 also since it's fundamentally about token transfers. It seems untenable to have each token creator register a different token number (that number is \"60\" for Ether) in [SLIP44](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md) and use the BIP44 directly.\n\nMy suggestion is to pick a number representing Ethereum Standard Tokens (I suggest 61 since this is available, and Ether is 60) and register that with SLIP44. Each token is defined by its 160 bit address `x`. Since each derivation step only has 31 bits we will decompose the address as\n\n```\nx = x0 || x1 || x2 || x3 || x4 || x5\n```\n\nwhere `x0` to `x4` are 28 bits and `x5` is 20 bits. We now define the derivation path as\n\n```\nm/44'/61'/x0'/x1'/x2'/x3'/x4'/x5'/a'/0/n\n```\n\nfor account `a` and address `n`. This allows us to have a separate, well-defined path for each token.\n\n_Example:_ We have the Unicorn token `0x89205A3A3b2A69De6Dbf7f01ED13B2108B2c43e7`. This would correspond to the HD path\n\n```\nm/44'/61'/89205A3'/A3b2A69'/De6Dbf7'/f01ED13'/B2108B2'/c43e7'/a'/0/n\n```\n\nwhich in standard decimal notation gives\n\n```\nm/44'/61'/143787427'/171649641'/233233399'/251784467'/186714290'/803815'/a'/0/n\n```\n\nas the final HD path.\n\n_Pros:_ Unambiguous, separate HD path for each token in a token wallet\n_Cons:_ Not _really_ BIP44 since BIP44 only has one number between 0 and 2^31 for the coin type.\n\nDiscuss! :smiley: \n",

    "body": "@niran Yeah, I thought about this too, i.e. using something other than `44'` as purpose. Not sure exactly how I feel since technically we're basically collapsing `/61'/x0'/x1'/x2'/x3'/x4'/x5'` into the one logical `coin_type`, so it's similar to BIP44. And if we use another number, should we introduce another BIP, like BIP45? It seems strange for something that has nothing to do with Bitcoin anymore...\n",

I can get behind your scheme here and follow this construction for the token accounts. From what I understand to do this properly we'll need to build an ethereum contract of some sort that can use the same derivation for distribution of tokens, if you have any resources on your end send me a heads up, and we can collaborate in the upcoming weeks and months.\n",

    "body": "I agree with @niran that it feels a bit forced to use BIP44 (or BIP32 for that matter) with token addresses.  One important point which wasn't raised so far is the [node discovery ability of BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki#Account_discovery).  I think that is one of the reasons it is structured as is.\n\nFully BIP44 compliant wallets are capable to discover all currently used derived nodes with a simple algorithm from the seed (i.e. someone recovering their wallet don't need to remember anything bar the mnemonic).  This is a really good feature from a users' perspective.\n\nThis won't be possible when using paths as described above. This may also suggest that BIP32/BIP44 is not the right answer?\n",

BIP 43 asserts that the first segment defines what the rest of the path means and BIP 44 defines what the path means if the first segment is `44'`.  If you are going to do _anything_ other than straight BIP 44 then pick another `purpose`.  I fully support picking a new purpose and defining the segments in a way that makes sense for Ethereum.  I am wholeheartedly against using `m/44'/*` where `*` is anything other than a BIP 44 path.\r\n\r\nThe BIP 32 and 43 standards are very amenable to people defining whatever schemes they want and it is well defined how one does this.  Please stick with this so when someone is looking at a path it is very clear what it means, without needing to know context like what chain it is for, what tool it is in, what context the author had when they wrote it, etc.",

I'd be fine with a search through the blockchain like etherscan uses, and for each contract that is found (ordering by time of deployment), they have an additional index. bip44 can then be used with an offset (600,000,000 or so.. whatever works really just something that we can preallocate a few million addresses within for future use in token creation.).\r\n\r\nfirst token contract created on ethereum, ordered by time of creation, is 600,000,000, second is 600,000,001, and so on.\r\n\r\nfirst token contract created on ethereum classic, ordered by time of creation, is 610,000,000, second is 610,000,001, and so on.\r\n\r\nThis would allow for 10 million token contracts to be automatically scanned and appropriately indexed, and incorporated into a master list available to wallets. still following the exact bip44 format.",
