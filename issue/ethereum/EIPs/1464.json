  "body": "Let us canonicalize the references for EIPs. They are inconsistently referred to as EIP-123 and EIP123 in the EIP documentation as well as the EIPs themselves. Another option is EIP 123. \r\n\r\n# Workplan\r\n\r\n- [ ] Decide preferred citation format\r\n- [ ] Update all text that is in the voice of the EIP authors (README, HTML files, EIP-1, etc.)\r\n\r\n# Motivation\r\n\r\nEIPs are much higher visibility than BIPs or PEPs. To reduce reader and community confusion, we should promote a consistent reference to these standards. \r\n\r\nIt is unavoidable that end-users of Ethereum-based systems will be seeing EIP numbers. It will improve the professional image of these projects if we can have these look consistent.\r\n\r\nIn other words, seeing \"You have 5 ERC-20 tokens\" in MetaMask and \"You have 5 ERC20 tokens\" in Etherscan and \"These are ERC 20 tokens\" in the actual specification is less than optimal. \r\n\r\n# Background / data\r\n\r\nEIP is inspired heavily from [BIPS](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips) which draws inspiration from [PEPS](https://github.com/python/peps). Both of those projects refer to proposals like BIP 1234.\r\n\r\nCurrent usage of these words is tracked by Google. \"ERC20\" is a clear winner versus \"ERC-20\" and \"ERC 20\". \r\n\r\nhttps://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&q=%22erc%2020%22,%22erc-20%22,%22erc20%22\r\n\r\nHowever this includes `ERC20`, the slug used in contracts.\r\n",

    "body": "I dislike using ERC20 for the same reason people use 50m, 50W, etc—ERC and 20 are different words (the former is an acronym) and should have a space in between them. ERC-20 and ERC 20 are OK, although ERC-20 is probably less confusing. E.g. in your example, \"These are ERC 20 tokens\", the uninitiated might think \"20 tokens of ERC, whatever ERC means\". Then they might look up ERC and see a [bunch of results](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=ERC&t=ffab&ia=web), none of which are the intended meaning. Generally, not a good experience. FWIW, [Wikipedia consistently uses ERC-20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERC-20).",
