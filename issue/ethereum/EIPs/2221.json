Meta issues can be found in the EIPs repository.\r\n\r\n~The deadline for this will be September (because of an upcoming ETC hardfork) and we're happy to extend this to find ANY other discrepancies to ensure our meta hardfork EIPS are correctly documented!~\r\n\r\nThe deadline will be on 2019-10-15, the eve of the Istanbul hard fork (2019-10-16). Once, completed, the payout will be equally based on how many discrepancies were found (1/5 discrepancies, 1/5 of the reward...).\r\n\r\nNOTE: #2220 does not count",
