  "body": "As a coauthor of EthPM, I fully understand that there is a solution underway for package management and reusability of contracts. But how might one craft a standard library without there being name squatting? This EIP proposes to create \"address ranges\" for standard library interaction for a certain language. \r\n\r\nFor simplicity's sake (and these numbers are arbitrary atm), one could set aside, say, 1000 addresses for utility contracts that we all benefit from in terms of a standard library, for Solidity, probably sitting in the address range 1000-2000. These could be added upon by the development team and by the community with good peer review. For clients a simple JSON file with a binary to address mapping distributed by the language development team should suffice to be distributed to an oracle contract that would then update the binaries on a regular basis. ABI's could be distributed as well via the web3 end from this json. \r\n\r\nPros:\r\n- standard library available on all networks\r\n- growth of community participation in language development\r\n- leads to optimized standards in contracts that consume less gas\r\n- leads to safer contracts and safer development overall\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- Potentially wasteful gaswise on the feeder metrics depending on how these are fed in.\r\n- How do we determine ranges without encroaching on another language's territory?\r\n- Potential for out of control growth of standard contracts in clients.\r\n\r\n",
