  "body": "# Abstract\n\nThis proposal helps prevent correlating transactions to individual ip addresses. It does this by giving clients the ability to broadcast transactions only to their non-neighbor peers.\n# Motivation\n\nA user may wish to broadcast a transaction that cannot be linked to their ip address. However, an attacker can sybil attack a node by generating a node id close to the target. Once an attacker has a similar node id, it becomes a \"neighbor node\". As a neighbor node, it is easier to perform traffic analysis to determine which transactions originated from the target node.\n# Design\n\nAdds two rpc methods `eth_sendTransactionToNonNeighbors` and `eth_sendRawTransactionToNonNeighbors`. These methods mirror `eth_sendTransaction` and `eth_sendRawTransaction`, however they only broadcast to non-neighboring nodes only.\n",
