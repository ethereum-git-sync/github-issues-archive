    "body": "@rekmarks thanks for bringing this to attention!\r\n\r\nI strongly oppose removing the spelling checker. The quality of EIPs are already quite low in this repository and the spell check has caught countless annoying misspellings.\r\n\r\nThis is the first time codespell was updated upstream (in 2+ years) and I think anyone who is bothered by this could have filed a PR fixing the above few cases. Alternatively it would be possible to lock down a specific version to avoid this in the future.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, I spent ~5 mins to create the PR closing this issue: #2683",
