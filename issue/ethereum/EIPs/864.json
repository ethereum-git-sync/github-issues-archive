  "body": "For our project we are exploring the need to have divisible non-fungible tokens, or in other words, shared ownership over a non-fungible token.\r\n\r\nAt first we thought about using the ERC-721, but it was illogical to have someone considered as the sole owner of a token when in fact he/she could only have a percentage of that token.\r\n\r\nSo the idea is that each unique, non-fungible token can be separated to equal, similar, fungible parts. \r\n\r\nAn example for this idea would be a smart contract that track multiple startups and the equity of their founders. While a startup could have multiple co-founders, none of them could be considered as the sole owner of the startup.\r\n\r\nLooking at things backwards, NFTs as they stand now are NFTs with a percentage of ownership locked at 100% (a divisibility of 1). \r\n\r\n[I wrote a basic quick example of an implementation for this type of tokens. It only contains a mint function and a transfer function that allows an owner to move some parts of a token to another address.](https://github.com/devzl/divisibleNFTs/blob/master/contracts/ExampleDivisibleNFTs.sol)\r\n\r\nI'm unsure how many real world projects will have this need and if it should become a standard, so your feedback is more than welcome.\r\n\r\n_Note:_\r\nIn our case we want the parts to be fungible, but one can think of use cases where there is a need to separate a token like a puzzle of non-fungible parts, that use case is not what we seek in this proposition.",

    "body": "After thinking about it more thoroughly and having a discussion over [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethdev/comments/7uk605/exploring_the_need_to_have_divisible_nonfungible/), I think it will be totally possible to have divisible NFTs while the contract is #721 compliant. \r\n\r\nThe tradeoff will be to consider the owner who has the biggest % as the \"ownerOf()\" the token, and if there are multiple owners who have equal shares, we will consider the last one among them who held the largest part of shares. Of course, on the side, we will make a more precise function available that shows the exact share of an owner. \r\n\r\nThe basic \"balanceOf()\" function will show how many tokens an owner has shares of, while another new function will show exactly the share of a, if not all the tokens he owns.\r\n\r\nFor the transfer function, the ERC-721 compliant one will transfer all the shares of an owner, while another one will allow to choose the exact % of shares to transfer.\r\n\r\nNow, as to if this use case should become a standard, it will depend largely about how many other projects have the need of shared ownership over NFTs.\r\n\r\n",

The fractional, fungible part that represents shares in the NFT can be implemented as a fixed cap ERC20, so that the shares in the token can be traded on existing exchange infrastructure.",
