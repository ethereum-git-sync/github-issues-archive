  "body": "# Abstract\r\n\r\nA new opcode is added, `ISBLOCKHASH`.\r\n\r\nInputs:\r\n1. A block number\r\n2. A block hash\r\n3. The start, and...\r\n4. length of memory addresses for a Merkle proof\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n* 1 if the given block hash is the block hash for the given block number, utilizing the given Merkle proof\r\n\r\n# Motivation\r\n\r\nBlock hashes are an important source of randomness in Ethereum in COMMIT-REVEAL schemes. The BLOCKHASH function only provides the recent 256 hashes. This limits applications to being useful only under a COMMIT-REVEAL timespan of 60 ~minutes.\r\n\r\nThis proposal allows to get block hashes using O(LOG(N)) node storage and O(LOG(N)) computation, which is billed appropriately.\r\n\r\nBlock hashes can make arbitrary guarantees on security if used in a commit-reveal scheme.\r\n\r\nExample coin flipping implementation:\r\n\r\n1. COMMIT to accept any outcome that is available at `X`, 6 blocks from now.\r\n2. REVEAL result of `H[X]%2` + `H[X-1]%2` + `H[X-2]%2` + `H[X-3]%2` + `H[X-4]%2` + `H[X-5]%2`\r\n3. If the result is greater than or equal to 3, heads; otherwise, tails\r\n\r\nThis can be particularly useful not just for simple smart contracts, but also for rollups, chains and other layer 2 solutions.\r\n\r\n# Specification\r\n\r\nThe BlockHashMerkleRoot shall be a function of two parameters: `firstBlock` and `lastBlock`:\r\n  1. The function shall be defined (informally) if and only if `firstBlock` \"ends in zeros\" and `lastBlock` \"ends in ones\", having the same prefix\r\n  2. The function shall be defined (formally) if and only if:\r\n    2. The exclusive-or of `firstBlock` and `lastBlock` plus one is a power of two;\r\n    3. The exclusive-or of `firstBlock` and `lastBlock`, bitwise-anded with `firstBlock`, plus one, is a power of two\r\n  3. If `firstBlock` and `lastBlock` are the same, the result shall be the block hash of `firstBlock`;\r\n  4. ElseIf `firstBlock` and `lastBlock` differ by one, the result shall be `keccak(block hash of `firstBlock`, block hash of `lastBlock`)\r\n  5. Otherwise, the result shall be `keccak()... // define this\r\n\r\nClients shall record BlockHashMerkleRoots for all block numbers that // need good specification here\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nNotes on an append-only Merkle tree https://github.com/EYBlockchain/nightfall_3/blob/master/nightfall-deployer/contracts/MerkleTree_Stateless.sol\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\nClients shall encode a root hash of merkle tree of each blockhashes in each block. (Future blocks have a \"hash\" of zero in this tree.) This costs LOG(N) storage to recalculate an append-only binary structure that is summarized in a merkle root.\r\n\r\nGas cost:\r\n\r\nCost is proportional to the proof length plus a constant.",
