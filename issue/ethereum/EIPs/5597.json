  "body": "### Proposed Change\r\n\r\nDear editors, here is an [example of comment](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/5593/files#r962979171) that I like to suggest against:\r\n\r\n> No external links\r\n\r\nThere is nothing personal, I am just trying to voice suggestion against such editorial practice.\r\n\r\nI suggest EIP editors avoid leaving a simple comment like this above, especially towards new authors who don't necessarily know how to challenge editorial comment. \r\n\r\nPlease note that, per \r\nEIP-1 shows the current policy in EIP-1\r\n> Links to external resources SHOULD NOT be included. External resources may disappear, move, or change unexpectedly.\r\n\r\nWhich is \"SHOULD NOT\" but not \"MUST NOT\" pursuant to RFC 2729\r\nPlease kindly allow authors to understand it's ok for them to include links when necessary given the current policy.\r\n\r\nI am making it a EIP issue so I can easily reference in other of my comments.\r\n\r\nI also think it's good for an Editor to set a good example about following EIP-1, and about understanding of \"SHOULD\" vs \"MUST\" in their editorial contributions\r\n\r\nFYI: @axic, @Pandapip1,  @gcolvin, @lightclient, @SamWilsn if my understanding of the current policy is incorrect.",

    "body": "Here's an argument to advocate for the less restrictive approach. \r\n\r\nI think there's major advantages to being able to reference other works externally and my interpretation of SHOULD NOT was that unless there's good reason to externally link, such as to reference another spec that's being normatively linked to, then it \"should not\" be done.\r\n\r\nIf the intent is to never externally link then this language should probably be updated to \"MUST NOT\".\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, I think should not is the right call here if you're intending to standardize technical specifications. I believe this is the intent with something like \"standards track\" available.\r\n\r\nMany organizations like ISO/NIST/W3C/IRTF/IETF/OASIS are able to achieve good practices of linking as well for standards too, so I don't believe this is an impossible task.\r\n\r\nWith those considerations in mind, I would say there's good intention that this repository is not meant to contribute proprietary designs, IP encumbered material to create moats for for profit companies, or turn it into a thinly veiled sales tactic for companies to design a piece of technology and promote it through EIP standards. That kind of defeats the purpose of a standard in the first place.\r\n\r\nSo I do believe there should be limitations here, but I don't think saying no links strikes the right balance here.\r\n\r\nHere's some ideas of how we might be able to solve this.\r\n\r\n1. Use reference links so it's easier to spot broken links\r\n\r\n2. Allow a select set of URLs that can be trusted to maintain documents for long periods of time like SDOs to be linked.\r\n\r\n3. otherwise require the web page to be snapshot and linked through the internet archive time machine or pinned to IPFS maybe.",

    "body": "@SamWilsn @lightclient was just listening to [EIPIP call](https://youtu.be/JKsUrL0VOxU?list=PL4cwHXAawZxpLrRIkDlBjDUUrGgF91pQw&t=1142) on this topic. Based on the definition in RFC 2119 which is pretty clear about [SHOULD NOT](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119#section-4) it states:\r\n\r\n> This phrase, or the phrase \"NOT RECOMMENDED\" mean that\r\n   there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the\r\n   particular behavior is acceptable or even useful, but the full\r\n   implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed\r\n   before implementing any behavior described with this label.\r\n   \r\nMy argument for this would be that linking to normative specifications is a \"valid reason in [this] particular circumstance when the particular behavior is acceptable or even useful\" because it allows us to be able to directly reference another specification that normatively defines a specific definition or feature so that it doesn't have to be redefined. In the case of W3C here's how they define what can be normatively linked here: https://www.w3.org/2013/09/normative-references\r\n\r\nI'd like to make the argument that normative references (e.g. references that directly impact usage of RFC 2119 and meet the quality defined by W3C) meet the exception case where external links are valid and should be allowed assuming it meets the guidelines defined by W3C. This is so EIP editors don't have to define these themselves. This process has worked quite well for W3C so no point redoing what's already been done IMO.\r\n\r\nIf the case for this is that it should never be done than I believe EIP-1 needs to be updated to [MUST NOT](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119#section-2) which more explicitly aligns with the expectations it sounds like the EIP editors have set.\r\n\r\ncc @MicahZoltu as well since it sounds like from #4335 that you've had strong opinions on this as well.",
