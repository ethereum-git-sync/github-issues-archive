  "body": "### Proposed Change\n\n# Reassess the usage of Public Domain - Creative Commons Zero \r\n\r\nThe public domain license used by EIP's has always irked me for a few reasons, however now that there is a separation of EIP and ERC's, I think a re-consideration of the public domain by default for ERC's should be re-examined (maybe even for certain EIPs as well?).\r\n\r\n[Community Specification License](https://github.com/CommunitySpecification/Community_Specification/blob/main/1._Community_Specification_License-v1.md)\r\n\r\nI am **NOT** endorsing adopting this license verbatim. I only reference it as an example of an alternative (that to be honest, is more geared towards Apache Foundation style OSS than Ethereum ecosystem). \r\n\r\n\r\n### Copyright Attribution\r\n\r\n>  Copyright Attribution. As a condition, anyone exercising this copyright license must include attribution to the Working Group in any derivative work based on materials developed by the Working Group. That attribution must include, at minimum, the materialâ€™s name, version number, and source from where the materials were retrieved. Attribution is not required for implementations of the Specification.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Promotion \r\n\r\n> Neither the name of Ethereum Foundation (Zug) nor the names of its contributors\r\nmay be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software\r\nwithout specific prior written permission.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Representation of specifications should explicitly be 'AS IS'\r\n\r\n```\r\nTHIS DOCUMENT IS PROVIDED \"AS IS,\" AND COPYRIGHT HOLDERS MAKE NO\r\nREPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED\r\nTO, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,\r\nNON-INFRINGEMENT, OR TITLE; THAT THE CONTENTS OF THE DOCUMENT ARE SUITABLE FOR\r\nANY PURPOSE; NOR THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SUCH CONTENTS WILL NOT INFRINGE\r\nANY THIRD PARTY PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS OR OTHER RIGHTS.\r\n\r\nCOPYRIGHT HOLDERS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL OR\r\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF ANY USE OF THE DOCUMENT OR THE\r\nPERFORMANCE OR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONTENTS THEREOF.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Larger Works\r\n\r\n[The inclusion of a Larger Works concept facilitates use of a contributor license agreement (CLA), with contributors granting a patent license to the works to which they're contributing, and therefore creating a common & safe platform for collaboration where no one is going to assert infringement by the same project in which they're an active participant.](https://oss.oracle.com/licenses/upl/#faq:~:text=Return%20to%20FAQ.-,What%20goes%20in%20the%20Larger%20Works%20file%20and%20what%20should%20it%20look%20like%3F,-To%20begin%20with)\r\n\r\nThis may be irrelevant, but I mention it anyway, as example code should be licensed and not put in the public domain. I think UPL would be a viable option in that respect. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Stated Security and Defects Policy\r\n\r\nCurrently, there is no security policy. Should an EIP or ERC have such a defect, wat do? I have emailed personally the EF before about a security issue and never gotten a response, though it may have been 'out of scope'.[^1]\r\n\r\n\r\n## One more thing...\r\n\r\n*No Attorney-Client Relationship*\r\n\r\nNeither the availability, operation, transmission, receipt nor use of these suggestions is intended to create, nor does it create, an attorney-client relationship or any other relationship.
