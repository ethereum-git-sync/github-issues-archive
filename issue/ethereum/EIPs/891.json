  "body": "## Preamble\r\n\r\n    ERC: 891\r\n    Title: Mineable Distribution Layer\r\n    Author: Oscar Fonseca - hiro@cehh.io\r\n    Type: ERC\r\n    Status: Draft\r\n    Created: 2018-02-20\r\n    Requires: ERC20\r\n\r\n\r\n## Simple Summary\r\nThe objective of ERC891 is to give developers an alternative method to distribute ERC20 tokens. \r\n\r\n## Abstract\r\nThe ERC891 provides an extension for ERC20 tokens that adds an interface for distribution. ERC20 tokens are often distributed via auctioning or airdrop, both of which fueled a bubble during 2017 and empowered exit scammers. With ERC891, the distribution model can be adjusted between the traditional ICO model and fully decentralized, PoW distribution.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nThe traditional ICO model has brought problems that have damaged the blockchain ecosystem. The [latest statistic](https://www.coindesk.com/over-half-of-icos-fail-within-4-months-suggests-us-study/) was that more than half of the ICO projects are doomed. From the point of view of blockchain users, restoring trust in distribution is vital for adoption. While we know that the ledger's transactions are trustless, DApps and adoption do require it.\r\n\r\n## Specification & Methods\r\nThe ERC891 extends the ERC20 token.\r\n\r\n### Extension Methods for ERC891\r\n\r\n**checkReward**\r\n```javascript\r\nfunction checkReward(address) view public returns(uint256);\r\n```\r\nGet the potential reward for address.\r\n\r\n**claim**\r\n```javascript\r\nfunction claim() public;\r\n```\r\nSend the transaction that will make the balance of the token effective at address of the amount returned by `checkReward()`.\r\n\r\n**claimWithSignature**\r\n```javascript\r\nfunction claimWithSignature(bytes _sig) public;\r\n```\r\nSubmit a transaction signed by an `address  a` in order to claim `a`'s balance into `msg.sender`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Notes on Reward Functions\r\n\r\nThe axis of ERC891 is the `claim` method. There are several consideration when deciding how to design both `mine` and `checkReward`.\r\n\r\n1. Each address should be mineable once. This is simple to achieve with a `mapping(address => bool) mined` contract variable.\r\n\r\n2. The `claim()` function should be predictable in gas prices. This allows miner to systematically know how much ETH is needed to complete the mining cycle.\r\n\r\n3. The `checkReward()` function should be only a function of the address and the total supply. The current sample implementation obtains the reward amount with\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nfunction checkReward(address) view public returns(uint256){\r\n  return uint256(bytes20(a) & 255);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nthus distributing reward amounts uniformly between 0 and 255 units. However, developers may opt to \"increase\" difficulty by implementing a function such as \r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nfunction checkReward(address a) view public returns(uint256){\r\n  return uint256(bytes20(a) & 255) == 0 ? fixedReward : 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nin which the reward becomes `fixedReward` but is found only with a probability of 1/255. Finally, developers may choose to limit the supply by defining the reward function as \r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nfunction checkReward(address a) view public returns(uint256){\r\n  return (maxSupply - totalSupply_) >= uint256(bytes20(a) & maxSupply) ? fixedReward : 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn order to move closer to the traditional ICO scheme, `checkReward()` could look like the following examples:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nfunction checkReward(address a) view public returns(uint256){\r\n  return msg.value * multiplier;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nfunction checkReward(address a) view public returns(uint256){\r\n  return isPatreon(a) ? uint256(bytes20(a) & 255) : uint256(bytes20(a) & 255) * 10;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Why is this pseudo? Isn't this just normal proof of work but instead of generating tons of hashes and checking if they win something I generate tons of private keys and check if the corresponding address wins something. \r\nA user that uses this transparently has no chance of keeping up with users that know that this token is minable so it makes nearly zero sense to call mine implicitly from check balance and transfer.  Because either the user has a real chance of getting something with a few addresses in that case so many tokens will get minted that a huge inflation takes place or the user chance is so small that it is not worth the extra gas paid for the mine() function.\r\nDo I miss something?",

    "body": "It is true that a \"normal\" (compared to a miner) user will be at a disadvantage compared to miners, but that isn't a problem. Look at Bitcoin or Ethereum. If anything, it makes the system more even because, even without mining pools, users can get tokens.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the transparency is that all the existing interfaces don't need to add special cases or update to make a transition. Normal users will simply see an airdrop to their addresses.\r\n\r\nAddressing the huge inflation, that is up to the developer. As explained at the end of the proposal, the `checkReward` function can make the necessary adjustments to cover the developers' needs. If value is the priority, then a function like the last one is more fitting. If a low entry barrier is preferred, the developers may opt to use the first example.\r\n\r\nSince the objective is not to make people rich, but to make a port of PoW to token space, this covers the basics. I called it PPoW and not PoW because PoW already has an implicit reference to blockchain hashing PoW. The addition of pseudo is to make clear that PPoW does not create a blockchain.",

The only advantage I can see on using PoW for a token distribution is if somehow the algorithm is designed so it's feasible to mine on consumer desktops, not GPU or ASIC farms. The Monero algorithm, for instance has been so successful on that front that it's sometimes used as a replacement for ads in websites. I'm still not convinced the \"crypto miner.js\" revenue model will work at scale but it's interesting to see people experiment with random token distributions.\r\n\r\nThis \"pseudo\" proof of work is just favoring traditional ASIC farms, as you basically need to generate addresses until you find some with rewards on them.

If some people will make them anyway, allowing bundle mining would reduce electricity wasting in the big picture.\r\n\r\n@flygoing I think mint-on-demand tokens already exist. However, there is the question of where the paid ETH goes and also doesn't address what I described above: migrating polluting chains for bundle mining.\r\n\r\n@tawaren Users would only lose money if they haven't actually claimed their balance. Once claimed they won't lose it.\r\n\r\n@Arachnid It's an airdrop for existing and future users and a PPoW token for people who want to mine. Once again, this isn't meant to solve the distribution problem, but the big picture of the blockchain ecosystem.\r\n\r\nI think we are all aware of the limitations of tokens compared to standalone blockchains. I think that extending token capabilities would be beneficial in the long run. While this implementation is far from perfect and doesn't solve the identity problem, I hope it works as a starting point that will motivate further development of this concept. In general I don't think many people will switch to PoS because of their views.\r\nPPoW would offer a middle ground. The miner base already exists on launch, and a new chain wouldn't double the electricity spending. This benefit would be more noticeable as more chains migrate to ERC 891. This doesn't aim to be the last step of this development, but a starting point to motive this research.",

Those coins could easily be implemented as ERC20 on the Ethereum blockchain, but that means that extra electricity doesn't need to be spent to secure them. What @alexvandesande suggested with just rewarding the miner of a block with the tokens would make a ton more sense as an EIP.

Perhaps just have the following:\r\n\r\n- `claimReward(bytes)` - for contracts that require data for verification\r\n- `claimReward()` - for contracts that just depend on internals/msg.sender\r\n- `checkReward(bytes)` - constant function for checking reward of a given blob (to match `claimReward(bytes)`)\r\n- `checkReward()` - constant function for checking reward related to internals/msg.sender (to match `claimReward()`)\r\n\r\nThese allow both the wasteful PPoW you suggest and what I essentially see as \"merged mining\" that @alexvandesande suggests, as well as really any other method of token distribution.",

    "body": "@flygoing That's something I can agree with. I started with PPoW because I don't think these altchains care about securing their network more than just playing the PoW game. Showing a middle ground \"neither you nor me\" could help to make them jump over. However, as you mentioned, this can be easily extended to create a non-ICO and non-airdrop distribution system. Especially with regulations starting to loom over the ICO space, new distribution systems will have to emerge. As you've noticed, some people have opted to simply make forks left and right.\r\n\r\nI am not a miner, but the miners I know won't stop mining just because coins adopt PoS. The invested capital is already there, and they will be highly reluctant to just sell and give up their income. If you really want to curb this growth hashrate growth you need to really make tokenization more attractive. Reducing relative profitability of other coins and reducing their prevalence should in the long run curb hashrate growth. Those GPUs and ASICs won't sit idle because, as you know, every minute they aren't mining they are losing money.\r\n\r\nPPoW could allow a smoother transition tokenization. Think of it as giving miners a transition period. Your suggestion to merge the proposals is probably worthy of being an EIP of its own. I don't know if you want to write it or you don't mind if I elaborate on it. Keep in mind that these ideas are happening as we speak: 1) current token distribution methods like ICO and airdrops are becoming unpopular due to regulations and reputation and 2) miners won't suddenly care about the environment and sell their mining rigs. Enable a smooth transition towards tokenization and the wastefulness might actually disappear over time.\r\n\r\nIf the security and viability of ERC 891 is not a problem, I would keep pushing it not because of its current impact but of its bridging capabilities. I don't mind making the generalized version you described.",

    "body": "I believe the amount of new chains (ignoring forks that are forking just as a cash grab) are creating their own chains for a good purpose. Many new chains are either trying to do what Ethereum does, but better, so they can't really just be built on top of Ethereum, and thus they need their own consensus protocol, of which PoW is usually the easiest choice.\r\n\r\n> I  am not a miner, but the miners I know won't stop mining just because coins adopt PoS. The invested capital is already there, and they will be highly reluctant to just sell and give up their income\r\n\r\nI don't disagree. Coins like Bitcoin that are very reliant on ASICs likely will never leave PoW. It's just so ingrained in their ecosystem. Those miners likely wont have to worry about doing something else with their PoW. GPU mining, on the other hand, will slowly die as there are less chains that are GPU minable (either because they switch to PoS or ASICs are developed for it).\r\n\r\nMiners get a mining reward *because* they're securing the network. The dilution of tokens is (most of) how the people using the network pay the miners for their service. If the mining has no purpose like this, then the reward for mining is going to be far less. Since the value of this mining is so much lower, there will be far lower demand for miners, and there just wont be enough value for all the GPUs that are abandoned from useful chain-mining.\r\n\r\n> PPoW could allow a smoother transition tokenization. Think of it as giving miners a transition period\r\n\r\nI think as GPUs are slowly outdated by ASICs and by chains just switching from PoW, the transition will be fairly natural anyway. It's not like one day all GPU chains will cease to exist. Note that, if there is success, projects like Golem will give great alternative uses for GPUs.\r\n\r\n> Your suggestion to merge the proposals is probably worthy of being an EIP of its own. I don't know if you want to write it or you don't mind if I elaborate on it. Keep in mind that these ideas are happening as we speak: 1) current token distribution methods like ICO and airdrops are becoming unpopular due to regulations and reputation and 2) miners won't suddenly care about the environment and sell their mining rigs. Enable a smooth transition towards tokenization and the wastefulness might actually disappear over time.\r\n\r\nFeel free to write it up, I'll come comment on it. I do agree that rewarding miners (and validators once we we get there) is potentially a good way to distribute tokens. I still think that the GPUs will find better uses than pointless mining when they're no longer useful for mining to secure a network.",

Setting up the fundamental pieces to avoid new chains popping up that need to do the reverse hash and secure the network, give those GPUs a home. It also worries me that those GPUs could flood the market. Just as their price rocketed, if/when miners lose profitability on GPUs, gamers will have a party, but the potential wattage spending is still there.\r\nHonestly, if GPU does die out, the actual wattage spending might go down. Which ironically makes ASICs the good guys by killing out GPUs in exchange for the a higher network security for less spending.\r\n\r\nI don't say that mining has no impact in ecology, but mining itself isn't a problem. If there is something to solve, it is [fuel sources](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1229857/How-16-ships-create-pollution-cars-world.html). Not that this concerns Ethereum, but we're taking jabs at the leaves when the root is still fossil fuels.",

    "body": "Hey @OFRBG there is a massive group of blockchainers that believe that tokens should be distributed using Proof of Work so that they are Decentralized and so that we reduce corruption in the blockchain space.   Please join us at https://reddit.com/r/tokenmining\r\n\r\nIf I may add to this discussion, a similar and potentially more finished version of this spec is EIP541 for a decentralized token standard which uses PoW to make it decentralized.  To all of the critics, I see your concern that energy will be wasted.  I hope you are seeing the massive collateral damage that ICOs are causing to the space and I hope you feel ashamed about that.  This is a way to evolve out of that.   Yes energy will be expended.  Yes corruption will be eliminated and we can get rid of ICOs.",
