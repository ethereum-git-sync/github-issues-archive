I hope some people get the idea, and add a feature to EIP1559, or create a new EIP that modifies this one, to prevent simply burning assets.",

Now, I’m no economist, and I admittedly haven’t read enough about this EIP to have an informed decision yet.  And perhaps burning tokens has some value to the platform beyond increased coin price for speculators.  But my first reaction is that it seems wasteful.  If some or all of those base fees could instead be directed into a development fund for the long-term health of the Ethereum ecosystem, and/or donated to various charities for a multitude of benefits, surely that would be preferable?",
