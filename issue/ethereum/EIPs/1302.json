  "body": "hi, guys:\r\n\r\nWhen I go through ERC20, ERC721, ERC223, ERC777.  All are very good proposals.\r\nI have an idea of light weighted improvement over ERC20.\r\n\r\nBasicly, I will keep all ERC20 untouched but borrow the method from ERC721 and only add a safeTransferFrom method and inherit all ERC20. This safeTransferFrom will call something for token receiver something like that in ERC721:\r\n\r\n/**\r\n\t * @dev Internal function to invoke `onERC721Received` on a target address\r\n\t * The call is not executed if the target address is not a contract\r\n\t * @param _from address representing the previous owner of the given token ID\r\n\t * @param _to target address that will receive the tokens\r\n\t * @param _tokenId uint256 ID of the token to be transferred\r\n\t * @param _data bytes optional data to send along with the call\r\n\t * @return whether the call correctly returned the expected magic value\r\n\t */\r\n\tfunction checkAndCallSafeTransfer(\r\n\t\taddress _from,\r\n\t\taddress _to,\r\n\t\tuint256 _tokenId,\r\n\t\tbytes _data\r\n\t)\r\n\tinternal\r\n\treturns(bool)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tif (!_to.isContract()) {\r\n\t\t\treturn true;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\tbytes4 retval = ERC721Receiver(_to).onERC721Received(\r\n\t\t\tmsg.sender, _from, _tokenId, _data);\r\n\t\treturn (retval == ERC721_RECEIVED);\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nI believe this light weighted improvement will solve a lot of problem while keeping it compatible with ERC20.\r\n\r\nThanks for your attention.\r\n\r\nGeorge Wu\r\n\r\n",
