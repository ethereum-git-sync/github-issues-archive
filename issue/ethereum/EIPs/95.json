  "body": "cc @frozeman @obscuren \n### Goal\n\nMake jsonrpc api engine agnostic.\n### Issue.\n\nCurrently jsonrpc methods `eth_getBlockByHash` and `eth_getBlockByNumber` return block objects with field `nonce`. Oddly, the other pow specific param `mixHash` does not exist.\n\n```\nnonce: DATA, 8 Bytes - hash of the generated proof-of-work. null when its pending block.\n```\n\nPoA blocks does not have `nonce` property.\n### Proposed solution\n\nReplace `nonce` field with `seal_fields`. An array containing all engine specific fields.\n\n```\n\"seal_fields\": [\"0x11bbe8db4e347b4e8c937c1c8370e4b5ed33adb3db69cbdb7a38e1e50b1b82fa\", \"0x0000000000000042\"]\n```\n",
