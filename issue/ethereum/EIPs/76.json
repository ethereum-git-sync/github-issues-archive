  "body": "I think it would be important and useful to discuss brain wallets and eventually settle on a method, which can be cross-application.\n\n**Current implementations**\n\nI am aware of three brain wallet implementations:\n- [libethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Brain-Wallet)\n\nRun `sha3` on the seed 16384 times. Then run `sha3` until the first byte of the address is 0 (to be compatible with ICAP Direct).\n- [Ether.Camp](http://live.ether.camp/)\n\nA simple `sha3` over the passphrase.\n- [Quorum](http://quorumwallet.com/)\n\nRequires a passphrase and a userid, both at least 10 characters long. Use the concatenated userid and passphrase as the input to `PBKDF2` with 2000 rounds, 32 bytes key size and `sha256` hashing.\n\n_(Note: the brain wallet part in Quorum is not supposed to have more Ether than what is needed to execute the contracts and therefore it wasn't made to be very complex)_\n\n**Passphrase generation**\n\n@alexvandesande has posted a [nice little tool](http://codepen.io/alexvandesande/pen/mymWEj) to generate memorable passphrases. There are many other dictionary tools.\n\n**A common interface**\n\nIt would be important to define a common key derivation method with the inputs required. These inputs also should have minimum length/strength requirements.\n\nHopefully this can be a start to a discussion to devise such a standard.\n\ncc @alexvandesande @ryancdotorg @romanman @Gustav-Simonsson \n\n**Update**: it seems like we were writing at the same time with @alexvandesande. https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/75 proposes a specific method. \n",
