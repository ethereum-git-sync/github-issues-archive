Multidimensional tokens involve layers of information and functionality, create interdependent curation markets, and give rise to integrated information across networks.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Specification**\r\n_The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Ethereum platforms (cpp-ethereum, go-ethereum, parity, ethereumj, ethereumjs, etc)._\r\n\r\n[Solidity Contract\r\n](https://gist.github.com/troverman/809dba32d8510e7713aaa5c869e607ae)\r\n```javascript\r\nmapping (address => mapping (string => uint)) balances;\r\n\r\nevent Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, string indexed _id, uint256 _value);\r\n\r\nfunction balanceOf(address _owner, string _id) constant returns (uint256 balance) {\r\n     return balances[_owner][_id];\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction transfer(address _to, string _id, uint256 _value) returns (bool success) {\r\n     if (balances[msg.sender][_id] >= _value && _value > 0) {\r\n          balances[msg.sender][_id] -= _value;\r\n          balances[_to][_id] += _value;\r\n          Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _id, _value);\r\n          return true; \r\n     }\r\n     else { revert; }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n> function approve, allowance, transferFrom -- mirror ERC20 → with identifier specification \r\n> utility contracts → specification based on the protocol implementation; \r\n> emergent properties based on identifier-specific logic;\r\n> i.e. vT protocol → viewers mint tokens w their address identifier → permission structures \r\n\r\n**Rationale**\r\n_The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion._\r\n\r\n> → you would need to create infinite ERC20 contracts to equate one ERC88 contract -- allows for scalability of tokenized data structures.\r\n> → allows for emergent properties based on identifier-specific logic and utility contracts to shape protocol implementation i.e. permission structures, token supply.. \r\n\r\n**Backwards Compatibility**\r\n_All EIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The EIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. EIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright._\r\n\r\n> \r\n> One could fork tokens with specified utility contracts\r\n> Sudo-code\r\n> //multiple fxns here; \r\n> //ERC20toERC88 function(ERC20Address, ERC20Amount, ERC88Id, ERC88amount){\r\n> \t//TODO: import contract via ERC20Address\r\n> //balances[msg.sender] -= ERC20Amount;\r\n> //balances[msg.sender][ERC88Id] += ERC88amount;\r\n> //}\r\n> //transferERC20toERC88 -- same as ^^ include address _to \r\n\r\n**Test Cases**\r\n_Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for EIPs that are affecting consensus changes. Other EIPs can choose to include links to test cases if applicable._\r\n\r\n> [bidio, cre8coin, viewToken\r\n> ](https://www.cre8bid.io)",

    "body": "This is pretty interesting. It reminds me of this short lived conversation around Divisible NFTs from a couple weeks ago: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/864.\r\n\r\nThe idea around divisible NFTs is to allow partial ownership of assets, which is pretty powerful. Imagine owning .001% of a van Gogh painting. Have you considered expanding this standard to cover both MDTs as well as DNFTs?\r\n\r\nWhat was the rationality of choosing the type `string` for ` _id` instead of a uint256? If a contract wants to track the MDTs it owns, it would have to store strings, which can be expensive, instead of just storing uint256. My suggestion is changing _id to a uint256 and including the `tokenMetadata` lookup to get data about the token. This would make it more compatible with also being a standard for DNFTs as well.",
