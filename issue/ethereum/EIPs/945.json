  "body": "## Preamble\r\n\r\n```\r\nEIP: <to be assigned>\r\nTitle: Web 3 QR Code Scanning API\r\nAuthor: Peter Jihoon Kim <pete@cipherbrowser.com>\r\nType: Standard Track\r\nCategory: ERC\r\nStatus: Draft / Discussion\r\nCreated: 2018-03-24\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Simple Summary\r\n\r\nThis Web 3 API makes it possible for Web3 DApps to scan QR Codes.\r\n\r\n## Abstract\r\n\r\nThe browser implementing this API should present a dialog to scan the QR code and return a promise that resolves when a QR-code is successfully scanned. The API looks for QR codes containing Ethereum addresses by default, but optionally takes in a regular expression object as an argument to allow for scanning arbitrary text.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nEntering lengthy strings of text such as Ethereum addresses is difficult and error-prone, especially on mobile devices.\r\n\r\n### Example Use Cases\r\n\r\n* A DApp that can needs to scan Ethereum addresses\r\n* An event-ticketing DApp that lets people check in by scanning tickets\r\n* An airdrop DApp that allows people to redeem tokens by scanning vouchers\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nscanQRCode(match?: RegExp): Promise<string>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Experimental Implementation\r\n\r\n[Cipher Browser](https://www.cipherbrowser.com/) 1.3.3 and above (available on both Google Play and iOS App Store) have an experimental QR code scanning API for Web 3 DApps. In Cipher's current implementation, the API resides within the `window.web3.currentProvider` object, but something like `window.web3Ext.scanQRCode()` might be better. Please make suggestions.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nwindow.web3.currentProvider.scanQRCode(match?: RegExp): Promise<string>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\n### Example 1 (Scan Ethereum Addresses): \r\n```javascript\r\nwindow.web3.currentProvider\r\n  .scanQRCode()\r\n  .then(data => {\r\n    console.log('QR Scanned:', data)\r\n  })\r\n  .catch(err => {\r\n    console.log('Error:', err)\r\n  })\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Example 2 (Scan custom text):\r\n```javascript\r\nwindow.web3.currentProvider\r\n  .scanQRCode(/^mydapp:.+$/)\r\n  .then(data => {\r\n    console.log('QR Scanned:', data)\r\n  })\r\n  .catch(err => {\r\n    console.log('Error:', err)\r\n  })\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Links\r\n\r\n* [Demo Video (YouTube)](https://youtu.be/XRrsrFofEic)\r\n* [Example DApp, usable on Cipher Browser >=1.3.3](https://cipher-qr-scan.netlify.com/) [(Source)](https://github.com/petejkim/cipher-qr-scan-test)\r\n\r\n## Revisions\r\n\r\n* 2018/03/24: Initial Draft + Experimental Implementation in Cipher Browser\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\n\r\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

    "body": "Great idea,\r\nI agree though that it should not be in web3.currentProvider \r\nMaybe it could be in web3.ext or something to keep everyting in the web3 object but allowing extension\r\n\r\nregarding naming and default behavior :\r\nI think the default behavior should be scanning any data as opposed to ethereum address\r\nWe could add a function scanEthereumAddressQR or scanEthereumDataQR for having the method check for validity following https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/681\r\n\r\n@vikmeup I like that. It is better than testing for the existence of the function. Any reason why make it a promise ? is it because ensuring there is a camera can be asynchronous ? \r\nMaking it a boolean would make it backward compatible with web3 browser that do not support it since they would return undefined. I would call it \"isScanQRSupported\" since it could be unavailable if the video stream is blocked by another app and not because it is not supported by the web3 browser itself\r\nAnd If we have to deal with camera not being available, we could deal with it in the error\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "I've implemented QR code reading for game matching in https://cryptogs.io and it works for both Cipher Browser and Trust Wallet. I wanted to answer @vikmeup on why a Dapp would ever want to have this functionality:\r\nIt's really nice to have as a call to action to suggest to users that _now_ is the time to use the scanner. \r\n\r\nFor instance, in my app, when the user gets to the point where she can create a new game or join an existing one, in Cipher there is a nice QR code icon indicating that they can click it to join a game via QR code.\r\n\r\nOf course, the user can pull the QR code reader down in the Trust Wallet menu system and it works there too, but it's just nice to be able to signal to a user *when* they should use the QR code reader. \r\n\r\nWhy not have the QR reader in your native menu system, but also build in scanQRCode()?\r\n\r\nProps to both @petejkim and @vikmeup for moving fast on this, I'm already using it and it's great.

    "body": "I'm not sure I understand the scenario here. **Apps should not care how their requested transaction is completed* only that it is completed. As such, an app should not care that something will be shown as a QR code or sent via private api. In my opinion the correct way should be:\r\n\r\n* An app makes a web3 request\r\n\r\nor..\r\n\r\n* An app calls an ethereum payment link https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/681\r\n\r\nThen the the browser will open the transaction window. In that window it can either show a direct payment option (if the browser has funds) OR it can add an option to show it as a QR Code, or any other format it so desires.",
