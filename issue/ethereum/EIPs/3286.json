We want to provide standard interfaces and processes for safe, conditional transactions based on user predefined timestamps. It would enable users to secure their accounts from lockout after account activity ceased for a predefining fallback address to transfer the funds. \r\n\r\nAs we are planning to submit an ERC standard proposal for it I would love to hear your thoughts on it and if you know about similar attempts from the past?
