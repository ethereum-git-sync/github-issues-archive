It finds the private key associated with `tx.from`, tries do decrypt it with the given password, signs the transaction and zero's the key, all in the context of a RPC call.\n\nI also don't like `personal_sendAuthenticatedTransaction`. When I see this name I assume that it accepts an already signed transaction just like `eth_sendRawTransaction`. \n\nAs a disadvantage for `personal_signAndSendTransaction`:\n\n> Is not distinct enough from eth_sendTransaction, as this one is signing also, just not unlocking the account first (it has to be unlocked)\n\n`personal_sendAuthenticatedTransaction` is not very different either?\n\nPersonally I don't think that there is anything wrong with `personal_signAndSendTransaction` and would opt for that name.\n",

Let's consider geth - Mist architecture. geth keeps password protected accounts, but it cannot show up a popup out of nowhere asking for a password on top of Mist UI.\n\nIf passing a password in JSON RPC is the issue, maybe we can use some better authorisation scheme. I only know there exist authorisation schemes where a server challenges a client with a puzzle that can be solved only if the client knows the password. Password is not revealed, the challenge is changed every session. I'm not able to name nor explain how it works, any help here?\n\nBringing that to our JSON RPC protocol, we could keep `eth_sendTransaction` request as it is, but in the response a node should give the user a challenge. The user should send another request with the answer.\n",

    "body": "I agree that `eth_sendTransaction` should remain as is.\n\nThe problem is that nodes currently encrypt the private key's with the password and need to have it in order to decrypt the private key that is used to sign the transaction. A challenge response system would not allow for the secure exchange of the password.\n\nIn the past I have thought of something like \"geth-agents\". When the node starts you can give it an agent endpoint. The node will connect to this endpoint and forwards (unsigned) transactions to it. The agent asks the user for the password if necessary, sends the signed transaction back to the node which broadcasts it onto the network. In that way the node doesn't need account management and anyone can write a custom agent suitable for their needs. For example, Mist can also act as an agent if it starts geth in the background. But this will break the current `eth_sendTransaction` since it can take some time before the transaction is signed.\n",

    "body": "1. `personal_sendTransaction` sounds like the best idea\n2. This was never meant to be used widely by developers. I only put this here to be discussed, so that we make sure we include something were we at least agree on a good name. But its more a function used by local dapps.\n3. I fully expect key signing to be outside of geth or any node, be it in the dapp itself, javascript, or a key management agent\n\nSo i would rather focus here on the name, and i prefer `personal_sendTransaction` , as  through the `personal_` namespace, makes sense that it has a added password.\n\nThe whole, \"how and where to sign\" discussion, and as @bas-vk says we were thinking already about that since a while, needs to take place in its own ERC.\n\nfor now its still in geth, but we should warn people when using this `personal_sendTransaction` endpoint that it is insecure over HTTP, or not even allow it there by default. I could also include a `console.warn` to make sure developers read and understand that.\n\nIn the future only `eth_sendRawTransaction` should be used (which i would rename to `eth_sendSignedTransaction`)\n",
