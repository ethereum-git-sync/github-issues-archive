  "body": "## Summary\r\nWe propose an operating system protocol for establishing policies and restrictions in Ethereum smart contracts within a machine-readable format. Our unique approach allows users to independently verify whether the policies of a governance system or an ICO are enforced without relying on manual code checking or 3rd party developers to trust.\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\nPlease see our whitepaper for more details, which is included in our [repo](https://github.com/daolab/beaker-whitepaper). Available here as well: [https://beakeros.org/docs/Whitepaper.pdf](https://beakeros.org/docs/Whitepaper.pdf)\r\n\r\n## Proof of Concept\r\nOur current work on the alpha evm implementation is available here: https://github.com/daolab/beakeros\r\n\r\n## Goals\r\n* Get validation for an ERC Proposal from the community\r\n* Convert whitepaper to an community supported ERC\r\n* Develop a BeakerOS Kernel Implementation\r\n* Develop a BeakerOS-CLI for developing, deploying and verifying smart contracts \r\n* Develop a Formal Specification and Yellowpaper\r\n",
