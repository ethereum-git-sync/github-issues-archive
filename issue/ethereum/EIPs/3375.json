  "body": "Hello everyone !\r\nIssue as a thread for discussion. ..\r\nI'm wondering if there is an existing  EIP that can provide shared ownership and divisibility of an NFT. \r\nHere is an example : \r\nConsider two people (person A and person B) who both own the same piece of land (which in my opinion can be considered as an NFT since it \"respects\" almost all the standards that define and NFT such as scarcity and uniqueness ). \r\nConsider now person A want to sell a part of their share in the piece of land. Is there an existing ERC standard that  combines all of these requirements ? \r\n",
