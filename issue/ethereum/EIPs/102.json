  "body": "### Parameters\n- `METROPOLIS_FORK_BLKNUM`: TBA\n- `GECADD`: 200\n- `GECMUL`: 1000\n### Specification\n\nAdds a precompile at address `0x0000....0a` which accepts as input 224 bytes that it interprets as `[x1, y1, x2, y2, P, A, B]` (if less than 224 bytes are provided the remaining bytes are assumed to be zero, if more than 224 bytes are provided they are ignored). Throws if `(x1, y1)` or `(x2, y2)` are not on the curve defined by `(P, A, B)` (ie. `x**3+A*x+B-y**2` is not a multiple of `P`), otherwise returns 64 bytes representing the elliptic curve addition `(x1, y1) + (x2, y2)` on that curve.\n\nAdds a precompile at address `0x0000....0b` which accepts as input192 bytes that it interprets as `[x, y, n, P, A, B]` (if less than 192 bytes are provided the remaining bytes are assumed to be zero, if more than 192 bytes are provided they are ignored). Throws if `(x1, y1)` is not on the curve defined by `(P, A, B)` (ie. `x**3+A*x+B-y**2` is not a multiple of `P`), otherwise returns 64 bytes representing the elliptic curve multiplication `(x1, y1) * n` on that curve.\n### Rationale\n\nAllows for the efficient application of ring signatures and other cryptography based on elliptic curves. Currently, an secp256k1-focused implementation of these operations (see https://github.com/ethereum/serpent/blob/develop/examples/ecc/jacobian_arith.se ) takes ~200k gas for a multiply, ~750k gas for an ecrecover and ~900k gas per linkable ring signature participant, which is unacceptably high.\n",

Are the functions included in the secp256k1 library?\n\nNot sure, especially with the curve generalization.\n",
