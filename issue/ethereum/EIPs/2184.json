  "body": "Proposal: add a new JSON-RPC method to return a session key derived from the ECDH value computed with the combination of one Ethereum private key and one Ethereum public key.\r\n\r\nNonce management would be critical.  We could use an HKDF taking as input the ECDH value, an application ID, the nonces from two recent transactions that used each key, and a minor-nonce from the application.\r\n\r\nApplications would retain the minor nonce in local storage, but would need to publish a new transaction to the blockchain (such as refreshing an ENS registration) whenever they are re-initialized, and wait for that transaction to clear, before attempting to generate session keys.\r\n\r\nPotential applications include in-browser messaging apps supporting end-to-end encryption.  Each message could be encrypted with a fresh session key that could be recovered by the recipient and used for decryption.  Messages could be exchanged off-chain using whatever mechanism (like leaving them on a Tor hidden server) that would not need to be trusted.\r\n\r\nSoliciting early feedback on the idea before writing the EIP; please let me know what has been done in this area already.\r\n\r\n",
