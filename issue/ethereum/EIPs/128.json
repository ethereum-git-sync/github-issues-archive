  "body": "Currently, contracts have no access to the call stack. Access to callstack size can help with the callstack bound, assuming we don't do https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/114 instead. It can also help avoid re-entrency style bugs by enforcing how many calls deep a contract is willing to be called from (maybe it wants to only accept calls from user accounts), or other access control policies like who the contract 2 up the call stack must be, etc.\n\nIn addition to making contracts potentially more secure, these opcodes can replace ORIGIN and SENDER, as ORIGIN becomes (CALLSTACK 0) and SENDER is (CALLSTACK (- CALLSTACKSIZE 1)).\n",
