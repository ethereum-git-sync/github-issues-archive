  "body": "### Proposed Change\n\neth docs say:\r\n\r\nSharding was on the Ethereum roadmap for a long time, and was once intended to be shipped before The Merge to proof-of-stake. However, the rapid development of layer 2 rollups and the invention of Danksharding (adding blobs of rollup data to Ethereum blocks that can be very efficiently verified by validators) has led the Ethereum community to favour rollup-centric scaling instead of scaling by sharding. This will also help to keep Ethereum's consensus logic simpler.",
