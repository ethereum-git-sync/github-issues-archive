    "body": "Another example, I am reading the EIP page for https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6493 and check the required EIP https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718 and notice that the required EIP-2718 makes no list of Transaction Types like EIP-6493 - should I ask the author @MicahZoltu to update or what? This sort of EIP is esp. important as what is considered 'valid' (meaning recognized by the community, etc). I do not believe there is a requirement on EIP Authors to go back to the required EIP to update its list or how it is handled in the first place absent explicit directive from the EIP itself (maybe @SamWilsn can pls explain).
