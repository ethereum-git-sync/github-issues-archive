But there are other systems out there that use coin type as the sole differentiator, for example ENS' multicoin address lookup.\r\n\r\nI don't think there are any real downsides to having a new coin type, and given keeping the same coin type will definitely cause some issues I think a new coin type might be the safe option.  \r\n\r\nThat said, the coin on both networks is still Ether so perhaps adding a new coin type is semantically incorrect.  As you may tell, I'm undecided on this matter.\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\n",
