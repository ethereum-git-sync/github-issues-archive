  "body": "Geth and other implementations offer the JSON-RPC over various transports, including Unix Domain Sockets and Windows Named Pipes. Clients of the RPC API need to find the socket in order to connect to the API. \n\nI propose that API clients (Mist, web3.js when using node.js, ...) should use the value of the `ETHEREUM_SOCKET` environment variable as the default endpoint to connect to. Doing so creates a convention that makes it easier to interact with Ethereum regardless of the node implementation chosen by the user.\n\nEnvironment variables are a common way to communicate API endpoints. For precedent, consider that ssh agent implementations communicate the location of their socket using the `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` variable. Similarly, dbus-daemon uses `DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS` to communicate its endpoint and software that needs access to dbus fails to launch if this variable is not set. \n\nSetting the variable is left to the user or system administrator. The default can be set through software packaging infrastructure (e.g. using a file in /etc/profile.d on Linux). Advanced init systems like systemd and Apple's launchd also allow setting environment variables in service definitions.\n\nI propose that the value of `ETHEREUM_SOCKET` should be interpreted as follows:\n- If set to a URL string starting with http://, https://, ws:// or wss://, the endpoint should be treated as a URL of the given type.\n- On UNIX-like platforms, values without such prefix should be interpreted as the file system location of a unix domain socket.\n- On Microsoft Windows, values without such prefix should be interpreted as a named `pipe` path.\n",

    "body": "Let's look at the risks:\n\nOne security risk is that some software (looking at you, Mist) still uses the keystore built into the node  to manage accounts. An attacker with the privilege to set environment variables could capture account passwords this way. But such an attacker could also bind the default socket location (e.g. ~/.ethereum/geth.ipc on Linux). Mist could defend against this by not checking the default location and spawning {geth,eth,parity} with a random socket location for each launch. We want to remove account management and associated APIs from geth in the long run, which would make this a non-issue generally.\n\nEven if the API only serves public data, a proxy can serve arbitrary state to the app to influence decisions based on blockchain data (e.g. opening door locks, granting access to in-game content, resolving DNS names to the wrong IP...). This risk also exists now and there is no good defense other than running the Ethereum client in the same process.\n\nI agree that we need to put some thought into this. The environment variable obviously adds some convenience for users and attackers alike.\n",
