We aim to define the type of interactions, payload storage and incentives for execution.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nA standard interface allows any smart contract to set a reward for the delegated execution. This allows developers to build general-purpose execution agent networks serving multiple protocols based on the delegated execution principal.\r\n\r\nThe idea of third party executions exists in the Ethereum Alarm Clock and Chronos protocols, as well as in standards such as EIP #1077 and EIP #948. This present EIP can in fact be viewed as a layer of abstraction over EIP #1077 as it defines the API for which third party executors can implement in order to be flexible across all of the third party execution schemes.\r\n\r\nIdeally, the third party executor software could switch out the addresses it would execute at and be able to call these methods _out of the box_. \r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\n## Contract\r\n### Methods\r\n\r\n#### execute\r\n\r\nExecutes the `_payload` provides by the caller. MUST check for `canExecute` to return `true` before execution. SHOULD allow any caller to successfully execute the contract. SHOULD transfer funds set as `fee` to caller after successful execution.\r\n\r\nOPTIONAL - `payload` equals 0x0 in case contract storing it internally.\r\n\r\n\r\n``` js\r\nfunction execute(bytes _payload) returns (bool result)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### canExecute\r\n\r\nReturns `true` if execution conditions are fulfilled for provided `_payload`.\r\n\r\n\r\n``` js\r\nfunction canExecute(bytes _payload) view returns (bool result)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### payload\r\n\r\nReturns the `payload` to be used for `execute` and `canExecute` functions\r\n\r\n``` js\r\nfunction payload() view returns (bytes payload)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n#### payloadStorage\r\n\r\nReturns the location of `_payload`. 0x0 in case using internal storage. Multilink in case using external storage.\r\n\r\n``` js\r\nfunction payloadStorage() view returns (bytes payloadStorage)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### nonceUsed\r\n\r\nChecks whether a specific nonce has been used for an account.\r\n\r\n``` js\r\nfunction nonceUsed(address _account, bytes32 _nonce) returns (bool used)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWill return true if the specific nonce has been used for the account and therefore the transaction is invalid to be executed. Otherwise, the nonce has not been used and the execution is valid for that nonce.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### payToCode\r\n\r\nDefines the code to be ran when an execution took place. The code will follow the EIP #1197 Meta Payments standard.\r\n\r\n```js \r\nfunction payToCode() view returns (bytes _code)\r\n```\r\n\r\nReturns the code that will be run upon execution.\r\n\r\n### Events\r\n\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\nWIP https://github.com/chronologic/chronos/blob/c--/contracts/c_offchain/C.sol\r\n\r\n## History\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

    "body": "Hey @PhABC. Both #1077 and this can fulfill the same needs. The differences I can think of now:\r\n\r\n* #1228 doesn't define any scheme for payload, aims to be as flexible as possible - payload is not only the data to be sent with transaction but can also contains any other necessary fields like to, value, conditions etc - this is taken from our work at https://github.com/chronologic/chronos/blob/master/encoding.txt\r\n* #1228 supports on-chain stored payloads too\r\n* #1228 uses #1197 as payments for execution",

So, yes this is the same.\r\n\r\n> ERC-1077 does refund the gas (in any tokens), but does not allow explicitly to pay more than the gas consumed. That's a good point\r\n\r\nI think in general there are 2 different approaches and the root problems these ERCs are trying to solve.\r\n\r\n* #1077 seems to be for UX improvements - which then probably leads to market structure where users of protocol A that uses token B will be able to interact with protocol A using only token B (not having ETH for gas). In this approach the `executors` will either be protocol A creators (similar to 0x relayers) or maybe other protocol A users (to improve protocol and token utility)\r\n\r\n* #1228 aims to create the market structure where multiple protocols and tokens can be served. The `executors` in that model are random nodes that willing to execute transactions due to extra incentive defined by `scheduler`\r\n\r\n@alexvandesande let me know if that's correct",
