  "body": "## Simple Summary\r\n\r\nAn equity agreement standard.\r\n\r\n## Abstract\r\n\r\nThe following is a standard that allows for the implementation of equity allocation and related functions within smart contracts. This standard allows for the functions of querying basic project and equity information, track the history of equity transfers, transfer equity, and distribute profits based on equity allocation.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nThis standard interface allows any project to tokenize their equity, to be protected by the security of Ethereum, and to be used by applications, enabling the transfer of equity from wallet to wallet.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\n### FAS\r\n\r\nThe Fair and Autonomous Stakeholder-equity protocol (FAS) is a standardized smart contract designed to tokenize how equity works. By implementing this with blockchain technology, precisely smart contracts, it enables tokenized equity to operate on a fair and autonomous basis, allowing the execution of any process to be transparent and pre-determined by the contract. This equity agreement standard allows for the querying of project and equity information, transfer of equity, distribution of profits and voting-related actions.\r\n\r\n### Methods\r\n\r\n#### name\r\n\r\n``` js\r\nfunction name() external view returns (string _name)\r\n```\r\n\r\nReturn the name of the project - e.g. `\"MyProject\"`\r\n\r\nReturn type `string`\r\n\r\n#### FasNum\r\n\r\n``` js\r\nfunction FasNum() external view returns (uint256 _FasNum)\r\n```\r\n\r\nReturn the number of total FAS created in the project - e.g. `100`\r\n\r\nReturn type `uint256`\r\n\r\n#### owner\r\n\r\n``` js\r\nfunction owner() external view returns (address _owner)\r\n```\r\n\r\nReturn the address of the project owner - e.g. `0xca35b7d915458ef540ade6068dfe2f44e8fa733c`\r\n\r\nReturn type `address`\r\n\r\n#### createTime\r\n\r\n``` js\r\nfunction createTime() external view returns (uint256 _createTime)\r\n```\r\n\r\nReturn the timestamp of the project creation time - e.g. `1534431600`\r\n\r\nReturn type `uint256`\r\n\r\n#### balanceOf\r\n\r\n``` js\r\nfunction balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 _balance)\r\n```\r\n\r\nReturn the FAS number owned by the address `_owner` - e.g. `15`\r\n\r\nReturn type `uint256`\r\n\r\n#### ownerOf\r\n\r\n``` js\r\nfunction ownerOf(uint256 _FasId) public view returns (address _owner)\r\n```\r\n\r\nReturn the address of the FAS owner for `_FasId` - e.g. `0xca35b7d915458ef540ade6068dfe2f44e8fa733c`\r\n\r\nReturn type `address`\r\n\r\n#### exists\r\n\r\n``` js\r\nfunction exists(uint256 _FasId) public view returns (bool)\r\n```\r\n\r\nConfirm the validity for the Fas with the FAS ID `_FasId`\r\n\r\n#### allOwnedFas\r\n\r\n``` js\r\nfunction allOwnedFas(address _owner) public view returns (uint256[] _allOwnedFasList)\r\n```\r\n\r\nReturn the list of FAS ID for the FAS owned by the address `_owner` - e.g. `[0,1,2,3,4]`\r\n\r\nReturn type `uint256[]`\r\n\r\n#### getTransferRecords\r\n\r\n``` js\r\nfunction getTransferRecords(uint256 _FasId) public view returns (address[] _preOwners)\r\n```\r\n\r\nReturn the list of transferor addresses for the FAS with FAS ID `_FasId` and arrange the list as the order of transferring - e.g. `[0xCA35b7d915458EF540aDe6068dFe2F44E8fa733c,0x14723A09ACff6D2A60DcdF7aA4AFf308FDDC160C]`\r\n\r\nReturn type `address[]`\r\n\r\n#### transfer\r\n\r\n``` js\r\nfunction transfer(address _to, uint256[] _FasId) public\r\n```\r\n\r\nTransfer the FAS with FAS ID `_FasId` (the number of FAS transferred here can be multiple by a list of FAS ID) to the address `_to`，and trigger the event `Transfer`\r\n\r\nIf the transferor attempts to send a FAS that does belong to him or a FAS that does not exist, the function will be broke.\r\n\r\n#### createVote\r\n\r\n``` js\r\nfunction createVote() public payable returns (uint256 _voteId)\r\n```\r\n\r\nCreat a voting event，and return the Vote ID `_voteId`\r\n\r\nReturn type `uint256`\r\n\r\n#### vote\r\n\r\n``` js\r\nfunction vote(uint256 _voteId, uint256 _vote_status_value) public\r\n```\r\n\r\nVote for the event with the Vote ID `_voteId`. In the voting event，value `0` for `_vote_status_value` means affirmative vote，value `1` for `_vote_status_value` means dissenting vote，and value `2` means abstaining.\r\n\r\n#### getVoteResult\r\n\r\n``` js\r\nfunction getVoteResult(uint256 _voteId) public payable returns (bool result)\r\n```\r\n\r\nObtain the voting result of the event with Vote ID `_voteId`. return `true` if the voting event got successful, and return `false` if not.\r\n\r\nReturn type `bool`\r\n\r\n#### dividend\r\n\r\n``` js\r\nfunction dividend(address _token_owner) public\r\n```\r\n\r\nDistribute bonus from the wallet address `_token_owner` to all the Fas owners.\r\n\r\n### Event\r\n\r\n#### Transfer\r\n\r\n``` js\r\nevent Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 indexed _FasId);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWill be triggered when transferring Fas, including transferring 0 FAS\r\n\r\n#### Vote\r\n\r\n``` js\r\nevent Vote(uint256 _voteId);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWill be triggered when creating a voting event\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nThe equity agreement standard is compatible with ERC-20.\r\n\r\n## Test Cases\r\n\r\n### Test Cases are available at\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/ideabit/ERC270/blob/master/contract/ERC1384BasicContract.sol\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\n\r\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

We have been thinking of adding vesting related function(s) to our contract (a schedule of some sort of a predetermined time for vesting equity to a founding team member / early investor, and a violation of meeting the specific timeline will result in a share buyback). When you say burning, are you refering to the equity not vested due to leaving early or the burn rate of a startup?",
