    "body": "We have discussed superseded in the past and have decided against it.  The primary reason (IMO) for not including superseded is that it means someone has to *decide* which EIPs supersede which.  For example, there are dozens of token contracts that are better than ERC-20 and all of them would love to be the \"official\" token that supersedes ERC-20 and have EIP-20 point at them, but who would make the decision which one is the one that actually supersedes it?\r\n\r\nSimilarly, what if someone claims to supersede ERC-20 but not everyone agrees that it does and some people think ERC-20 is still the \"correct\" token contract?\r\n\r\nTL;DR: it is a governance nightmare to add `superseded-by` to an EIP.\r\n\r\nWe could have a `supersedes` field on EIPs that points *backward*, but I feel like that wouldn't add much value and every token would *claim* to supersede ERC-20 and I fear there would be user confusion because people would assume that when they saw that there was some official process by which a token supersedes another, when really it is just the author saying \"you should use this instead of that\".",

There is a good use case for it: see https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-820 and https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1820.\r\n\r\nThis would certainly be more acceptable to me, though part of me feels like when an EIP becomes final its \"ownership\" shifts over to a public good, and I am hesitant to give power to the original authors whose views may not align with the broader community just because they happened to be the ones who penned the original EIP.\r\n\r\nFor example, say I was the author of ERC-20 and then years later I create ERC-N where I create a new token standard.  Perhaps most people believe my ERC-N token standard is terrible, should I be able to put a mark on ERC-20 that basically tells people to go use ERC-N just because I happened to be the author of ERC-20?  This gives me a *huge* amount of power that I probably shouldn't have.  If ERC-N is a good idea, the community will adopt it, and they won't if it is a bad idea, independent of whether ERC-20 was popular or not.",

    "body": "My feeling is that we want each standard to stand on its own merit, and not be standing on the merit of the author's prior work.  Someone can make a great standard, and then 2 years later make a terrible standard.  *Most* people likely don't know which is better but they receive a breadcrumb to the new (terrible) standard when they should have gone and sought feedback from the broader community.\r\n\r\nImagine if today Fabian created a new token contract and updated ERC-20 to say that their new token superseded ERC-20.  *Many* developers, particularly new developers, would run off and start implementing this new token even though there are a dozen token standards out there that are all better than ERC-20 and many of which may be better than the new standard that Fabian created.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nAnother thing to consider is that allowing the addition of superseded can introduce some pathological incentive games where someone who authors a popular EIP (ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155, etc.) can sell rights to the superseded field to authors of future EIPs.  Basically you just agree that you'll add a superseded field pointing at the highest bidder's EIP which can then be used for advertising a new standard.  By making EIPs immutable, we avoid this entire can of worms.",
