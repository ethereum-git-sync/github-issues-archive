  "body": "Currently in solidity, there is this very unintuitive way of declaring variables. You would think that taking up less storage with a uint8 would end up costing less in gas than a uint256, but in actuality you end up being charged more in gas for a uint8 than a uint256. This proposal is for a set of EVM opcodes to mimic SSTORE but with specific sizes and ascending gas costs from 8-248. I will add to this more, but this is an initial posting to get this out there. Let me know your initial thoughts and concerns. \n",
