Thus, the token has a negative value: the less you have, the better.\r\n\r\n## Abstract\r\nImagine a anti-currency blockchain where, instead of signing the sending, you sign the receival. \r\n\r\nYou cannot send the currency to an address, you can only receive it from the given address.\r\n\r\nThus, the incentive is to spend it, nobody wants it, the currency has a negative value.\r\n\r\nThis ERC uses a smart contract to emulate an anti-currency on the Ethereum ecosystem.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nAn antitoken can be used to represent debt, bad reputation, or anything negative in relation to its owner. \r\n\r\nThe incentive is to spend it and to have a balance of zero.\r\n\r\n## Technical specification\r\nFor technical specification, see https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/3476\r\n\r\n## Reference implementation\r\nhttps://github.com/hazae41/ERC-Antitoken",

There's nothing preventing collateral free debt in the current finance world and plenty of real world examples of debt without collateral. One could argue reputation is the minimum collateral but it is intangible and failing to pay back debt does not always destroy reputation.

But this credit score and more specifically how much credit line to give them is subjective, and there wont be a universal methodology. \r\n\r\nLets say you wanted to transfer identity based debt to someone else. Deciding if that someone else is allowed to receive that debt depends on their identity, and if the identity is sufficient enough to receive that amount of debt without financial collateral is a subjective decision that will have to be ran through proprietary code from the system that issued the debt token. A random person saying they will take all your debt off your hands is not enough to run a protocol.\r\n\r\nI think the takeaway from your idea is that Aave and all other lending protocols (including identity/reputation based) should allow someone to transfer their debt tokens to another party providing two conditions are met:  first, the receiver authorizes the receipt, and second, that the protocol rules allow this much debt to this ethereum address. The second part is key, and what makes a antitoken transfer standard largely pointless.",
