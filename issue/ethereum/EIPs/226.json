  "body": "Currently we have web3.eth.sign() which allows an application to have a message signed using an EOA private key and ecerecover() which allows smart contracts to verify signatures.  There are use cases where it would be convenient to use the EOA's key pair to perform encryption and decryption of application specific data.  Currently this is not possible as there is no API to access the private key.  I understand that web3.eth.sign() is currently an RPC call but there is desire to move it to be client only.  Given that direction, this EIP would be for adding encryption/decryption to the client libraries only (my specific interest is in the javascript libraries).  With this EIP is also a request to add an API to add access to the public key so it can be used as part of the encryption process.  It is possible to obtain the public key today via ecerecover() on a signature, but requiring a signature should not be required to obtain the public key.",
