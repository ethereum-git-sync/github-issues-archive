  "body": "Sometimes a user has a series of transactions pending that they want to invalidate urgently and atomically.\r\n\r\nCurrently the best solution is to submit a replacement \"zero value\" tx for each of the pending txs, with an increase of gas, and hope that miners mine the cancellation transactions first.\r\n\r\nThis creates a lot of on-chain traffic just for batch cancellation, and can result in inconsistent results, where some dependent transactions are processed when earlier ones were successfully \"cancelled\".\r\n\r\nOne way this could be alleviated would be if transactions could have \"nonce spans\" that included a range of nonces from the current valid nonce to a future nonce, incrementing the account nonce by a user-specified amount, and invalidating any transactions with a nonce below the resulting nonce.\r\n\r\nThoughts? Other approaches?",
