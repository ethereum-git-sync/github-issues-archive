This narrows the gap between prices denominated in crypto and fiat currencies, and thus increases the adoption of cryptocurrencies as a payment method. The Ethereum blockchain is chosen as the experimental environment in this work, yet the architecture can be migrated to other decentralized systems without additional efforts. This work devises a novel ERC standard to resolve the payment at a predetermined exchange rate that can be employed by any existing cryptocurrency. The blockchain inborn receipts generated upon the issuance and settlement of the payment transactions grant rights to the merchants to settle the payment at a regular basis. The architecture demonstrates a notable reduction on the risk of the exchange rate for the merchants, solving the primary problem of cryptocurrency payment adoptions nowadays.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nCryptocurrencies are developed as a decentralized and trustless payment system, in which participants should be able to conduct payments across borders with acceptable latencies. However, the fluctuation of the exchange rate between crypto and fiat currencies has raised significant concerns and thwarted the prevalence of cryptocurrency payment adoption. Existing solutions require merchants to liquidate the received cryptocurrency on an exchange platform. To compensate for the exchange rate risk, merchants tend to charge a higher price in cryptocurrencies compare to in fiat currency, which dampens the incentive of customers to choose cryptocurrencies as the means of payment.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n### Terminology\r\nThree roles are involved in the interactive network of the payment actions.\r\n- `Customer`\r\nThe Customer possesses cryptocurrencies and initiates payments to Merchant in exchange of services or products. The actual cryptocurrency flows to the Token Issuer, and a payment receipt is generated to record the payment details, which is kept by the Merchant for a regular settlement purpose.\r\n- `Merchant`\r\nThe Merchant provides services and products to Client and requests cryptocurrency payment in return. The Merchant will not receive any cryptocurrency, yet a specific receipt will be recorded on the underlying blockchain. The Merchant can settle a collection of receipts at a predefined rate in a contract with the Issuer, at a regular time basis, for example, a month or a quarter.\r\n- `Token Issuer`\r\nThe Issuer is the originator and owner of cryptocurrency. The Issuer decides a predetermined exchange rate with the Merchant, which will be adopted when the Merchant wants to execute a settlement of payment receipts. \r\n\r\n### Events\r\n```solidity\r\nevent PaymentIssued(\r\n    address client,\r\n    address merchant,\r\n    uint256 value,\r\n    uint256 timeStamp,\r\n    bytes32 paymentHash,\r\n    uint256 nonce\r\n);\r\n\r\nevent PaymentSettled(bytes32 paymentHash);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Functions\r\n**pay**: usually called by Customer\r\n```solidity\r\nfunction pay (address _merchant, uint256 _value) public onlyClient;\r\n```\r\n\r\n**settle**: usually called by Merchant\r\n```solidity\r\nfunction settle (bytes32 _paymentHash) public onlyMerchant paymentHasNotBeenSettled(_paymentHash) paymentHasBeenIssued(_paymentHash);\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\nThe interface is designed to be compatible with ERC20 tokens. Specifically, a token contract can inherit this interface to acquire functionalities of stable payments.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\nCopyright and related rights waived via [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).\r\n",
