  "body": "### Title\r\n\r\n    EIP: 661\r\n    Title: Provable Burn of ERC20 Tokens\r\n    Author: Alex Miller\r\n    Created: 2017-07-01\r\n    Version: 3\r\n\r\n### Specification\r\n\r\nA `provableBurn` function is added to an ERC20 token such that the owner of this token may sign a message to burn a certain number of tokens. This is an extension of ERC20 using the proposed `provable_` standard from #662 .\r\n\r\n    function provable_burn(bytes32[3] sig, uint256 value) returns (bool) {\r\n      // ABI definition of this function\r\n      bytes32 word = 0xc1644b1f;\r\n      address signer = ecrecover(msg, uint8(data[2]), data[0], data[1]); \r\n      uint nonce = nonces[signer];\r\n      bytes32 msg = sha3(sha3(uint(value)), bytes4(word), address(this), uint(nonce));\r\n      \r\n      // Replay protection\r\n      if (played[signer][msg] == true) { return false; }      \r\n      \r\n      // Update state variables\r\n      played[signer][msg] = true;\r\n      nonces[signer] += 1;\r\n\r\n      // Burn tokens\r\n      balances[owner] = safeSub(balances[owner], value);\r\n      supply = safeSub(supply, value);\r\n      Transfer(owner, 0, value);\r\n\r\n      return true;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNo tokens are moved during the burn. Rather, the number of atomic token units burned is simply subtracted both from the user's balance and from the total supply.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nSome token systems may desire to have users burn some number of tokens to unlock certain rewards. This uses the event emission proposed in #621, namely transfer to the zero address and requires the owner of the tokens to sign a message that proves the desire to burn them.\r\n\r\nPer #662, calling of `provable_burn` may be outsourced with a signed message and played by any actor with the message. This includes a contract that might require this provable burn to happen before initiating an internal mechanism.",

    "body": "Mmm I see two things happening here:\r\n\r\n1) A function to burn tokens. This is indeed useful, as it's more deliberate than sending to a unretrivable address. Actually @evertonfraga added that to the ethereum.org/token example, after he added a trigger preventing accidentally sending to the zeroth address\r\n\r\n2) Ability to execute token actions via signing messages. This is very useful too, but it could be extended to all other functions: move tokens, approve transactions, etc just by signing so the user doesn't need to pay gas\r\n\r\nIn my opinion these can be discussed separately ",
