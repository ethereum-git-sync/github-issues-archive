  "body": "Coin vote is now underway on EIP-186:\r\n\r\nhttp://carbonvote.com/\r\n\r\nAs an FYI, Carbonvote set this up on their own. I think they did a very nice job and thank them for serving the Ethereum community in this way.\r\n\r\nPlease, whatever your opinion is on EIP-186, let your voice be heard by participating in the coin vote!\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nModified EIP proposal with changes, followed by the original EIP proposal. These changes are based on feedback provided on Reddit and Github regarding this EIP regarding the issuance reduction schedule and minimum issuance level under proof-of-work.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n<pre>  \r\n  EIP: 186\r\n  Title: Reduce ETH issuance before proof-of-stake\r\n  Author: Matthew Light | lightuponlight9@gmail.com\r\n  Discussions-To: lightuponlight9@gmail.com\r\n  Status: Draft\r\n  Type: Standards Track\r\n  Created: 2016-12-21\r\n  Replaces:  N/A\r\n  Superseded-By: N/A\r\n  Resolution: N/A\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n**Abstract**\r\nA reduction in the issuance of Ether (ETH) is very likely to be price-supportive and lead to increasing investments in the platform and to help ward off speculative attacks on the value of Ether by promoters of competing platforms who offer, or plan to offer, reduced token inflation rates. This proposal is based on [a discussion on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/5izcf5/lets_talk_about_the_projected_coin_supply_over/?st=iwzg8ikv&sh=34454d8e) about ETH token issuance rates that many people participated in, including Ethereum Foundation member Vitalik Buterin.\r\n\r\nIn the current version of Ethereum as deployed on the network, there is already a coded schedule of reduced issuance per time period due to the \"ice age\" (an increase in difficulty designed to incent the adoption of hard forks). Normally, the \"ice ages\" in Ethereum are postponed by hard forks and the issuance is kept at 5 ETH per block. This EIP suggests that instead, the reduction in issuance from the \"ice age\" be implemented in a stepwise fashion within the protocol rules on a set block number schedule and with a defined lower bound (such as the \"tail emission\" in Monero). The proposed block reward reduction timetable has been pushed farther into the future, and the terminal issuance level has been increased in light of discussions on Reddit and  github regarding this EIP.\r\n\r\n**Motivation**\r\nThere is widespread interest within in the Ethereum community to reduce the current rate of ETH issuance. Uncertainty about the future total ETH token supply is a significant factor in reducing the market value of ETH which has negative externalities on the Ethereum ecosystem, by reducing the capital available by current investors to make investments in new Ethereum-based projects and by reducing the Ethereum Foundation's funds available for spending on salaries. Reducing ETH issuance in advance of proof-of-stake would provide a measure of reassurance to investors that their holdings of ETH will be diluted to a much lower degree. It would be helpful in the cryptoplatform marketplace for Ethereum to reduce issuance given that various competing platforms have or are planning lower issuance levels, such as Ethereum Classic. \r\nAdditionally, reducing block rewards in the near future helps reduce a sense of pressure on the Ethereum network architects and developers to rush a proof-of-stake implementation and try to deliver it more quickly than would be prudent.\r\nThe terminal reward value of 2 ETH / block was chosen to reduce token supply inflation to around 4% annually, gradually reducing over time until proof-of-stake is launched. This is in line with the current Bitcoin token inflation rate of approximately 4%. In comparison, current proof-of-work ETH token inflation rate is a bit less than 13% per year.\r\nA reduction of token emission under proof-of-work could lead to a reduction in network security. However, a plausible improvement in the exchange rate of ETH because of a reduction in issuance will lead to an increase in network security. It is unclear how much the ETH token price might increase due to a lowered issuance rate, but the positive response of Bitcoin price to issuance reductions (\"halvening\") is encouraging.\r\n\r\n**Specification**\r\nThe current issuance level for ETH is 5 ETH per block, with various kinds of uncle rewards also provided. This EIP proposes that no change to the relationship between block rewards and uncle rewards be made, but instead that all uncle and uncle inclusion rewards be downsized proportionally with the provided block reward schedule.\r\nThe proposed reduction in issuance is an approximation for providing stepwise issuance reduction approximately matching the \"ice age\" coin issuance reduction already built into the current specification of the Ethereum software. Vitalik Buterin gave an estimate of this reduction on Reddit:\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/5izcf5/lets_talk_about_the_projected_coin_supply_over/dbc66rd/\r\nBased on the ice age blocktime lengthening data Vitalik provided, the following reduction of block reward schedule is proposed as a reduction in issuance that is smaller than the reduction already scheduled (via longer blocktimes caused by the \"ice age\" PoW difficulty bomb). The reduction schedule is also significantly delayed over the \"ice age\" reduction already contained in the code:\r\nBlock 3700000 - Block reward reduced to 4 ETH / block\r\nBlock 5000000 - Block reward reduced to 3 ETH / block\r\nBlock 7000000 - Block reward reduced to 2 ETH / block (minimum block reward until proof-of-stake)\r\nAs previously stated, all uncle rewards should be proportionally reduced along with the main block reward.\r\nThe reduction in issuance specified in this EIP should also be accompanied with a change to push back the \"ice age\" date into the future as best determined by the Ethereum Foundation in the context of planning for the Casper / proof-of-stake release.\r\nIn the light of discussions with members of the Ethereum community and the Ethereum Foundation, this EIP recommends a coin vote should be taken to determine the level of community support before a decision about whether to implement it.\r\n\r\n**Rationale**\r\nThis design is deliberately simplified from the issuance function Vitalik used to calculate his predicted blocktime schedule with relatively few block reward amount transition changes in order to minimize implimentation difficulty across the various Ethereum clients. No change in the relationship between block and uncle rewards is made to avoid introducing unforseen game-theoretic changes in mining strategy. Minimum planned proof-of-work issuance is set to 2 ETH / block to provide a baseline level of security rewards for proof-of-work close to Bitcoin's current issuance rate until the transition to proof-of-stake.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Implementation**\r\nThis EIP must be implemented in all Ethereum validating nodes by a hard fork, either in a currently-planned hard fork such as Metropolis, or in a separate hard fork.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nOriginal EIP proposal below\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>  \r\n  EIP: 186\r\n  Title: Reduce ETH issuance before proof-of-stake\r\n  Author: Matthew Light | lightuponlight9@gmail.com\r\n  Discussions-To: lightuponlight9@gmail.com\r\n  Status: Draft\r\n  Type: Standards Track\r\n  Created: 2016-12-21\r\n  Replaces:  N/A\r\n  Superseded-By: N/A\r\n  Resolution: N/A\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n**Abstract**\r\nA reduction in the issuance of Ether (ETH) is very likely to be price-supportive and lead to increasing investments in the platform and to help ward off speculative attacks on the value of Ether by promoters of competing platforms who offer, or plan to offer, reduced token inflation rates.

    "body": "I would support this proposal. \r\n\r\nEthereum is an amazing project with aims far greater than the simple monetary goals of bitcoin. But it is the digital scarcity of cryptocurrency that gives value to underlying tokens for a chain. Do not forget that ethereum already has 87M ether in existence with another 13M expected in the coming years. For ethereum to work as a cryptocurrency then ether must have value - or PoS will not work and the numerous startups with ICO's held in ether risk failure. \r\n\r\nPerception is everything and general perception is that ethereum has a loose inflationary monetary design. This isn't accurate because of course bitcoin will continue to inflate for a long time. But bitcoin has a perceived hard cap and everyone knows the mantra that 'there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins'. Ethereum has no hard emission schedule published for post-PoS or an upper limit / upper bound to inflation decided. This is surprising for the second biggest cryptocurrency asset in the space in terms of market capitalisation. Developers openly saying that ethereum is not a store of value is also extremely unhelpful in my personal opinion when trying to grow an ecosystem based at it's root upon programmable digital money.\r\n\r\nLowering coin emission and monetary inflation to anything below 2% in the short term would improve things dramatically. Further implementing a hard cap at 100M with exponentially falling rewards until then (say over 100 years) would also be positive, especially in the context of ethereum post-POW. Even if this did not alter the actual emission schedule much - appearances are everything.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Some arguments against this request (but a delay in the Ice Age is probably going to be needed).\r\n\r\n1. It is supposed to help investors. Although a play of words, but I see investing into the ether value as a speculation. With investment into Ethereum, I see investment into tools, contracts and other related services. This type of investment does not benefit from an increased value of ether.\r\n\r\n1. Changing the consensus rules to encourage a higher ether price is not going to be seen kindly upon from outside of the Ethereum community. There is a risk that it will be interpreted as profits going first. The issuance rate is one of the fundamentals people look at when analyzing a cryptocurrency. It should not be changed lightly. One reason for the proposed change is uncertainty of the future issuance. I believe the proposed change may increase this uncertainty, not decrease it.\r\n\r\n1. The Ethereum Foundation is one of the bigger holders of ether, and would benefit the most from an increased value. Also, some of the members of EF hold large amounts of ether. Again, very questionable. What would be the next step, a hardfork that mints 1 million new ether dedicated to the EF? ETH's price is something completely external to the development of the Ethereum protocol.\r\n\r\n1. There is a risk hash rate will fall proportionally. Do we really want that?\r\n\r\n1. Until POS, this change of reward is a temporary change. Suppose we are talking about one extra year, running with  lower rewards instead of the current 5 ether/block. With POS, we  will get the lower reward system anyway, so it is only one year of difference.\r\n\r\n1. A discussion around this subject is prone to self confirmation. If you own ether, you may be influenced positively by the idea.\r\n\r\n1. POW need higher rewards than POS because it has higher operational costs.\r\n\r\n1. Any reference to another cryptocurrency is irrelevant for this discussion. That is, a change based on competition to other currencies is not a good change. The decision to adopt this EIP should be exactly the same as if Ethereum was the only existing cryptocurrency.\r\n\r\n1. There is a risk that the hard fork will not be accepted 100%, leading to another split of the community. This could be very damaging.",

It is very dangerous!\r\nThis EIP implies that 99,9% of all miners will follow the fork decision. This implication is wrong.\r\n\r\nAny attempt to take away somebody's money (here the miner's) for common weal is not quite fair and very risky. Even democratic ballots is not the suitable governance model for miner's community, because the minority have strong and continuous chain of incentives to rebel and split off the coin.\r\n\r\nSo, don't relay on decision. Let us relay on incentives:\r\nEthereum could make an offer to miners to convert theirs freshly mined ethers into Casper mining deposit.  I would also give an extra stake voting power to those stake.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n- Inflated Ethers become sterilized as Casper deposit.\r\n- PoW miners become fair transition path to PoS\r\n- Ethereum/PoS becomes better distribution of stakeholder (not only the oligopoly of ETH whales)\r\n\r\nContras:\r\n?",

    "body": "> Presumably falling supply will be price positive\r\n\r\nNot a given. Falling supply could lead to falling security, leading to distrust in the platform, leading to falling price. Not saying this will happen, but it could. It's not a trivial possibility at least.\r\n\r\n> 51% attack is theoretical\r\n\r\nWell it is a legitimate concern. Low cap altcoins have been 51% attacked. It's unlikely to happen in ETH. But then, I come back to my original question. If short-term price-gain is wanted, why stop at 1.5 ETH/block? There's no good reason just besides saying: \"There should be *some* security, but at least we should be around Bitcoin's current issuance rate.\" It's not satisfactory reasoning. \r\n\r\n> issuance has never predicted hash power\r\n\r\nThis is true. Price has been the main factor. But zero issuance in PoW means a dead chain (tx fees won't save you here). Issuance *is* correlated to hash power.\r\n\r\n> beneficial for all\r\n\r\nThis I don't agree with. I'm legitimately concerned with the negative impact of perception of changing monetary policy to fit short-term greed (more \"immutability\" trolls coming out of the woodworks), and legitimately concerned about unknown events regarding security and the changing of expectations (splitting the community).\r\n\r\n> In summary it's complex\r\n\r\nThis is true. Thus, current proposals need substantially more economic/theoretical backing to prove that we won't steer into a disaster.\r\n\r\nIt's not a straight-forward decision.",

    "body": "> Why not argue that we need more issuance to entice in more hash power?\r\n\r\nGood point. No one knows what's the effective trade-off to retain the highest security. We might be underperforming. Zero issuance = dead chain. %4m inflation per block is also a dead chain. Somewhere along this line you get the most security. What *is* that?\r\n\r\n> I don't believe hashrate will be significantly affected by this, assuming price tracks decreasing issuance\r\n\r\n... but there's my problem. How do *know* that?\r\n\r\n> I think Bitcoin halvening events are good indicators to follow.\r\n\r\nAnd how do we know that Bitcoin would not have had a much higher security if it kept a constant subsidy?\r\n\r\nThese are still conjectures.\r\n\r\n> In my opinion, nothing about this is \"short-term\"\r\n\r\nChanging something like this whilst Ethereum is going to be around for decades *is* short-term price greed.\r\n\r\n> Is the current issuance not a magic number?\r\n\r\nIt is (I might be wrong and Vitalik and co based the percentage inflation on actual economic research). So it works fine for now. It might not have been the best magic number, but don't change to other magic numbers when it's not broken.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBasically, all I'm saying is. There's no need to fiddle with monetary policy in the short-term. If we are, we need a lot more substantial research for why fiddling with it is a good idea. And not just conjectures. Stay with the working status quo, unless there's substantial convincing evidence otherwise.\r\n\r\nOthers might require less convincing evidence, or the trade-offs are substantially more obvious to others. It's just so nebulous to me, that it feels like tinkering a car engine whilst driving and not looking at the road ahead.",

Let me push ahead:\r\n\r\n- Block 5000000 - Block reward reduced to 4 ETH / block\r\n- Block 6000000 - Block reward reduced to 3 ETH / block\r\n- Block 7000000 - Block reward reduced to 2 ETH / block ~~(minimum block reward until proof-of-stake)~~\r\n\r\nWhere Block 5M is December 2017, 6M May 2018, and 7M November 2018. \r\n\r\nAnd to get an idea: 4M is already next month. 8M is April 2019, so going down in steps like 5000000-6000000-7000000 is the most realistic schedule we currently could come up.\r\n\r\nWhile thinking about this, if we want this as a tool to enforce validators to switch to Proof of Stake, why not going on and on with this scheme:\r\n\r\n- Block 8000000 - Block reward reduced to 1 ETH / block\r\n- Block 9000000 - Block reward reduced to 0 ETH / block (fees only)\r\n\r\nBlock 9M will pass in September 2019.

Yes I agree, the numbers should be updated, but I think the principle is just a lower issuance rate effective until PoS.\r\n\r\nJust read the [meeting notes](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/blob/master/All%20Core%20Devs%20Meetings/Meeting%2014.md) and it sounds like this EIP was rejected. I would like to add that although I agree a 2-3M difference is not worth a controversial hard fork, this assumes that PoS will be delivered on time. I know the core devs have a much better idea of when that will be, but I want to make the point that this difference doubles on the order of every 6 months.",
