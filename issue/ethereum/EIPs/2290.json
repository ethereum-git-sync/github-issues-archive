  "body": "For a long time, ERC20 was an ABI definition masquerading as a semantic spec. This means some \"ERC20\" tokens are now technically non-compliant even though the developers were following what the standard said at the time.\r\n\r\nWhen the semantics were finally standardized, it revealed all the warts in the design. **ERC20 tokens are surprisingly hard to build and use correctly.**\r\n\r\nExperience building token system shows that nearly all custom dapp logic lies when to mint/burn, and almost no dapp has a concept of \"logic on transfer\". In practice, every single dapp has its token re-audited to ensure it doesn't violate the same basic rules in every project.\r\n\r\nMeta-proposal: **Design by github thread is a bad idea**\r\n\r\nProposal: A universal token factory that constructs a common \"Token\" type. \r\n\r\nThe token:\r\n\r\n* has a \"controller\" which is just a regular simple \"owner\" address. I propose \"controller\" because people tend to anthropomorphize \"owner\" and forget that single-signature control is a special case. The controller can update via `setController`. It really is just an \"owner\".\r\n* controller can call `mint`/`burn`/`move`  (\"move\" is a backdoored \"transfer\")\r\n\r\nThe factory:\r\n* DOES fire an event recording new tokens,\r\n* does NOT assign a numeric ID\r\n* does NOT have a registry.\r\n\r\n**Do not dare try to launch the \"first\" \"official\" one of these without bytecode-level formal verification. You know who you are.**\r\n\r\nConsider this OP an evolving document, I will revise it with a concrete spec and rationale for each decision above.\r\n\r\nMaybe if all the right people tweet about it we could even call these \"ETokens\" or \"eTokens\".",
