  "body": "If `block.number >= METROPOLIS_FORK_BLKNUM`, then opcode `0xfa` functions equivalently to a `CALL`, except it takes 6 arguments not including value, and calls the child with a `STATIC` flag on. Any calls, static or otherwise, made by an execution instance with a `STATIC` flag on will also have a `STATIC` flag on. Any attempts to make state-changing operations inside an execution instance with a `STATIC` flag on, including nonzero-value calls, creates, and `SSTORE`, `SSTOREBYTES` or `SUICIDE` operations, will instead throw an exception.\n### Rationale\n\nThis allows contracts to make calls that are clearly non-state-changing, reassuring developers and reviewers that re-entrancy bugs or other problems cannot possibly arise from that particular call; it is a pure function that returns an output and does nothing else. This may also make purely functional HLLs easier to implement.\n",

DELEGATECALL is essentially a hack that makes an account's code de-facto mutable. I don't think changing CALL is viable given how many contracts are relying on it. I think CALL/STATIC_CALL has precedent because C++ and other languages have a notion of \"constant functions\"; this is just what is necessary to make constant functions actually constant in a multi-user multi-contract environment where some of the things you're calling may be black boxes. We could also come up with other calling styles (eg. SANDBOXED_CALL in #117, which (in my modified interpretation) adds the restriction that the call can only change state in the destination address).\n",

    "body": "I think this is a step in the right and the wrong direction at once. \n\nTo gain a lot from this we need a few concepts;\n1. Memioization: The ability to calculate a function, param set only once and store the answer. To do this the function cannot access volatile state, the volatile state must be passed in via parameters. The benefit for Ethereum is unclear at present; it may play out that memioization can reduce evaluation time and possibly cause a major drop in gas prices. It could be that it adds nothing and the cache costs more to maintain than to ignore. \n2. Side-effects: What this is ultimately about is the ability to call a \"Query\" in Command/Query Separation terms. To do that, we cannot simply call existing methods that were written with state changes in mind, we need to properly flag methods on the blockchain as having no side effects. The benefits for Ethereum get huge here; we can begin to build up a library of trust worthy functions that can also be parallelized to an astonishing degree depending on the problem. This will greatly reduce evaluation times and gas prices. To ensure non-side effecting calls, we can also not allow a Query to call a Command (function with side effects). We also need a mechanism to prevent calls to other contracts from pointing to Queries at compile time, but pointing to Commands when the other contracts get upgraded. \n",

    "body": "Another idea about redesigning the call opcode: Currently, solidity performs a basic check to see whether the called address is at least a contract (it cannot check any further type information, but at least this creates some basic protection). With #150 this makes calls even more expensive on the gas side but not on the resource consumption side. In light of this, it might be good to provide a way to automatically include the `extcodesize > 0` check as part of the call (of course, we still need the ability to send ether and also send ether with data to non-contract accounts, so this should only be a \"flag\" of the opcode).\n",
