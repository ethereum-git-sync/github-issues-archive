Such as requesting a \"signature verification\" from the contract itself via CLI or Mist? Maybe a specific storage instance per contract, reserved for digital signatures? \n\nAuditing of smart contracts will surely become the norm within the next few years, since storage of value often occurs within a contract, as well as any reliance on general data integrity (for public chains especially). The easier it is to verify a CERTAIN TRUSTED PARTY's private key signed a specific contract, along with the usual bytecode verification, the more businesses and organizations may be willing trust the Ethereum platform if / when it makes it's way into a mainstream environment in the future.\n",

    "body": "@flyswatter Interesting insights. If Ethereum contracts could be signed securely like application binaries on a PC, and display a warning dialog if not trusted or signed (via CLI or Mist GUI) before executing them, I think end-user trust levels may be more in line with mainstream use. \n\nAdditionally, a \"Trust this source\" feature could be added to the various implementations, which would remove the issue of repeated approval of a trusted source, whether the same contract or a separate one. \n\nGoing this route, there may be less disasters regarding malicious contracts / large ETH losses, as the default  in implementations could be to warn if a signature is non-existent, or not yet marked as a trusted source before execution.\n",
