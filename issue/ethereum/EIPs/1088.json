Based on the [initial PR that introduced this change](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/16203), and corroborated in [a later note](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/16301#issuecomment-372687543), the computational cost of `ECADD`, `ECMUL`, and pairing checks (excepting the constant) has dropped roughly an order of magnitude across the board.\r\n\r\nI am introducing this early EIP to propose dropping the gas costs accordingly.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nFollowing is a table with the current gas cost and (current) suggested new gas cost:\r\n\r\n| Contract      | Address   | Current Gas Cost              | Suggested Gas Cost  |\r\n| ------------- | --------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------- |\r\n| `ECADD`       | `0x06`    | 500<sup>[1]</sup>             | 50                  |\r\n| `ECMUL`       | `0x07`    | 40 000<sup>[1]</sup>          | 2 000               |\r\n| Pairing check | `0x08`    | 80 000k + 100 000<sup>[2]</sup>| 5 500k + 100 000      |\r\n\r\n[1]- Per [EIP-196](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/984cf5de90bbf5fbe7e49be227b0c2f9567e661e/EIPS/eip-196.md#gas-costs).\r\n[2]- Per [EIP-197](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/df132cd37efb3986f9cd3ef4922b15a767d2c54a/EIPS/eip-197.md#specification).",

    "body": "@Shadowfiend \r\n\r\nAntonio, thank you for opening it. Right now the main show-stopper for practical confidential transactions and ring-signature based votings is a price of MUL operation in G1, that has picked up 20 fold speed-up after changes you’ve mentioned. I’d propose dropping price of ADD from 500 to 50 and the price of MUL operation from 40000 to 2000. Also it's worth including a reduction of paring operation cost too as all those optimizations are closely related. \r\n\r\nFor the reference of what would be a practical use of such ops I’ll try to give you an estimate of checking a single “Bulletproof” based range proof for 32 bit long integer tomorrow as I’ll release the set of provers, verifiers and mixers.\r\n\r\nSincerely, Alex",

If 20Mgas, there are certainly some optimizations you can make to improve that number (I got it down to 7.9Mgas).\r\n\r\nI'd recommend reducing the number of inv() function calls as I've found those to be quite gas intensive.  For instance when calling haddamard_inv(publicParameters.hs(), b.ys), you are doing 64 mod inverses when you really only need to be doing one: haddamard(publicParameters.hs(), powers(b.y.inv()).\r\n\r\nAgain, sorry if this is too far off topic.  In any case, I'd be very happy to see the gas costs lowered.",

    "body": "@shamatar\r\n> By the way, what do you mean under “multiplication by a power of 10 and an offset” in your implementation?\r\n\r\nSo I was leveraging a technique used by Borromean Range Proofs where you can supply a power of 10 and an offset which are publicly known in order to reduce the number of bits required.  For example, if I want to commit to 0.051 ETH, that's 5 x (10^16) + (10^15) wei.  So, I could do a range proof on 5 for a lesser number of bits (at least 3, but probably more), and tell the contract that I'm multiplying my value by 10^16 and adding an offset of 10^15 (though in practice I rarely use the offset).\r\n\r\nThe way I do this with bullet proofs is that after the bullet proof is verified, I have the contract modify the commitment and store that one as positive instead: C' = (10^power10)C + (offset)H.  Note that if adding a power of 10, the blinding factor is scaled up by that same power of 10: bf' = bf x (10^power10) mod N.",
