The smart contract would support meta-transactions with OpenGSN, and the editors would be responsible for ensuring that the fees are always paid. A GitHub action could also be added that automatically assigns a random EIP number using its own pool of NFTs.

If beautiful numbers arise from this process and we can all agree it was just luck, that's good.",
