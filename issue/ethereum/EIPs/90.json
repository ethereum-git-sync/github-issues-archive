  "body": "Function calls usually provide all available gas to the callee because it is extremely hard if not impossible to come up with a good estimate of how much gas the callee will need.\n\nAt he same time, this mechanism relies on actual gas costs inside the EVM and is very fragile:\n\nThe amount of gas left can be retrieved via the `gas` instruction - the problem is that some gas is already spent again between this instruction and the actual call, most notably the gas for the `call` instruction itself (which can even vary depending on its arguments).\n\nThe usual way to cope with this is to subtract a certain constant from the value of the `gas` instruction (this constant includes the costs for performing this subtraction...).\n\nThis is of course all very fragile and means that if we ever increase the gas costs of the instructions `call`, `gas`, `sub` or of pushing constants, we will break existing contracts.\n\nFurthermore, sometimes some gas has to be retained by the caller because it cannot efficiently estimate how costly the `call` opcode itself will be.\n\nThis is less an actual EIP but more a request for ideas about how to handle that situation.\n\nPossibility 1: Use the special case of 2**256-1 gas to mean \"all available gas\". This would at least make future contracts more flexible.\n\nPossibility 2: Change the semantics of `push1 50 gas sub call` (similar for other constants) to mean \"all available gas\" regardless of the result of the actual computation. That should at least keep the intended semantics of existing contracts.\n",
