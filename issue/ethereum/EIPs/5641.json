  "body": "### Proposed Change\r\n\r\nCurrently, the process for creating an EIP is not very simple and it is pretty time-consuming just to get an EIP to draft. I imagine a large part of the reason that a lot of EIPs end up stagnant is that the effort even to get an EIP into draft is a lot - more than is probably needed when the criteria for drafts, per EIP-1, is them being \"properly formatted.\" We have tooling that lets users know when their EIPs aren't properly formatted, and we might soon have tooling to automatically *fix* the most common errors.\r\n\r\nCurrently, when an EIP is initially proposed is when things like \"is this EIP ideal for its current purpose\" are discussed and block the progress. Having an actual EIP that is being built and on which people can submit PRs that propose changes is, IMHO, better than the status quo, and would actually allow the community to take *some* of the burden off of the EIP editors.",
