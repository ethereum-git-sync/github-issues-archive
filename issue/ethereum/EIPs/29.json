  "body": "To commemorate the increased environmental friendliness of proof of stake, starting from Serenity \"gas\" should be renamed to \"mana\".\n### Rationale\n\nAside from the above, \"mana\" is a better descriptor because:\n- Unlike \"gas\", \"mana\" is typically understood to be ephemeral and nontransferable, clarifying the relationship between ether and gas/mana that has so far been a source of great confusion.\n- Gas in the real world is non-renewable, gas in Ethereum is renewable. Mana is typically understood to be renewable, and so would be more accurate.\n### Implementation\n\n```\n for x in `find .`; sed -i s/gas/mana/g $x\n```\n",

    "body": "Not a gamer so didn't know 'mana' had been appropriated by them...\n\nThis naming really irks me because of it's religious origin.  'Mana' of course was the food that biblical god Jehovah/Yahweh dropped on the ground every morning to the ancient Hebrew's to keep them alive for 40 years in the desert (or a least until they complained).\n\n'Mana' == \"What is it?\" as they'd never seen it before.  \n\nIt came with rules...\n1. Mana will be provided on Sunday to Friday.\n2. Will turn to worms if not consumed on the same day as provided.\n3. Manner will not turn to worms on the Sabbath (Saturday).\n4. Collect double rations on Fridays as Sabbath must be kept holy and if you work I will likely kill you.\n\nSo unless you want a religious blockchain that takes Saturdays off, and where unused gas turns to worms the next day, I think calling 'gas' 'Mana' is a very bad idea.\n\nI personally would prefer 'fuel' as it's a far more generic concept than the American colloquialism 'gas' (when everyone else calls it petrol or alike.)\n\nSo please, keep the blockchain agnostic.\n",

    "body": "I'm on the fence. Like others I agree it is associated to gaming, but I think it can fit nicely into the rest of the Ether branding and get past that. Most people involved with ethereum are probably not the best sample as most of us associate it more heavily with games than the actual meaning behind the term. Gas does make sense in a PoW world but I think mana does have a more positive connotation especially in a PoS world. Long term I think it would work. One thing to remember is that ether is the main user-facing token and gas / mana is more developer oriented.\n\nRe @PeterBorah's thoughts on contracts, I think agents _are_ too nerdy / technical compared to contracts, much more so than gas / mana. With contracts there's a very clear link between the name and function of the thing, whereas the tradeoff between the more functional name of 'gas' and the more idealistic name of 'mana' is easier to make as gas isn't so easily paired with the functionality in the first place.\n",
