Whenever the balance drops below the system constant `KEEPALIVE_DEPOSIT` the account would be deleted. Any remaining balance would be effectively burnt, any code or storage would cease to function and the effective nonce would become zero.\r\n\r\nAn important consequence of this is that accounts would become immediately insecure and susceptible to a variety of transaction-replay attacks if the balance were ever to drop too low. This means that third-party tools, particularly wallets, will need to ensure that any transaction which would result in an account's balance dropping to the point of being deleted is:\r\n\r\na) impossible to do without the user being told it will actually *delete* the account and make it no longer usable; and\r\nb) that once done, the account is marked dead in the UI, indicating clearly that it should no longer be used to receive funds.\r\n\r\nA more complex EIP could include a mechanism allowing it to increase or decrease over time according to miners' preferences similarly to the gas limit. To avoid a malicious miner cartel reducing it too speedily and compromising accounts with small but significant balances, the speed of movement of the limit should be slow, perhaps around 1.5x per month.\r\n\r\nA still more complex variant would involve forcing miners to pay ether in order to raise the gas limit temporarily. From this behaviour, a reasonable gas price could be derived and from that a reasonable value for `KEEPALIVE_DEPOSIT`.\r\n\r\n# Rationale\r\n\r\nThe state trie is become clogged with dust accounts which, practically-speaking, are systematically created and orphaned at industrial volumes by irresponsible members of the Ethereum community. One particular offender, the operator of a popular exchange, produces around thousands of new dust accounts per day. Naively encoded, each such account adds around 100 bytes to the state trie. Overall this results in the storage and synchronisation bandwidth requirements of Ethereum needlessly increasing by up to 1 MB per day. \r\n\r\nImplementing this EIP would allow around 500k accounts to be removed from the state, immediately saving up to 50 MB from databases and state-based synchronisation bandwidth. It would also prevent any new ones from being created, providing continued cumulative savings.\r\n\r\n`KEEPALIVE_DEPOSIT` is defined as the current average cost in Ether to send a basic transaction, following from the assertion that a basic account is useless if it no longer has enough funds to send a basic transaction.\r\n\r\nContracts (at least those pre-existing) should be spared from this mechanism, through the requirement of dust accounts having no code, since their continued existence may be an important guarantee that caused prior actions to take place.",
