For each fork it has another array of execution results on that fork rules with post state root hash and transaction parameters.\r\n\r\nall value fields are in hex and prefixed with '0x'\r\naddress, secretKey and hash fields are not prefixed with '0x'\r\n\r\n**Rationale**\r\nDue to the recent network changes it would be good to make state tests more general so we don't need to copy them each time a new hard fork occur. The new tests would have a single filler for a single test. \r\nOne test per file. So instead of previous ```stInitCodeTest.json``` file with lost of tests it would be ```stInitCodeTest``` folder with files describing every individual test from ```stInitCodeTest.json```. \r\n\r\nThe new format will have results of a transaction execution on every implemented hardfork and in addition it would also allow to describe multiple transaction parameters such as ```array of data```,  ```value``` and ```gasLimit```. Thus transaction would be executed with different parameters on a single pre state. This allows to test range of test cases where we need to check x, x+1, x-1 values results.",

    "body": "We finally got around to implementing this in go-ethereum and there are a few issues with this format:\r\n\r\n* The indexes indirection is kind of weird. All we really want here is a way to say \"run these transactions on the same pre state with different fork rules\".\r\n* Transactions need to be signed by the client that's testing. This is annoying because it's unclear which signature scheme to use, i.e. I can sign all txs with Homestead rules.\r\n\r\nTo fix these, I propose that the format should be changed as follows:\r\n\r\n`\"transaction\"` should be removed. Instead, the post state should contain the RLP encoding of the (signed) transaction that is to be applied. Example:\r\n\r\n```text\r\n{\r\n    \"testname\" : {\r\n        \"env\" : { ... },\r\n        \"pre\": { ... },\r\n        \"transactions\" : {\r\n            \"EIP150\" : [\r\n                {\r\n                    \"tx\" : \"0xrlp\",\r\n                    \"postStateRoot\" : \"99a450d8ce5b987a71346d8a0a1203711f770745c7ef326912e46761f14cd764\",\r\n                    \"logs\": [ ... ]\r\n                }\r\n            ]\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}",
