  "body": "## Simple Summary\r\nAllow users to specify the latest block a transaction can be included in.\r\n\r\n## Abstract\r\nAdd an optional parameter for transactions to specify the max block number the transaction can be included in to improve UX.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nAny valid transactions broadcasted by users provide no guarantee when they will be included in a block, if ever. This means transactions can linger in the mempool indefinitely, resulting in UX issues:\r\n\r\n1. Subsequently broadcasted transactions are unable to be validated while pending tx is in mempool. \r\n \r\nAdvanced users may resubmit tx and reuse the previous nonce, but this is still undesirable UX and not guaranteed to prevent the original from being validated (in cases where original tx becomes stale).\r\n\r\n2. Lingering transactions become \"stale\" but can eventually be included in blocks anyway, both needlessly wasting gas and bloating the blockchain.\r\n\t\r\nMany DeFi transactions are time-sensitive. Below from https://uniswap.org/faq/ :\r\n\r\n```\r\nMy swap failed with code “EXPIRED”, what happened?\r\nIf a swap takes more than 20 minutes to execute, the router is programmed to fail the transaction. This is to protect the user from extreme swings in prices that can occur while the transaction is pending.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the current UX, a user making such a financial transaction who desires to not waste gas must babysit their transactions live to ensure they are included, and resubmit with same nonce and higher gas price (possibly repeatedly) until the tx is executed.\r\n\r\nContrastly with this proposal, a user can simply set a block number, and have far more assurance their tx will execute based on a non-volatile context (as it will be mined within a certain block number), or simply not have any effect.\r\n\r\nThe second order benefit is that less failed transactions occur, which both relieves pressure on congestion and the blockchain state.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\nTransactions currently include several parameters, some of them optional like `data` and `value`. A new optional parameter is to be included, `maxBlock`.\r\n\r\nWhen validating transactions, if the `maxBlock` provided and is less than the current block height, the transaction is not includable in a new block and is discarded from the mempool. Similar to if a `nonce` of a tx is less than the tx count of the EOA that originated the tx, it is never mined/validated in a block.\r\n",

This greatly limits the effectiveness of the attack because you can basically only DoS your immediate peers, who will simply kick you if you become abusive.  If you submit a gas price that is high enough to fit in the mempool, you risk having to actually pay should gas costs decline.  If you have to pay, then the attack isn't free.  😄 ",
