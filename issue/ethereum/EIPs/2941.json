  "body": "In May we had a long discussion on the Abandoned/Withdrawn issue (https://github.com/ethereum-cat-herders/EIPIP/issues/15), and prior to that it came up several times on Gitter. On the call I suggested to make use of the `resolution` field.\r\n\r\nMy opinion was that we are better with less states than fine graining them indefinitely. Abandoned and Withdrawn are so close, and it is possible to introduce fine-graining to either of these statuses to make them clear. I sense there was/is a subjective aspect (by some) to preferring withdrawn over abandoned, as a term.\r\n\r\nI suggest the following:\r\n1. Rename Abandoned to Withdrawn\r\n2. Introduce a `reason` field with the following options: \"withdrawn by author\", \"automatically withdrawn\", \"replaced/superseded by something else\"\r\n\r\nThe reason is from an outsider point of view all it matters the standard is not pursued further, but for someone really interested in the relevant topic, figuring out the reason can be / is important.\r\n\r\nIf we do introduce a \"replaced/superseded\" marking, then likely we should reconsider the role of the the `replaces` and `superseded-by` fields too.\r\n\r\nIf we go ahead with any of these, I'd also propose to retroactively update and clarify all the EIPs currently marked as \"Abandoned\", and would also suggest to merge everything today as \"Abandoned\", unless we hit a resolution very quickly.",

    "body": "Abandoned/withdrawn only applies to pre-final EIPs right (e.g., Draft)?  If so then I'm OK with with this proposal, with the caveat that only the original author can set replaced/superseded by as part of the process for moving something to withdrawn.  I really dislike the idea of someone coming in and declaring that their thing is a replacement of someone else's thing without buy-in from the original author as that can very rapidly lead to political problems that editors now have to deal with.",

    "body": "The other long outstanding idea is to have a bot which automatically \"withdraws\" EIPs which are stalled.\r\n\r\nLet's say we have such a bot, which marks long untouched EIPs as such.  Now the question is what is the best way to let people know this has happened? I have two ideas:\r\n1. The bot actually creates a PR changing the EIP to `status: Withdrawn` and `reason: automatically withdrawn` or `reason: automatically withdrawn due to inactivity` The authors are tagged with their github usernames (like with the automerger). An editor has to merge this PR.\r\n\r\n2. The bot creates a commit. In this case we want an intermediate status which is shown in an RSS feed and in a prominent place like for `Last Call`s. This I think could be either `status: Pending Withdrawal` or having a specific `reason: Pending Withdrawal`. In either case after some period this intermediate status has to be moved by the bot to the final `Withdrawn` status to stop it being presented in the RSS / prominent spot on the site.\r\n\r\n@MicahZoltu @lightclient @Souptacular @MadeofTin any preference? Any other ideas?",

I personally do not have a strong opinion whether Abandoned or Withdrawn is the right one, but I have a strong opinion that we should have a single one. Mostly because I think there more than 2 reasons to move into that status, which means we need to have extra fields even if we have both Abandoned and Withdrawn. Hence I suggest we choose one and use a `reason` field.\r\n\r\nTook a look around the RFC and W3C process. RFC uses Withdrawn and W3C uses Rescinded. Perhaps rescinded is a good term based on the dictionary?",

EIP-editors and perhaps a Bot can move an EIP to this status as long as it qualifies.\r\n\r\nIf someone wishes to withdraw or abandon an EIP an author can move it to the withdrawn state. This is not a status change that an editor nor a bot can make. Only the authors themselves can do this. Allowing Editors to move something to Withdrawn or Abandoned is a political decision. We should keep political decisions away from editors as much as possible.\r\n\r\nStagnant is useful here because it is very clear about what the status means and why an EIP has moved here.",

After that PR is merged, then someone (@axic?) can create a PR against EIP-1 that merges Stagnant and Withdrawn and introduces a `reason` field so we can avoid the politics that @MadeofTin mentioned in the above post.\r\n\r\nI don't want to delay getting the broader changes integrated ASAP (hence my desire to merge as per the call and flowchart), though I also do generally agree with @axic that a single `Withdrawn` status with a `reason` field is better than having multiple statuses that mean \"this EIP is no longer being actively pursued\".\r\n\r\nAfter both sets of changes are in (assuming agreement), editors/bots would only be able to move to to `status: Withdrawn; reason: Stagnant` or something, while authors would be able to move to `status: Withdrawn, reason: no longer pursued by author` or something.",

There is no RSS feed for this, so they have to keep checking the site time to time. If there is an RSS feed I'm not fully sold people will subscribe to stagnant notification in case their EIP is moved there.\r\n\r\nWhat was suggested [here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/2941#issuecomment-687919486) is that a PR is created marking something as `status=Withdrawn reason=\"no activity` or `status=Stagnant`. The automerger **will** notify the authors on this PR. Because authors will be notified, it makes very little difference whether it is stagnant or withdrawn, because the main point is that **the author is notified** and is given a chance to react.\r\n\r\n(To clarify, it was mentioned that even for withdrawn the reason field **must be displayed** on eips.ethereum.org.)\r\n\r\nWe have also discussed to require at least a single author to have a github username, because otherwise the automerger bot is blocked. I think this a key question we need to address besides anything else. Right now there is a huge burden on the editors to track down authors who don't want to respond. Since the EIP workflow is centred around Github, requiring a github username **and** response in a reasonable timeframe is something we should have.",

Anytime an EIP is 'withdrawn', it's status changed to \"Deprecated\" with a mention of the reason.

Review - a new but justified status \r\n2. Deprecated (with a reason field) - instead of 'rejected' status, with the reason field to clearly state the reason - \r\n a) author's choice, \r\n b) no activity, \r\n c) failed to move to the next status.  \r\n3.

This status **is not proposed by the author but is assigned in his absence** by an editor or a bot. (we've seen examples of 'sad' PR)\r\n- The idea is liked by part of the community, hence proposed. But the author does not have time to pursue it has no problem being pursued by a champion (who later be added as an author, with the author's consent). The **original author and EIP number remain the same** and that helps the community to relate easily. (eg. EIP-1057)\r\n\r\n>  I would rather see someone just create a new EIP where they are the author that is an exact copy of the original than have editors play a role where we re-assign authorship.\r\n\r\nAs I understood, this is the definition of 'Withdrawn' status that is proposed. Which seems like, **EIP can not be resurrected** but can be brought back to the system with a new number (as good as a new proposal).\r\n\r\n[![Screen Shot 2020-09-12 at 5 37 14 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29681685/92992589-1dd7d580-f4ba-11ea-8c19-dd236faa0f38.png)](https://github.com/ethereum-cat-herders/EIPIP/blob/master/All%20EIPIP%20Meetings/Meeting%20009.md#brainstorm-more-about-the-withdrawnstagnant)\r\n\r\n> I also don't see the of having an EIP that is withdrawn be permanently withdrawn if we allow abandoned to re-enter the lifecycle.

By having Deprecated be a terminal status, I worry that we'll just be encouraging people to abandon their EIPs rather than Deprecate their EIPs since the latter is not permanent.\r\n\r\nI think, '**Withdrawn**' is a status that **is proposed by the author** itself and not because of inactivity but because of at least one 'reason' that is convincing enough (at least for the author) to take that decision. It could be anything \r\n\r\n- technically not feasible\r\n- some better proposal came up while his/her proposal is still in draft\r\n\r\nThese seem valid reasons to me. An author may decide to 'Withdraw' the proposal and I think the best place for such a proposal is to be terminated (if possible adding a reason field for people to know). eg.
