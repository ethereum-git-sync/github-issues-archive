  "body": "# Overview\n\nSplit the specified gas cost of `SSTORE` and `SLOAD` to processing and storage cost elements.\n# Specification\n\n`SSTORE` to have the following gas costs:\n- processing: 50 gas\n- storage charges:\n  - set to non-zero from zero: 19950\n  - any other case: 4950\n- storage refunds:\n  - set to zero from non-zero (ie. deletion): 15000\n\ni.e. setting to non-zero from zero is a total of 20000, while setting to zero is a refund of 10000. (No change here to current behaviour)\n# Rationale\n\nBased on the [Merkle Patricia Tree Specification](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/blob/78990aca283f67ceb26ed70c8eb82008424aaf64/pages/patricia-tree/[english]-patricia-tree.md), inserts and lookups should be the same complexity.\n\nAs `SLOAD` currently takes 50 gas to load (lookup), we can assume that is the processing cost for traversing the trie. `SSTORE` should have the same cost for processing.\n\nMaking this split now will be beneficial when blockchain rent needs to define the rent figures as opposed to the processing costs.\n",
