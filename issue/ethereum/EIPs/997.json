In fact, as far as I've understood, it's actually not an interface in the formal sense. Also the two listed example implementation use just a regular contract instead of an interface (ConsenSys and OpenZeppelin).\r\n\r\nTo make it clear, a contract declaration could be presented in the documentation.  Something like:\r\n\r\n**Contract declaration**\r\n`contract ExampleContract { ...`",
