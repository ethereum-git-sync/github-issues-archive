  "body": "DApp websites currently implement their own workarounds when using standard HTTP and URL formats. In order to foster the web3 identity, setting semi-cosmetic standards for DApps would serve as a cornerstone.\r\n\r\nFor example, instead of having a scattered collection of DApp links:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.cryptokitties.co/\r\nhttps://idex.market/\r\nhttps://etheroll.com/\r\n\r\nwhich do not explicitly state belonging to the web3 ecosystem, we could set the cosmetic standard:\r\n\r\nhttps://web3.cryptokitties.co/\r\nhttps://web3.idex.market/\r\nhttps://web3.etheroll.com/\r\n\r\nThis is just semi-cosmetic. If DApps widely adopt the web3 subdomain, search engines such as Google might pick up on this. Even if it doesn't, simply by generating the identity can create a sense of unity.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, DApps that are implementing sign-in authentication without third-party interaction i.e. message signing, don't have an HTTP method that cleanly represents such authentication scheme.",
