And payment methods are not always obvious and understandable to end-users. Therefore I propose to develop a subscription standard which implies a more flexible and intuitive interface for paying for services\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n<!--The motivation is critical for EIPs that want to change the Ethereum protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the EIP solves. EIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->\r\nThis EIP is motivated by the need to standardize the way of payment for services. There is a lot of crypto-services that can interact together. Also, many services that charge end-users through direct transfers to wallets that do not provide a sufficient level of transparency.\r\n\r\nFor example some stories:\r\n\r\n#### As a user, I want:\r\n* Subscribe to the service\r\n* To cancel the subscription\r\n* View current subscriptions\r\n* To change the subscription owner\r\n\r\n#### As a service owner, I want:\r\n* To create different plans\r\n* Choose the payment method\r\n* Receive funds immediately or after the end of the period\r\n* View details on each subscription\r\n\r\nNo existing EIPs for subscription found.\r\n## Specification\r\n<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Ethereum platforms (go-ethereum, parity, cpp-ethereum, ethereumj, ethereumjs, and [others](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Clients)).-->\r\n[WIP]\r\nIt can be a standalone subscription contract that store and proceeds purchases in ethers or tokens\r\n\r\nOr it can be built-in with ERC-20 utility token \r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\n<!--The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->\r\n[WIP]\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
