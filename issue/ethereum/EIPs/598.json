  "body": "### Summary\r\n\r\nExtend the ABI standard to include support for decimal fixed point values.\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nDecimal fixed point values are used in Viper and may be used in other HLLs on ethereum in the future. Unlike traditional binary fixed point and decimal fixed point, decimal fixed point has a \"what you see is what you get\" property in that any value that can be written in decimal, and any sum and difference (and to a limited extent product) of such values, can be stored as a decimal fixed point value precisely without any rounding, whereas in a binary representation values such as 0.3 need to get rounded. For this reason, decimal fixed point values are already recommended for use in many financial applications.\r\n\r\n### Specification\r\n\r\nAdd to the ABI standard the variable type `decimal<n>` (eg. `decimal3`, `decimal10`), where `n` specifies the number of decimal places. A value `x` is encoded as `left_zpad32(int_to_big_endian(x * 10**n) % 2**256)` (the modulus ensures that negative numbers can also be encoded).\r\n\r\nDecoding is in two steps:\r\n\r\n1. Check whether the first byte is greater than or equal to 0x80 (ie. the value is negative)\r\n2. If the first byte is >= 0x80, then decode the decimal value via `(big_endian_to_int(bytes) - 2**256) / 10**n`. Otherwise, use `big_endian_to_int(bytes) / 10**n`.",
