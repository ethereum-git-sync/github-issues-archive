  "body": "```\r\neip: 2294\r\ntitle: Explicit bound to Chain ID size\r\nauthor: Bryant Eisenbach (@fubuloubu), Alex Beregszaszi (@axic)\r\ndiscussions-to: <URL>\r\nstatus: Draft\r\ntype: Standards Track\r\ncategory: Core\r\ncreated: 2019-09-19\r\nrequires: EIP-155\r\n```\r\n## Simple Summary\r\nAdds a maximum value to the EIP-155 Chain ID parameter to avoid potential encoding issues that may occur when using large values of the parameter.\r\n\r\n## Abstract\r\nThis EIP restricts the size of EIP-155 Chain ID parameter to a particular maximum value, in order to ensure that there is a standard around how this parameter is to be used between different projects.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n<!--The motivation is critical for EIPs that want to change the Ethereum protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the EIP solves. EIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->\r\nEIP-155 introduces the Chain ID parameter, which is an important parameter used for domain separation (replay protection) of Ethereum protocol signed messages. However, it does not specify any properties about the size that this parameter takes. @axic mentions this concern in  [EIP-1344 (comment)](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-1344-add-chain-id-opcode/1131/109) and suggests a reasonable maximum enforced size in order to ensure that there are no issues when encoding this parameter. This would allow a sufficient amount of different values for this parameter, which is typically chosen by community consensus as a genesis parameter for a given chain and thus does not change often.\r\n\r\nThere have been suggestions of using a hash-based identifier in place on Chain ID to allow the value to adapt over time to different contentious forks and other scenarios. This proposal does not describe this behavior, but ~63 bits of entropy should be enough to ensure that no collisions are likely for reasonable (e.g. non-malicious) uses of this feature for that purpose.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Ethereum platforms (go-ethereum, parity, cpp-ethereum, ethereumj, ethereumjs, and [others](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Clients)).-->\r\nThe maximum value of Chain ID is 9,223,372,036,854,775,771 (`MAX_CHAIN_ID`). This value is `floor(MAX_UINT64 / 2) - 36`, and is chosen to avoid overflow when performing uint64 math. For reference, a value of 0 or less is also disallowed.\r\n\r\nA client should reject a value outside of this range in a provided transaction, and disallow a genesis configuration with a value for Chain ID outside of this limit. Due to how the calculation for chain ID is performed, the maximum value seen during the arithmetic is `CHAIN_ID * 2 + 36`, so clients must test to ensure no overflow conditions are encountered when the highest value is used. No underflow is possible.\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\n<!--The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->\r\nWithout a well-chosen value of Chain ID, there could be differences in the implementation of EIP-155 (and EIP-1344 by derivative) in both client codebase and external tooling that could lead to consensus-critical vulnerabilities being introduced to the network. By making this limit explicit, we avoid this scenario for Ethereum and any project which uses the Ethereum codebase.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n<!--All EIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The EIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. EIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.-->\r\nThis EIP introduces a change that affects previous implementations of this feature. However, since no known chain makes use of a value outside of the suggested bounds, there should not be an issue in adopting this limit on the size of this parameter, therefore the impact should be non-existent.\r\n\r\n## Test Cases\r\n<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for EIPs that are affecting consensus changes. Other EIPs can choose to include links to test cases if applicable.-->\r\n[Aleth PR](https://github.com/ethereum/aleth/pull/5742)\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n<!--The implementations must be completed before any EIP is given status \"Final\", but it need not be completed before the EIP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of \"rough consensus and running code\" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.-->\r\nTBD\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
