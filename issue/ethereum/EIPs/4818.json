  "body": "Beacon chain RANDAO mixes are much less biasable than `difficulty` and `blockHash` values in PoW network. But they are still biasable up to a limited extent which is expanded in the [Security Considerations](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4399#security-considerations) section of the EIP.\r\n\r\nOne of nice to have things limiting biasability is to have a `RANDOM(n)` instruction, where `n` is a *slot* number, which returns a RANDAO mix produced in a specified slot disregarding whether this slot is empty or not (if empty, RANDAO mix from latest non-empty slot is returned). It prevents an attack where proposer/builder pushes back transaction that rolls the dice until a mix with desired outcome is met. Security properties of return value of this instruction may be hardened up by returning a recent VDF result.\r\n\r\nSo, we might want `RANDOM` instruction to have *a parameter* in the future and this is where the `RANDOM` name proposed in EIP-4399 may become a source of confusion.\r\n\r\nOptions:\r\n1. Keep `DIFFICULTY -> RANDOM` renaming, and name the future opcode if that need be `SECURE_RANDOM(n)` or `RANDOM2(n)` (the latter is a sort of a joke as it looks terrible). Or any reserve any other name for the future -- we have a plenty of time for this\r\n2. Rename `DIFFICULTY -> ?`, we need to define `?` in the next *few* days. `RANDOM` stays reserved for the future\r\n3. Keep `DIFFICULTY` to reflect how difficult it is to pick up a name",
