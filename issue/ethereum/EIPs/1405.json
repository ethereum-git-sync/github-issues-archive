  "body": "### Simple Summary\r\n\r\nAn extension of the standard interface ERC721 for tokens with identity \r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n \r\n   With the Standard ERC721 ,the item can be unique with pair (contractAddress,nftId) ,that can just be called as notation  not for identity.Any one can easily copy and use  this pair .\r\n     So ERC721 is just to handle the ownership between wallet and cyrpto item. If cypto item has  attached to a private key ,many interesting things will come. With private key ,the item can sign transaction ,so as to contract function call . Then its is  easy to record the life  of this item. The item can also own other nft ,that is just  like the real world .The most important part is that  the item itselft can  decide where to transfer .So just think this situation ,we want to made a nft for a real world collection such as a picture. So there exists two types of that picture, one is the picture in the real world ,another is the picture as a nft in blockchain . The strange part is that ,one person keep the real world one in his hand ,and transfer the nft to others . One picture ,two parts belongs to different person, so  it is hard to explain that with standrad ERC721.But if the item has private key ,things become diffrerent .When  the painter make a picture ,he just create a nft for that with private key .The private key can be add to the picture as a QR code or other ways . With this private key ,you can always ( there may be some limit ,we'll explain later),transfer the nft to what ever you want . So if you own the real world picture, you also own the nft. As for private key print on picture,some encryption chip can give a more safe way.\r\n\r\n### Specification\r\ncontract ERC1405 is ERC721 {\r\n    event PeriodTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 expiresAt);\r\n    event OwnershipRevoked(address token ,address from);\r\n\r\n    function periodTransfer(address _to, uint256 expiresAt );\r\n    function revokeOwnership(); \r\n  \r\n}\r\n  ",
