  "body": "### Proposed Change\r\n\r\nI was submitting an EIP recently and I encountered this error when I was trying to specify both my Github account and an email in the `author` section: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/6485#issuecomment-1426029120\r\n\r\nI've asked if this is possible to specify both Github name and email at the same time and I got a reply that it is not possible and we need to update the [EIP-1](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1) to allow this: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/6485#issuecomment-1427166175\r\n\r\nI decided to update the EIP-1 and found out that in fact it already allows both Github name and email to be assigned at the same time. This is described in the [author-header section of EIP-1](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1#author-header) if I understand it correctly.\r\n\r\nI would suggest to modify the bots to allow Github AND email for author of the EIP as it is described in EIP-1.",
