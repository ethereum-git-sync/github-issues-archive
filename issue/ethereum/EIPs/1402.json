  "body": "title: Signature Composition and Verification\r\ncategory: ERC\r\nstatus: Draft - Request For Comment\r\ncreated: 2018-09-11\r\n------\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nSubmitting transactions on the Eth blockchain suck really bad. On the one hand you don't want your users to pay too much in fees, yet going for that is a sure way to get them frustrated with long confirmation times (days, if ever). The prime motivation of this ERC is to find an alternative to **submitting transactions**.\r\n\r\nInstead, users just sign **intents** with their private key and move along: **Instant Feedback**\r\n\r\nHence the less we rely on submitting transactions the better the UX. Any Dapps following this path will be more centralized in design, and the purpose of including anything on a blockchain will be for verification,  dispute resolution and non-repudiation.\r\n\r\n### Technical\r\n\r\nAll user actions, aka **intents**, inside the Dapp should follow this condition when the user **signs**, confirms an action:\r\n\r\n```\r\nt( h( g( f(pub_key)))) == pub_key\r\n```\r\nFor instance if a game got 1000 levels, as long as every incremental signing satisfy this condition we can be sure that the user got to that level or did all steps.\r\n\r\n### Derived Reputation based on actions\r\n\r\nMore signing could mean more contributions to a Dapp ecosystem, hence the user gains more reputation points and power to affect/mutate it.\r\n\r\n![reputation based on actions](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11381259/45038147-acddc780-b02e-11e8-9f0f-6d7998c52701.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Help\r\n\r\nI have no idea, on how to implement this yet. Any papers, code samples, demos would be highly appreciated. Let's brainstorm and find a way here.\r\n\r\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
