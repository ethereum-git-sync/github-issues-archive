  "body": "This is a proposal to split the EIP process in **E**thereum **P**roposals for **I**nterfaces of **C**ontracts that only specify contract interfaces (think ERC #20,ERC #721,ERC #801,..) and other EIPs (no change here).\r\nThis will have the following advantages:\r\n 1. easier to find and get an overview of all contract interfaces (my current pain point)\r\n 2. can be less opinionated than changes that might fork hard -> less governance pain\r\n 3. less noise when you want to keep up to date if you are just interested in contract interfaces (could improve interoperability between projects/contracts - not all contract devs can read all EIPs)\r\n 4. maybe less potential legal problems (but IANAL!) could also help getting very talented editors back on board that just have problems with certain kind of proposals (cc @pirapira)\r\n 5. less work for editors involved in this process\r\n 6. more decentralized in a sense\r\n 7. smaller numbers - easier to remember interface numbers - when being embedded in EIP process we get into 4 digits soon\r\n 8. easier to require formal defaults like methods and events\r\n\r\nTo decease mental workload requirements for the transition we could use the old numbers - but fill the gaps (see point 7)\r\n\r\nERC-20 -> EPIC-20\r\nERC-721 -> EPIC-721\r\nERC-801 -> EPIC-801\r\n\r\nOpinions and links to EIPs that could become EPIC very welcome! Was on the search for EIPs that define contract interfaces and this is possible but painful manual work - one reason for this very proposal.\r\n",

That's already the term for EIPs that don't modify consensus.\r\n\r\nOne (weak) reason: \"rebooting\" the numbering.\r\n\r\nCurrently, still - and in conflict with EIP-1 - ERCs and other EIPs tend to get a number assigned ad-hoc, commonly using the number of a github issue that a PR closes. This creates gaps in the numbering, as well as draws from the same number pool. (I hoped this would be remedied by a more strict adherence to the merge-as-draft workflow.)\r\n\r\nOn this point, I disagree with leaving \"already accepted\" ERCs' numbers as-is:\r\n\r\n> 7. smaller numbers - easier to remember interface numbers - when being embedded in EIP process we get into 4 digits soon\r\n> (...)\r\n>\r\n> To decease mental workload requirements for the transition we could use the old numbers - but fill the gaps (see point 7)\r\n>\r\n> ERC-20 -> ECIP-20\r\n> (...)\r\n\r\nThe confusion caused by renaming ERC-20 to EPIC-2 is momentary: i.e., experienced by current developers only (which are not that numerous).\r\n\r\nThe confusion caused by EPIC-721 having been proposed/draft-merged _years_ before EPIC-720 will be permanent: experienced by current _and_ future developers, forever.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n> Is there a reason for a separate process for EIPS-about-smart-contract-interfaces and other EIPs?

Perhaps also an increased S/N ratio.\r\n\r\nFor EPICs, it might well be that competing/conflicting approaches go through the full cycle from draft to obsolete, all without danger of network-wide consensus failure (or the like). This often can't be said about those-other-EIPs.\r\n\r\nCounter-argument: segregation promotes (self-)disempowerment, and eases the formation of cabals. Such categorisation may start out as \"separation of concerns\", and soon become a barrier.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt _might_ be that I'm playing devil's advocate above.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n^1: (sans infinite tape)\r\n",

It would be the first step of a migration anyway. We can start by labelling all the CLIPs/EPICs as such, ensure there is clear agreement on what falls into that category, and pick up the discussion from there. Such a labelling would be immediately value creating and non-invasive. It woul also clarify further discussion since we would know what number of EIPs we are talking about, their spread, etc.\r\n\r\nOverall I'm very much in favor of splitting. The common interfaces that clients would want to implement and the protocol layer changes seem mostly separate.\r\n\r\nWrt numbering, why fill in the gaps? Keep counting from the highest number in each repo. It avoids the confusion of out-of-order CLIPs/EPICs, which I think is worse than the high numbers.",
