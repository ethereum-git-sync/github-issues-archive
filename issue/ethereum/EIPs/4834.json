  "body": "## Preamble\r\n```\r\neip: 4834\r\ntitle: Hierarchical Domains Standard\r\ndescription: The Heirarchal Domains Standard is a standard for extremely generic name resolution.\r\nauthor: Pandapip1 (@Pandapip1)\r\ndiscussions-to: https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-4834-hierarchical-domains-standard/8388\r\nstatus: Draft\r\ntype: Standards Track\r\ncategory: ERC\r\ncreated: 2022-02-22\r\nrequires: 165\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Abstract\r\nThe Hierarchical Domains Standard is a standard for extremely generic name resolution. conversely it makes it simple to extend - any smart contract that implements the ERC-4834 interface could be set as a subdomain. This differs from ERC-137 because it does not provide a separate \"resolver\" contract - any behaviour should be part of the ERC-4834 contract itself.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nThe motivation behind this ERC is that existing standards like ERC-137 are relatively complex and have limitations. The advantage of ERC-4834 is that it provides a minimal interface that supports name resolution. This permits use-cases such as referencing an ERC-20 or ERC-1155 token by a name directly, without using a \"resolver.\"\r\n\r\nThis ERC also implements flexible access control. This allows for clever implementations, such as having a token that can be redeemed for subdomains of the token, and domains that are themselves NFTs that grant the ability to manage the domain to the owner of said NFT. There can also be multiple managers of a single domain with different access, instead of a single \"owner.\"\r\n\r\nIn addition, TLDs (like .com), subdomains, and even the \"root\" itself (analogous to the ENS registry) are all implemented as ERC-4834 smart contracts, meaning that name-resolution is a relatively simple recursive algorithm, and there is no limit to the amount of nesting that is possible (e.g. 0.1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9.a.b.c.d.e.f.g.h.i.j.k.l.m.n.o.p.q.r.s.t.u.v.w.x.y.z could be valid if the root contains z, and z contains y, and etc).\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\nSolidity Interface: https://gist.github.com/Pandapip1/dbd4a3c56f612daad80ddb33fb69e715\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\nAs previously mentioned in the abstract and motivation, the design of this ERC is different than that of ERC-137. ERC-137 has a strong tiering - the registrars update the ENS registry, which points to resolvers. In ERC-4834, every domain is effectively a registry, resolver, and registrar all in one. This is specifically designed to be a universal addressing system.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\nThere is no compatibility with ERC-137. While the two ERCs are somewhat similar, the rationale for each is different. An ERC-4834 contract that wraps the ERC-137 contract could be created, however, that would support .eth domains, so compatibility is possible.\r\n\r\n## Reference Implementation\r\nUntested, non-final: https://gist.github.com/Pandapip1/196d4cf7a39bfcdffc6c29e2817f60c0\r\n\r\n## Security Considerations\r\nNeeds discussion.\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\r\n",
