  "body": "The official ERC20 document and perhaps others, declare named return parameters of the same name as the function for `name`, `symbol`, `decimals` and `totalSupply`. This raises shadow declaration warnings in the compiler which a standard really should not do.\r\n\r\nAdditionally it breaks the opportunity for recursive calling. As unlikely as that might be for a getter, it breaks logic to have a parameter declaration prevent a declared function from being called and by this could be considered a bug. \r\n\r\nWhile ERC20 has long been standardised, I think the parameter naming convention needs revision.  My own styling uses prefixed and suffixed underscores for passed and return parameter names.\r\n\r\ne.g. `function foo(uint _in) returns (uint out_);`   \r\n\r\n[https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md)",
