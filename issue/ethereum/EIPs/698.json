  "body": "## Preamble\r\n    \r\n\tEIP: 698\r\n \tTitle: OPCODE 0x46 BLOCKREWARD\r\n\tAuthor: Cody Burns <dontPanic@codywburns.com>\r\n\tType: Standard Track\r\n\tCategory: Core\r\n\tStatus: Draft\r\n\tCreated: 2017-28-08\r\n\r\n## Simple Summary\r\n\r\nThis EIP adds an additional opcode to the EVM which will return a finalized blocks reward value. \r\n\r\n## Abstract\r\n\r\nIn the EVM, the 0x40 opcodes are reserved for `Block Information`. Currently reserved opcodes are:\r\n* `0X40 BLOCKHASH`\r\n* `0X41 COINBASE`\r\n* `0X42 TIMESTAMP`\r\n* `0X43 NUMBER`\r\n* `0X44 DIFFICULTY`\r\n* `0X45 GASLIMIT`\r\n\r\nThis EIP would add an additional opcode, `0x46 BLOCKREWARD`, which would return the block reward for any finalized block. The finalized block reward would include the base reward, uncle payments, and gas.   \r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\n\r\nPer EIP-649 ( #669 ) periodic block reward reductions/variance are now planned in the roadmap, however, this EIP is consensus system agnostic and is most useful in decentralized pool operations and for any contract that benefits from knowing a block reward payout(i.e. Merge mined tokens) \r\n\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter block `n` all clients should process opcode `0x46` as follows:  \r\n\r\n* Value: `0x46`\r\n* Mnemonic: `BLOCKREWARD`\r\n* δ:` 0` nothing removed from stack\r\n* α:`1` block reward added to stack\r\n* Description: `Get the block's reward emission` \r\n* GasCost: `G<sub>base</sub>`\r\n\r\nWhere:`µ'<sub>s</sub>[0] ≡ I<sub>HR</sub>`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\n\r\n### Contract Mining Pools\r\n\r\nFor distributed consensus systems(staking pools and mining pools) ad hoc groups combine resources in order to reduce variance in payouts. Broadly, pool operations function by allowing a collective of  miners / stakers  to verify their contribution to solving PoW or staking share by periodically submitting solutions which are is representative of the miners probability of finding a true block. \r\n\r\nIn all these schemes `B` stands for a block reward minus pool fee and `p` is a probability of finding a block in a share attempt ( `p=1/D`, where `D` is current block difficulty).\r\n\r\nSome common methods of mining pool payout are pay-per-share, `R = B * p`, proportional [`R = B * (n/N)` where `n` is amount of a miners shares, and `N` is amount of all shares in this round.], and pay-per-last-N-shares [`R = B * (n/N)` where miner's reward is calculated on a basis of `N` last shares, instead of all shares for the last round]. All of these methods are predicated on knowing the block reward paid for a given block. In order to provide a trust minimized solution, `0x46` can be used to call a blocks reward for computing payouts.     \r\n\r\n### Merge mined tokens\r\n\r\nContracts could create tokens which could be variably ‘minted’ as a function of block reward by calling `0x46`  \r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\n\r\n### Currently deployed contracts\r\n\r\nNo impact\r\n\r\n### Current clients\r\n\r\nThis EIP would be incompatible with currently deployed clients that are not able to handle `0x46` and would process all transactions and block containing the opcode as invalid. \r\n\r\nImplementation should occur as part of a coordinated hardfork.\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\n\r\n## Further reading\r\n\r\n[Mining Pools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining_pool)\r\n\r\nThe Yellow Paper Appendix H.
