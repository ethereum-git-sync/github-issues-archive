  "body": "### Specification\r\n\r\nIf `block.number >= CONSTANTINOPLE_FORK_BLKNUM`, the gas cost for the following precompiles is reduced:\r\n\r\n* `ECMUL`: reduced from 40000 to 10000\r\n* `GPAIRINGBASE`: reduced from 100000 to 40000\r\n* `GPAIRINGPERPOINT`: reduced from 80000 to 40000\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nCurrently, operations using the alt_bn128 curve are much more expensive than secp256k1 signatures: an ECRECOVER implicitly contains 3 ECMUL operations, but ECMUL is ~13 times more expensive than ECRECOVER. There is nothing fundamentally mathematically more complex about the alt_bn128 curve that justifies this; the original numbers were calculated from implementations that existed at the time, and it just so happened that the secp256k1 implementations were much better optimized than those for alt_bn128. Recently, geth introduced a new library that allows it to do elliptic curve math faster, so a recomputation of the gas costs, to reduce the currently very high gas cost of applications using ring signatures, BLS signatures and ZK SNARKs, is worth considering.",

    "body": "This is currently proposed in [EIP-1108](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1108.md), though with different numbers (generally smaller by a factor of 10 rather than a factor of ~2 based on the benchmarks posted by geth).\r\n\r\nNot sure how the EIP process proceeds in these cases; I'm happy to update EIP-1108 with the numbers from here if they have a better basis, and the motivation here gives more historical context that can also be included in 1108. But if the more common practice is to supersede the existing EIP, I'm also down to do whatever is needed for that.",
