  "body": "***\r\n\r\neip: <to be assigned>  \r\ntitle: Contact Card  \r\nauthor: Kiyoung Jung(@fxpoet) , KyoungMin Baek(@marsland83) \r\ndiscussions-to: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1572 \r\nstatus: Draft  \r\ntype: Standards Track  \r\ncategory : ERC  \r\ncreated: 2018-11-08  \r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Simple Summary \r\nA Smart Contract Based Digital Business Card that allows you to modify information after deployment.\r\nThis ERC defines a standard interface for reading information in any contact applications or wallets.\r\n\r\n## Abstract \r\nThis RPC proposes a specification about standard contact information interface in Ethereum contract.\r\n\r\n## Motivation \r\nWhen you have networking at a conference, you should exchange lots of business cards with each other.\r\nAfter that, you have to manually input them with finger typing into the contact application.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if the information is already in the blockchain and the interface is already defined,\r\nyou can import the information by just scanning the QR code drawn on the business card.\r\n\r\nSometimes, we need to change business cards after deployment.\r\nFor various reasons, such as wanting to know that a job has changed, department changes, etc.\r\nthis Smart Contract can change the information simply without redistributing business card.\r\n\r\nThe existing QR-based contacts require to install their application and they used private schema.\r\nTherefore, they were not popularized.\r\n\r\nWhy Smart Contract?\r\n- Unique addresses without any duplication \r\n- They will store in the blockchain, so they don't depend on application or service provider.\r\n- For QR code recognition, you do not need to multiple install an app for each service.\r\n  You can install just one of your favorite apps that follow this specification.\r\n- No online maintenance costs.\r\n- You can control ownership of a contract directly.\r\n\r\nIt's really simple. I want to create a standard form for use as a digital business card.\r\nWe can think of two forms like the Bussiness Card.\r\n\r\n1. Standard Business Card \r\n    - It is a normal business card that informs company and contact information to a person.\r\n2. Commercial Contact Card \r\n    - It is an information card for a store which needs reservation, order, delivery.\r\n\r\nEspecially in case 2, that smart contract can help you peer to peer deal without an online shop.\r\n\r\n## Specification \r\n\r\n### 1. Interface \r\n```\r\ncontract ContactCardInferface {\r\n    \r\n    struct basicContact {\r\n        string name;\r\n        string surname;\r\n        string country;\r\n        string company;\r\n        string title;\r\n        string email;\r\n        string mobile;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    enum Status { DISABLE, ENABLE, REDIRECT }\r\n\r\n    string  public version = \"ERC1xxx\"; // schema version\r\n    string  public encrypted;           // empty or \"AES\"    \r\n    uint8   public status;              // 0 disable, 1 enable, 2 redirect\r\n    string  public redirect;            // redirect address or URL\r\n    uint256 public modified;            // last modified time\r\n\r\n    string  public template;            // web page url for display \r\n    string  public imageURL;            // image url for display\r\n    \r\n    basicContact public contact;\r\n    string public extKeys;              // extention keys, \r\n                                        // ex. \"facebook,telegram\"\r\n\r\n    event Modified(string keyField, uint256 modified);\r\n\r\n    function setValue(string key, string value) onlyOwner public;\r\n    function getValue(string key) public view returns (string);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 2. Usage \r\n\r\nIt is very intuitive and easy to use and you can expand data fields.\r\n\r\n```\r\n.contact -> return basic struct (name, company...)\r\n\r\n.setValue(\"github\", \"fxpoet\")\r\n.setValue(\"telegram\", \"fxpoet\")\r\n\r\n.extKeys -> \"github,telegram\"\r\n\r\n.getValue(\"github\") -> \"fxpoet\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 3. I18n\r\n\r\nPeople sometimes use two names when living in another country.\r\n\r\nCountry code uses ISO 3166-1 alpha-2. <https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1>\r\n\r\n```\r\n.contact.country -> \"kr\"   // Korea\r\n.contact.name -> \"Kiyoung\" // name you use in your country.\r\n\r\n.setValue(\"name_us\", \"Yodelay\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 4. Encryption for Privacy\r\n\r\nYou can store information as encrypted string.\r\nof course, you have to give the decryption code to that person.\r\nIn this case, the QR code drawn your business card can be used as a decryption key.\r\n\r\nThe \"Encrypted\" variable describes which encryption algorithm was used.\r\n\r\n```\r\nstring public encrypted; // empty or \"AES\"    \r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\nInterface Codes:  \r\n\r\n<https://github.com/fxpoet/erc_contact_card/blob/master/ContactCardInterface.sol>\r\n\r\nContact Card Example:  \r\n\r\n<https://github.com/fxpoet/erc_contact_card/blob/master/ContactCard.sol>\r\n",
