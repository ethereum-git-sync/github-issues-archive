  "body": "Currently we rely in non-standard middleware to handle the state of the active chain of the Wallet. This state could be standarized in the current `eth_sendTransaction` JSON-RPC method by adding a second parameter to include the chainId.\r\n\r\nEIP-155 already takes this into account to protect transactions from being replayed as this chainId is included in the signature `v` value however this is not communicated in a standard way between a Wallet and a Dapp\r\n\r\nDapps today would barely notice this change as the chainId could easily default to the middleware state already handled by libraries like web3.js, ethers.js, ledger.js and etc, but it would allow use to gain instant multi-chain compatibility for Dapps with a (IMO very small) change to the current method.\r\n\r\n**BEFORE**\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n  \"id\":1,\r\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\r\n  \"method\": \"eth_sendTransaction\",\r\n  \"params\": [txn]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**AFTER**\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n  \"id\":1,\r\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\r\n  \"method\": \"eth_sendTransaction\",\r\n  \"params\": [txn, chainId]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change would also target `eth_sendRawTransaction` and `eth_signTransaction`\r\n",
