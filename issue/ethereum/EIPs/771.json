  "body": "## Preamble\r\n\r\n    EIP: <to be assigned>\r\n    Title: SelfDestruct waiting List ( a Garbage Filter for 'Statically Referred Common Libraries' )\r\n    Author: ghasshee@gmail.com\r\n    Type: Meta\r\n    Status: Draft\r\n    Created: 2017-11-17\r\n\r\n\r\n## Simple Summary\r\n\r\nTo be a common web tool, Ethereum would have various kinds of safety nets which guarantee the data, especially that of library contracts, is safely kept. In this issue, I would like to propose one kind of safety net, which is `SelfDestruct Waiting List`. When `SELFDESTRUCT` is called, the contract will get held by the list in some term `t`.\r\n\r\n## Abstract\r\n\r\nWe have 2 new Lists, `ListOfReferrers` and `SelfDestructWaitingList`.\r\n\r\nThe `ListOfReferrers` is a list of sets, each set is named with a contract address e.g. `A`.\r\nthe set `A` is a set of contract addresses which statically call contract `A` directly.\r\n* Every time a contract is deployed, we add its static reference information to the list.\r\n* If contract `A` executes `SELFDESTRUCT`,  then add `A` to the `SelfDestructWaitingList`.\r\nThen for all member `x` of the `SelfDestructWaitingList`,\r\n  - make a new list `AllReferrers(x)` which lists all direct and indirect referrers,\r\n  - and if `AllReferrers(x)` ⊆ `SelfDestructWaitingList` then `SELFDESTRUCT` `x` and clean `x` completely from both lists else do nothing.\r\n  - After the term `t` has passed, Remove `A` from `SelfDestructWaitingList`.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nThe problem is we do not have a proper `Garbage Filter`.\r\nThis is an attempt to formalize how to deal with what is going to be garbage.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\ne.g. 1\r\n~~~\r\nlet ListOfReferrers(A) = {}\r\n\r\nif contract 'A' which statically refers only contract 'A' is deployed, then\r\nListOfReferrers(A) += {}  // Do not include itself to Referrers\r\n\r\nSo if SELFDESTRUCT 'A' is called,\r\nAllRefers(A) = {} and 'A' self-destructs immediately,\r\nand clean 'A' from both lists completely.\r\n~~~\r\n\r\ne.g. 2\r\n~~~\r\nlet ListOfReferrers(A) = {}, ListOfReferrers(B) = {}, ListOfReferrers(C) = {}\r\nif contract 'A' which statically refers 'B' is deployed, then ListOfReferrers(B) += A\r\nif contract 'B' which statically refers 'C' is deployed, then ListOfReferrers(C) += B\r\nif contract 'C' which statically refers 'A' is deployed, then ListOfReferrers(A) += C\r\n\r\nnow the whole List is like;\r\nListOfReferrers = {\r\n    A : {C},\r\n    B : {A},\r\n    C : {B}\r\n}\r\n\r\nthen call SELFDESTRUCTs.\r\nlet SelfDestructWaitingList = {}\r\n\r\nif SELFDESTRUCT 'A' is called\r\nthen SelfDestructWaitingList += A and make AllRefers(A) = {B,C}.\r\nThen 'for all x ∈ SelfDestructWaitingList, if AllReferrers(x) ⊆ SelfDestructWaitingList then SELFDESTRUCT x else do nothing' is executed.\r\nFor now nothing happens.\r\n\r\nif SELFDESTRUCT 'B' is called\r\nthen SelfDestructWaitingList += B (so = {A,B})\r\nand make AllReferes(A) = {B,C} and AllReferes(B) = {C,A}.\r\nThen 'for all x ∈ SelfDestructWaitingList, if AllReferrers(x) ⊆ SelfDestructWaitingList then SELFDESTRUCT x else do nothing' is executed.\r\nFor now nothing happens.\r\n\r\nif SELFDESTRUCT 'C' is called\r\nthen SelfDestructWaitingList += C (so = {A,B,C})\r\nand make AllReferes(A) = {B,C}, AllReferes(B) = {C,A}, and AllReferres(C) = {A,B}.\r\nThen 'for all x ∈ SelfDestructWaitingList, if AllReferrers(x) ⊆ SelfDestructWaitingList then SELFDESTRUCT x else do nothing' is executed.\r\nNow all A, B, C self-destruct.\r\nAnd remove A,B,C from SelfDestructWaitingList.\r\nAnd clean A,B,C from ListOfReferrers completely.\r\n~~~\r\n\r\ne.g. 3\r\n~~~\r\nif contract A dynamically refers from contract AA to contract AZ\r\nthen do nothing.\r\n\r\nSo if SELFDESTRUCT 'AA' then 'AA' self-destructs immediately and clean.\r\n~~~\r\n\r\ne.g. 3 shows that this is a limited safety net only for statically referred common library.\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\n\r\nI think we all who will use library contracts on Turing completeness decentralized consensus machines in the future might have potential to have responsibility for the vulnerability which anyone could cause at libraries on such a new technology.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nI am not sure but this might need a hard fork because of creating new two database. I would like to keep them in another place, e.g. `~/.ethereum/gf/` ( `gf` denotes `garbage filter` ) at the first implementation of this issue.\r\n\r\n## Test Cases\r\n\r\nJust I thought that it could be suitable with ⊂ rather than with ⊆.\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\nPerhaps or maybe, Copyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\r\n",

    "body": "Suicide, or politically correct “self destruct”, is one of those features that should never be there, because it breaks fundamental principal of immutability of smart contract's code.  The code of deployed contract may not be changed in general (which might actually be very useful in many cases), but may be wiped out (which is not useful at all but is actually extremely dangerous).  It also breaks the rule that contract's code is executed every time ether is being sent to the contract and contract may always reject ether transferred to it by reverting the transaction.\r\nJust avoiding using self destruct and printing at compile time bold warning about self destruct usage would be much simpler and much better protection from accidentally killed contracts.",
