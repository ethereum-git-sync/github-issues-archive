  "body": "This is a discussion thread for https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/2364\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Abstract**\r\n\r\nThe [`forkid` (EIP-2124)](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2124) was designed to permit two Ethereum nodes to quickly and cheaply decide if they are compatible or not, not only at a genesis/networking level, but also from the perspective of the currently passed network updates (i.e. forks).\r\n\r\nEIP-2124 only defined how the `forkid` is calculated and validated, but due to the numerous possible applications, it did not itself spec out how the `forkid` should be exchanged between peers. This current EIP requests the inclusion of the `forkid` as a new field in the Ethereum wire protocol (`eth`) handshake (releasing a new version, `eth/64`).\r\n\r\nBy cross validating each others' forks already during the handshake, incompatible nodes can disconnect before expensive block exchanges and validations take place (PoW check, EVM execution, state reconstruction). This furher prevents peer slots from being taken up by nodes that are incompatible, but have not yet been detected as such.",
