  "body": "Why is the EIP150Hash (the block header hash for the EIP-150 protocol upgrade) separately marked in the ChainConfig struct? After reviewing EIP-150, it seems that there were no changes made to the hash algorithm. Instead, only gas cost adjustments were made. If the EIP150Hash field is not highlighted separately, it may cause confusion or misinterpretation for those who are only interested in the changes related to hash algorithm.",
