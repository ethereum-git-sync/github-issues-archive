  "body": "ERC-3000 presents a basic on-chain spec for contracts to optimistically enact governance decisions made off-chain.\r\n\r\nThe standard is opinionated in defining the 6 entrypoint functions to contracts supporting the standard. But it allows for any sort of resolver mechanism for the challenge/response games characteristic of optimistic contracts.\r\n\r\nWhile the authors currently believe resolving challenges [using a subjective oracle](https://aragon.org/blog/snapshot) is the right tradeoff, the standard has been designed such that changing to another mechanism is possible (a deterministic resolver like [Optimism's OVM](https://optimism.io) uses), even allowing to hot-swap it in the same live instance.\r\n\r\n### [Read more](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/3000/files)",
