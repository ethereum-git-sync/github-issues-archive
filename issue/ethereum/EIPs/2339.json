Eth1 keystores used to have Address fields, but they were removed because they compromised privacy and reduced security as a PubKey field reveals the value of each key.\r\n\r\nJust checked with `geth` and it still creates the `address` field when it creates new accounts.\r\n\r\nNot providing public keys in the keystore forces users to unlock their keystore whenever they wish to access their public keys.  This, to me, seems like a much larger security issue than storing the public key and forces users who want to carry out read-style operations against their public keys to expose their private keys (note this would still have to happen if the mapping was maintained in 3rd-party software, at least once per key).\r\n\r\nOne other point: if users require their keystores to be protected it would make more sense for the 3rd-party software to encrypt the keystore in its entirety and protect it that way.  This would give both security and usability, and allow for the secure storage of keystores (e.g. within a 1password store).",
