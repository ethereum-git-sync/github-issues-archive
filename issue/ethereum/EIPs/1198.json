  "body": "The biggest obstacles to true standalone \"decentralized\" applications is hosting.\r\n\r\nFor applications that do not depend on data kept offchain, all that is  needed to\r\nrun the dapp is an html page. This proposal is thus: Smart Contracts include an `html` function that returns a string which is valid HTML for viewing and accessing the page.\r\n\r\nIt might make sense to reference packages like JQuery or eth-lawyer (my own tool for getting callbacks to account changes) in comments in the html. If the comment includes an address and abi of the package, a user could copy and paste code from the blockchain and assemble their own website.\r\n\r\nPlease note,, I am not suggesting a package manager built into Ethereum, although that a standard could emerge letting a third party tool scrape a smart contract and assemble a webpage without further input from the user. Writers who don't follow the standard could still deploy their own webpages using the html function.\r\n\r\nNo changes necessary to the EVM. This is a suggestion to smart contract developers to start standardizing on the `html` function to use for website rendering instructions.",

That entity may operate in the dark (anonymously, hiding from state censors, etc.), but that doesn't matter.  If such an entity doesn't naturally exist, you can create an incentivization system to cause them to exist.  e.g., allow users to buy content from other users, thus encouraging users to store data indefinitely so they can sell it back to people when requested.",
