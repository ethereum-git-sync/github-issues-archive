And to further eliminate the possibility of such a thing occurring it would be possible to put in place certain hardcoded safeguards, mainly in the interest of stopping people from even attempting this sort of thing thinking it has any chance of working. One idea that has been floated is a checksum in the state change objects that would only be generated when a legitimate ERP process has been successfully approved. \r\n\r\nAs one of the coauthors of the proposal, I can safely speak for all of us in saying we definitely don't want any possibility for this tool to be usable for taking people's money away from them.

But I see forking as the solution to immutable history if you disagree with the history.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I think this fundamentally misunderstands the point of cryptocurrency. A major appeal, for me, is the push vs pull type of transaction. This breaks that. Because now the network has a pull transaction that can take money from anyone - just like banking. Then I don't technically own my coins. The people who can vote to take them do. \r\n\r\nI don't think I support this on any grounds but I can be educated if I am completely missing the point.",

If I get this right, you are proposing a way to submit, let's use the right word, a request to revert transaction or refund ETH and that not only for a one time deal but as a standard process ? We should probably forget about Ethereum and use a spreadsheet so it could be easier to correct error ?\r\n\r\nEthereum survived the DAO Fork and I think it was necessary at the time, but this, this is not what \"we\" are building. I don't think you'll get a lot of people on board with that kind of idea other than those who will benefit, indeed.\r\n\r\nI hope the community will speak it's word, **even if you are not a technical person and you can at least understand the repercussion of this for the entire Ethereum project**. \r\n\r\nWrite a comment here with your thought, as Ethereum will grow more money will come in and \"attack\" like this to the immutability of the TX will happend, we need to standup and speak, either for or against but this is a crucial question. If 10 eth is stuck somewhere now, it's a 10kUSD lost you might live with it, but think about how many of those proposal we'll see if eth is worth 5k or 10k one day ?",

    "body": "I am 100% against this proposal as an ETH holder and supporter. Since coming into the crypto world, I've believed in ETH and ETH only because I believed that it wouldn't pass proposals like this. \r\n\r\nTo be clear, I support open discussions about proposals like this, and I commend the Parity team for opening the dialogue.\r\n\r\nThat being said, beyond the concerns about standardizing an explicitly non-standard change to the network, the proposal has two fatal flaws in the approval process:\r\n\r\n1. The ERP author is given the sole responsibility to collect evidence of support.\r\n\r\nWhile I understand that the ERP author has the most motivation to collect support, the proposal doesn't account for how the author will likely give a biased account. This doesn't sit well with me at all. Generally, we can expect the author stands to gain from recovery. Shouldn't there be opposing sides presenting evidence, especially when such a decision can effect the overall value of the network? \r\n\r\nThe Parity funds is a great example. Unlike the DAO, it's not a system-breaking amount of ETH. We could do nothing, and the network would not be affected. There are also credible risks for allowing such a proposal to go through. As such, it behooves the network to have some sort of devil's advocate which fights against these types of requests. This system is not described in the EIP as presented.\r\n\r\n2. The EIP editor is made to be the sole arbiter of acceptance. \r\n\r\nFirst, the EIP editor position is not answerable to the Ethereum community. They should not be given the responsibility to decide arbitrarily on what cases deserve fund recovery and what cases do not. The guidelines given in the EIP are extremely vague as to what constitutes a valid request, and it's effectively up to the EIP editor's judgment to make a decision. I didn't have a say on electing the EIP editor nor did I  have a say in allowing them to to make this decision. No one else did either (outside the foundation). \r\n\r\nSecond, there's no determined threshold of what's reviewable by the EIP editor. Is it the EIP editor's responsibility to weed through all the proposals that are essentially \"I lost my private keys?\" If so, this seems like a massive waste of an EIP editor's time, especially when the job of the EIP editor is so critical to the continued technical development of the system. Not only does the EIP editor become a bottleneck for ERP requests, he/she also slows down continued technical development.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I vehemently against this proposal because I believe it allows for biased submissions of ERPs and puts undue burdens on the shoulders of EIP editors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

One of those best practices is third-party audits on the final production code. Audits will be more difficult if auditors have to consider whether any nefarious but innocent-looking state changes could be snuck by the overworked judges.\r\n\r\nIf something happens which is so exceptionally bad that a large majority of the community comes together to fix that special case with a fork, then it's probably worth fixing.
