  "body": "### Problem\n- Defining an API that lasts for ever is difficult. There is a need to support changes.\n- There should be no centralized dependency. Anyone should be able to propose new functionality for any API, or to define a completely new API.\n- It should be possible to fulfill any subset of versions.\n### Proposed solution\n\nDefine a generic base class that all standard contract APIs have to inherit. Override a query function that returns support status for features.\n### Implementation proposal\n\nEvery feature is identified by a (globally scoped) feature number. To minimize the risk of accidentally using the same number, it should be randomly generated 144 bits.\n\n```\ncontract VersionInformation {\n    /// @param _feature A feature number\n    /// @return True if the feature is supported\n    function querySuppport(uint _feature) constant returns (bool supported);\n}\n```\n\nA random 144 bit feature number can be created with web3 Javascript:\n\n```\n\"0x\"+(BigNumber.random(11)*1e11).toString(16).slice(-9) + (BigNumber.random(11)*1e11).toString(16).slice(-9)\n```\n",

Of course, you can't force others to use it, but good proposals will be used if there is a need for it.\n\nI am not sure how to best allocate a feature number. As I wrote in the proposal, a random 64 bit number could be used. This is maybe not a safe process, as you could claim that you got the number '1' as a random. Another way is to use a hash, but hash on what?\n\nI am thinking a little like you allocate a new account address. You don't need a central control of what addresses are allocated.\n",
