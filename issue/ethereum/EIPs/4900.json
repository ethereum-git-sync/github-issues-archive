  "body": "```suggestion\r\nIn the case of defining the asset attribute but not the user attribute, two states define if the token is waiting for authentication with the owner or if authentication has finished successfully. Figure 2 shows the corresponding states in a flow chart. When a token is created or transferred to a new owner, then the token changes its state to \"waitingForOwner\". In this state, the token is waiting for authentication by the owner. Once the asset is authenticated, its associated token changes its state to \"engagedWithOwner\".\r\n```\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @RosarioArjona in https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/4519#r799566529_",
