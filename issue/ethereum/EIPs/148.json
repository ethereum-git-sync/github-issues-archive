    "body": "I'd also like to see labels for the different EIP categories.\n\nIn [EIP1](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1.mediawiki) the \"Standard Track\" had two categories: Consensus and Networking. Then [EIP4](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-4.mediawiki) expanded that to four \"layers\": (1) Consensus, (2) Networking, (3) API/RPC, and (4) Applications.\n\nI suggest refining these four categories under the following labels: (1) \"core\", (2) \"networking\", (3) \"interface\", and (4) \"standard\".\n1. `core`: includes improvements requiring a consensus fork (e.g. [EIP5](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-5.md), [EIP101](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/28)) and also changes that are not necessarily consensus critical but still most relevant to \"core dev\" discussions (for example, [EIP90](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/90), and the miner/node strategy changes 2, 3, and 4 of [EIP86](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/86#issue-145324865)).\n2. `networking`: includes improvements around [devp2p](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/%C3%90%CE%9EVp2p-Wire-Protocol) ([EIP8](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-8.md)) and [Light Ethereum Subprotocol](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Light-client-protocol), as well as proposed improvements to network protocol specifications of [whisper](https://gist.github.com/gluk256/4654922ca45eb9d0846d941d7ca326f4) and [swarm](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/2959).\n3. `interface`: includes improvements around client [API/RPC](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC) specifications and standards, and also certain language-level standards like method names ([EIP59](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/59), [EIP6](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-6.md)) and [contract ABIs](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-Contract-ABI). The label \"interface\" aligns with the [interfaces repo](https://github.com/ethereum/interfaces). Would include [EIP144](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/144), [EIP136](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/136), [EIP130](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/130), [EIP95](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/95), [EIP94](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/94), [EIP80](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/80), [EIP60](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/60), and [EIP50](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/50).\n4. `standard`: an abbreviated label for application-level standards and conventions, including contract standards such as token standards ([ERC20](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20)) and name registries ([ERC26](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/26), [ERC137](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/137)). Would also include proposals for URI schemes ([ERC67](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/67)), library/package formats ([EIP82](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/82)), and wallet formats ([EIP75](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/75), [EIP85](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/85)).\n",

    "body": "> proposals change from ERC to EIP, by way of the issue title being changed.\n\nI think ERC and EIP are (or should be) two different things. An ERC is a general protocol proposal for the Ethereum ecosystem, and doesn't require consensus changes. An EIP involves a change to the Ethereum protocol. We could potentially dump the 'ERC' nomenclature and expand 'EIP' to cover everything, but I think it would be misleading to treat them as different stages of the lifecycle of the same thing - they're both \"Proposals\", after all.\n\n> status/labels should follow this https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0002.mediawiki#bip-status-field (maybe with some modifications to make it simpler)\n\nThe issue tracker is really a terrible way to maintain EIPs, and I was really hoping we could move off it. In the issue tracker, only the original author can modify the EIP, and they can do so without review or notification, and with no way to see past versions of the EIP. The discussion thread adds a lot of noise, and on some EIPs makes it difficult to determine what the canonical version of it is.\n\nMy suggestion would be to return to using the repository to track EIPs, with PRs for submissions and changes. With this, we can easily add Jekyll support to automatically generate a 'standards site' from it - see https://github.com/pidcodes/pidcodes.github.com and http://pid.codes/ for an example of this; I'm happy to help set it up.\n",

The number on the left of the EIP title takes you to the file for the  EIP, and the history tab for that file takes you to the complete revision history.  The Status on the right of the title is linked to the associated issue discussion.  Everything is timestamped, user tagged, commit numbered.\n\nSo currently, EIPs start as de facto Issues that we call EIPs.  Some issue discussions lead to a Draft EIP.  That does require a PR.  Sometimes there is further discussion attached to the PR.  (But getting to that PR - or to a  list of all PRs -is a pain.)  Revisions to an EIP require reopening the PR, where more discussion can be attached.\n\nI'm not sure what (if anything) we are proposing to change about this structure.  The policy decisions seem to that for some reason we want to change the facto EIP number as it moves from being an Issue to a Draft?  And that further technical discussion once the EIP is drafted be attached to the PR and not the original issue?\n",

    "body": "> Currently, if you go to https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs you find a list of EIPs. The number on the left of the EIP title takes you to the file for the EIP, and the history tab for that file takes you to the complete revision history.\n\nRight, but that's manually maintained and only covers the first 8 EIPs; it's not the process that people are using in practice at the moment, which is to post EIPs _as_ issues.\n\n> So currently, EIPs start as de facto Issues that we call EIPs.\n\nRight, and I think that's a mistake. The author (and only the author) of the issue can edit it at any time with no revision history, and it's not clear in some EIPs what the implemented version is. PRs work perfectly well for this purpose.\n\n> I'm not sure what (if anything) we are proposing to change about this structure.\n\nI'm proposing, at least, that we actually follow the process outlined in EIP0. EIPs are submitted as pull requests, and reviewed in the PR. I don't see any reason for them to have a stage in their lifecycle uring which they are an issue tracker entry.\n\nChanges are opened as new PRs with their own explanation. If we feel there's a need for a draft process before an EIP is officially accepted and given a number, we could follow the RFC convention and have 'draft-eip-some-descriptive-name.md' in the PreEIPs directory.\n",

    "body": "OK.  It's a loose thing right now, but yes, as soon as an issue is posted we call it an EIP if it is a proposal to change Ethereum, and refer to it by issue number.  I think it's understood that it's in a pre-draft stage, and may never get any farther.  The advantage to this custom is that there is one main place for discussion that can be (manually) linked to later, and a number to remember it by.  So I do find a use for this pre-draft stage.  If we get rid of it we will need a replacement.\n\nI'm not sure what you mean by \"The author (and only the author) of the issue can edit it at any time with no revision history\".  Seems people comment on an issue - not revise it - and that is the history?\n\nOnce there is a Draft EIP there must a PR, and I'm fine with the process.  I just find it very difficult to navigate the PR discussions in Github, especially if multiple revisions of an EIP require multiple PRs.  So I think maintaining manual links on the front page will still be needed.  But my preference would be for technical discussion of an EIP to continue under its issue number, (so the continuity of the discussion is not lost) and PR discussions be about problems with the merge (which are usually uninteresting once the merge succeeds).\n",

    "body": "@Arachnid  An automatically generated web page as you mentioned above allays my concerns about fragmentation and navigability of the discussions on the PRs for EIP drafts and revisions.\n\nFor discussions leading up to a draft - EIP issues have been working well enough in our GitHub-centric world that I'd hate to just drop them unless we are sure we are moving to something better.   I do see now what you mean about the issue author's privileges.  I don't know that it's a problem pre-draft, but I'm surprised GitHub doesn't provide for administrator override.   And I agree that it was wrong to start calling issues EIPs in the first place, but we do now, and Gitter helpfully  abbreviates e.g. this issue's URL to ethereum/EIPs#148.\n\nYou suggest that \"If we feel there's a need for a draft process before an EIP is officially accepted and given a number, we could follow the RFC convention and have 'draft-eip-some-descriptive-name.md' in the PreEIPs directory.\"  Which is fine, but you need to prepare a file and go through the PR process to even get something started there, whereas opening an issue is quick and easy.  And  for issues there usually is not yet a file to discussed.  If there is, preEIPS might be a good place to put it.\n",
