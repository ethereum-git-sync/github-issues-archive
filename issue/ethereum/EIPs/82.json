  "body": "## Package and Dapp Descriptor Format\n### Abstract\n\nSuccessful languages have package management tools which greatly simplify code sharing, which contributes to network effect.\nThe Ethereum ecosystem is somewhat unique in that everyone shares a global runtime environment, so addresses are both \"code-like\" and \"object-like\".\n### Motivation\n\nWe want to ensure we can support the whole spectrum of Solidity packages, especially those that allow working with existing systems:\n- Simple static libraries which make no reference to any objects on any chain (ie `Math`)\n- Packages which describe singleton dapps (they ship address references and type info, but don't intend for people to re-use the solidity code, like actual Solidity libraries (`string`)).\n- Packages which describe singleton dapps, with extra support code for interacting with the system (eg something that interacts with a registry)\n- Packages which describe dapp \"types\" which you can deploy, like when an app is too large to build via a factory or requires a complex deployscript (eg a Token system that separates datastore/controller/frontend).\n\nThe result is a descriptor file called a `dappfile` which is similar to npm's `package.json` but with special attention to handling addresses with special meaning.\n`dappfile`s can be modified in a structured way with \"deploy scripts\", which is out of scope for this ERC but is described here: https://github.com/nexusdev/dapple/blob/master/doc/deployscript.md\n### Specification\n\nThe `dappfile` schema is defined here: https://github.com/nexusdev/dapple/blob/master/specs/dappfile.schema.json\n### Implementation\n\nSample implementation here: https://github.com/nexusdev/dapple\n### Example dappfile\n\n```\nname: mydapp\nversion: 0.1.0\nlayout:\n  sol_sources: contracts\n  build: build\nenvironments:\n  default: morden\n  morden:\n     my_dapp_registry:\n       address: 0x0...\n       type: MyRegistry\n  ethereum:\n     my_dapp_registry:\n         addresss: 0x1...\n         type: MyRegistry\n```\n### Things to discuss\n\nI propose we start by polling to see if there are any unusual use cases which do not fit into the \"set of solidity files, plus named sets of sets of named addresses\" model.\n",
