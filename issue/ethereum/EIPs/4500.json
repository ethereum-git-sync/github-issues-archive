  "body": "# Introduction\r\n\r\nCurrently, there are two major ways of connecting to a social dApp: using a cold account or using a hot account.\r\n\r\n## The \"cold\" account\r\nThis account is usually on a cold, hardware, multisig, hard wallet. e.g. Ledger.\r\nIt holds your assets (tokens, NFTs, ENS, etc.) and proves your identity (signature, ENS).\r\nWhile it is secure and trustworthy, it is definitely not practical for social dApps.\r\nThus, the following actions are a major drawback for users: \r\n- Connecting to the dApp and proving your identity (usually requires a signature)\r\n- Making small, inexpensive transactions: tipping an user, interacting with the blockchain.\r\n \r\n## The \"hot\" account\r\nThis account is usually on a hot/software/unisig/soft wallet. e.g. Metamask.\r\nWhile it is very practical and allows users to quickly get on track, it can be compromised.\r\nThus, it is definitely not safe to use it for holding assets and proving your identity, as both can be compromised.\r\n\r\n# Proposal\r\n\r\nMy proposal is to have the best of both worlds by allowing users to **delegate their cold account's identity to a hot account**.\r\n\r\nYou would connect for the first time to a dApp with your cold wallet for proving your identity, and then you would be able to delegate this identity to your hot wallet. You can then connect with both, and **can undo this delegation at any time**; just like you can remove an access token from your Github account, or disallow a device from using your Google account.\r\n\r\nFrom the dApp perspective, an user can make actions either on-chain (on the blockchain) or off-chain (on a traditional server/database architecture). Both on-chain and off-chain actions can be separated into two categories.\r\n\r\n## Weak actions\r\nThose actions are usually small, inexpensive, not important.\r\nThey are feasible by both cold and hot accounts.\r\nThey do not have a large impact if the hot account is compromised.\r\nFor example: \r\n- Tipping an user with a small amount (e.g. <$10)\r\n- Posting something (off-chain or on-chain)\r\n- Following an user, group, channel, topic, etc.\r\n- Modifying the user's profile (name, avatar, bio)\r\n- Messaging someone (see next part for details)\r\n\r\n## Strong actions\r\nThose actions are usually expensive, important.\r\nThey are only doable by the cold account, for security reasons.\r\nFor example: \r\n- Creating, minting, staking, transfering, withdrawing assets\r\n- Modifying \"hard\" parts of the user's profile (e.g. email address)\r\n- Creating/deleting a social page, or some important stuff\r\n- Undoing the delegation\r\n\r\n# Technical considerations for even more secure dApps\r\n\r\nThe dApp could show which account was used when creating a post (e.g. a lock icon near the username).\r\n\r\nThe dApp could store an history of all actions made by the hot account, and could allow the user to rollback those actions if the hot account gets compromised.\r\n\r\nFor private conversations, each conversation could be hot or cold. Cold conversations would be used for even more private stuff. This way, if the hot account gets compromised, those conversations do not leak. While still allowing the hot account to quickly message someone.\r\n\r\n# Implementation\r\n\r\nThe delegated identity system, while being more secure, can be somewhat hard to implement from both design and development perspectives. \r\n\r\nOn the design side, it needs to be clear for the end user how this system works. \r\nAlso, the dApp needs to define which action is strong and which one is weak.\r\n\r\nOn the development side, the dApp needs to abstract two accounts into one identity/profile, this can be hard to implement for existing social dApps. The dApp may also allow existing users to move their identity to a cold wallet when they first connected with a hot wallet.\r\n\r\nAlso, the action of delegating an identity to another account needs to require both accounts to accept it. Once the delegation is made, the hot account would see his identity/profile removed and replaced by the cold account's identity. The hot account won't be able to delegate his new identity to yet another account.\r\n\r\n# Your comments are welcome ðŸ˜‰",

    "body": "Hi @hazae41, \r\nThe above content looks like you may be looking to collect feedback on the idea to potentially document a proposal. This doesn't seem like an Issue that you are looking to be helped with. If that's the case, may I request you to create a thread at  [Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians](https://ethereum-magicians.org/) and close the issue here.\r\n\r\nAs per the recent changes to [EIP-1](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1.md#shepherding-an-eip), we're encouraging users to open a thread at FEM for \"discussion-to\" and add concerns or general issues that can be addressed by EIP editors or related contributors in this repository. \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n",
