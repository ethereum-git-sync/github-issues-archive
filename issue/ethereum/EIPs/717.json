  "body": "### Summary\r\n[ERC20](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20-token-standard.md) provides a standard API for Ethereum smart contracts implementing tokens. While all ERC20 tokens share the same API, different implementations of the standard functions have been released by [various](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/blob/master/contracts/token/StandardToken.sol) [teams](https://github.com/ConsenSys/Tokens/blob/master/contracts/StandardToken.sol). This proposal slightly modifies the implementation of the `transferFrom` function in a way that allows a user to provide an unlimited allowance, which can provide significant gas savings.\r\n\r\n### Specification\r\nWith this proposal, `transferFrom` only modifies the `allowed` mapping if `allowed[_from][_spender]` is less than the maximum unsigned integer (2 ** 256 - 1). \r\n\r\n```\r\nuint constant MAX_UINT = 2**256 - 1;\r\n\r\n/// @dev ERC20 transferFrom, modified such that an allowance of MAX_UINT represents an unlimited allowance.\r\n/// @param _from Address to transfer from.\r\n/// @param _to Address to transfer to.\r\n/// @param _value Amount to transfer.\r\n/// @return Success of transfer.\r\nfunction transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint _value)\r\n    public\r\n    returns (bool)\r\n{\r\n    uint allowance = allowed[_from][msg.sender];\r\n    require(balances[_from] >= _value\r\n            && allowance >= _value\r\n            && balances[_to] + _value >= balances[_to]);\r\n    balances[_to] += _value;\r\n    balances[_from] -= _value;\r\n    if (allowance < MAX_UINT) {\r\n        allowed[_from][msg.sender] -= _value;\r\n    }\r\n    Transfer(_from, _to, _value);\r\n    return true;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\nThere are cases where a token owner is willing to give another address an unlimited allowance. With the current accepted implementation of `transferFrom`, `_value` is subtracted from the `allowed` mapping every single time the function is called. This is an unnecessary (and annoying) state change in the case the token owner wishes to grant an address an unlimited allowance, wasting 5K gas per call of `transferFrom`. This change is a huge long run efficiency gain and is completely backwards compatible. \r\n\r\nI would also like to acknowledge @Recmo, who initially proposed this solution.\r\n",

However, if you want to go that route and you don't want to add the extra storage, then at least add the following function with its own documentation: \r\n\r\n```\r\n  function approveUnlimited(address _spender) public returns (bool) {\r\n     approve(_spender, MAX);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, I wonder if a better option would be a standard \"JointAccount\" contract (probably exists already) that would allow a primary user to add authorized users.  The JointAccount could hold the tokens and authorized users could spend them.  To me, it seems better than putting this special logic in the StandardToken and a JointAccount approach would actually be backward compatible with tokens that have already been deployed.  Again, maybe I'm just not clear on the use cases.",
