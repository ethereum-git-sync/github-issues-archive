  "body": "## Preamble\r\n\r\n    EIP: <to be assigned>\r\n    Title: Hyperlocal Dapps with DAG-ish sub-layer\r\n    Author: Prabhat K Singh <prabhat@talking.im>\r\n    Type: Standard Track\r\n    Category: Core\r\n    Status: Draft\r\n    Created: 2017-12-30\r\n    Requires: <EIP number(s)>\r\n    Replaces: <EIP number(s)>\r\n\r\n\r\n## Simple Summary\r\nProposed hyperlocal Dapp have it's own (secondary) blockchain, where main blockchain mines only in conflict situation. Secondary dapp blockchain adds intra-Dapp transactions in DAG like data structure for simplicity. \r\n\r\n## Abstract\r\nDapps are primary consumption media of ETH, but they also clog the whole network. I am proposing hyperlocal Dapp which runs it's own DAG like blockchain(secondary) for instant additions and relays but any conflict like double signing or forks are raised to main network. Dapp blockchain will be PoS based so that main network could penalise offenders. This implementation will unclog the dapp based loads on ETH(large %) and improve the user experience due to faster dapps.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nWith increasing adoption of ETH, a variety of dapps are being realized, but the are adding unprecedented load on global network. Hyperlocal dapps are a way to localize the impact. As such, dapps are slowing the network for general masses(like crypto kitties). Hyperlocal dapps will increase the overall suitability, sustainability and UX of ETH in its current state. Though the planned other proposals will make it even better. Hyperlocal dapps will isolate the load of dapps from main network and only in case of node-honesty issues, the main network would require to mine. In essence, honest dapps could be many times faster than ETH network. \r\n\r\nThe model arose from our logistics implementation in SIngapore for a postal client(thebitpost.com). We improvised the modules to segregate load and crises in different zones. We have now packaged the blockchain solution as TIM (http://talking.im), while BitPost is dedicated to IOT solutions. Though we have developed 3 new features on ERC20 for GPS based mining, multi-zoning and hyperlocal dapps with programmable anonymity, we could only backport hyperlocal dapps and anonymity(in separate proposal) to ETH.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\nWIP - To be submitted after confirming suitability to ETH vision\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\nWIP - To be based on views of ETH community\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\nWIP - To be discussed. But in general there would not be any conflicts, as such.\r\n\r\n## Test Cases\r\nWIP - To be discussed\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\nWIP - To be submitted after confirming suitability to ETH vision\r\n",
