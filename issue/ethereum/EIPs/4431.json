    "body": "This is not at compilation time like doxygen, if I understand your question.\r\n\r\nfor some background, you can check out EIP-3224 which this was originally part of but was requested to be split into two separate EIPs.\r\n\r\nThis is a method the contract author adds, which is compiled into the contract though.\r\n\r\nImagine if your contract had a method like: `approveProposal(bytes32 hash, bytes signature)` which would use ecrecovery to vote your address as accepting the proposal. The best things like MetaMask could do today is present you with a UX of “do you agree to this? { Scary Hash Goes Here }”.\r\n\r\nThis would allow a virtual function, which MetaMask can generically understand (i.e. MetaMask doesn’t even have to have know about your contract before and didn’t need to include any additional custom config) may look like `acceptProposal(string name, uint date, uint[] payouts, address[] recipients)`, which would return 2 things:\r\n\r\n- the string to display to the user, “do you agree to the propose ‘pay the devs’, on November 11, 2021 to pay ricmoo.eth an amount of 1.21 eth, nick.eth an amount of 2.3 eth and 0x1234567…6754 an amount of 0.6 eth?”\r\n- The bytes necessary from the non-virtual function, `approveProosal(bytes32,bytes)`\r\n\r\nSo MetaMask can give the user a meaningful description and once agreed, MetaMask can sign the payload, and do whatever the signed payload should do (likely submit them to a server which would then send the transaction or commit it to a state channel).\r\n\r\nI’ll be adding more examples to this soon. Right now I’m just getting the EIP broken into the 4 separate EIPs I was suggested to do. :)",

Thanks for the submission!\n\nAs I understand, per the original discussion on eip-3224, you are in the process of splitting it into 4 seperate EIPs to address the UX issue for web3 users.\n\nweb3 user's UX issue: \"I want to know what's happening when I am interacting with the dApps, explained in plain words\", if possible in the user's locale.\n\nI am currently going through eip-3224 and it's pre-requisite eip to better understand. Please be patient, I will reach out to you shortly.",
