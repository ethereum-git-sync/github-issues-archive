  "body": "> Disclaimer: My area of expertise does not lend well to me suggesting *how* to make things ASIC resistant.  I hope there are some informed opinions floating around out there who can help fill in the *how*.\r\n\r\nAccording to \"the internet\" there is an ASIC based ethereum miner on the horizon.  \r\n\r\n[this *may* be the original source of that news](http://technews.cn/2018/02/12/bitmain-tsmc-dram/)\r\n\r\nIf you believe the analysis in the comments on [this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/87ucsk/would_you_support_a_hard_fork_that_obsceletes_eth/) BitMain may already running these miners.\r\n\r\nI believe it is the accepted wisdom that ASIC based mining leads to increases centralization when compared to GPU mining.\r\n\r\nThis leads us to two questions:\r\n\r\n1. Should we hard fork to make ASIC mining harder and to demonstrate a willingness to hard fork any future ASIC based ethereum mining.\r\n2. What specifically changes do we make to implement this increased ASIC resistance.\r\n\r\n### Should we fork?\r\n\r\nI propose that people indicate support/opposition with a simple üëç / üëé  on this main issue.  I would prefer this conversation not devolve into deep discussions around this subjective topic so **my request is that people refrain from commenting on that specific question here**.\r\n\r\n### How do we implement improved ASIC resistance\r\n\r\nThis is the primary issue that I think needs to be addressed, after which we can have an informed discussion about whether we should actually do it.\r\n",

How much damage could ASICs do in the meantime? Is this not dropping the \"ASIC resistance\" from the original roadmap? \r\n\r\nWhile it may be fine in protocol to wait, it reduces the communities opinion on the deliverance of the ideals they were promised.\r\n\r\nThe real question to be asked is will PoS be here fast enough to avoid needing this EIP?",

Current Ethash is memory bound design , but only memory bound does not mean the memory controller part can not be ASIC-like .... The only way to create a ASIC proof POW block chain is try to make ASIC die size as large as possible to make each of the ASIC as more expensive as possible ... So take one simple idea for example :  Let's say each hash function can be highly optimized by circuit design and shrink to a small die size area , but if we create like 1024 hash function in the hash function table but only use like 16 and randomize them in chain for each hash ... That means only 16/1024 of the die size area is utilized for hash function .... That will decrease the ASIC efficiency and when the cost of such ASIC is higher than GPU , there is no incentive to design ASIC to compete with GPU .... ",
