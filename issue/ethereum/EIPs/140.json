  "body": "<pre>\n  EIP:\n  Title: Opcode for exceptions that don't drain gas\n  Author: Nikolai Mushegian (nikolai@nexusdev.us)\n  Discussions-To: <email address>\n  Status: Draft\n  Type: Standards Track\n  Created:\n  Replaces:\n  Superseded-By:\n  Resolution:\n</pre>\n\n\nI tried to find an existing EIP for this and couldn't. This surprises me! Please help find existing discussion.\n# Abstract\n\nRight now rolling back state requires manually triggering an EVM exception (eg invalid jump), which drains all gas for the subcall. I prefer throw-oriented error handling despite all the drawbacks (no error details, drains gas) because reverting all state when something unexpected happens feels much safer.\n\nThe REVERT opcode would let you throw an exception without draining all the gas that the caller allocated to you.\n\nRelated issues:\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/62\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/evm2.0-design/issues/43\n# Details\n\nExtra things to consider\n- Per #62, it would be useful to be able to pass back a return value to be interpreted as an error when an exception is thrown. Solidity already re-throws when the stack is 0 so this backwards compatible in terms of Solidity semantics but may not be if someone has done ASM hacking where they read the \"return\". This is a nice-to-have, if it can't be done than a simplified version which gives you back no useful information is still much better than \"deliberate invalid jump\".\n",

I initially thought this could be done informally by simply leaving values on the stack at throw, but this only allows debugger inspection of error codes, and also makes propagating errors difficult. If revert allows return data, we can properly report error codes to callers.",
