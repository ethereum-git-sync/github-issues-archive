We've seen some projects take this approach already ([1]). The main problems with ERC20 standard token are: \r\n- Lack of reference implementation and tests\r\n- Higher complexity due to `approve` functionality, which not all projects need.\r\n- Returns boolean values to signal failure instead of throwing.\r\n- Function `totalSupply()` could just be implemented as a state variable in most cases.\r\n\r\n# Specification\r\n\r\n## totalSupply\r\n```javascript\r\nuint public totalSupply;\r\n```\r\nThe total token supply\r\n\r\n### balanceOf\r\n```javascript\r\nfunction balanceOf(address who) constant returns (uint);\r\n```\r\nGet the account balance of another account with address `who`\r\n\r\n### transfer\r\n```javascript\r\nfunction transfer(address to, uint value);\r\n```\r\nSend `value` amount of tokens to address `to`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Transfer event\r\n```javascript\r\nevent Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint value);\r\n```\r\nTriggered when tokens are transferred.\r\n\r\n# Reference Implementation and tests\r\nhttps://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20Basic.sol\r\nhttps://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/blob/master/contracts/token/BasicToken.sol\r\nhttps://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/blob/master/test/BasicToken.js\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the code is simpler and very concise. Comments appreciated.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/imapp-pl/golem-crowdfunding/blob/master/contracts/Token.sol",
