  "body": "**The final standard can be found here: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559**\r\n\r\n******\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nProvide a concrete proposal for implementing the fee market proposed in https://ethresear.ch/t/draft-position-paper-on-resource-pricing/2838 on the current 1.0 chain.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/3473 for more detailed arguments for why this is a good idea.\r\n\r\n### Parameters\r\n\r\n* `FORK_BLKNUM`: TBD\r\n* `MINFEE_MAX_CHANGE_DENOMINATOR`: 8\r\n* `TARGET_GASUSED`: 8000000\r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\n\r\nFor all blocks where `block.number >= FORK_BLKNUM`:\r\n\r\n* Impose a hard in-protocol gas limit of 16 million, used instead of the gas limit calculated using the previously existing formulas\r\n* Replace the `GASLIMIT` field in the block header with a `MINFEE` field (the same field can be used)\r\n* Let `PARENT_MINFEE` be the parent block's `MINFEE` (or 1 billion wei if `block.number == FORK_BLKNUM`). A valid `MINFEE` is one such that `abs(MINFEE - PARENT_MINFEE) <= max(1, PARENT_MINFEE // MINFEE_MAX_CHANGE_DENOMINATOR)`\r\n* Redefine the way the `tx.gasprice` field is used: define `tx.fee_premium = tx.gasprice // 2**128` and `tx.fee_cap = tx.gasprice % 2**128`\r\n* During transaction execution, we calculate the cost to the `tx.origin` and the gain to the `block.coinbase` as follows:\r\n    * Let `gasprice = min(MINFEE + tx.fee_premium, tx.cap)`. The `tx.origin` initially pays `gasprice * tx.gas`, and gets refunded `gasprice * (tx.gas - gasused)`.\r\n    * The `block.coinbase` gains `(gasprice - MINFEE) * gasused`.\r\n\r\nAs a default strategy, miners set `MINFEE` as follows. Let `delta = block.gas_used - TARGET_GASUSED` (possibly negative). Set `MINFEE = PARENT_MINFEE + PARENT_MINFEE * delta // TARGET_GASUSED //  MINFEE_MAX_CHANGE_DENOMINATOR`, clamping this result inside of the allowable bounds if needed (with the parameter setting above clamping will not be required).\r\n\r\n### Further explanation\r\n\r\nThere is a MINFEE value in protocol, which can move up or down by a maximum of 1/8 in each block; initially, miners adjust this value to target an average gas usage of 8 million, increasing MINFEE if usage is higher and decreasing it if usage is lower. Transaction senders specify their fees by providing two values:\r\n\r\n1. A \"premium\" gasprice which gets added onto the MINFEE gasprice, which can either be set to a fairly low value (eg. 1 gwei) to compensate miners for uncle rate risk or to a high value to compete during sudden bursts of activity. The MINFEE gets burned, the premium is given to the miner.\r\n2. A \"cap\" which represents the maximum total that the transaction sender would be willing to pay to get included.\r\n\r\nUltra-short-term volatility in transaction demand or block times will now translate mostly into ultra-short-term volatility in block sizes instead of volatility in transaction fees. During normal conditions, fee estimation becomes extremely simple: just set the premium to some specific value, eg. 1 gwei, and select a high cap. If a transaction sender highly values urgency during conditions of congestion, they are free to instead set a much higher premium and effectively bid in the traditional first-price-auction style.\r\n",

Since the miner gets only a 1/1000 of the current transaction fees, and instead they go to a public commons, while a naive miner is incentivized to put as much as possible in the pot so they can get more in the future, a selfish miner could decide to save computation time by ignoring all transactions.

    "body": "> Doesn't this creates an incentive to mine empty blocks?\r\n\r\nAh sorry, I did not mean to say that the incentive to include transactions is literally zero. The `tx.fee_premium` component still goes 100% to the miner. It's up to the market to determine how much of a premium is incentive enough, but the key point is that the value that we can expect to be a sufficient incentive can be expected to be roughly constant over time, and not change block by block with changing levels of congestion/demand or even just bad luck of the Poisson process.",
