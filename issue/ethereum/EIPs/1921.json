    "body": "I made a PR request with the Draft at https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/2267.\r\n\r\n@Arachnid, regarding your question from [another discussion](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/case-discussion-on-the-eip-process-based-on-eip-1900-eip-1/3627/16):\r\n\r\n> Can you give an example, then, of how you would define a DType type with, say, the ERC20 transfer method, and how multiple developers would implement this? I still don’t see how that’s possible in DType, so an end-to-end example would really help.\r\n\r\nThe original issue that we [were discussing](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/case-discussion-on-the-eip-process-based-on-eip-1900-eip-1/3627/14?u=loredanacirstea) was:\r\n> DType, in contrast, seems to assume each type will have exactly one implementation.\r\n\r\nSo, I will give a more appropriate example for the current state of the dType EIPs:\r\n\r\n\r\nUint256 is too general a type. In different contexts, it means different things. Using dType, the dev will be able to express the intent:\r\n\r\n```\r\nIntLength:: uint256\r\nIntVolume:: uint256\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn a comparison function:\r\n```\r\nmoreThan(uint256 dim1, uint256 dim2) pure public returns(bool result);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe should not be able to compare the length with the volume. That is why we will use dType and the function will describe truthfully our intent:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmoreThanLength(IntLength len1, IntLength len2) pure public returns(bool result);\r\nmoreThanVolume(IntVolume vol1, IntVolume vol2) pure public returns(bool result);\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, `moreThanLength` and `moreThanVolume` can be registered with dType with their ABI definition, but in this case, the implementation is left to the developer.\r\n\r\nThe ERC20 example is not covered by the functions extension yet. The current proposal targets `pure` / `view` functions.\r\n\r\n",
