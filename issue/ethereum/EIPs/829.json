This will extremely simplify contract creation and interaction.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nUser wants to deposit tokens in some DeFi service. Doing this user should send two transactions: first with token transfer approval and second with Defi service deposit.\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract IToken {\r\n  function approve(address from, address to, uint amount) public;\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract IDefi {\r\n  function deposit(address from, uint amount) public;\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction deposit(uint amount, address token, address defi) {\r\n    require(IToken(token).approve(msg.sender, defi, amount));\r\n    require(IDefi(defi).deposit(msg.sender, amount));\r\n\r\n    // Do something on success\r\n    notify();\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Other demonstration logic\r\n\r\ncontract ILogger {\r\n  function verify(string memory notification) public;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Dummy example function\r\nfunction notify() {\r\n    ILogger(address(0x1)).emit(\"Transfer completed\");\r\n}\r\n```\r\n",
