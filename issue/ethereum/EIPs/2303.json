  "body": "    ---\r\n    EIP: <to be assigned>\r\n    Title: Standard interface to fork tokens\r\n    Author: √Ålvaro Torralba <donfrutosgomez@gmail.com>\r\n    Discussions-to: Here\r\n    Status: Draft\r\n    Type: Standards Track\r\n    Category: ERC\r\n    Created: 2019-09-30\r\n    Requires: ERC20\r\n    ---\r\n\r\n## Abstract\r\nThis document describes a standard interface to fork ERC20 and other types of tokens in a new contract.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nIf, for example, I have **100 ATKN**, but the ATKN smart contract has a degree of centralization unacceptable to me, a backdoor or any error that could cause the loss of money. Assuming the contract is open source, I could talk to others who noticed the same error or who have the same ideological difference with the smart contract as me. We could edit the source code of the contract and deploy it, launching the **OTKN** token. But, why would we do that? Our new OTKN token would have no value. And we would have _x_ ATKN and 0 OTKN. We must sell our ATKN tokens and buy OTKN tokens. This would not work, because no exchange has included our new token.\r\n\r\nThis standard was created with the intention of solving this or similar problems, such as updating smart contracts.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n**NOTES**:\r\n  + The following specifications use syntax from Solidity 0.5.11 (or above).\r\n\r\n### Constants\r\n#### forkOf\r\n```solidity\r\naddress public forkOf;\r\n```\r\n**Only for forked tokens**: Specifies the address of the forked token when creating the current token.\r\n\r\n#### currentSupply\r\n```solidity\r\nuint256 public currentSupply;\r\n```\r\nSpecifies the current supply of the tokens.\r\n\r\n### Methods\r\n#### claimTokens\r\n```solidity\r\nfunction claimTokens() public returns (bool success);\r\n```\r\n**Only for forked tokens**: If ```balanceOf(msg.sender)``` is 0, adds the quantity of tokens of ```msg.sender``` at the [```forkOf```](#forkof) address to its balances and calls the [```giveTokens()```](#givetokens) function of the contract at the [```forkOf```](#forkOf) address. Additionaly, fires the [```TokensClaimed()```](#tokensclaimed) event.\r\n\r\n#### giveTokens\r\n```solidity\r\nfunction giveTokens() public returns (bool success);\r\n```\r\nBurns tokens of ```tx.origin``` at ```address(this)``` address. Additionaly, fires the [```TokensGiven()```](#tokensgiven) event.\r\n\r\n### Events\r\n#### TokensClaimed\r\n```solidity\r\nevent TokensClaimed(address _owner);\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### TokensGiven\r\n```solidity\r\nevent TokensGiven(address _owner);\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n```solidity\r\npragma solidity ^0.5.11;\r\n\r\ninterface IForkableToken\r\n{\r\n    function giveTokens() external returns (bool success);\r\n    event TokensGiven(address _owner);\r\n}\r\n\r\ninterface IForkedToken\r\n{\r\n    function claimTokens() external returns (bool success);\r\n    event TokensClaimed(address _owner);\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract ForkedForkableExampleToken is IForkedToken, IForkableToken\r\n{\r\n    using SafeMath for uint256;\r\n\r\n    address public forkOf;\r\n    uint256 public currentSupply;\r\n    mapping (address => uint256) private balances;\r\n    \r\n    constructor() public\r\n    {\r\n        // ...\r\n        forkOf = address(0x0123456789abcdef /* ... */);\r\n        currentSupply = 0;\r\n        // ...\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    /* ... */\r\n    \r\n    function claimTokens() public returns (bool success)\r\n    {\r\n        IForkableToken forkableOriginalToken = IForkableToken(forkOf);\r\n        IERC20 erc20OriginalToken = IERC20(forkOf);\r\n        require(balanceOf(msg.sender) == 0x00);\r\n        uint256 originalBalance = erc20OriginalToken.balanceOf();\r\n        require(forkableOriginalToken.giveTokens() == true);\r\n        balances[msg.sender] = originalBalance;\r\n        currentSupply = currentSupply.add(originalBalance);\r\n        emit TokensClaimed(msg.sender);\r\n        return true;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function giveTokens() public returns (bool success)\r\n    {\r\n        balances[tx.origin] = 0x00;\r\n        currentSupply = currentSupply.sub(balanceOf(tx.origin));\r\n        emit TokensGiven(tx.origin);\r\n        return true;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /* ... */\r\n\r\n    event TokensClaimed(address _owner);\r\n    event TokensGiven(address _owner);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\r\n",
