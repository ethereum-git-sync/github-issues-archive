  "body": "Proposal text can be found at: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/2172\r\n\r\nIt adds an EIP Editor Criteria section to EIP-1: a transparent process for appointing new EIP editors. \r\n\r\nThere have been discussions about adding more people as editors, but there is no PR with a process proposal in this repository, at this time.\r\nIt is a start, I expect the community and current editors to participate and improve.\r\n\r\nMy approach is:\r\n- to make the requirements somewhat strict and based on merit. I think it is better to start with \"strict\" and see how the process works and how many new editors are still willing to meet requirements. Afterward, the process can be updated.\r\n- start with a process that can be implemented in Github (because this is the current medium), but could eventually be decentralized\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: I do not fit any editor category from the proposal, not now and not in the near future.",
