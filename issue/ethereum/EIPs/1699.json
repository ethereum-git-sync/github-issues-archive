    "body": "# The EIP-1052 issue\r\n\r\nHere is my issue with EIP-1052 (the version as of 80b8f8071076537d99888064c63636a07b40b627).\r\n\r\nI believe this test case:\r\n\r\n> \"The EXTCODEHASH of an precompiled contract is either c5d246... or 0.\"\r\n\r\nis ambiguous and could lead to multiple, conflicting implementations. That of course would lead to a network split and cost billions of dollars.\r\n\r\nThe solution is to provide more explicit test cases, one that returns c5d246... and one that returns 0.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Disclosure timeline:\r\n\r\n2019-01-21 -- I identified issue and disclosed to EF under the [Ethereum Bounty Program](https://bounty.ethereum.org) since it could lead to a network split and that is a security issue.\r\n2019-01-21 -- The author of the EIP replied privately and defended that no change is necessary\r\n2019-01-22 -- Another number of EF replied privately and defended that the current EIP is clear as specified and that no change is necessary.\r\n2019-01-24 -- A member of EF [invited me to publish this](\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/1642#issuecomment-457222394)\r\n2019-01-26 -- I am posting this publicly.\r\n\r\nPractically speaking, any impact this issue report could have is limited by the fact that EF controls every/nearly every implementation of the client and the upgrade path of all deployed clients. \r\n\r\nI do recognize that the value of using the full two-week EIP process and fixing standards is more important for the actual decentralized future and setting a good example, rather than worrying about what might happen the day after this current fork.",
