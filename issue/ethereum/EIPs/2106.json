  "body": "An extension to the ERC-20 standard token that allows Token wallet owners to request payout from their wallet, by calling the smart contract and attaching a payout instruction string.\r\n\r\nToken wallet owners (or approved addresses) can order payout requests through blockchain. This is done by calling the orderPayoutFrom or orderPayoutFrom methods, which initiate the workflow for the token contract operator to either honor or reject the payout request. In this case, payout instructions are provided when submitting the request, which are used by the operator to determine the destination of the funds.\r\n\r\nThe corresponding PR can be found here: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/2021",
