  "body": "I'm a total novice at cryptocurrency tech, but was thinking it might be feasible to have each Serenity validator instead of being X number of randomly chosen accounts that meet certain criteria, be X number official Casper decentralized staking pool smart contracts instead? Wouldn't this simultaneously solve these two potential issues:\n\n1) _Everybody_ can participate in staking _at any time_, _with any amount of ETH_.\n\n2) With _multiple_ official decentralized staking pools to choose from _that are all identical protocols_, pool centralization issues cannot easily occur.\n\nSorry if I'm missing something here from a technical perspective, I'm just a web2 guy for now (slowly getting there with web3).\n",

Because of _that_, there's no way for members to easily enter or leave, without completely rebuilding the pool.  \n",
