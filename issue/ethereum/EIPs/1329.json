The main property of such reputation should be inalienability. This ERC proposes the standard in creating inalienable reputation tokens.\r\n\r\n## Abstract\r\nStandard in creating inalienable reputation tokens.\r\n\r\nReputation tokens are emitted and burned by a contract depending on balance holders actions and their consequences (i.e. there is a proof of the Byzantine behaviour of the owner). Reputation balances can be queried, but not directly changed or transferred from outside of the contract.\r\n\r\nThe token balance is protected by two-tier key design that allows signing transactions that can affect the reputation from one address while keeping the ability to replace the address with a compromised key by using the primary key stored in an airgap/secure cold storage.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nIn building trustless decentralized P2P networks sometimes we need to utilize multi-stage/repeated games (in terms of game theory). In such cases, reputation becomes the measure that helps to build economic incentivization schemes for the selected economic game. The reputation works as a \"glue\" that ties together the actor responsibility over time, creating an ability to utilize the strengths of repeated economic games. \r\n\r\nReputation system needs some specific kind of token, that can't be transferred between actors. Why? Because if the reputation may be transferred, it can be sold; and if it can be sold, it breaks the whole game setting and economic incentives, creating different Nash equilibrium and generally getting worse protection from malicious actors (lower Byzantine tolerance).\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n```solidity\r\ninterface ERCReputationToken {\r\n    /// ERC20-like properties providing general information \r\n    /// about token name and symbol\r\n    function name() public view returns (string);\r\n    function symbol() public view returns (string);\r\n\r\n    /// ERC777-like granularity\r\n    function granularity() public view returns (uint256);\r\n\r\n    /// Reputation may be limited or onlimited by the supply. These functions\r\n    /// provide information whether the supply is limited and, if not, the\r\n    /// `totalLimit()` and `currentSupply()` will be returning the maximum amount\r\n    /// of the tokens that can be produced and current token issuance\r\n    function hasLimit() public view returns (bool);\r\n    function totalLimit() public view returns (uint256);\r\n    function currentSupply() public view returns (uint256);\r\n\r\n    /// Function returns the balance of reputation tokens on an account\r\n    function balanceOf(address owner) public view returns (uint256);\r\n    \r\n    /// Function returns the address that is authorised to sign transactions \r\n    /// to this contract that can affect amount of the reputation on the account\r\n    function authAddress(address owner) public view returns (address auth, uint duration);\r\n    \r\n    /// Authorizes address to interact with the contract on behalf \r\n    /// of the balance owner for a some duration (amount of blocks)\r\n    function grantAddressAuth(address auth, uint duration) public returns (address prevAddress);\r\n    /// Extends authorized duration for the registered authorized address\r\n    function extendAuthDuration(uint forDuration)\r\n    /// Remokes authorisation right from the currently authorised address\r\n    /// to interact with the contract on behalf of account owner\r\n    function revokeAddressAuth() public;\r\n\r\n    /// Produced when contract generates some about of reputation and assigns\r\n    /// it to a certain account\r\n    event Issued(address owner, uint amountProduced);\r\n    /// Produced when contract burns some about of reputation on a certain account\r\n    event Burned(address owner, uint amountBurned);\r\n\r\n    /// Events for operations with authorised accounts\r\n    event AuthGranted(address owner, address auth, uint duration);\r\n    event AuthRevoked(address owner, address auth);\r\n    event AuthExpired(address owner, address auth);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe token contract MUST implement the above interface. \r\n\r\nThe smallest unit—for all interactions with the token contract—MUST be `1`. I.e. all amounts and balances MUST be unsigned integers. The display denomination—to display any amount to the end user—MUST be 10<sup>18</sup> of the smallest, like in ERC-777 standard.\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\nThe standard provides a solution for the trade-off between reputation token inalienability (non-tradability) and security issues in the case when private keys of reputation owner are compromised. This is implemented as two types of addresses associated with token balances, where the primary address and its private key can't be changed and can be used only for authorising some other address and its private key to perform operations with the contract on behalf of the balance owner. Thus, the primary key can be kept in cold storage most of the time, and all necessary operations can be performed by using the authorised key, which can be stored in 'hot' on a server or desktop/mobile. If the authorised key gets compromised it can be replaced or revoked using the primary key. Unfortunately, there is no option to replace the primary key in the case when it was compromised.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\nNo known issues\r\n\r\n## Test Cases\r\n*Left for future work*\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n*Left for future work*\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\r\n",

On the contrary, it is a type of token to use in projects internally. There can be thousands of projects, each one tracking some variables that it needs as user’s reputation within that project. Multitude of opinions and choices. Why some of you believe that projects should be barred from doing that? Only because the Chinese government abuses the idea? And if the Chinese government starts to use smart contracts, then must we stop using them? Besides, there is a major difference. This token does not give any way to punish for bad reputation, since in the worst case you scrap the private key and restart anew. It only gives to projects a way to reward users for certain actions and makes that reward non-transferrable. That’s it. ",
