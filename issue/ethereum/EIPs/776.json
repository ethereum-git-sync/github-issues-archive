I would love to be able to create a modifier in solidity smart contracts that interact with the estimateGas function to suggest a default gasLimit.\r\n\r\n## Abstract\r\nSee Above.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nWhen using functions that have extra functionality, sometime the gasLimit requirements change and it would be great for the smart contract designer to be able to suggest a gasLimit to improve the user experience.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nLooking for help here :-D\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\n\r\nWill flesh out more.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\nShould be 100% backwards compatible, it might be an upgrade to the estimateGas function\r\n\r\n## Test Cases\r\nWill flesh out more.\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\nWill flesh out more.\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\r\n",
