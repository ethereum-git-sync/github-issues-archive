I would support a change that makes the discussion URL go away at final.  This would be similar to RFCs where the final RFC doesn't include a link to historical discussions.  If people really wanted to find the historical discussion, they can dig through git history so it isn't like we are purging it from the internet.\r\n\r\nThis policy would also, importantly, let us eventually close GitHub issue discussions so we don't have an ever growing list of open issues.",
