This would allow users to pay fees in any desired token, using on-chain exchanges (Bancor Network, Kyber Network, Uniswap, 0x). And would allows IoT devices to avoid problems with topping up their ETH balances and pay fees from the managing smart contract.\r\n\r\n# Motivation\r\n\r\n1. IoT devices without ETH balance interacting with the managing smart contracts\r\n2. Ability to send tokens without having any ether, involving paying fees in the token or by using any on-chain exchange\r\n\r\n# Specification\r\n\r\nEthereum miners should consider zero gas price transactions as one's possible to pay directly to them over smart contract. And since EVM checks of this payments are much harder than cheks `gas_limit * gas_price <= sender_balance` we have to propose several cases to protect from a cheap flood, so we found 2 approaches at that moment:\r\n\r\n1. On-chain registration of wallets which would like to send this kind of transactions and blacklists of these wallets on nodes, which tries to send free transactions without any payments.\r\n\r\n2. Off-chain [HashCash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashcash) of transactions by tweaking their signatures until Tx with enough number of leading zero bits in hash found.",
