  "body": "This is probably a bad place to ask this, but I don't seem to find anything related on the interwebs.\n\nBack in Feb 2014 it was announced by @vbuterin that all crypto opcodes will be moved to pre-mined contracts. See [here](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/02/03/introducing-ethereum-script-2-0/) and [here](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/02/05/more-thoughts-on-scripting-and-future-compatibility/).\n\nsha256, ripemd160 and ecrecover since have been moved to such contracts, but sha3 remained as an opcode.\n\nThe yellow paper defines separate gas costs for all of them, although in different places. For sha3 it is in Appendix G (Fee Schedule), while the others are explained in Appendix E (Precompiled Contracts).\n\nIs there any memo somewhere explaining the design decisions leading to the current state?\n",
