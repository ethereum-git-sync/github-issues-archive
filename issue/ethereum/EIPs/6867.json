  "body": "### Pull Request\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### What happened?\r\n\r\nI did a quick test with a simple ERC20 token contract, having an EOA(Metamask) mint and send some ERC20 tokens to another basic contract that just stores the ERC20 test tokens I made. Using the \"owner\" EOA that was used to deploy the ERC20 tokens, I can basically delete any ERC20 tokens that are stored by the smart contract via the `burn()` function. I wonder if this is also going to be the same behavior with ERC-4337 abstract smart contract wallets? \r\n\r\nMy understanding is that for EOA non custodial wallets, either a manual `approve()` followed by `transferFrom()` is required or for newer tokens with `permit()`, for any EOA/contract to execute a `transfer()` on behalf of token owner, and as for the burn function for ERC20 tokens, burn = transfer to `0x00` account + affects total supply of token. \r\n\r\nTransaction can be found here:\r\nhttps://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0xc206c8488dc17bccc979ed0435292737438c965cd5e09fc176ec98cb4bd9c177\r\n\r\n### Relevant log output\r\n\r\n_No response_",
