    "body": "Here's my understanding of the current process, based on EIP 1 and experience:\r\n\r\n 1. Someone submits a draft EIP as a pull request\r\n 2. Interested participants debate the proposal until consensus on the contents of the draft have been reached.\r\n 3. An EIP editor merges the PR as a draft\r\n 4. Someone submits a PR to update the draft; repeat from step 2.\r\n 5. Once the EIP is 'mature', if it modifies the protocol it's discussed at an All Core Devs meeting. If the participants agree it's a good idea, they implement it in their specific clients, and the EIP moves to 'accepted'.\r\n 6. Once implemented, if the EIP modifies consensus, it's added to a scheduled hard fork.\r\n 7. The hard fork and its contents are announced, and users have the opportunity to determine if they accept the hard fork or reject it.\r\n 8. The hard fork block is reached, and people upgrade, or don't.\r\n\r\nA couple of really important notes here. First, the part at which the general userbase has input is on deciding to accept or reject a proposed change by way of hard fork. This is the network's ultimate governance method, and employs economic consensus to determine which 'side' 'wins'. As a result, individual end users don't need to 'vote' on draft EIPs, and thus we don't need a formalised process for taking community consensus at that point of the process. Further, the presence of this ultimate check discourages the implementation of a change that everyone knows will be unpopular.\r\n\r\nSecond, 'consensus' in the EIP process does not mean \"nobody disagrees\"; it means that all technical and editorial concerns that have been raised have been adequately addressed. [RFC 7282](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7282.txt) is an example of how the IETF handles this, and the sort of process we aspire to. In this context, voting can be harmful, as it gives the impression that decisions are taken by majority rule; on the contrary, one single participant expressing a critical flaw should be enough to torpedo a proposal, and a hundred people with irrelevant objections should not.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I think this is a good process (at least, if functioning as designed); it ensures that standards get written to the highest technical standard we can achieve, and it ensures they don't get adopted unless the community agrees (that last bit is baked into the operation of a consensus system - we couldn't change it even if we wanted).\r\n\r\nFinally, one last note: The EF does not run the EIP process - EIP editors are volunteers and don't all work for the EF. Nor does the EF have the final say at all core devs meetings.",

    "body": "@Arachnid \r\n\r\nA few comments:\r\n\r\n1. I think quite legitimately, many members of the community would perceive approval of an EIP at an All Core Devs meeting and its marking as 'accepted' as being quite strong \"coordination flags\" (in @vbuterin's terminology). Yes, in a formal sense, neither core devs nor the Ethereum Foundation can insist that nodes upgrade, but in practical terms dissenting once such strong coordination flags have been set means one very likely has already lost a great deal. Either ones choice will leave his or her node uselessly out of consensus, or the node operators will be genuinely divided and the community will bifurcate *a la* Ethereum Classic. I don't think it at all unreasonable that, at least for some matters, the broader community wants some more defined role in social consensus formation prior to what would amount to a long-shot boycott.\r\n\r\n2. Regarding\r\n\r\n    > RFC 7282 is an example of how the IETF handles this, and the sort of process we aspire to. In this context, voting can be harmful, as it gives the impression that decisions are taken by majority rule; on the contrary, one single participant expressing a critical flaw should be enough to torpedo a proposal, and a hundred people with irrelevant objections should not.\r\n\r\n   This makes much more sense for matters that might be understood as _technical_ than for matters that might be understood as _political_. Unfortunately, the distinction between those categories blur, in general but especially in blockchain systems, where technical changes create economic winners and losers quite directly.\r\n\r\n   Although it will never be possible to distinguish the technical and political perfectly, like Potter Stewart's dictum about pornography, we kind of \"know it when we see it\" if some proposal is in fact political. I think the EIP process as you describe it may be adequate for technical questions, but it is not adequate for more contentious and political questions. When EIP commentary devolves to what are essentially political debates, there should be some other process besides or in addition to the expertise-focused process that you describe.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI say all this, by the way, without prejudging contentious questions like when and whether it is appropriate to unfreeze lost assets or reverse \"bad\" transactions. I supported the DAO fork and would support, under some circumstances and with clear justification for why it is to the benefit of the entire community, other proposals that restore lost assets or undo malicious actions. Nevertheless, EIP 867 struck me as entirely inappropriate, a way of making an ostensibly technical change for the clear purpose of greasing the skids for a particular resolution of contentious political questions. The process for overriding pre-agreed \"automatic consensus\" with exceptional \"manual consensus\" (@gavofyork's terms) ought not to be streamlined and easy. It should require very extraordinary social consensus, and it is a virtue, not a vice, that the process for executing such changes not be ordinary or routine. But that is a social and political claim. No matter how beautifully and efficiently, as a technical matter, support for \"state change objects\" could be designed into common node implementations, this political point would stand. And the EIP process, at least as I understand it at present to be constituted, is poorly suited to address this kind of point.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIt is very important to me to end by emphasizing that I don't think anyone is acting in bad faith here, that I sympathize a very great deal with people who lost not-so-small fortunes by adopting software produced by extremely reputable people within the Ethereum community, and that I oppose the self-righteousness and bitter ideological certainty that often suffuse blockchain debates when they do become political. I especially sympathize with the EIP editors, who are trying, actually, to be editors but find themselves in appearance or in actuality thrust into very different roles. If we as a community find ways to move past a _caveat emptor_ ethos without undermining the predictability and consistency, and therefore the legitimacy, and therefore the value, of a blockchain system, I'd be excited to do that. But whether and how we do so is not primarily a technical matter, and I am not sure the EIP process is well suited to shepherding so broad an evolution. ",

I don't agree with everything you say, but I think you're broadly right.\r\n\r\nThe question, though, is whether there's a way to reliably assess community consent on a proposal, without making the standardisation process a political quagmire? I'm strongly of the opinion that good standards are not written by voting, and that approving a standard (independent of implementing it or deploying it) should not require approval from the entire community.\r\n\r\nFurther, the final 'supreme court' is always going to be the economic consensus on which chain has value.

    "body": "Excellent description of the process as it currently works, @Arachnid.\r\n\r\nThe AllCoreDevs meeting is a good forum in which to discuss the technical merits of an EIP, but may not be the best forum in which to discuss the moral/ethical/legal/philosophical implications of decisions. Those attending AllCoreDevs are mostly engineers after all, not experts in M/E/L/P. Still, I do appreciate the efforts made at each meeting to reflect on these matters and to attempt to channel community sentiment (especially when the decision is controversial).\r\n\r\nThe reality here is that groups in the community need to organize if their voices are to be heard by those deciding to accept an EIP, much less have their voices incorporated into the approval step of the EIP workflow. \r\n\r\nThe Fellowship is being organized to improve communications and decision-making processes for Ethereum engineers, perhaps a similar effort can be organized in the community for moral/ethical/legal/philosophical work. \r\n\r\nAn institution can emerge to develop \"Ethereum philosophy\", discuss EIPs in terms of the M/E/L/P implications, reach out to the community for feedback, and even come to consensus to make recommendations to the wider community, AllCoreDevs, and implementers.",

The EIP workflow and even decision-making in general (!) seem to be widely misunderstood in the Ethereum community, and we must work to improve this.\r\n\r\nThere is a very high priority to understanding and improving governance. Every rocket has a guidance system; how is ours?\r\n\r\nTo scale the process (given the level of technology adoption we are now looking at), I believe that the community must adopt **principles and practices** similar to those outlined in the [Fellowship invitation](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/open-invitation-to-participate-in-a-fellowship/14).",

Votes based on the holding of ether can be thought of as measurable or fair, but may not address key technical/format concerns and result in a decision that badly affects the network and important stakeholders.\r\n\r\nWho has the most weight in decisions needs to be very carefully established.\r\n\r\n**RE spamming out of concern:** It is important to illustrate this because this indicates a larger process problem. The objecting posts in controversial EIPs represent a need to be heard that is not being addressed. \r\n\r\nGetting moral/ethical/legal/philosophical is not appropriate for Standard EIPs, but perhaps applicable to a Meta EIP like this one. EIP editors have a clear set of duties to perform, and comments in an EIP should help this work along.\r\n\r\nFrom [EIP-1](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1.md):\r\n\r\n> The EIP editor will not unreasonably deny an EIP. Reasons for denying EIP status include duplication of effort, being technically unsound, not providing proper motivation or addressing backwards compatibility, or **not in keeping with the Ethereum philosophy**.\r\n\r\nThe term \"Ethereum philosophy\" is not defined in EIP-1, yet it seems to carry a lot of weight. Does keeping to a philosophy invite us to debate whether the EIP, once mature, should be accepted? Well looking this term up in the wiki, I find that \"Ethereum philosophy\" is actually a set of design principles, followed by an explainer + vision blurb.\r\n\r\nIf this is the case, it means that there is even less of a basis for debating about M/E/L/P in EIPs.

Changes to the process require more research and especially needs-gathering before I make my own judgement.\r\n\r\nAn example of what you might put into your proposal:\r\n\r\n> This Meta EIP proposes to introduce a \"community review\" step in the EIP process, allowing certain stakeholders to veto the acceptance of an EIP in certain cases involving a hard fork. This Meta EIP also proposes to formalize the current operating role of AllCoreDevs as a \"developer review\" step in the EIP workflow. The effect of this proposal would be to modify the operating EIP process as well as the process described in EIP-1.\r\n>\r\n> The \"developer review\" step in the EIP process applies to all Standard Track EIPs, and is performed by the AllCoreDevs group. In order for any Standard EIP to be accepted, consensus must reached during the \"developer review\" step that the EIP is acceptable.\r\n>\r\n> The \"community review\" step would only apply to \"Standard Track / Core\" EIPs (e.g. those leading to a hard fork). It would occur after AllCoreDevs have reach consensus that the EIP is acceptable. \"Community review\" will use the carbon vote mechanism and require 80% approval. If \"community review\" has less than 80% approval, the \"Standard Track / Core\" EIP cannot be accepted.\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "> 1. **Simplicity** - the Ethereum protocol should be as simple as possible, even at the cost of some data storage or time inefficiency. \r\n\r\nI agree that it should be as simple as practical, but it may be necessary to have quite a high level of complexity, for instance to scale, to internalize costs of storage, bandwidth and I/O, for security, privacy, transparency, etc. Where complexity is necessary, documentation should be as clear, concise and up-to-date as possible.\r\n\r\n> An average programmer should ideally be able to follow and implement the entire specification, so as to fully realize the unprecedented democratizing potential that cryptocurrency brings and further the vision of Ethereum as a protocol that is open to all. Any optimization which adds complexity should not be included unless that optimization provides very substantial benefit.\r\n\r\nI mostly agree with this, although note it does say **ideally**, and most people would consider the [current specification](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf) difficult to read. It takes time to really read and understand it.\r\n\r\n> 2. **Universality** - a fundamental part of Ethereum's design philosophy is that Ethereum does not have \"features\". Instead, Ethereum provides an internal Turing-complete scripting language, which a programmer can use to construct any smart contract or transaction type that can be mathematically defined. Want to invent your own financial derivative? With Ethereum, you can. Want to make your own currency? Set it up as an Ethereum contract. Want to set up a full-scale Daemon or Skynet? You may need to have a few thousand interlocking contracts, and be sure to feed them generously, to do that, but nothing is stopping you with Ethereum at your fingertips.\r\n\r\nIt would be good to talk about abstraction here. The [latest roadmap, scroll to the bottom of the top post](https://ethresear.ch/t/sharding-phase-1-spec/1407) is actually also looking to abstract execution, allowing execution engines to not necessarily have to follow one canonical specification, but for instance it could be tailored for a specific application, as well as a shard.\r\n\r\n> 3. **Modularity** - the parts of the Ethereum protocol should be designed to be as modular and separable as possible. Over the course of development, our goal is to create a program where if one was to make a small protocol modification in one place, the application stack would continue to function without any further modification. Innovations such as [Dagger](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/%5BEnglish%5D-Dagger), [Patricia trees](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/%5BEnglish%5D-Patricia-Tree) and [RLP](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/%5BEnglish%5D-RLP) should be implemented as separate libraries and made to be feature-complete even if Ethereum does not require certain features so as to make them usable in other protocols as well. Ethereum development should be maximally done so as to benefit the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem, not just itself.\r\n\r\nThis is outdated, I suggest rephrasing this to:\r\n\r\n**Modularity** - the parts of the Ethereum protocol should be designed to be as modular and separable as possible. Over the course of development, our goal is to create a program where if one was to make a small protocol modification in one place, the application stack would continue to function without any further modification. Innovations such as Ethash (see the [(Yellow Paper Appendix)](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf#appendix.J) and [wiki article])(https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethash), modified Patricia trees ([Yellow Paper)](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf#appendix.D), [wiki](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/%5BEnglish%5D-Patricia-Tree)) and RLP ([YP](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf#appendix.B), [wiki](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/%5BEnglish%5D-RLP)) should be implemented as separate libraries and are feature-complete, and as part of Ethereum, even if Ethereum does not require certain features, so as to make them usable in other protocols as well. Ethereum development should be maximally done so as to benefit the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem, not just itself.\r\n\r\n> 4. **Agility** - details of the Ethereum protocol are not set in stone. Although we will be extremely judicious about making modifications to high-level constructs such as the [C-like language](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/%5BEnglish%5D-CLL) and the address system, computational tests later on in the development process may lead us to discover that certain modifications to the algorithm or scripting language will substantially improve scalability or security. If any such opportunities are found, we will exploit them.\r\n\r\nThis is also out-dated, and is harder to update. [C-like language](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/%5BEnglish%5D-CLL) doesn't even work any more, I don't know what happened to it. I suggest changing it to:\r\n\r\n4. **Agility** - details of the Ethereum protocol are not set in stone. Although we will be extremely judicious about making modifications to high-level constructs, for instance with the [sharding roadmap](https://ethresear.ch/t/sharding-phase-1-spec/1407/), abstracing execution, with only data availability enshrined in consensus. Computational tests later on in the development process may lead us to discover that certain modifications, e.g. to the protocol architecture or to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), will substantially improve scalability or security. If any such opportunities are found, we will exploit them.\r\n\r\n> 5. **Non-discrimination** - the protocol should not attempt to actively restrict or prevent specific categories of usage. All regulatory mechanisms in the protocol should be designed to directly regulate the harm and not attempt to oppose specific undesirable applications. A programmer can even run an infinite loop script on top of Ethereum for as long as they are willing to keep paying the per-computational-step transaction fee.\r\n\r\nNo suggested changes for that.",

This was stated in an earlier version of EIP-1: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/2145841c6ab56142d6c9beec5d2aaefd5bb52c3d/EIPS/eip-1.md#eip-work-flow\r\n\r\n> Some Informational and Process EIPs may also have a status of “Active” if they are never meant to be completed. E.g. EIP 1 (this EIP).\r\n\r\nThat sentence was unfortunately removed from EIP 1 in a recent PR from @fulldecent that was recently merged: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/1100\r\n\r\n`Superseded` is a redundant status term IMO, equivalent to `replaced-by`. It is not very useful and we could simplify the set of Status terms by removing it.\r\n\r\n",

Quantitatively measuring support/opposition to EIPs\r\n\r\nThese changes do address my first concern.\r\n\r\nAs for my second, I think @MicahZoltu has previously stated, to paraphrase, if people don't like EIPs, they can always \"fork off\". If core devs are wise, I'll assume that they can make appropriate judgements about support in the two week Last Call period.\r\n\r\nSo I'll consider this issue resolved, and I guess have @MicahZoltu to thank for the addition of the \"Last Call\" status.
