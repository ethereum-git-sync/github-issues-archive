In order for this to work, the call needs to be done like every other on the mempool, except that miners are required to include that call if and only if the target event has triggered. \r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\nToken contracts are usually monolithic and do not implement anything other than the balances and the token logic. Merchants or users might want to add listeners to the events. While this is possible via a setup with a node listening to the calls, end-users and developers using remote nodes have no way of achieving this. All in all, this would make the workflow of a task more efficient.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\nIt would be possible to make an airdrop for registered users with locked up \"stake\" ether. Users could call a listener function version of `mint()`. This call would be attached to  a public function that may only be called after a certain block number. Once the participation period is over, the attached `mint()` calls are released, and the tokens are airdropped and the ether is returned to the users.\r\n",
