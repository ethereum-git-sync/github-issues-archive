  "body": "I'd like to get some feedback before submitting a draft:\r\n\r\nIntro\r\n------\r\n\r\nEvery wallet (Metamask, Mobile Wallets, Web Wallets, etc.) that deals with multiple networks need some basic information for every blockchain that it connects to. Metamask for example asks for: \"Network Name\", \"New RPC URL\", \"ChainID (optional)\", \"Symbol (optional)\", \"Block Explorer URL (optional)\".\r\n\r\n![Metamask screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/666289/94666627-ff713700-030d-11eb-913b-b18f7ed963d4.png)\r\n\r\nMost of the time there is a good default for these values, only in edge cases a user would want to customize them. There are lists for these values like https://github.com/ethereum-lists/chains where a user could manually look up the correct values. Often some networks are already pre configured by the wallet.\r\n\r\nProposal\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThere should be an RPC endpoint to fetch these values. Once the user enters the RPC url the values can be fetched from the RPC and the form fields can be filled automatically. Currently there only seems to be an [endpoint to fetch the chainId](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-695).\r\n\r\nThe endpoint would provide these values when configured:\r\n- Network Name\r\n- ChainId\r\n- (NetworkId)\r\n- (Native Coin Name)\r\n- Native Coin Symbol\r\n- Blockchain Explorer URL (and explorer type? blockscout, etherscan, etc. to figure out the url structure...)\r\n- (Faucet URL)\r\n\r\n",

Any chance you could write the method specification using [OpenRPC \"method\"](https://spec.open-rpc.org#method-object) syntax? This way we can get this added to the [JSON RPC standard method set](https://github.com/etclabscore/ethereum-json-rpc-specification), and regenerate sdk's so we can get to using these values in a sane way :) ",
