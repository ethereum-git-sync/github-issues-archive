There are two different ways:\r\n1. The owner of the EOA created an address collision to have their EOA collide with the deployment of a contract, and they decided to use it as an EOA first. This is the fault of the owner of this address, and would be stupid, because it being a contract address will (with the implementation of EIP-3607) strictly reduce their capabilities. So there is no attack surface here.\r\n2. Someone else (other than the account owner) brute forced an account to collide with this. Note that this requires a *preimage attack* rather than just finding a collision, which is much harder. In fact it is just as hard as just brute forcing the private key for the address. So this attack should be considered computationally infeasible (complexity `2**160`).\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "I don't see an immediately obvious and simple solution, but it would be great if self destructing a contract didn't make that address accessible by an EOA.  I believe the specification as currently written would allow someone with an EOA + contract collusion to self destruct the contract and then access all of the assets held by that address via the EOA.\r\n\r\nDisallowing this would...\r\n1. Give stronger guarantees that there is no way for any human to access the assets held by a colliding contract.\r\n2. Allow us to implement a one way \"convert to contract\" feature where users can submit a transaction that writes code to their EOA address and that functionally turns it into a contract (permanently).\r\n3.
