    "body": "My opinion is that while I support using only ether and wei for the end user (with SI extensions) and retiring the use of all other uses, I don't think removing them from web3.js is the solution. End users shouldn't be caring about variable inside the web3 object.\n\nYou'll notice that on the wallet for example we don't even use SI units. The price of gas for example is defined as _\"X ether per million gas\"_\n\nIn numismatic, the face of a person on a coin or a banknote is called \"Effigy\". So here's a compromise solution: officially the only **units** become ether and wei, and we call all others **suggested effigies**.  This allows the names to be kept for historical reasons and niche discussions (for example, when deciding what would be the default gas price at launch, calling them \"shannon\" was very useful).\n\nSo 0.000001 _ether_ can be described using the _unit_ **micro ether** while _Szabo_ is just considered a _suggested effigy_.\n\nThis is how it's [currently described](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/blob/master/lib/utils/utils.js#L294) on the web3.js library:\n\n```\n    SI Short   SI Full        Effigy       Other\n  - kwei       femtoether     ada\n  - mwei       picoether      babbage\n  - gwei       nanoether      shannon      nano\n  - --         microether     szabo        micro\n  - --         milliether     finney       milli\n  - ether      --             --\n  - kether                    einstein     grand\n  - mether\n  - gether\n  - tether\n```\n",

I agree that \"finney\", \"szabo\" and \"shannon\" are quite valuable in particular kinds of discussions, and perhaps if some day ETH becomes ultravaluable we can transition to finney being the default unit of discussions (see Bitcoin's [in my view] general failure to get people to use \"millibitcoins\" or \"bits\"; that lesson was in fact the original reason behind coming up with finney etc in the first place) but while that day hasn't come not using finney that much seems fine.\n",
