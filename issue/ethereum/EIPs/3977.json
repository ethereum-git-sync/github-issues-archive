  "body": "In an ERC, \r\n\r\nCurrently, for a contract to be considered conforming an ERC standard, all it has to do is to have all required methods specified in the right method signatures (parameters etc).\r\n\r\nHowever, often an ERC standard specifiy certain methods behaves certain way with a `MUST` statement. It seems to me currently there is no standard way to validate it.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if `an ERC can also propose a section to include standardized TESTs so there is a machine-runnable way to validate if a contract follows all MUST in an ERC standard specifications.`\r\n\r\nA potential use-case, for example, is that De-App platforms or clients who specifically cares about interoperability for contracts can ensure they only operate on contacts not just \"look like an ERC\" but also actually \"behaves as ERC required\".\r\n\r\nI wonder if (1) this idea has been previously discussed, (2) if not yet, any potential problems?\r\n\r\nOne I can first think of is that sometimes the behavior is state-dependent, and from outside there is no way to test it before the contract reaches certain state. However we can run other TESTs to rule out cases that is immmediately validatable. We could also do post-factual validation: going through the on-chain history of a contract and monitor the state change and behavior and see if any time it violates the standard specification.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
