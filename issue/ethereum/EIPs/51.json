With the current polling cycle we make come easily up to a batch request with 20-40 request, which we poll every 200ms.  \nThis creates a CPU overhead in the dapp as well as in the node, in 95% of the cases the requests come back with not change.\n\nSo push to the rescue.  \nWe introduced a [new push API](https://hackpad.com/RPC-interface-VDul0tsDu1t), based on the JSON RPC 2.0 notification support and already implemented that in the geth node's RPC layer.\nIt works fine with the current IPC socket connection and is implemented in the web3.js#subscriptions branch.\n\nTo make it working for the HTTP transport layer we need to introduce web socket support.  \n\nThis ERC is mainly to discuss the pros and cons of moving to web sockets. Whether normal HTTP requests should be deprecated or not etc.\n# Usage\n\nWeb sockets will be introduced like another provider and will work the same as the currently existing IPC provider. Once you choose to use the web socket provider, all communication (method calls, notfications) go through an open web socket created by the provider module.\n# Pros and Cons\n\nAs much as web sockets improve the development of dapps, it has some certain drawbacks and based on those, we need to decide in which direction to go here.\n## Pros\n- push notifications, allowing for pub/sub\n- faster notification\n- less CPU usage on the node (no polling request to process) and on the Dapps (no sending and analysing of poll cycles)\n## Cons\n- in the current implementation, subscriptions are based on sockets, so lost connections would require the dapp to re-subscribe (or we could try to do this automatically in web3.js)\n- web sockets are problematic on mobile devices, due to the cell tower switches and unstable internet connections\n  - certain cell towers/mobile providers, can cancel and regain connections without the dapp being notified, therefore loose the subscription without noticing it\n  - some mobile providers don't allow web sockets at all. (could be an outdated info)\n- Dapps couldn't make synchronous calls anymore, as web sockets don't allow that (which are a no go for UI's anyway).\n# Deprecation\n\nIdeally i would like to remove all polling code from web3.js and the nodes RPC side, so that for notifications sockets is the only way. This will clean up the complexity of both web3.js and the node and remove the need to maintain a legacy connection.\n\nWe could keep the HTTP request based providers for all simple calls. This would allow to still request, but not use filters etc anymore, as they would require push.\n# Community Request\n\nPlease give comments and reasons, why we should go in one way or another. Please lets keep this ERC short :)\n",

I'd love for Web3 fires events when the connection drops or is reconnected, and if the dapp wants to it could handle those events and respond accordingly. But I think it should be Web3's responsibility to maintain a connection and not place that burden onto each dapp (because this is something each dapp will want to do, except in rare cases).\n\nIf we reconnect automatically, mobile devices would work more seamlessly as the connection would drop on a cell tower change, but would automatically reconnect behind the scenes with no hindrance to the user.\n",

    "body": "If we decide to implement the WS interface I would like to see the current HTTP interface marked deprecated and removed in the future. Removing only the polling methods from the current HTTP interface and let the rest intact doesn't make much sense. Any non trivial DApp will probably want to use these filters an thus making the HTTP interface unusable.\n\nWen a connection is droped and reestablished I would not let web3 try to recreate the subscriptions. What should happen if a connection is recreated after 1 second, or after 1 minute, or after 10 minutes? By default I would simply drop the subscriptions and notify the DApp that the connection is lost. Maybe you can allow DApps to give web3 a callback that is called when the connection is reestablished. That callback can receive the subscriptions that were active when the connection was dropped. DApps can then recreate the subscriptions if necessary.\n",

    "body": "@bas-vk See your point. But I think a) most dapps (let's say 9 out of 10) will want to reconnect, and b) information about the status can be handled by events. At the very worst, I think we should make reconnection optional rather than default, because there's no reason for each dapp to write the same reconnection code. \n\nSome prior art regarding reconnection by default, and as an option:\n1. Socket.io makes it optional: http://socket.io/docs/client-api/#manager(url:string,-opts:object)\n2. In Faye, it's automatic (search \"Retry interval\" within the page): http://faye.jcoglan.com/browser.html\n3. PubNub is also automatic, and includes some \"catch up\" mechanism that relays missed messages: https://www.pubnub.com/knowledge-base/discussion/332/how-does-auto-reconnect-work\n",

    "body": "Note about websockets and their ability to communicate their connection status. TL;DR: They suck at it. \n\n---\n\nI strongly recommend we implement a heartbeat mechanism on top of the websocket connection to provide dapps quicker information about the state of their connectivity. You can see a live demo of how websockets respond to connectivity issues in this video, which is to say they respond poorly:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/3MFlyQshsvY\n\n**I've also detailed the issues below.**\n1. In the case of an internet connection disruption, the websocket object doesn't receive a disconnect event until a websocket message has been sent to the server from the browser. \n2. Between the time of the internet disruption and when a message is sent from the browser, all messages pushed from the server are lost.\n3. This means there could be minutes or more of non-connectivity without a status update, increasing the amount of backdata that needs to be gathered on reconnection.  \n4. Furthermore, there are issues that exacerbate this period of non-connectivity without update:\n   1. Even if the internet connection comes back online, the websocket connection still won't be notified of a disruption until a websocket message is sent from the browser.\n   2. Even worse, if the internet connection stays disconnected, the websocket object won't be notified **at all** of connection interruption (at least, within an acceptable time period) **even if** a websocket message is sent. Both these issues are shown in the video above.\n5. This is unacceptable for dapps that rely on an immediate and up-to-date connection to the network (think financial instruments or block explorers), but it's also unacceptable for normal dapps that would like to maintain a good user experience even during periods of disconnectivity.\n6. Possibly the most important point: In building our websocket implementation, we have a chance to solve this problem for everyone. \n\nAn easy solution is to maintain a web3-level heartbeat system (think, ping/pong, back and forth between browser and server). The browser (web3) pings the websocket server sending a normal message but containing a specific payload, and the server responds quickly with a pong. After a certain timeout (say, a few seconds, or 10?) we give up on the connection and fire a disconnect message ourselves if we haven't received the pong response. \n\nThere's no reason every dapp developer should have to implement this behavior themselves, and I think better status checking would apply universally. At worst, if people don't want it, we could easily make it configurable. Finally, I don't think we should trust browsers websocket implementations to correctly communicate their connection status, because as proven in the video above they're poor at doing it. I can easily profile other browsers if you prefer.\n",

    "body": "> We could keep the HTTP request based providers for all simple calls. \r\n\r\nIf I understand this discussion correctly, there is a suggestion to remove support for querying the node using something like 'curl.' If that is correct? I think this would remove a significant capability that pub/sub won't meet. (Although, I'm open to being argued out of that position--I don't know enough about pub/sub.)\r\n\r\nI write C++ code that 'scans' the chain. This means I start at any block, retrieve the block, then retrieve each transaction in the block, then each of the receipts for each transaction, etc. I do this using 'curl.' It's slow as hell, but I cache the data in a local database which means the next time I try to scan it's significantly faster.\r\n\r\nThis allows me to do all sorts of data analysis on the chain as a whole (as opposed to say one or a small collection of addresses). Another use for the method is what I call \"Forensic Accounting.\" I'm not sure pub/sub would work. At the very least, it would be made much more difficult.\r\n\r\nMy code is dependent on the ability to get the block/transaction/receipt data \"on-demand.\" As you develop this EIP, please keep in mind that some code interacts with the data using things other than  Javascript and web3.js.\r\n\r\nThanks.",

They work by sending normal one-off requests at a regular interval behind the scenes; there's no \"polling\" RPC interface; it's just a loop in the client library somewhere to make developer's lives easier.\r\n\r\nThose API calls you're using are the standard one-and-done requests to get information; removing those would be a little odd, since that sort of information retrieval is the entire reason client libraries like this exist. You're not in any danger of having to rewrite your code.\r\n\r\nSo yes, the filter commands, like frozeman mentioned earlier:\r\n> I would like to deprecate the eth_newFilter and eth_getFilterMessages endpoints and remove the polling from web3.js",
