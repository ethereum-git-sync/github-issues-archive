  "body": "### Specification\r\n\r\nIf a contract creation is attempted, due to either a creation transaction or the CREATE (or future CREATE2) opcode, and the destination address already has either nonzero nonce, or nonempty code, then the creation throws immediately, with exactly the same behavior as would arise if the first byte in the init code were an invalid opcode. This applies retroactively starting from genesis.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nThis is the most correct approach for handling the case where a contract is created in a slot where a contract already exists, as the current behavior of overwriting contract code is highly unintuitive and dangerous.\r\n\r\nCurrently this is not an issue because there is no way to create a contract with the same address twice without spending >2^80 computational effort to find an address collision, but with #86 this will change. Hence it is important to have correct behavior for this situation in the long term. This can be safely applied retroactively for simplicity, because currently creating a contract with the same address twice is computationally infeasible.",
