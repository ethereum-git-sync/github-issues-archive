[Burn](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/7a9673e0bd7f1f8d7e699fb1271b320d63964dbc/EIPS/eip-3475.md?plain=1#L284) was a given as an example but no event was defined\r\n2. [burnBond](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/7a9673e0bd7f1f8d7e699fb1271b320d63964dbc/EIPS/eip-3475.md?plain=1#L104) in comment doesn't exist in any definition in this file \r\n3. [transferAllowanceFrom](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/7a9673e0bd7f1f8d7e699fb1271b320d63964dbc/EIPS/eip-3475.md?plain=1#L68) was declared with \"virtual override\" which isn't an valid solidity interface\r\n4. Usages of [`emit` implementation code and `event` with interface](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/7a9673e0bd7f1f8d7e699fb1271b320d63964dbc/EIPS/eip-3475.md?plain=1#L267) renders non-compilable code in any place.\r\n5. In consistency and mixure usage of `//` vs `/**/`.\r\n\r\nA discussion for editorial policy / procedure: shall we consider impose a rule that for when a last-call EIP changes a lot, they shall not [go to Final in that same commit](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/5385/files) and, maybe, revert to `Review` to give people more time for reviewing the updated version. I will file a separate issue for procedure proposal\r\n\r\nNotify: @dhruvmalik007 @yuliu-debond",
