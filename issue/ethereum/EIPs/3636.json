  "body": "**Problem**\r\n**Front running bot**\r\nBot and front-running bot is becoming an obsession of market participants crypto DEX. \r\nEspecially for new tokens, every transaction that has the potential to increase the token price is caught by front running bots. Make investors lose money right after the trade. \r\nThis makes investors afraid to participate in the DEX market, and it has hindered the development of the DEX market in particular and the crypto market in general.\r\n**Hacking in DEFI**\r\nFrom 2018 to now, every year dozens of hacks occur with billions of dollars in damage to the community.\r\nSince it is a decentralized application, these wallet addresses are all without anything to stop it. Current hacks are still happening daily, crashing projects and investors have lost a lot of money.\r\n**Phishing projects**\r\nPhishing projects are also becoming increasingly popular. That also hinders the development of the whole market. Scam projects should not have appeared. Owners of scam projects after withdrawing money are still cavalier without anyone being able to do anything.\r\nBlockchain is transparency, anonymity, but by no means fraud, hacking, and illegal profiteering. We need solutions to stop these things.\r\n**Solution**\r\nWe have implemented a solution and proposed to make it a new standard for ERC20, BEP20, ERC721 tokens, and exchanges, farming, games, dapps Decentralized blacklist. \r\n\r\nConstantly updating and adding \"black\" addresses to the list is very expensive (**needs a lot of transaction gas fees)**. And each project also needs to keep a close eye on the market developments of the hacks to be able to update in time, which is also a very difficult thing. Front running bots also need an automatic scanning and updating system to be able to stop them in time.\r\nUnity is a strength, if a blacklist of addresses is centrally managed in a smart contract and other projects use them together, it will save a lot of costs, manpower, and data is also updated, continuously updated.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Decentralized Governance**\r\nIn order for the project to be transparent and fair, we propose to establish a council, including those who staking tokens into this smart contract..\r\nTo avoid manipulation, the voting power ratio is not only based on the stake ratio but also on the staking time. Called proof of stake and time. (PoST)\r\n\r\nEach stakeholder, when staking a number of shares, needs to wait for a minimum period of 1 month to start voting.\r\nDecisions are executed when at least ⅔ of the total stakes are approved.\r\nEach accepted vote (matching the final result, whether approve or disapprove) will be rewarded with an amount token in proportion to the stake.\r\n10% of total tokens will be locked and reserved for rewards\r\n\r\n**Mistakes and opportunities for vindication It**\r\n\r\nis entirely possible for a token to be blacklisted through a mistake. (For example, receiving money from a hacker account but not related, or an exchange's wallet received money from a hacker and processed it internally)\r\nThe project provides a tool for these accounts to call “unjust”. The Council of Stakeholders will vote.\r\n\r\n**Voting**\r\n**Vote unlist**\r\nEach account is blacklisted, if you believe you were wrongly, can perform the function of whitewash, with a link to evidence stored outside.\r\nThen the stakeholder council will vote. If the minimum amount of ⅔ of the agreed shares is reached, the account will be removed from the blacklist and can trade normally in the alliance smart contracts.\r\nAn account can claim an unlimited number of times.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Voting to remove a stakeholder**\r\nWhen a stakeholder has many manifestations of fraud, dishonesty, and objectivity in voting, another stakeholder can propose to remove the other account from the stakeholder.\r\nIf there is at least 90% of the remaining stakeholder's shares (except for the account under suspicion of fraud), the stakeholder will be removed from the list.\r\nAll of that person's shares will be burned.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Voting to remove an Crime Hunter**\r\nIf a Crime Hunter occurs 3 or more misdemeanors then that Crime Hunter will be removed from the list and lose all staked tokens. These tokens will be burned.\r\nIf 1 Crime Hunter allows 2 wrongful cases, the other stakeholders will vote to remove Crime Hunter from the Crime Hunters list and the list of stakeholders.\r\nIf there are at least 90% stakes of the stakeholders remaining (except for accounts being processed) the auror will be removed from the list.\r\nAll of that person's shares will be burned.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe above will motivate stakeholders to work fairly and seriously, and the shared blacklist will be managed decentralized.\r\nAfter 1 year of operation, the core team will cancel its owner rights and become a normal stakeholder. And can also be removed if it is voted against by stakeholders. At this point, the antibot will become a fully decentralized project.\r\n\r\n**A new standard for tokens and Dapps.**\r\nIn order to promote a decentralized economy that is fair, transparent, and safe for everyone to use, we propose to make antibot.finance the new standard for Dapps and token applications.\r\n\r\nHackers and scammers will immediately have the assets in those tokens and applications disabled if they perform a hack. No matter where they transfer money, they will be tracked and locked.\r\nFull document: https://docs.antibot.finance/\r\n",
