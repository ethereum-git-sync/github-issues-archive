  "body": "## Summary\r\n\r\nA way to interact with smart contracts (read and write) without spending gas.\r\n\r\n## Abstract\r\n\r\nCurrently, only read functions of smart contracts are free, but they can not change data. Gas is needed for other (write) interaction with smart contracts. This could be the problem, because users of đApps must have enough Ethereum for their usage. This is not good for new users of đApps because they must buy Ethereum even for simple contract operations.\r\n\r\nIn order to make Ethereum and smart contracts more useful and user-friendly, there should be a way to interact with them without gas.\r\n\r\n## Possible solutions\r\n\r\nOne solution is to make another blockchain network, which will be just for smart contracts and it will be free. Like test networks but more stable. This has a problem, because users would have to download both blockchains for usage of đApps.\r\n\r\nAnother solution is to make faucet for gas on mainnet. This could also has a problem, because it could lead to abuse of faucet.",

Depending on how DApps integrate this into their UX, it would seamlessly feel to the user that interacting with smart contracts are free. The way it works is that users sign messages signalling execution requests, and relay these messages to third party executioners. The executioners deploy the transaction to the chain and cover the gas fees. They can then be reimbursed in a token or in some other way (such as gaining a new user).",
