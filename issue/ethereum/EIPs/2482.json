Both can be fixed and built upon the other, so we just need to pick an order.\r\n\r\nNow, since we already do have an implementation of our EIP, I'd say we are a bit farther ahead in it (i.e. we'd actually like to release in in the next version of Geth) vs. this one I *think* does not yet have an impl. And the tx propagation EIP has a hotfix effect on the network (will greatly reduce bandwidth) vs. this one is a client nicety with no immediate impact on the network health (i.e. I think the tx prop is a bit more imprtant).\r\n\r\nThat said, I obviously have a dog in this race, so please chime in others too :P ",

In that case however, we'll probably need to figure out the request/response ID for transactions too, which is not *that* obvious, because transaction responses use the same packet as tx broadcasts.

Make the second element the list that defines the whole command in the current scheme.\r\n>\r\n> This is consistent with the request / response pairs in the `les` protocol\r\n\r\nThis is absolutely **not** consistent with either LES or SNAP, or for the matter of fact the example packets given above.\r\n\r\nIn both LES and SNAP, the request ID is simply the first field, after which come all the other fields in the same flat scoping. There's no extra wrapping. If all the other fields are a single list of hashes or whatnot, obviously you will have them in a list, but that's not \"the whole command in the current scheme\".\r\n\r\nBlindly dropping the whole command in there would simply add a dependency between protocol versions, because we can't just have a standalone eth/66, because we need the eth/65 messages to be scoped in there. Let's just please not even mention eth/65. List the old message formats if you want, list the new message formats and don't try to make a strange rule how one is derived from the other. The new packets should be meaningful standalone, not in context of the old protocol.",

The first example lists:\r\n\r\n* `GetBlockHeaders (0x03)`\r\n   * **Current (eth/65):** `[block: {P, B_32}, maxHeaders: P, skip: P, reverse: P in {0, 1}]`\r\n   * **Then (eth/66)**: `[request_id: P, [block: {P, B_32}, maxHeaders: P, skip: P, reverse: P in {0, 1}]]`\r\n \r\nSo in `eth/65` we have a list that holds the `block_hash`, `max_headers`, `skip` and `reverse` and for `eth/66` we turn it into a list that holds  the `request_id` followed by another list that again holds `block_hash`, `max_headers`, `skip` and `reverse`.\r\n\r\nAnd isn't that exactly what [LES](https://github.com/ethereum/devp2p/blob/master/caps/les.md) does, too?\r\n\r\n>GetBlockHeaders (0x02)\r\n>[reqID: P, [block: {P, B_32}, maxHeaders: P, skip: P, reverse: P in {0, 1}]]\r\n\r\nI can't figure out which part you are disagreeing with?
