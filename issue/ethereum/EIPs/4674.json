Existing projects utilizing standards like EIP-1633 conventionally deploy seperate ERC-20 compatible token standard to fractionalize the non-fungible token into ERC-20 tokens. In contrast, this ERC allows each token ID to represent a token type representing(fractionalizing) the non-fungible token.\r\n\r\nThis standard is approximate in terms of using ``_id`` for distinguishing token types. However, this ERC has a clear difference with ERC-1155 as each ``_id`` represents a distinct NFT.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nThe conventional fractionalization process of fractionalizing a NFT to FT requires deployment of a FT token contract representing the ownership of NFT. This leads to inefficient bytecode usage on Ethereum Blockchain and limits functionalities since each token contract is seperated into its own permissioned address.\r\nWith the rise of multiple NFT projects needing to fractionalize NFT to FT, new type of token standard is needed to back up them.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n/**\r\n    @title Multi-Fractional Non-Fungible Token Standard\r\n    @dev Note : The ERC-165 identifier for this interface is 0x83f5d35f.\r\n*/\r\ninterface IMFNFT {\r\n    /**\r\n        @dev This emits when ownership of any token changes by any mechanism.\r\n        The `_from` argument MUST be the address of an account/contract sending the token.\r\n        The `_to` argument MUST be the address of an account/contract receiving the token.\r\n        The `_id` argument MUST be the token type being transferred.

Also, copying the name & symbol every time when token gets added might place a lot of redundant bytecode on the Ethereum blockchain. \r\nHowever, according to the need and design of the project it could also be added to each token type by fetching the metadata from the NFT contract.\r\n\r\n**Design**\r\n\r\nMost of the decisions made around the design of this ERC were done to keep it as flexible for diverse token design & architecture.\r\nThese minimum requirement for this standard allows for each project to determine their own system for minting, governing, burning their MFNFT tokens depending on their programmable architecture.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nTo make this standard compatible with existing standards, this standard ``event`` & ``function`` names are identical with ERC-20 token standard with some more ``events`` & ``functions`` to add token type dynamically.\r\n\r\nAlso, the sequence of parameter in use of ``_id`` for distinguishing token types in ``functions`` and ``events`` are very much similar to ERC-1155 Multi-Token Standard.\r\n\r\nSince this standard is intended to interact with the EIP-721 Non-Fungible Token Standard, it is kept purposefully agnostic to extensions beyond the standard in order to allow specific projects to design their own token usage and scenario.\r\n\r\n## Test Cases\r\n\r\nReference Implementation of MFNFT Token includes test cases written using hardhat. (Test coverage : 100%)\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\n**Standards**\r\n* [ERC-20 Fungible Token Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20)\r\n* [ERC-721 Non-Fungible Token Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721)\r\n* [ERC-1155 Multi-Token Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155)\r\n* [ERC-165 Standard Interface Detection](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165)\r\n* [ERC-1633 Re-Fungible Token Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1633)\r\n\r\n**Implementations**\r\n\r\n* [Multi-Fractional NFT Reference Implementation](https://github.com/PowerStream3604/multi-fnft)\r\n\r\n**Multi-Fractional NFT Implementations and Projects**\r\n1.
