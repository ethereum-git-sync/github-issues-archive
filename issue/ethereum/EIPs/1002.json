The Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians is working on this process and I think it needs an issue to maintain updates on the process for transparency... and this is a very auspicious number for such a magical EIP :-D\r\n\r\nSome relevant issues already proposed with very nice informative comments are: \r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/797\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/898 \r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/736\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/988\r\n\r\nA lot of this will be discussed in Toronto and will likely be live streamed so more people can participate in the discussion.
