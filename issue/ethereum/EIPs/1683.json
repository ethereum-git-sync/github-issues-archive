Our main motivation for this proposal is to fix this major Ethereum onboarding problem, by drawing on\r\n\r\n- the best proven on-boarding user experience offered by existing web2 apps (WeChat/Paypal)\r\n- the emerging interoperability standards of web3 such as Universal Identity Contracts & ENS.\r\n\r\nAs a result we have developed an invite functionality to onboard new users to Ethereum during the [Status Hackathon 2018](https://hackathon.status.im/) in collaboration with [Alex Van De Sande](https://twitter.com/avsa) & [Marek Kirejczyk](https://github.com/marekkirejczyk) as an extension to [EIP1078](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1078) and the [Universal Login SDK](https://github.com/UniversalLogin/UniversalLoginSDK).\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\n### Assumptions\r\n\r\nIn order for the invite functionality scheme to work in practice, the following assumptions needs to be valid: \r\n\r\n- Alice has an EIP 1078 identity contract and wants to send an ERC721 or ERC20 token to Bob\r\n- Bob is a new user without ETH, wallet or any prior crypto knowledge\r\n- Alice share the QR code or invite link with Bob over a secure channel e.g Signal\r\n- There is a proper incentive in place (on a user, dapp or relay level) to pay gas\r\n\r\n\r\n### Key Scheme\r\n\r\n![invite scheme](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18598519/48316096-10f8ab00-e5df-11e8-89f0-63a0397c904c.png)\r\n\r\n1. Alice shares an invite link or QR code with Bob, including a transit private key and a signature\r\n1. Clicking the link, Bob is directed to a webpage\r\n2. Bob generates his own private key stored in the browser\r\n3. Bob uses the transit private key to sign Bob’s address\r\n4. Bob’s browser sends his two signatures to the relayer \r\n5. The Relayer calls Alice’s identity contract\r\n6. Then Alice’s identity contract creates an identity contract for Bob and sends a Robot\r\n7. In addition, Bob can now also help Alice recover access to her identity contract in the future using a social key recovery mechanism\r\n8. Bob now got the Robot he wanted, and in addition has a Universal Login Contract and ENS name 9. which allows him to use the best of web3 to login to all other Ethereum dapps.\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\n\r\nThe rationale for above is enabling to send digital assets and/or Universal Login invite link to users before they have any Ethereum address yet. This will enable new users to get onboarded to the entire dapp ecosystem by only clicking a link or scanning a QR code.\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\n### Modular Universal Login Implementation\r\n\r\nThe main function of the module is transferTokensByLink, which:\r\n\r\n- Verifies 2 signatures (sender's and receiver's signatures)\r\n- Checks that link wasn't used before (by storing transitPubKey in storage)\r\n- Transfers tokens from sender's identity contract to receiver address\r\n\r\n**Sender's signature verification** can be done using [owner.canExecute](https://gist.github.com/Dobrokhvalov/00e2bbca13a1378636fa5a400bd692f5#file-invitelink-sol-L117)\r\n\r\nFor **transferring tokens**, we can use [owner.moduleExecute ](https://gist.github.com/Dobrokhvalov/00e2bbca13a1378636fa5a400bd692f5#file-invitelink-sol-L141)\r\n\r\n### Reducing Gas cost via Proxy delegation (EIP 1167)\r\n\r\nUsing Proxy delegation the gas price can be reduced around 10x\r\n\r\n[Ropsten gas price](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/tx/0xe6dd4c6a2050240c3d942f4f745eab9d34cdeb050d756d63b7429397c2ab931d) before optimization\r\n\r\n[Ropsten gas price](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/tx/0xcdf897efe1e0a6b2b455b1638ca1a02df3ae7a5e1f5d772c177e99c1317be3a0) after optimization etherscan\r\n\r\n### React Native Starter\r\n\r\nAs we are actively working to implement invite link functionality into different mobile applications, we have developed this [Universal Login React Native Starter](https://github.com/VolcaTech/UniversalLoginRNStarter)\r\n\r\n## Demos of applications built on top\r\n\r\n### Onbotting.eth webdapp developed during Status Hackathon\r\n\r\n[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K67dOixMBWI&t=)\r\n\r\n### Cryptoxmas.xyz - Charity Christmas NFT Cards\r\n\r\n[Video](https://twitter.com/dobrokhvalov/status/1071440314169208834)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
