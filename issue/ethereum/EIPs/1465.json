Closed for obvious reasons.** \r\n\r\nHowever, this did bring up a good point in regards to contracts that are used as interfaces not having to require all functions to be used... But I shouldn't have posted an issue without looking into the problem... I was seeing things, and could've sworn that function overloading didn't work... Sleep Deprivation...\r\n\r\nAnyway, I will look into abstract implementations further and create a new issue if it makes sense.\r\n",
