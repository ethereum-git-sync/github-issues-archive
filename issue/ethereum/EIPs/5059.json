Similar to how `selfdestruct` transfers ether to the destination without making a call to it.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nFrom an architectural point of view, execution flow should never be handed over to an untrusted contract. Ethereum currently does not have any ideal way to transfer ether without transferring the execution. People have come up with reentrancy guards and similar solutions to prevent some types of attacks but it's not an ideal solution.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\nMUST introduce a new opcode, `airdrop` that transfers ether to the destination without making a call to it.\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\nThis behavior is already possible via `selfdestruct` but is prohibitively expensive. A good security expensive should not be made expensive, artificially.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\nNo known issues.\r\n\r\n## Test Cases\r\nTODO\r\n\r\n## Reference Implementation\r\nMaybe TODO\r\n\r\n## Security Considerations\r\nNo known additional security risk.\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
