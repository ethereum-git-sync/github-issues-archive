But for now, we might not know how to motivate to keep the state DB size small in terms of blockchain technology. This is an experimental trial to give an example which might give incentive that miners should keep the db small.  \r\n\r\n## Abstract\r\n\r\nThere are 3 big changes.\r\n1. We have a common unique contract `ThePostOffice` which issues stamps as contract notes which define the term `s` in which a stamp is valid. If `SELFDESTRUCT` happens, it takes `x` per cent of the stamp fee as cleaning fee of garbage contracts which will be paid to the miner, `100-x` per cent is used for the gas, and the rest is returned to the stamped contract sender. \r\n2. All contracts without contract notes ( or stamps ) is valid only for some term `t` ( e.g. 3 months or 6 months or 1 year or something else ). 'We' ( needing definition ) can paste stamps whenever a contract is valid. \r\n3. `SELFDESTRUCT` can happen only when the valid term `t+s` has passed. i.e. `SELFDESTRUCT` is a system-operation and it prohibits anyone and any contract from calling it as opcodes.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nThe motivation of this issue is related with #771 .\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\n\r\nThe rationale of this issue is related with #771 .\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nThis would need a hard fork. If this hard fork occurred,  currently attached contracts should be updated with buying stamps and pasting it in the valid term `t`. If the contracts have `SELFDESTRUCT` in their codes, the opcode simply won't work.\r\n\r\n## Test Cases\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\nPerhaps or maybe, Copyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
