It's either a standard nor process proposal.\r\n\r\nThe continous-integration Travis currently supports `htmlproofer`, `eip-validator`, `codespells`. One of the most important thing in the EIPs are the code representation of interfaces, some in solidity, e.g. \r\n\r\nHow about we create a new Travis task that strips the interface defined in the EIPs and check the interfaces defined in a EIP, if defined in Solidity (or other languages), to be valid Solidity (or other) code? How do you think of the idea, or have this been discussed before? \r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n",
