One thing we want to be careful of is enshrining ERC20 tokens into the core Ethereum protocol, since it means we'll never be able to move past them in terms of technology.\r\n\r\nAlso, keep in mind that if EIP-1559 is merged (which continues to look more and more likely), then ETH **MUST** be burned as part of every transaction if there is any congestion.  This means that even if the miners did accept some other token as the miner bribe, someone would still need to burn ETH for the transaction to get included.\r\n\r\nCheck out https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2711 and https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2938 and https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2733 for some alternative proposals that may enable different mechanisms for gas payments.",
