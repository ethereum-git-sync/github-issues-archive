  "body": "EIP-155 requires that different chains must have unique chain ID. Specification contains list of chains with their IDs, but it turns out that this list is incomplete and contains only biggest chains. There's no official full list (I think we can't assume that https://github.com/ethereum-lists/chains is official list because it's not mentioned in EIP-155).\r\n\r\nRequiring unique ID without providing list of used IDs looks like serious design problem in EIP-155. There's no way to check if given chain ID is free. As a result, there may appear conflicts like https://github.com/ethereum-lists/chains/issues/25\r\n\r\nTo resolve this issue I propose to include full list in EIP-155 or create an official list somewhere and insert link to it in specification.",

The problem is EIP155 is done by @vbuterin - so he need to approve to trigger the merge - but I think he has more important things to do.\r\n\r\nAdding all chains via PRs to ethereum/EIPs sounds like a big overhead and will make EIP numbers even larger. Especially with so many chains popping up over time.",
