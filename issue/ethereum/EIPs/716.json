Although they can all follow the mainnet, some tests fail (for example, `BlockchainTests/GeneralStateTests/stCreateTest/TransactionCollisionToEmpty_d0g1v0.json` reveals a difference between `geth` and `cpp-ethereum`).\r\n\r\nIt is not desirable to keep the unspecified corner in the specification.\r\n\r\n## Possible solutions\r\n\r\nSince no more empty accounts exist on the mainnet, the question here is how to specify what happened on the mainnet.\r\n\r\nThere are many ways to specify what happened on the mainnet.\r\na. [address 3 is special](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/3c8656347f67dbc8e57c663ec5c26d24c4151678/core/state/journal.go#L97), although otherwise touched accounts become untouched after OOGs\r\nb. [precompiled contracts are special](https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/blob/9a13ce49082eee29e5d9159c3549087c675fa50c/libethereum/Executive.cpp#L274), although otherwise touched accounts become untouched after OOGs\r\nc. [a certain transaction in a certain block is spceial](https://github.com/ethereum/yellowpaper/pull/288/files#diff-9f702e1491c55da9d76a68d651278764R2257), although otherwise touched accounts become untouched after OOGs\r\nd. OOG in inner calls should keep touched accounts; OOG in the outermost call in a transaction untouches accounts.\r\ne. OOG in the touching call and inner calls should keep touched accounts; OOG in a parent call context untouches accounts.\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\n<del>The proposal here is to pick d. or e. because they do not involve magic numbers.  Perhaps `e.` is cleaner because it does not talk about the magic \"outermost call\".</del>\r\n\r\nAfter seeing options, `a.` looks the simplest.\r\n\r\n## Steps to be taken\r\n\r\n* [ ] an experimental implementation of `a.` on cpp-ethereum is created will be tested on the mainet.\r\n* [ ] an EIP will be written\r\n* [ ] the EIP will be discussed in coredev meetings\r\n* [ ] test cases will follow the EIP\r\n* [ ] YP will follow the EIP",

    "body": "Some more context\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nAt block 2675119, shortly after the planned “Spurious Dragon” hard fork, the state sweep to ‘touch’ empty account had just begun. The initial account sweeping went from 0x0 and up.\r\nWhen a call to 0000000000000000000000000000000000000003 was made ([tx](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xcf416c536ec1a19ed1fb89e4ec7ffb3cf73aa413b3aa9b77d60e4fd81a4296ba)), the CALL went Out-of-gas. The reason being that 3 is the address of the RipeMD160 precompile.\r\nIncidentally, both RipeMD160 (0x3) and Identity (0x4) were ‘empty’ accounts created by the attacker, whereas ‘0x1’ and ‘0x2’ already contained ether and were not ‘empty’.\r\nAt this point, even though the CALL to RipeMD160 went OOG, the effects were _not_ reverted, and both Geth and Parity deleted the account . \r\n**NB**: The actual transaction did not go out of gas, only the (inner) CALL.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt block 2686351, the state sweep of ‘seeded’ accounts was in progress. During the execution of these invocations of the Sweeper.sol contract, the number of ‘touches’ to perform is varying. An invocation was made which attempted to perform 1320 CALLs within 600K gas. This was insufficient, and the transaction went out of gas. So while the touches had been performed via `CALL`, the _outer_ context went `OOG`. \r\n\r\n* At this point, Parity reverted the effects of the call, thus not deleting the touched accounts\r\n* Geth failed to revert the effects, and deleted the touched accounts, causing consensus-issue. \r\n\r\nAs Geth implemented reversion of touch after OOG, the earlier case was discovered. \r\n\r\n## Possible solutions\r\n\r\nI'd even split up d) into two options: either see it as topmost vs internal calls, or see it as call parent context vs call context. Consider the following scenario:\r\n\r\n1. Tx -> Call A -> Call B-> Call/Create \"empty but existing account\"\r\n2. Call B-> OOG",

It would be possible to state another rule: \r\n\r\n* `Addresses < 0x4` are special. A 'touch' on `<0x4` is never rolled back. \r\n\r\nOne added complication to bear in mind, is that with the new precompiles, we have new errors (point not on curve etc), which supposedly behaves like OOG. If we were to use a `b`-like option, perhaps we should avoid phrasing the rule in terms of `OOG`, if possible. \r\n",
