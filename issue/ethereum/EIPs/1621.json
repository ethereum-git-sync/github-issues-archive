For example dApps.\r\n\r\n## Abstract\r\nAlmost every platform/project/game/service on the web has some kind of referral mechanism used for marketing purposes, but not only. We believe that for a smooth transition from the current centralized internet model to a decentralized one, the users should have at least the same user experience or better. With this proposal we want to standardise a referral mechanism for Ethereum smart contracts that can be used for all sorts of bounty campaigns and reward systems for both tokens and Ethereum.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nThis EIP is motivated by the need for onchain tracking of referred user accounts on some dapps. Onchain saving the referrals will be able to verify information about a given address from a single trusted source without concerning that it could be manipulated, and to do so in as simple a manner as possible. It is also motivated by the desire to make user experience with dapps more flawles and user-friendly by both the simplicity of the interface as well as by the guarantees on uniqueness provided by the proposed standard.\r\n\r\nNo existing EIPs for storing referral accounts on-chain found.\r\n\r\nThis EIP proposes a light-weight interface for adding referrals functionality for smart contracts. This abstraction layer can sit on top of standards like ERC-20 and ERC-721 or others where account information is being stored.\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\nI'm currently developing an example implementation for the referral interface proposed here. \r\n\r\n[Work in progress implementation](https://github.com/mradkov/onchain-referral)\r\n\r\nI would like to start a discussion here for the viability and the merit of the proposal as well as design.\r\n\r\nðŸ‘‹\r\n@mradkov and the @hackbg team",
