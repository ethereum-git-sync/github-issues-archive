  "body": "The current editors ask all authors to publish their EIPs under public domain. However, given that many EIPs have to reference yellow paper, which is licensed under CC-BY-SA, it simply means many EIPs cannot be published, or published EIPs commit a license violation:\r\n\r\n> If you remix, transform, or build upon the material, you must distribute your contributions under the same license as the original. \r\n\r\nPart of the EIP might still be able to be public domain. However, those materials that built upon yellow paper must be published under the same license -- CC-BY-SA.\r\n\r\nCompared with the practice in this repo, the ECIP repository is much more friendly to all types of [permissive licenses](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/blob/master/_specs/ecip-1000.md#ecip-licensing), which we may want to learn from.\r\n\r\nAnother solution is to ask Gavin, and all contributors to yellow paper, to re-publish it in public domain.",
