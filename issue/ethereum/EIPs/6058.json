Since within a block any prior tx may have modified an account, all prior tx's would also have to be replayed. But in principle, light clients are capable of replaying transactions.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @Jcortezc69 in https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/658#issuecomment-312260102_\r\n      Revert all files to original ",
