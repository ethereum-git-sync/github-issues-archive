  "body": "    EIP: 901\r\n    Title: Additional EVM Transaction Global Variables\r\n    Author: Anton Bukov <k06aaa@gmail.com>\r\n    Category: EVM\r\n    Created: 2018-02-23\r\n    Updated: 2019-04-20\r\n\r\nSimple Summary\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nSome additional global variables are technically possible to be added but not yet added to EVM: `tx.hash`, `tx.nonce`, `block.chain_id`.\r\n\r\nMotivation\r\n------------\r\n\r\n1. `tx.hash`:\r\nHash of the transaction can be used in Dapps (backendless solutions) to provide direct links to blockchain explorer to the concrete transaction. Transaction nonce can be used for something unknown to me at this moment.\r\n\r\n2. `block.chain_id`:\r\nFor example, need to implement replay protection to delegate transactions: https://github.com/bitclave/Feeless\r\n\r\nRevisions\r\n------------\r\n2018/02/23: First version\r\n2018/04/23: Added `block.chain_id`\r\n2019/04/20: Clarified why `tx.hash` couldn't be provided\r\n2019/05/29: Reverted prev changes, sorry :)",

The only way is to make `etherscan.io` to have an API similar to this: `etherscan.io/tx/<sender_addresss>/<nonce>`\r\n\r\nI'm confused by that explanation as the `tx.hash` is actually known already when the transaction is broadcast, which is before the code is actually executed.\r\nAlso, Etherscan is not available inside the contract, for one thing, and for the other, depending on external resources like Etherscan is nothing I'm too happy with in systems I work on, as it adds risk of e.g. outages and/or (future) paywalls.\r\nThat said, I found a way around using this for my current use case by reliably having access to all event log history of my contracts, but I'd still would find it an interesting feature.",
