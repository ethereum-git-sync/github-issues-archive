  "body": "Currently specifying gas price and gas limit has many uncertainties. Specifying gas price that is too low results in not mined transaction, while setting price too high rewards miners unnecessarily. \r\n\r\nNetwork congestion can change suddenly, so a transaction submitted with one gas price can suddenly become stuck. Furthermore, in more complex scenarios (ex. MakerDAO loans) when it is necessary to execute a series of transactions one after another, a stuck transaction can result in a failure of the whole sequence from which it is not so easy to automatically recover.\r\n\r\nMy idea is to be able to give user a choice of how soon do they absolutely require the transaction to be mined by, and what is the maximum they are willing to pay to guarantee it.\r\n\r\nThis can be done using a **ramp up curve**. Each transaction can have 2 optional values: maximum gas price, and ramp-up. The transaction starts with a low value, and if it isn't mined it automatically increases in price, all the way until the maximum value. This can happen in steps or more gradually.\r\n\r\nI believe this is something that should be built into the core protocol and not be required for Dapps to do manually, this way achieving better developer experience (DX) leading to better UX. Looking forward to hear thoughts from the community.\r\n",
