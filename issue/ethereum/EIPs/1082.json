  "body": "## Simple Summary \r\nA standard interface to enhance ERC20 token to trade across blockchain using atomic swap. It can be used in applications like decentralized token exchange platform or blockchain games which are all suffer from the current speed limitation of Ethereum. \r\n\r\nI used a decentralized token exchange application as an example to further elaborate the use case, please see here: \r\n[Decentralized Cross Chain Token Exchange Based on Atomic Swap] \r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nDecentralized exchange protocol like 0x and Kyber has already show a good example of what a decentralized token exchange platform looks like. However,  both of them use the underlying blockchain (ethereum) as the final balance settlement for traders. It requires at least 1 transaction for every trade activity to take place. Considering current TPS of ethereum, this certainly set a hard limitation for the overall performance.\r\n\r\nThis interface works as an enhancement of ERC20 token interface. It allows token to be swap into another public or private blockchain which can provide higher speed capacity than ethereum. It is possible to use the high speed blockchain as the underlying balance settlement for decentralized exchange protocols. And later on, user can choose to swap back to ethereum mainnet when they want to withdraw from their balance from the exchange platform.\r\nAtomic swap provides trustless mechanism for tokens exchange across chain. As long as we can give enough incentive for different parties to ensure the availability of the atomic swap channel between the private chain and mainnet, and furthermore, ensure the credibility of underlying private blockchain by adding different parties as “auditors”. We can consider this decentralized trading platform as a “safe” place to trading. See further arguments from above pdf file. \r\n\r\n## Specification\r\ntoken owner need to generate a random secret to create token on mainnet and private blockchain. The same secret hash is shown as a evidence that the token are generated from the same owner, for the same project, and represent the same usage and intrinsic value \r\n```\r\nbytes32 public ownerSignatureHash; \r\n```\r\nopen a swap: \r\n```\r\nfunction open (address _receiver, bytes32 _hashlock, uint _timelock, uint _amount) public returns (bytes32 contractId)\r\n```\r\nreveal secret to the hashlock to retrieve token \t\r\n```\r\nfunction close(bytes32 _contractId, bytes32 _secret) public returns (bool)\r\n```\r\nin case of contract expires, use the method to refund from the hashlock \r\n```\r\nfunction refund(bytes32 _contractId) public returns(bool) \r\n```\r\ncheck the hashlock details and secret\r\n```\r\nfunction checkContract(bytes32 _contractId) public view returns (\r\n      address sender, \r\n      address receiver,\r\n      uint amount,\r\n      bytes32 hashlock,\r\n      uint timelock,\r\n      bytes32 secret\r\n)\r\n```\r\n## Implementation\r\nAn example implementation can be find here: \r\n[atomic swap token]\r\n\r\n\r\n[atomic swap token]: <https://github.com/shiweihavefun/atomic_swappable_token>\r\n[Decentralized Cross Chain Token Exchange Based on Atomic Swap]: <https://github.com/shiweihavefun/atomic_swappable_token/blob/master/Decentralized%20Cross%20Chain%20Token%20Exchange%20Based%20on%20Atomic%20Swap.pdf>\r\n",
