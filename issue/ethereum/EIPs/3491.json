  "body": "Building apps on Ethereum is getting more difficult on the side of testing and orchestration. I try to work by forking mainnet whenever possible, and ENS is a useful utility in orchestrating my deployments because I don't need to pass contract addresses to different Docker container-ized apps, I only need a local blockchain running in a Docker where the rest will connect. I cannot use it when forking mainnet, because we don't have any instant way to register a name, we must go through auction etc. Why don't we have a .test domain for mainnet deployment that allows for this? \r\n\r\nwrong repo, sorry, closing, this was meant for ENS",
