It mints the new stablecoin (ERC20) at the correct rate of exchange and sends back to the user. In effect, the user has converted one stablecoin to another stablecoin. The FRC gains interest from the supplied stablecoin. This interest is used to correct for differences in the stablecoin pair's values. \r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nCreating a stablecoin from something volatile is hard. This is what MakerDAO is doing with by issuing stable DAI from volatile ether. It is on the other hand not that hard to create something stable _from something stable_. There are several implementations of stable US dollars, but what about the rest of the world's currencies? The proposed EIP is a secure and simple way of representing all of these currencies on-chain.\r\n\r\nWarning: This EIP *cannot* be used for assets which are meant to grow over time, e.g. stocks. The Reserve Fund will not be able to correct for more increase than the Interest generated (1%-20%), meaning a more significant increase would break the peg.\r\n\r\n## Definitions\r\n\r\n* Stablecoin: A coin which is pegged to another value, e.g., the DAI represents the US dollar 1 to 1.\r\n* Security Stablecoin (Security): The ERC20 token used as security for the new stablecoin. \r\n* CDP: Collateralized Debt Positions\r\n* Stablecoin Pool (Pool): A pool of all the supplied Security into CDPs.\r\n* Issued Stablecoin (New Currency): The new stablecoin generated as an ERC20.\r\n* Interest: Services like Compound Finance allows for lending out ERC20 tokens for an interest.\r\n* FRC: The Fiat Representation Contract which operates all of this.\r\n* Reserve Fund: The FRC get Interested by lending out the Pool. The pool grows to allow for correcting for instabilities between the Security and New Currency.\r\n* Oracle service (Oracle): An oracle service is used for getting external data into the Ethereum blockchain. This standard does not define how this Oracle service should be implemented, only that the FRC needs to know the value of both the Security and the New Currency. \r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nUsing the US dollar (DAI) and the NOK (imagined as eNOK) as examples for simplicity. \r\n\r\n### Issue\r\nThe user supplies 10 DAI to the FRC. The oracle service reports that 10 DAI represents 90 NOK, and the FRC issues 90 eNOK for the user.\r\n\r\n### Burn\r\nThe user asks the FRC to close the CDP. \r\n\r\n#### Positive difference\r\nThe Oracle reports that the supplied DAI is now valued at 99 NOK, i.e. the difference between USD-NOK has increased with 10%. However, the user still only has the 90 eNOK which was issued. When the FRC get the burn request, it reports back that the user only will get 9 DAI back, i.e. 10% less that he supplied. So he has the same amount of NOK when he entered (issued) and when he left. He has however lost a dollar, but only if he leaves. The FRC puts the 1 DAI into the Reserve Fund. \r\n\r\n#### Negative difference\r\nThe Oracle reports that the supplied DAI is now valued at 81 NOK, i.e. the difference between USD-NOK has decreased by 10%. However, the user still has the 90 eNOK which was issued. When the FRC get the burn request, it reports back that the user will get 11 DAI back, i.e. 10% more that he supplied. So he has the same amount of NOK when he entered (issued) and when he left. He has however gained a dollar, by closing the CDP.\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
