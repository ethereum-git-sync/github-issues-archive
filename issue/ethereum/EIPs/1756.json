During each round of the random number generation, the **rand_seed** is updated according to **main_seed**.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Correctness\r\nSince that we only expose the `Main.sol` code, the `Randomness.sol` code remains invisible. The security level escalates from _known-plaintext attack_ to _ciphertext-only attack_. Any attempt towards the `Randomeness.col` can only change the state of it without making it a feasible \"key-value\" pair in any time of future.\r\n\r\nThough we are free to get the private **rand_seed** in the `Randomness.sol` (I wrote a [tutorial](https://medium.com/swlh/ethereum-aint-hiding-your-secrets-703e89088937) for that if interested), it could be hard to retrieve the **func_seed** inside the random function. \r\n\r\nThe `Randomness.sol`'s random function has been made as **owner only** via OpenZeppelin's `Ownable.sol`, so it makes it harder for submitting an external attempt for trials.\r\n\r\n## Disclaimer\r\nPlease think twice before using it on some profitable projects. I am really looking forward to any comment and suggestion. Thanks. :)\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n### `Main.sol`\r\n```\r\npragma solidity ^0.4.25;\r\n\r\nimport { Ownable } from \"./openzeppelin-solidity/contracts/ownership/Ownable.sol\";\r\nimport { Randomness } from \"./Randomness.sol\";\r\n\r\ncontract Main is Ownable {\r\n\r\n  Randomness randomnessContract;\r\n\r\n  // ...

The resulting random number can be computed with a passed variable and the privately stored seed as inputs. However, this approach does not consider the impossibility to store private data inside a public network. Despite Ethereum having a concept of private memory in smart contracts, this storage can still be read by anyone running an Ethereum node. Reading private or internal state can be achieved by [web3.eth.getStorageAt](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/web3-eth.html#getstorageat).
