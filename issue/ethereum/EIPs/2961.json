  "body": "We have the following pieces of automation currently:\r\n1. automerger bot\r\n2. syntax tests\r\n    a. eipv (preplaced the old validator not long ago](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/2860))\r\n    b. spellcheck\r\n    c. hmlcheck\r\n3. greeter bot\r\n4. stale bot ([added lately](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/2949))\r\n\r\nThe automerger can automatically merge PRs, except those changing statuses or adding new files. It is a Python-based code run on Google AppEngine and triggered by Travis.\r\n\r\nThe syntax tests are executed via Travis and are displayed on github with a red or green \"continuous integration\" icons. This is sometimes overlooked by authors. The automerger will also not act, if the status is red.\r\n\r\nThe most important check we have is the eipv one: it validates a lot of formatting requirements, but not every single requirement. For outstanding issues [check here](https://github.com/lightclient/eipv/issues).\r\n\r\nThe greeter bot reminds new contributors to read EIP-1, while the stale bot ensures that old issues are closed if there is no activity.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNow, this looks great, but it could be better. In order to speed up the review process we should make sure that `eipv` checks for a lot more mistakes. The most common mistake is not having all the appropriate sections: the correct names, ordering, indentation, or having non-standard sections.\r\n\r\nThe second biggest problem is that a lot of contributors are not familiar with travis and/or continuous integration. We should introduce a bot (eipv-bot) which creates comments for each mistake. Then mostly editors would be restricted to assigning EIP numbers.\r\n\r\nOnce #2941 is properly decided on we could introduce another bot to mark long untouched drafts as `status=Withdrawn reason=\"withdrawn due to inactivity\"`. It should create a PR, and ideally merge it after some period of inactivity, or let editors merge it.\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\nI think we should move over to Github Actions, because:\r\n- We can define all the rules of execution in this repository in the `.github/workflows` directory\r\n- Can place all the bots in a separate repository\r\n\r\nI propose the following projects to undertake:\r\n1. eipv-bot: github action compatible bot which executes eipv and creates comments for each issue\r\n2. abandon-bot: github action compatible bot which creates a PR marking old drafts as withdrawn\r\n3. automerger-bot: github action compatible bot which replaces the automerger\r\n",
