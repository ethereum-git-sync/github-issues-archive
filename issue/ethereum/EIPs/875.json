  "body": "## Summary\r\nA simple non fungible token standard that allows batching tokens into lots and settling p2p atomic transfers in one transaction. You can test out an example implementation on rinkeby here: https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0xffab5ce7c012bc942f5ca0cd42c3c2e1ae5f0005 and view the repo here: https://github.com/alpha-wallet/ERC-Example\r\n\r\n## Purpose\r\nWhile other standards allow the user to transfer a non-fungible token, they require one transaction per token, this is heavy on gas and partially responsible for clogging the ethereum network. There are also few definitions for how to do a simple atomic swap.\r\n\r\n## Rinkeby example\r\nThis standard has been implemented in an example contract on rinkeby: https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0xffab5ce7c012bc942f5ca0cd42c3c2e1ae5f0005\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\n### function name() constant returns (string name)\r\n\r\nreturns the name of the contract e.g. CarLotContract\r\n\r\n### function symbol() constant returns (string symbol)\r\n\r\nReturns a short string of the symbol of the in-fungible token, this should be short and generic as each token is non-fungible.\r\n\r\n### function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256[] balance)\r\n\r\nReturns an array of the users balance.\r\n\r\n### function transfer(address _to, uint256[] _tokens) public;\r\n\r\nTransfer your unique tokens to an address by adding an array of the token indices. This compares favourable to ERC721 as you can transfer a bulk of tokens in one go rather than one at a time. This has a big gas saving as well as being more convenient.\r\n\r\n### function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256[] _tokens) public;\r\n\r\nTransfer a variable amount of tokens from one user to another. This can be done from an authorised party with a specified key e.g. contract owner.\r\n\r\n## Optional functions\r\n\r\n### function totalSupply() constant returns (uint256 totalSupply);\r\n\r\nReturns the total amount of tokens in the given contract, this should be optional as assets might be allocated and issued on the fly. This means that supply is not always fixed.\r\n\r\n### function ownerOf(uint256 _tokenId) public view returns (address _owner);\r\n\r\nReturns the owner of a particular token, I think this should be optional as not every token contract will need to track the owner of a unique token and it costs gas to loop and map the token id owners each time the balances change. \r\n\r\n### function trade(uint256 expiryTimeStamp, uint256[] tokenIndices, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public payable\r\n\r\nA function which allows a user to sell a batch of non-fungible tokens without paying for the gas fee (only the buyer has to) in a p2p atomic swap. This is achieved by signing an attestation containing the amount of tokens to sell, the contract address, an expiry timestamp, the price and a prefix containing the ERC spec name and chain id. A buyer can then pay for the deal in one transaction by attaching the appropriate ether to satisfy the deal.\r\n\r\nThis design is also more efficient as it allows orders to be done offline until settlement as opposed to creating orders in a smart contract and updating them. The expiry timestamp protects the seller against people using old orders.\r\n\r\nThis opens up the gates for a p2p atomic swap but should be optional to this standard as some may not have use for it.\r\n\r\nSome protections need to be added to the message such as encoding the chain id, contract address and the ERC spec name to prevent replays and spoofing people into signing message that allow a trade.\r\n",

    "body": "There are parts of the example implementation that diverge from the specification or are added functionality (e.g. the `endContract`, `getContractAddress`, `myBalance` functions). I think it might be good to keep the example contract as close to the spec as possible.\r\n\r\nAlso, it's possible to implement atomic swaps for tokens in a single transaction with contracts that exist above current ERC token so that we don't have to add this functionality to every token contract that gets deployed. Adding this is general purpose contract seems like a better approach than implementing it in every token contract (maintainability and cost reasons). Otherwise, we can keep changing the token spec to add arbitrary functionality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I added those functions in as boilerplate, they are not part of the ERC Spec by default I just wanted them in there in case I wanted to remove the contract later etc. \r\n\r\nThe getContractAddress() is needed in this spec as a protection against double spending (i.e. I could get you to sign a message for my contract and rebroadcast it on another contract, by adding this data in as well as a message like ERC875 etc this is not possible)\r\n\r\nYes, open to here the views of what people would like to change in this draft!

    "body": "@Nanolucas, I guess you refer to ERC721Enumerable in #841.\r\n\r\nA few years ago I was involved in a project by Sydney entrepreneur Nick Addison (now of Consensys Sydney) where we wanted to tokenise subway advertisement screens in batches of 5-minute. For example, someone can buy the 5-minutes ad of Sydney Townhall station LCD ad in a rush hour because it's his birthday, or because he believes it was undervalued. It failed for regulatory reasons but what I observed is that investors tend to buy and sell hours or days of advertisement together, moving 2000 tokens a time - each covers 5 minutes of one screen in one subway station. The technical learning is that transaction fee only increase a little (less than 10%) if you transact 200 tokens instead of 1 in one transaction because most of the fee goes to the update of state tree. So there definitely is an incentive to transfer them in one call, instead of calling an Enumerator and transfer each asset piecemeal by the identifiers returned from Enumerator. Furthermore, being able to specify a range is helpful for reducing blockchain size, since such batch movements are usually done in lots. If someone moves 2000 tokens, there is a good chance all of them are from the same subway station or same hour of all subway stations.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that the Sydney subway experiment was not one of a kind - there are in fact more business cases of batch NFT operations than there are for individual NFTs (collectables), as I learned by working on a blockchain architect role in Australia's largest bank. For example, RESIMAC regularly transfers thousands of loan titles to Westpac in one go and requires them to move in _an atomic fashion_. The thriving of the kittens did give an impression that NFT is usually traded one by one - all because real businesses haven't moved in.\r\n\r\nThat was just the argument why Enumerator is not the answer for a batch transaction. `trade()` was for a different reason though. I see reasons for `ERC721Trade` extension to be there in #841 as well as for having a version of `trade()` function to move assets in batch.\r\n",
