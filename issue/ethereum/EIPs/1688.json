  "body": "I filed a PR #1687 to fix the Last Call feed.\r\n\r\nI'm now proposing a few other changes to feeds for the EIPs website.\r\n\r\nPlease add suggestions & feedback here, and I will reference it when I do a pull request.\r\n\r\nThe EIPs site uses the jekyll static site builder, so some of the language I am going to use is jekyll specific. Because EIPs are implemented as Pages rather than Posts, it makes a whole bunch of stuff harder. Long term, turning EIPs into a jekyll Collection is probably the right thing to do, but I'm not going to tackle that right away :) If someone is interested in working with me on this, let me know in a comment.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Global Feed\r\n\r\nThere was an auto-generated ```feed.xml``` from the jekyll-feed plugin that only works with Posts, so I removed the plugin.\r\n\r\nI'm suggesting a global feed that lists all EIPs in all status.\r\n\r\n## Feed per Category, Status\r\n\r\nCan also generate separate feeds per category -- Core, Networking, Interface, ERC, Informational, Meta.\r\n\r\nAlso a feed per Status, so there would be a feed for Draft, Last Call, Accepted.\r\n\r\n## JSON Feeds\r\n\r\nAt the very least, a JSON feed that is a global feed that contains all the data around all of the EIPs -- this is useful for consuming programmatically in different ways, as a kind of simple API.\r\n\r\n## Last Call Date as Metadata\r\n\r\nI've suggested how to have a last call date show up in the Last Call feed in #1535 -- this would also mean updating process instructions a little bit, as Last Call authors will need to add a new metadata line. But would \"work today\" with Jekyll.",
