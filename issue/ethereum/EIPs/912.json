  "body": "I wish to champion the following proposal, and want to know if others before me have done something similar, and/or discuss this idea before deciding to move (if appropriate) to an EIP:\r\n\r\n\r\n# Transparent Open Organisation Contract (TOOC)  \r\n\r\nThis standard seeks to define a financial mechanism that an organisation can adopt, which makes details of all transactions public.  \r\n\r\nIt is useful for charities, clubs, open trusts, escrow providers, peer insurance, benevolent societies, and in general any honest business or organisation willing to demonstrate their ethical commitment to transparency and open principals through \"opening their books\".  \r\nAn organisation committing to a TOOC becomes a TOORG (transparent open organisation)  \r\n \r\nThe general principal works as follows:  \r\n\r\n1. Each TOORG publishes their own TOCC - an \"[ERC777](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/777)\" (or similar) contract.  For clarity, tokens defined by the TOOC will be called \"TOTx\" (transparent open tokens, for organisation x)\r\n2. The TOORG connects their existing financial mechanisms (typically their bank account) into a \"mini exchange\" which they run or outsource\r\n3. Incoming payments are used immediately to purchase TOTx from the order book to the value of the payment (the original fiat or crypto that arrives remains in the TOORG bank account, or for auditing compliance, may move to a new exchange account owned by the TOORG)\r\n4. Outgoing expenses are facilitated by matching the required expense amount with orders in the book, and selling the required TOTx to orderbook buyers to raise the (fiart or crypto) funds necessary to cover the outgoing payment.\r\n5. Steps 3 and 4 trigger on-chain transactions for the requisite number of TOTx, and the accountancy metadata explaining the transaction (including source/fiat currency amounts and exchange rates where necessary) is extensibly encoded using the [protocol-buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) mechanism (a highly-efficient compact binary datastructure - but more or less equivalent to JSON otherwise) and recorded in the `userData` and/or `operatorData` fields.  \r\n \r\nmetadata at least includes tagging using Standard Chart of Accounts (SCOA) and Data Dictionary codes (e.g. [IFRS](http://www.ifrs.org) or [NSCOA](http://www.acnc.gov.au/ACNC/Manage/The_National_Standard_Chart_of_Accounts_/ACNC/Report/NSCOA2.aspx?hkey=179cdfe1-4e9e-412a-96c3-e0db53e0acfe ) - example: 1-0000=assets, 2-0000=liabilities,...) - the outcome being that software reading the blockchain can *autonomously* produce the entire set of accounts, books, and financial-statements for the TOORG at any point in time, with sufficient detail to be acceptable and file-able within the TOORG jurisdiction and satisfy local laws (e.g. SEC).  \r\nSingle on-chain transactions carrying multiple metadata payloads are acceptable (e.g. payment of a monthly credit card account is one on-chain transaction, but the breakdown of the expenses present on the card will be the body in the metadata)\r\n \r\nAn [ERC820](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/820) style mechanism be adopted to support accountancy extensibility (so, for example, the TOORG can define which SCOA standard it follows, and publish the codes actually in use): or in other words - the TOTx metadata refers to the accompanying ERC820 \"database\" to determine otherwise redundant information helping to explain the transaction.  Individual transactions can optionally contain specific details (for example: a party TOORG in countries where political donations must be disclosed can include the identity of the contributor).  \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n# Transparent Open Company Contract (TOCC)\r\n \r\nA special case of a TOORG is a public company - so a TOCC is the same as a TOOC except for how it is used, which will be as follows.  \r\n \r\n* The company committing to a TOCC becomes a TOCO (Transparent Open COmpany)\r\n* The TOCC defines a fixed supply of tokens which collectively represent 100% of the equity of the TOCO.\r\n* Trading of TOTx tokens occurs naturally on either the TOCO's own exchange, or any others that choose to list the TOTx.\r\n* The TOCO can raise capital through selling equity, and can (if it chooses) \"buy back\" it's own equity through TOTx purchases.\r\n* Owners can monitor the TOCO financial activity in realtime (open and transparent)\r\n* Dividends are payable to equity owners via the following mechanism:  \r\n\r\n1. The TOCO decides the dividend frequency and amount to be paid (usually via published upfront policy), and purchases an equivalent value worth of its own TOTx tokens from an exchange\r\n2. These purchased TOTx tokens are distributed proportionally to existing (remaining) TOTx owners.  \r\n \r\nThis dividend mechanism rewards TOTx investors with income, which in addition to added value also slightly increases the % holdings of remaining TOTx owners as well as ensuring that the market value of TOTx tokens remains reasonable (standard market P/E ratio values will dictate TOTx trading value and dampen price swings)\r\n \r\n\r\nThe general point of a TOCO is to provide investors with more \"genuine\" value than exists today: typically, on account of the protectionism of existing traditional stock exchanges, crypto-companies have to deny their investors \"real\" value to satisfy the letter of the law, or have to prevent swathes of investors  from participating (e.g. all Americans, under SEC laws).  My proposal will hopefully be the \"chicken\" (egg?) that one day in future will help governments understand that marginalizing modern investors is doing them a disservice, and perhaps this method of project financing will itself become legally recognized.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?  \r\n  \r\nMy accompanying goal is to publish all the software [I'm a long way into completing this already] to run the above on github, so a TOORG/TOCO can simply open a bank account, grab the code, and start running.  \r\n\r\n## Copyright  \r\n\r\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\r\n",
