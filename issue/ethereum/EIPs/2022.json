  "body": "This EIP proposes a service for decentralized compliance checks for regulated tokens. \r\n\r\nA regulated token needs to comply with several legal requirements, especially KYC and AML. If the necessary checks have to be made off-chain the token transfer becomes centralized. Further the transfer in this case takes longer to complete as it can not be done in one transaction, but requires a second confirmation step. The goal of this proposal is to make this second step unnecessary by providing a service for compliance checks.\r\n\r\nPlease see [the PR](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/2009) for more details.",
