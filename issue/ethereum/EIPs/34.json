  "body": "(An idea I've had for a while, also spoken of by chriseth at DEVCON1.)\n\nRight now, contracts default to accept all incoming funds, only returning or forwarding funds if specifically coded to. This creates a situation where the creator either has to code most methods to return funds or just accept that \"mistake\" funds will be sent periodically and add a \"drain funds\" method to recover them. \n\nShouldn't a developer be able to specify \"autobounce\" at the contract level to change invert the current default behavior? In this situation, the coder would have to include an \"accept offered funds\" line in the code at each appropriate location, but in practice, that'll end up being far few times than returning funds in all error scenarios.\n",
