    "body": "We should differentiate between user requested links and crawled -- each link has to be intentionally added through a service like https://perma.cc\n\nAdditionally an allowlist of acceptable providers should be considered, along with prohibition of links needing user maintenance like ipfs pinning (not as a primary link maybe?) \n\nMore crucially having the possibility of now linking cross repo with the specs etc provides an opportunity to revisit front matter possibly. \n\n\nYea no URL shortening either, really the links need to be served by the domain, cant have an additional layer of abstraction like url shortening services or ipfs addressing. Example is with git.io -- github has shut down their url shortening service and now links may be useless. ",
