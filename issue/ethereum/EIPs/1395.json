  "body": "ATTENTION! If you would like to submit an EIP and it has already been written as a draft (see the [template](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/eip-X.md) for an example), please submit it as a [Pull Request](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pulls).\r\n\r\nIf you are considering a proposal but would like to get some feedback on the idea before submitting a draft, then continue opening an Issue as a thread for discussion.  Note that the more clearly and completely you state your idea the higher the quality of the feedback you are likely to receive.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind the following guidelines from [EIP-1](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1.md):\r\n\r\n> Each EIP must have a champion - someone who writes the EIP using the style and format described below, shepherds the discussions in the appropriate forums, and attempts to build community consensus around the idea. The EIP champion (a.k.a. Author) should first attempt to ascertain whether the idea is EIP-able. Posting to the the Protocol Discussion forum or opening an Issue is the best way to go about this.\r\n\r\n> Vetting an idea publicly before going as far as writing a EIP is meant to save the potential author time. Asking the Ethereum community first if an idea is original helps prevent too much time being spent on something that is guaranteed to be rejected based on prior discussions (searching the Internet does not always do the trick). It also helps to make sure the idea is applicable to the entire community and not just the author. Just because an idea sounds good to the author does not mean it will work for most people in most areas where Ethereum is used.\r\n\r\n> Once the champion has asked the Ethereum community as to whether an idea has any chance of acceptance, a draft EIP should be presented as a Pull Request. This gives the author a chance to flesh out the draft EIP to make properly formatted, of high quality, and to address initial concerns about the proposal.",

    "body": "You decided to cut miners reward from 3 to 2 eth. It will decrease inflation. \r\n\r\nBut at the same momeny Ethereum has a big problem with scalability. In Decembe 2017 and June 2018 for several weeks we'd been seeing spammed network and got to use gasorice = 100.\r\n\r\nCurrently owners of full nodes do not receive any rewards for their work. \r\n1. They store blockchain\r\n2. Use their CPU for EVM\r\n3. Pay for new SSds, internet etc.\r\n\r\nThese guys do all of this for free for you for many years. I t was not a problem when blockhain was 20 Gb. But now many of them could just stop their work what would be not good for decenralisation.\r\n\r\nCasper + Sharding is about 1 year ? \r\n\r\nWhat coud happen for this 1 year.\r\n1. We can see any spam attacks or gypes as Kryptokitties what will affect all users of Ethereum\r\n2. What if anyone make good working dApp and current 15 tps would be a bottleneck.\r\n3. Size of blockchain - it's bigger and bigger. Will Constantinopole resolve the blockhain size broblem ? If not we will see reducing number of full nodes.\r\n\r\nThe possible way what to do is to give part of 1 eth (3 eth -> 2 eth) to full node owners. Reward can be dinamical depending on number of transactions in pool (what if to increase block limit to 80M gas).\r\nI understabd that here could be a big discussions with miners - they receive all tx conissions and big block is not beneficial for them. So here could be any algorithm.\r\nJust 1 ex. \r\n1. Miners receive 2 eth for blaock + all tx costs\r\nFull node owners receive 0.1 ether for block\r\n2. In case of very high Ethereum network load you pay 0.4 eth additionally (for ex 50/50 to miners and full node owners) and blocks are 80M\r\n3. In cases of medium loadness we need any algorythm decided which block size (8-80M is optomal) and  how much to pay additionally (0-0.4 eth).\r\n\r\nSo emission will be 2.1 (almost all time ) - 2.5 eth (in case of very high load).",

Every full node that isn't mining or running a node out of their own interest could shut down right now and nothing would change, nobody would notice (the network would actually get more efficient) and the network would still be sufficiently decentralized. To add to this, if I spin up a full node right now without any other changes to the network, I'm not adding anything to the network. I'm actually taking a (negligibly) small amount of efficiency from the network.

All I **know** about full nodes is that there is at least 1. I have a full node, but I have no idea if there are any other full nodes in the world. Obviously there most likely are, because it's beneficial for someone to run their own full node, but it doesn't benefit me.",
