  "body": "## Specification\n\nEach chain (including the current public chain) should choose a 1-3 byte string consisting of capital letters and numbers [A-Z,0-9]. For example the current public chain could choose `0` while the morden testnet could choose `M` or `MOR`.\n\nThis string would be prefixed by a capital `E` on all exchanges. Such that the current public chain would be recognized by `E0` while morden would be recognized by `EM` or `EMOR`.\n\nAny string starting with `TH` would be forbidden since it would result in a string like `ETH`. Since all chains would have ether (changing the unit names would break cross chain compatability), it would be confusing to sell `ETH` since every chain has ether, and it would be unclear which chain `ETH` refers to.\n## Rationale\n\nReferring to both the public chain and the underlying technology as \"Ethereum\" is problematic. It confuses the technology with the chain. In the future, it is possible there will be multiple public chains all running the EVM. In this future, it would be useful to have a naming convention that allows for these chains to coexist without confusion.\n\nIt would also be important for cross chain relays to have a standard identification scheme, such a single \"Ethereum relay\" like BTC relay can house all the logic for all EVM based chains.\n",
