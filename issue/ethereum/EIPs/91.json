  "body": "I've run a small experiment to see how compressible EVM bytecode is and the result is: very.\n\nThe two examples I've taken is the Multisig Wallet contract and Shapeshiftbot:\n- Wallet: 6993 bytes to 2706 bytes\n- Shapeshift: 6018 bytes to 1486 bytes\n\nThe compressor used was zlib on level 1 (_best speed_).  Level 9 (_slowest_) only gives an improvement of around 10% in the case of the Wallet.\n\nIt might be early discussing this and may become more important when blockchain rent comes into effect.  Using compression would optimise from storage costs to paying decompression costs.\n\nWould that make sense? In two cases it might:\n- very compressible code or\n- something which is rarely executed\n\nThis could implemented either:\n- on the blockchain level\n- as a self-decompressing contract (i.e. in bytecode only). However this would require jumping to a memory location, which is prohibited in EVM.\n",

    "body": "I've done some experiments with doing LZF decompression in the EVM. Here's a simple decompressor: https://gist.github.com/Arachnid/4bf0dc27432e325505ca7b06f6366114\n\nIt averages about 40 gas per byte decompressing bytecode, and the compressed bytecode is about 60% of the plaintext size. That's not quite enough to make it more efficient to compress transaction data (which costs 68 gas per byte), unfortunately.\n\nMore optimal decompressors are probably possible by reading the input data directly from calldata, instead of memory, but I wouldn't expect more than perhaps another 25% improvement in speed from that.\n",

    "body": "There is new interest stateless blocks, where bytecode is transmitted with each block that executes it. [Recent experiments](https://medium.com/@akhounov/the-shades-of-statefulness-in-ethereum-nodes-697b0f88cd04) show that bytecode is one of the size bottlenecks (but not the biggest bottleneck). A proposal to improve the bytecode size bottleneck is to merkleize bytecode.\r\n\r\nIn curiosity, I compressed [124 EVM contracts](https://gist.github.com/poemm/3b3b64dd577bda2ef221a58374a178c3), including CryptoKitties, Uniswap, and other dapps which I greedily found on rankings lists and in recent transactions, until I had ~1 MB total. Then I measured sizes before and after compression.\r\n\r\n```\r\nTotal size without compression: 1004806 bytes\r\nTotal size with off-the-shelf zstd compression: 364759 bytes\r\nTotal size compressed with zstd using custom dictionary: 235683 bytes\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo EVM bytecode compressed to 36% without much effort, and 23% with a little more effort. Decompression of everything took around 250ms on my slow computer.\r\n\r\nCompression may improve further by doing some of the following.\r\n1) Separately compress opcodes and immediates, i.e. split-stream compression.\r\n2) Tune the dictionary for popular contracts.\r\n3) Use many dictionaries, each tuned for different opcode frequency histograms.\r\n4) Tune algorithms to be more aggressive, being aware of space-time trade-offs.\r\n5) Compress leaves of merkleized bytecode.",

    "body": "Yes, good point. Depending on how you define \"valid block\", there could be a DoS attack.\r\n\r\nMerkleizeing bytecode only gives 50% bytecode size reduction (early estimate, [ref: see section: Code \"chunking\"](https://blog.ethereum.org/2020/01/17/eth1x-files-digest-no-2/)). My post was to remind people that compression can give closer to 30% on average, sometime better.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is wise to allow individual contracts to choose whether/how to reduce their bytecode size, and the `decompress`/`merkleize`/`bytecode_recover` operations can be metered as EVM code or as precompiles, as wisely described by @Arachnid above.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is wise to allow popular contracts to be stored by every node, maybe as consensus cache of recent blocks, or with storage deposit/rent costs. Then only infrequently used bytecode will need to be transmitted with blocks.",
