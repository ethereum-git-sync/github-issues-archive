    "body": "Posting questions that arose in discussions on other mediums:\r\n\r\nfrom @Arachnid\r\n> - How would you do an address lookup for sending someone ether in dtype?\r\n> - What prevents squatters from just grabbing popular names on the types that are most widely used?\r\n> - Does this imply no portability? When I switch from Gnosis to Status for my wallet, do I have to tell everyone to use a new name?\r\n\r\nfrom @makoto\r\n\r\n> If I understand correctly, in ENS, once I own matoken.eth, I can own all types (contenthash,address,text, etc), whereas in dtype, I have to take them one by one (eg: md.matoken, addr.matoken, text.matoknen). \r\n> I think this is good and bad. Sure, squatters have to spend a lot to squat on all types for my name, but in reality all squatters have to do is to squat on addr.matoken which would be the most popular data type.\r\n> From name ownership perspective, it's easy to attack (just squat on one type) but very hard to defend (own every sing type of my name).",
