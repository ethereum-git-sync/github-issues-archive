  "body": "Was curious what issues there would be with adding a integer logarithm opcode?\r\n\r\nI understand that logarithm opcodes for other processors are typically floating point instructions, but there has got to be a decent fixed-point operation that can be implemented in our 256-bit processor, that also minimizes information loss from the operation (especially when using change of bases to compute arbitrary logarithms), and is bounded by a constant time for a reasonable input.\r\n\r\nI have a preliminary idea for such an algorithm [here](https://github.com/fubuloubu/evm-logarithm), but I am sure there are holes in such an approach that can be improved upon. My preliminary approach uses 256 loops at most, at costs about 160k gas. Hopefully that can be substantially reduced with an opcode.\r\n\r\nA good minimal implementation would be able to implement at least a base 2 logarithm instruction that compiler writers could leverage via `log_a(b) = (DIV (B2LOG b 2) (B2LOG a 2))` either internally or through a psuedo opcode that implements that macro.",
