But anyway we have inheritance and composition and.. that's all.\r\n\r\nAnother idea came in the end but it looks like overengineering for me:\r\nmainnet_transfer_start.yaml\r\n```yaml\r\nconfigs:\r\n  - mainnet\r\n  - mainnet_genesis\r\nconstants:\r\n    MAX_ATTESTATIONS: 128\r\n    MAX_TRANSFERS: 16\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n",
