[go playground](https://play.golang.org/p/Xl0l370f8Dy) link. \r\n\r\nLooking at the [spec for yaml](https://yaml.org/type/binary.html), this data should be represented as a base64 binary string with the prefix `!!binary`.\r\n\r\nEdit: I no longer support adding `!!binary` as it is entirely unnecessary with modern libraries understanding that Base64 encoded strings are binary data. However, the tag resolution in the yaml spec for this scenario is unclear. It's probably safer to add `!!binary` explicitly. \r\n",

Instead, we overwrite the hex strings to base64 in the yaml, then ingest that data to the tests. \r\n\r\nWith regards to \"do what the JSON API does\", I recant my earlier statement and I don't support hex encoded strings in JSON going forward. I see little benefit to hex encoded over base64 and it means we have to write a special work arounds to support it.\r\n\r\nThe latter comment is probably for a different discussion topic. ",

    "body": "For size, we could also compress, encode suites in SSZ (or other), or split mainnet suites (huge) from minimal suites (reasonable) in another repo. If there's an issue with size, clients should put that forward, and describe their resources / caching. But I don't think there's much of a problem (although yes, yaml encoded mainnet tests are very large). \r\n\r\nGenerally I think it's perfectly fine to load tests in a convenient way, i.e. load into a map, translate python names and hex values, and load into the appropriate types. Better than describing all new types just for testing. In Go specifically, I just load them through https://github.com/mitchellh/mapstructure and do some translation, then put them directly in the types I use for state-transitioning. No extra code, or per-type conversion. And while I agree it's far from perfect, it's affordable (tests loading doesn't take that long) and easy. \r\n\r\nYou could generate structs with decoder definitions or use a custom yaml decoder, but I really just think running (and then passing) the tests at this stage is worth much more than (over-)engineering the test runner. Eventually, yes, it would be very nice. But first things first.\r\n",
