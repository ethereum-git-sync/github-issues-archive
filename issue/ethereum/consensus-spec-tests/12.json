    "body": "The problem here is that we are hosting mainnet-configuration tests, which are quite large. Too large really for a normal git repository. But we still wanted to version them. And then multiple eth2 implementer teams are downloading them, some of which didn't even care to cache them in their CI unfortunately. So we reached the free limit relatively quick. Things should be better with the latest refactor, since individual identical tests between versions do not have to be redownloaded anymore (since they are split up now, not big suite files anymore). Alternatively, we could buy a little data pack, if it's not too much (less than a single work hour for the rest of the year?)",
