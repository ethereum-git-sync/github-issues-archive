    "body": "Meeting notes:\r\n- We discussed blockers to migrate to discv5. Felix said they are kind of waiting on Nethermind to have an implementation ready.\r\n\t- during the discussion about this we discussed how there will be a transitory stage where we would have both discv5 and discv4 enabled on the same port.\r\n- We also discussed hole punching mechanisms and Felix pointed to this [PR](https://github.com/ethereum/devp2p/pull/227/files#diff-0d4a1b70973df7b61b5a379499df260230a79e31f3d05c9d2762619f51a1e227)\r\n- Last there was a discussion from light client that we need to think how to support more blobs on the p2p network as there is a direction to do so in a year or so.\r\n\t- We discussed a mempool sharding mechanism and how we can use different identifiers to identify which peer is a member of which shard\r\n\t\t- One is nodeId (easiest solution)\r\n\t\t- Another is Discv5 topic (requires Discv5 implementation to be done in all clients)",
