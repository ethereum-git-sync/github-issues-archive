  "body": "To replace Goerli by end of this year, we proposed to launch [Holesky](https://github.com/eth-clients/holesky) to launch not later than September.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis breakout call is to discuss the timeline, validator set and discuss any other related topics. \r\n  - Thursday, June 29, 2023, 12:30 UTC\r\n\r\nAgenda\r\n    - Get updates from client teams and validator commitments\r\n    - Discuss alternate ways to achieve a stable validator set\r\n    - Discuss strategies for initial genesis allocation (or mass seeding of developer/staker accounts)\r\n    - Discuss upper limit of native eth clients can handle, is it uint64 or higher? We can inflate the supply near the limits\r\n\r\nWe would like to invite representatives of the client teams to discuss and other testnet enthusiasts, e.g. ethstaker, ephemery. Feel free to add more items to the agenda if necessary.\r\n\r\nSome notes from the last call can be found here:\r\n- https://notes.ethereum.org/@parithosh/holesky-planning\r\n- https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/803#issuecomment-1593108937\r\n\r\nZoom: shared on #allcoredevs Discord channel shortly before the call",

    "body": "Key Takeaways:\r\n- We reached out required commitment of 1.5M validators, we're currently at 1.7M and would like to close the signups\r\n- The client teams are currently making up ~800k\r\n- Genesis ETH allocation size of ~few 100M ETH. That way we have enough ETH for faucets/validators but don't have to worry about supply overshoot issues.\r\n- We stick to mainnet values as it allows for predictable testing.\r\n- We set the allocations similar to https://github.com/eth-clients/holesky/issues/1 but modifying the values to sane numbers.The post genesis seeding can happen via scripts.\r\n\r\nRough timeline:\r\n- End July: Complete testing to ensure CLs can handle the validator state size\r\n- End July: Create genesis state and start review\r\n- 7th Aug: End of review period, clients can start releases with state\r\n- Mid Aug: Releases from all clients with `--holesky` flag\r\n- Mid Sept: Chain genesis\r\n\r\nNote: Updates shared on ACDC/ACDE unless there are more discussion points needing a breakout call. If not, we can have another breakout call closer to the genesis file release date.\r\n\r\n",
