    "body": "There were two things that came up in https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/581 where CL teams' feedback is necessary to unblock things on 4844:\r\n1. Whether the `Blob gasprice update rule` in the EIP should optimize for stable throughput or \"bursts\" of blobs ([context](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/5353#issuecomment-1199277606))\r\n2. Whether blob syncing should be tightly coupled to block syncing. Long term, the desire is to decouple these, but this adds implementation complexity and, given the low number of blobs expected with EIP-4844, it might be best to sync blobs along with their associated blocks. \r\n\r\nIf time permits, it'd be great to discuss both these things.",

    "body": "> 2. Whether blob syncing should be tightly coupled to block syncing. Long term, the desire is to decouple these, but this adds implementation complexity and, given the low number of blobs expected with EIP-4844, it might be best to sync blobs along with their associated blocks.\r\n\r\nI have written down some thoughts on the loosely coupled block/sidecar approach and what the dependencies are like from the client's perspective. We don't have to go through this, I'll link it here for reference: https://hackmd.io/_3lpo0FzRNa1l7XB0ELH7Q?view\r\n",

    "body": "Can't make it to the call today. But regarding EIP4844:\n- Tracking excess blobs, instead of total blobs, sounds great, we can merge the current EIP update PR when it includes that.\n- Let's ignore the burst vs smaller incremental blob inclusion thing for now, there are more important spec and implementation issues currently.\n- Coupling blobs sidecar and beacon block in gossip propagation and/or sync would make things easier, but due to current implementation doing the uncoupled approach, and future compatibility of the uncoupled approach, I'm hesitant to change it. Do the client teams prefer the simplification of coupling in this context?\n- I'm curious if there's any progress with the BLST extension to include the building blocks desired for optimized KZG related functionality.\n- EIP4844 testnet: first experimental version is running I think, but is missing the new fees approach, and likely needs to be restarted to include more test eth and add a faucet.\n\n",
