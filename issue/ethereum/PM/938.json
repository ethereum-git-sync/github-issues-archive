    "body": "> With that context, @anderselowsson then would like to touch on some of his work on this topic.\r\n\r\nI have recently been studying the effect of issuance level on various important features such as consensus incentives and reward variability for solo stakers. If we are to temper issuance in Ethereum, then my recent [ethresearch post](https://ethresear.ch/t/properties-of-issuance-level-consensus-incentives-and-variability-across-potential-reward-curves/18448) can be helpful for understanding the options available, including the existing limits. A moderate approach in this case seems like the best avenue. The reason is that an equilibrium enforced through a more aggressive reduction in issuance can unbalance the economic forces (MEV vs issuance), rendering the micro incentives of the consensus mechanism ineffective. The overall topic is the subject of active research at the moment, so I simply wished to highlight this and refer to the post for a deeper understanding. I may not necessarily need to bring it up in the chat. \r\n",
