The idea is to give a short overview over why such targeting might be necessary / desirable, and the possible roadmap towards implementing it. In particular, I want to explain why there might be some urgency around including a simple first step of that roadmap in Electra already.\r\n\r\nWith that context, @anderselowsson then would like to touch on some of his work on this topic, including a proposal for an EIP that could be considered for Electra.",
