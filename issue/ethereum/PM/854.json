    "body": "**Big Blocks Study**\r\n\r\nDuring May 28th and June 11th, there was an experiment performed to inject large blocks on Mainnet and study their propagation. Multiple \"sentry\" nodes were deployed before the injection, in 3 locations around the world, to study the latency in different geographies. We studied the block diffusion latency for different block sizes, as well as the attestation latency. \r\n\r\nLater on we discovered that there are many organic big blocks on mainnet, some of them going over 2MB (https://etherscan.io/block/17968783). Over the last 6 months we have observed 100K+ blocks of size over 250KB, while the average block size is 100KB.\r\n\r\n**Resources**\r\n\r\nBig Block Experiment\r\n[Blocksize vs. Latency analysis](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1GrI6JaPZCTCmnW30YYXPs-MjA866jjXC)\r\n[Attestation latency analysis](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-0hv6UcQ-Suaz-i1Uq3elSdu29YY4fsv)\r\n[Block diffusion latency for a period of time (last 24H by default)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11P4oRknvkjFbn3OCCoH1jYXOzeB67FfG)\r\n\r\nOrganic Big Blocks\r\n[5000+ large (500KB+) blocks](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1XVyDj2d7ifNkH6ISLOxjs5tTEVnlscWs)\r\n[100,000+ large (250KB+) blocks](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1x6AGBhJeJMtLaSjG5oHO_WZi1WZweiyW)",

    "body": "Looking for reviews on the SSZ `StableContainer` (formerly `PartialContainer`) proposal: [EIP-7495](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7495)\r\n\r\nOne idea is to start using that for transactions / receipts in [EIP-6493](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6493), but the `StableContainer` could also become useful in context of [EIP-4788](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4788) as it provides stable generalized indices across spec forks. For example, if we add fields to a consensus object in the future and bump it, e.g., from 16 to 17 fields, as of now, all existing proof verifiers targeting that consensus object will stop working without an update.\r\n\r\nAlso, regarding timing, if [EIP-7495](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7495) receives positive reviews, could we bump Verge specs from current [EIP-6475](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6475) style SSZ `Optional`  to the proposed [EIP-7495](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7495) style `StableContainer` as well? For that, we'd need `StableContainer` implementations in SSZ libraries, it's rather straightforward though (sample impl provided in the EIP).\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/3230",
