I don't think this needs to take 2 weeks.  \r\n\r\nRe: \r\n\r\n> Buffer of 2 weeks assuming there is 1 issue found between clients Wednesday Mar/24\r\n> Settling the dust, one week client preparation time to include a new HF block for Ropsten Wednesday Mar/31\r\n\r\nI think maybe we can do something like set the fork block once all clients sync to each other, for 3 weeks in the future. WDYT? IMO 1 week to put out a release and distribute it after a bug has been found is short, so I think the best we can do is plan for the \"happy case\" where clients are all in sync, and then have clients put out a release with a block 2-3 weeks in the future.

    "body": "> plan for the \"happy case\" where clients are all in sync\r\n\r\nI am always a fan of planning for the \"non-happy case\". 😄  In the JavaScript team we perceive `EIP-2718` and `EIP-2930` as rather complex from an implementation PoV, currently doing the implementation (https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1048) and I would think that having 1-2 more issues with these EIPs (not for us isolated but between teams) - maybe also along some edge cases in the specs - is rather likely than not, also judging from the current discussions on ACD.\r\n\r\nA buffer has also the advantage that it reduces the cost of additional delay planning - especially for such short periods like 2-3 weeks or so. We already had this often in the past and there is a substantial coordination effort here in case (additional calls, new client releases, (public) communication), also to note a not-so-optimal outer perception if there are too many delays.\r\n\r\nBut at the end I am also fine with the happy-case planning and the 3-weeks-in-the-future date setting for the first testnet fork. 🙂 ",

Since [go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) hasn't even got a release out with the fork activations and a removed `EIP-2315` EIP yet (which is totally understandable since removal is just some days old), is it safe to assume that at least the `Ropsten` fork will be postponed? 🤔  (has there been some discussion around that that I missed, couldn't find anything?)\r\n\r\nWhat's with the other fork numbers, should everything be postponed by a week here?\r\n",
