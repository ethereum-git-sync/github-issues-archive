I think that there are some people in favor of granular hard forks, but the EIPs we currently have that are accepted and require hard forks is not very many. Because of that and the laser focus on client improvements, casper, and sharding it is difficult to dedicate time for a hard fork for a few EIPs that are less important arguably. I'm sure the idea of granular hard forks will be brought up again though.\r\n@ButtaTRiBot Added.",

    "body": "Update on Turbo-Geth (I will not be able to join the meeting again, unfortunately):\r\n\r\nCurrently working on the reorg capability. There are two parts to the reorg - database and trie. Database part is easy, because turbo-geth stores list of keys updated at each block, so it can delete them in bulk. Trie part is more complicated, because, unlike original geth, it cannot maintain multiple forks of the state at the same time. Therefore, the trie has to be rewound to the fork base before the fork can be applied. Ditched the original plan of marking trie nodes with block numbers where these nodes were created. The reason - it makes interaction with the hashfile (32Mb file storing hashes of level 5 of the trie) very complicated. Instead, the reorg in the trie will be implemented by playing backwards the state updates. This required a substantial change in how trie updates interact with the database, and incidentally, led to further decoupling of database and the trie. It will also further speed up block import.\r\n\r\nRebased to the go-ethereum master as of 2nd of April.\r\n\r\nI shall be talking about Turbo-Geth at Edcon",

They have ignored the overwhelming community support to make a change to prevent ASIC mining. It appears Vitalik is more concerned about saving his legacy of having developed a successful ASIC resistant algorithm instead of protecting Ethereum. The proposed change was very small and could have been completed in a few weeks with very little interruption to the development team.\r\n\r\nIn response to this inaction we are calling on all of the GPU miners to unite from 4/9/2018 until 4/13/2018 and switch to mining another coin. If enough miners stop mining Ethereum during this time it will only leave the ASIC miners in control of the network.\r\n\r\nThis is a standoff now between the ASIC miners and the GPU miners. The Ethereum Foundation does not see ASIC mining as a threat, let's call their bluff and see if they are right. Now is the time to stand together as a community. #NoETHGPUMining",

We could include EIP 969 or maybe even a better proposal that the community comes up with into the next hard fork (maybe Constantinople, or maybe those changes will be rolled back until Casper TFFG), with other changes.",
