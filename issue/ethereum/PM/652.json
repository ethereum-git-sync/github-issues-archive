    "body": "I would like to talk about the elephant in the room on this call: **Increasing Operational Cost of Running an Ethereum Node**\r\n\r\nEthereum has an operational cost problem and I estimate 0% of Ethereum users (rounded to nearest integer) actually run their own node.  This means the other ~100% of users are utilizing centralized services, many of which actively censor.  Lately we have seen a lot of discussion about \"scaling\", and this usually results in making the operational cost problem worse, lowering that 0% to a smaller 0%.  EIP-4844 is a prime example of this in that it will increase both network bandwidth and disk requirements of operating a node notably.  I'm concerned that we \"lost the plot\" somewhere along the way and are now worried about attracting users rather than building censorship resistant software.\r\n\r\nThe common argument I see is \"we'll fix the operational cost problem later\", usually with references to verkle trees and stateless, but very often in software \"later\" never comes, or it comes too late.  We are already seeing active censorship throughout the stack on Ethereum (MEV relays, RPC providers, app frontends, etc.) and I think that we should be focusing all of our efforts on addressing those problems and actively pushing back against changes that make the problem worse until such time as we have addressed the operational cost and censorship issues.  This would mean devoting more resources to verkle trees, statelessness, Portal Network, EIP-4444, CR Lists, internal refactoring, etc. and less time on proposals like EIP-4844 which focus on scaling at the cost of operational costs.",

I've added it to end of the agenda, but like for the broader testnet proposal, I think there's a risk we aren't able to cover it with the attention it deserves on this call. That said, this is an important topic, and I think perhaps if we time box it, we could move it up the agenda (and then have a longer conversation on the subject later as well). Curious what you think is the best approach here! ",

If we delay talking about this issue, then I fear there is a good chance that 4844 will go in without really being challenged, which aligns with how we have been going about this problem for the last several years (perpetually kicking the can down the road).\r\n\r\nI brought it up in this agenda (rather than the previous one) because I was under the impression that this was the call where we would try to figure out what is actually going into Shanghai, and I think talking about the inoperability of Ethereum clients is an important part of that discussion that shouldn't be skipped because it is uncomfortable/not-fun.\r\n\r\nI'm fine with any solution that gets the developers actually talking about the issue, whether that be timeboxing or something else, as long as we get people seriously thinking about our priorities and intentionally making the call to continue to sacrifice client usability for scalability (and other features) rather than having it happen as an unintended side effect.",
