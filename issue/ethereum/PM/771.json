    "body": "I haven't had time to update EIP-4788 and I am not sure I will be able to make tomorrow's call.\r\n\r\nTo summarize the latest status here: it was decided on ACDE to minimize boundary violation from EL and CL which means sending over the slot data along with the block root it corresponds to. I'm leaning towards writing the \"last slot touched\" to the contract storage so that to update the EL reads a special key to get the last slot `a` and parses the root `block_root` and new slot `b` to know how to update the ring buffer in the contract for the current block (e.g. write `block_root` to the storage keys `a % SLOT_SPAN ... b % SLOT_SPAN).\r\n\r\nThe EIP itself is a fairly easy ask from the CL as you just need to pass around the slot and block root when building a block. Meanwhile, it greatly expands the design space for trustless staking pools which I think we can all agree is important. It is a bigger ask on the EL to schedule for the next hard fork along w/ 4844 but I think there is a good chance of inclusion. Coming to strong consensus on this feature for Deneb at the CL would go along way to signal support to the EL that this feature should also be prioritized in Cancun.",
