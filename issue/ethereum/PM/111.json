Hopefully this can influence the agenda so that most of the time is spent discussing these issues. \r\n\r\n1. **\"How we work towards Istanbul\"**: what EIPs are included, excluded and other roadmap considerations. These EIPs were mentioned explicitly: \r\n    1. EIP-615\r\n    1. EIP-1344 vs. EIP-1965\r\n        * Can we make a decision on EIP-1344 independently of EIP-1965? \r\n    1. EIP-1283\r\n        * There was [an AMA](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-1283-1706-ama/3467) with no further questions about the EIP. Should it move to Accepted? \r\n    1. EIP-1962\r\n    1. State Rent EIPs\r\n    1. Other EIPs\r\n        * ProgPow?\r\n        * EIP-2028?\r\n1. **EIP Refactoring**\r\n    *  Given EIP-1702: Which of the Istanbul EIPs live only in version 1 code?  Which live in version 0 and version 1 code?\r\n    *  Proactive refactoring of the client implementations to make EIPs more simple, and reduce their conflicts. See \"Comment by Alexey\" below for details.\r\n1. **Conformance Testing** \r\n1. **Gas costs improvements that help developers today**\r\n\r\n**Comment by Alexey**: I would like to introduce this idea that, regardless of whether EIPs are accepted or not, part of their implementation that \"loosens\" up the code, should be done anyway. It means that instead of EIP implementations bringing all the complexity with them, some of the complexity is eliminated upfront. This is a new concept, but I think it is quite important to promote.",

Calls usually go this long, so if I am needed to make a decision on EIP-1344 I will try to attend. If not, if someone could inform me via Gitter when that decision is made, it would help me out immensely so I am not rushing to join the call to find out everyone had already left. Thanks!",

    "body": "> Given EIP-1702: Which of the Istanbul EIPs live only in version 1 code? Which live in version 0 and version 1 code?\r\n\r\nRegarding this, in the call we'll basically want to discuss two options:\r\n\r\n1. Treat old versions as \"immutable\" -- define a new version each time we do a hard fork. This will be really good to ensure backward compatibility. And because older versions are not changed, clients may be able to make more assumption of the versions to simplify the design. The drawback is that we'll get 2 new versions per year.\r\n2. Treat versions the same as how we do **semantic versioning**. Deploy a new version when a feature qualify as a \"major release\", and only change existing versions when a feature is \"minor release\" or \"patch release\". I'm okay with this, but I have worries about all the gas reduction EIPs for Istanbul -- I cannot convince myself that they won't have backward compatibility issues.\r\n\r\nIf we decide on (2), then we may not have a new version this time, because most Istanbul EIPs (except EIP-615 and state rents) are minor changes. However, I do want to propose that we ensure account versioning is implemented in all the clients and include it in Istanbul testing, because it allows people to write EIPs with the assumptions that we have account versioning, which in many situations will greatly simplify things (for example, state rent EIPs' new account RLP fields).",
