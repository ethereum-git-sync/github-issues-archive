If the more general approach is found too complex, I would consider including BEGINDATA. \r\n\r\n[Martin, Geth](https://discord.com/channels/595666850260713488/745077610685661265/820654744501878784): \r\n> 2327 Begindata: imo also too soon/rushed.

    "body": "( same comment being posted to simple subroutines)\r\n\r\nI don't think this should target London. The [EVM encapsulation format](https://notes.ethereum.org/@axic/evm-object-format#Encapsulation-format) I think is what the first step should be. From there we can impose rules on the EVM bytecode that will make evolution easier.  \r\n\r\nThis proposal will completely moot the BEGINDATA opcode and it feels like a hack to deal with the EVM's tolerance of invalid opcodes and the implications it has on multi-byte operations. I support evm code segmentation but I think right now the evm encapsulation design needs to run it's course before considering this.  If it is successful then this will be implicit in that design.",

    "body": "Hey I'm Mark from Optimism, this EIP (or something similar) is really helpful for improving the UX for deploying contracts onto Optimism. There is a [Safety Checker](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/contracts/blob/master/contracts/optimistic-ethereum/OVM/execution/OVM_SafetyChecker.sol) that any contract being deployed onto L2 must pass so that we can guarantee deterministic execution on L1 for the fraud proof. Currently, the Safety Checker sometimes fails when it shouldn't due to it interpreting the constructor arguments as opcodes. The current solution is to just try different constructor args until it works which isn't the ideal user experience. Addresses are known to trigger this problem. I'd like to learn more context around this EIP and how we can help to get this functionality into Ethereum.",
