    "body": "Random idea to debate briefly: is there a specific reason to retain the notion of the `pending block` or `pending transactions` in EL clients? Historically it served as a glimpse into what the next block might be. However, even way back this became mostly moot when there are 4K txs in the pool and only a few fit into the block, but with MEV and the likes, it's even moot-er since we have no idea what sandwiches and other food types end up included.\r\n\r\nThe upside of getting rid of it is just a weird mechanism that's not really useful, but makes the code weird in various places (e.g. we need to exec txs to maintain the pending block even if nobody calls it; retrieving the pending txs is weird when considering the inclusion fields (block, txindex) or basefee; pending txs get even weirder if subscribed via a streaming API (ws) because then you just get a stream of txs that have no clear block boundary not block inclusion info).\r\n\r\nWe can most definitely maintain this thing, just wondering if there's no specific reason for this to exist, we might as well delete it? Do we have any secific use case that validators might need?",

    "body": "Yet another interesting question wrt removing legacy code is the need to sync / transition non-merged networks. Even though all our maintained networks (apart from Rinkeby, scheduled for removal in Q3) is merged, we still maintain the capability to sync non-merged networks and to transition them.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot of code and logic around this old mode of operation (old sync, block proapgation, etc). Would be nice to remove it, but that would also entail that any new network we create should be merged already on genesis. Not sure how functional this is, I kind of remember that devops always schedules all the beacon forks on subsequent block numbers, not everything applied form the get go. Would it be possible to make this workable so we can long term remove all that legacy and transition logic?",

If clients are fine with it, we could choose mainnet dates as well and make it a combined release for Goerli as well as Mainnet. Alternatively we wait to see how Goerli performs before choosing a mainnet date (at the cost of a later fork). ",
