Testing updates.\r\n2. [Yellow paper update](https://twitter.com/gavofyork/status/949662885222998018).\r\n3. EWASM update + update on the following related EIPs.\r\n  a. EVM 2.0 - https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/48 \r\n  b. Extend DUP1-16 / SWAP1-16 With DUPN / SWAPN - https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/174\r\n  c. Subroutines and Static Jumps for the EVM - https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/615\r\n4. Stateless client development.\r\n5. Add ECADD and ECMUL precompiles for secp256k1 - https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/603 [[See this blog post for context](https://medium.com/@clearmatics/privacy-on-ethereum-is-too-expensive-fb8b9e1815b2)].\r\n6. Introduce miner heuristic \"Child pays for parent\" (like in BTC) to combat the weird cases when transactions with 1000 Gwei stuck in the mempool (because they are dependent via nonce on transaction paying much less and not getting mined).\r\n7. Creating a relay network of nodes to mitigate issues [described here](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/29#issuecomment-356952590) and [other transaction propagation issues](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/29#issuecomment-357151890).\r\n8. Fork release management/Constantinople.\r\n9. Client updates.\r\n10. Client improvements to alleviate issues.\r\n\r\nPlease provide comments to add or correct agenda topics.",

A proper set of high performance, widely interconnected nodes.\r\n\r\nWe know that the foundation set some bounties to boost some specific scaling methods for ethereum, I do think that build an high performance ethereum relay network could be very helpful to small miners with the final scope is to mantain decentralization. So I propose to set up similar bounties to run one or more relay network and to research how to build the better possible network in term of costs and efficency.",

    "body": "@RSAManagement I suspect those two big miners simply connected their nodes directly using \"addPeer\", so they propagate new blocks directly to each other.\r\n\r\nI would generally oppose encouraging specialised relay networks, because the end effect would be that the network will be more like a concentrated ring of miners and periphery, rather than more like a mesh now. And that would be bad for small independent miners, because if they are not part of the club (or ring), they end up on the periphery, and their blocks are more likely to be uncle-d.\r\n\r\nI think it is absolutely urgent to improve the propagation speed every time we see congestion like this, so that the miners have no incentive creating such a ring-relay network. The longer we keep the network a mesh, the healthier ecosystem we will get",

Updates on scaling, will we see any scaling improvement from Constantanople? Are there going to be any improvements because of CasperFFG? (I expect not in either case but worth asking) I know Plasma and Sharding are far from being implemented.. but would love to hear guesses (best case, worst case) on time frame for any scaling improvements. Many dapp devs have come to the conclusion that the main chain is not able to host their DApp because of gas costs. We are looking to build sidechain solutions to bide our time until we see some further improvements here, but would love to hear your input.",
