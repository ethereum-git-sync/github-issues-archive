The main advantage of the proposal is that it introduces fewer required changes to make the consensus upgrade on Ethereum Mainnet, i.e. replace PoW with PoS.\r\n\r\nThis proposal does imply that the Merge becomes the main focus of Ethereum core developers after London and Altair (the beacon chain upgrade expected to happen soon).\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nThe Merge is the main thing that the Ethereum community expects, and working on other initiatives (i.e. another “feature fork”) takes the limited focus that core developers have away from the merge.\r\n\r\n### Quick merge proposal\r\n- https://notes.ethereum.org/m9IX3OkkTveXCCOSzGkUiw",

Will all EVM interactions happen on POS?\r\n\r\n1. Consensus upgrade has no direct impact on transaction fees, transaction fees for the end user are expected to become lower when rollups start working under PoS and using shards. By swapping PoW with PoS the application layer gains native access to the data availability layer provided by shards. Then rollups being an application layer solutions leverage consensus upgrade + shards to deliver a significantly higher throughput and lower fees\r\n2. All EVM interactions will be secured by PoS and in general it does not affect smart contract computations. Other than `BLOCKHASH` seem to loose its strength as a source of randomness and apps will get access to a stronger entropy source, i.e. randao. Composability and contract interactions, JSON-RPC remain the same as on the mainnet today. The other property of PoS that might matter here is more predictable block times (the beginning of each slot), i.e. there is no fluctuations related to Poisson process like on the PoW chain\r\n\r\n",
