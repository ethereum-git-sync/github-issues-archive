    "body": "I'd like to request some clarifications wrt [EIP-2718](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718). The spec explicitly wants to omit defining what different transaction types will be in the future and how the numbers are allocated:\r\n\r\n> There was discussion about defining the TransactionType identifier assignment/selection algorithm in this standard. While it would be nice to have a standardized mechanism for assignment, at the time of writing of this standard there is not a strong need for it so it was deemed out of scope.\r\n\r\nThis is of course fine as we don't know what the future holds, yet I do think it misses a crucial clarification, namely explicitly stating how legacy transactions behave.\r\n\r\nThe spec talks about transactions in both a **legacy format** as well as a **wrapped format**. The moment you mention the latter, you need to explicitly define it. I **think** the idea was to have `TransactionType == 0` be a legacy wrap, but without a very strong definition of how the legacy transactions should be handled on the wire, RPC and in the consensus structures, this is going to blow up (e.g. in the transaction hash field of a block, do we hash in legacy format or in wrapped format?).\r\n\r\nIf the EIP does not want to define the wrapped version of legacy transactions, that's is fine, but then my request would be to explicitly mention it that clients implementing this EIP are still expected to fully only use the legacy format, and that and future wrapping will be defined in a future EIP and will explicitly spec the wire, RPC and consensus representation for them.\r\n\r\nMy personal suggestion on that front is that maintaining both formats in the consensus format is insanity which will surely backfire when some client code does a weird conversion and goes out of consensus; so I'd vote to either use one or the other, but never both.",

In 2930, I get the impression that the hash for a transaction is done by rlp-encoding into the hasher. Basically: \r\n```\r\nhash([1,[...]])\r\n```\r\nBut the 2718 spec instead sounds like the correct way to hash it would be to hash it as a prefix + opaque blob. Basically: \r\n```\r\nhash(1, [...])\r\n```\r\n (where [] means rlp-list)",
