(Hence why I didn't detail how the GPO works, it works the same way as until now).\r\n- Users stuffing `eth_gasPrice` into a 1559 tx for the priorityFee or maxFee will be handled gracefully as if they just did a legacy transaction, no shooting yourself in the foot.\r\n- Advanced users who know 1559 is different and how can rely on the new endpoint `eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas` which returns a value for the tip only (thus it won't be mined if used as is without a baseFee + slack on top).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nEdit: Geth's gas price oracle retrieves the cheapest 3 transactions from the past X blocks, and uses the 60th percentile as the suggestion for the price. The 60th percentile ensures we're aiming for inclusion in 2-3 blocks, whereas looking at the minimums ensures we're trying to push prices downward instead of up.\r\n\r\nEdit2: X = 20 for full nodes and 2 for light clients (they need to retrieve the entire blocks to suggest a price)",

    "body": "Hi! Yes some thoughts on the proposed oracle:\r\n(edits after the following was made clear: there is an oracle ('GPO') that tracks the 60th percentile of the minimum tip paid over the last 20 blocks, looking at the 3 transactions with the smallest tip for each block. `eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas` returns GPO while `eth_gasPrice` returns GPO + current basefee)\r\n\r\n- 20 blocks seems too long, it takes 6 blocks for basefee to double, so 20 blocks is 4 minutes 20 worth of blocks (average) which in worst case leads to basefee 10x'ing. The intuition here is that when basefee stabilises around the current correct market value, instead of catching up to it during spikes, in a way it \"cleanses\" the environment, you shouldn't need to rely on what happened in the past to determine what you should be doing now. The only periods where you want to use past information to determine your tip would be during spikes, but it's unlikely that we'd ever see a period with 20 full blocks in a row, for reference 6 full blocks means that prices doubled in about 1min20sec. I checked the worst spikes once and even then it wasn't that sudden (lost that analysis to a bad computer crash.... but happy to run it again!). There is also a strong dependency between the length of your look back period and the percentile you choose which we could exploit. You could say \"let's keep 20 blocks but up the percentile to 80th\" or \"let's keep the percentile to 60th and only lookahead 10 blocks\", that would probably have about the same effect. But if I had to pick I'd be more inclined to choose the latter because 20 blocks in the past is ancient history in 1559, basefee would have caught up to something by this point.\r\n\r\n- In the Discord messages it was discussed that the congestion rate is the important metric, not congestion level. I do think that any 1559-adapted gas price oracles must look at the gas used one way or another. This is the objective source of truth that prices alone cannot capture. If you see a block that is less than full, your oracle should stop advertising higher premiums than necessary. Right now it doesn't take advantage of the fact that block fullness provides the correct measure of congestion rate. I understand the need to not break everything at once and it's something again we could simulate to convince ourselves, but it seems inescapable to me that we cannot be looking only at prices to design a good 1559 oracle. Although after being more clear on what the current proposal does it's probably safe, if suboptimal.",

For the eth_gasPrice call, we will return the estimated priority fee + 1 basefee (which will essentially be the \"current\" full gasPrice that we estimate pre-London). For eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas, we return the estimated priority fee. The user needs to set the `maxFeePerGas` either manually based on the tip, or Geth defaults to the priority fee + 2x baseFee.",
