Testing\r\n2. Client Updates\r\n3. Research Updates\r\n4. Post EIP 1011 (Hybrid Casper) Spec Plans\r\n   1. [Now that EIP 1011 is deprecated, is there still the interest among client developers to have a joint testnet, a Ropsten-successor if you want to put it like that?](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/50#issuecomment-404428413)\r\n    2. [If yes, and I assume most of us are interested in some effort like this, how could it look like if not like the hybrid Casper proposal?](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/50#issuecomment-404428413)\r\n    3. [What smaller steps can/should we take in the meantime while waiting for casper+sharding? (can we just call it \"shasper\" now?)](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/50#issuecomment-404459475)\r\n5. Possibly changing network Id in Constantinopole (or, alternatively, the format of the handshake message to make it backwards-incompatible).](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/50#issuecomment-404749064)\r\n6. Constantinople hard fork timing and what to include (continuing conversation from last call).\r\n  a. [EIP 145: Bitwise shifting instructions in EVM](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-145.md): pretty well-formed, but not 100% implemented or tested.\r\n  b. [EIP 210: Blockhash refactoring](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/210).\r\n  d. [EIP 1052: EXTCODEHASH Opcode](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1052).\r\n  e. [EIP 1087: Net gas metering for SSTORE operations](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1087).\r\n  f. [EIP 1014: Skinny CREATE2](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/1014).\r\n  g. Delay ice age?\r\n\r\n**Proposed Constantinople Timeline**\r\nFinalize EIPs that are being implemented: July 13th\r\nClient implementation: July 16th - August 13th\r\nTesting: August 13th - September 10th\r\nTestnet: September 10th - October 1st\r\nLaunch: October 8th\r\n\r\n**This is not final and there will likely be changes. I am soliciting feedback from client devs and testers who will be working on this.**\r\n\r\nPlease provide comments to add or correct agenda topics.",

I'm not strictly following it but what I want to figure out is, if we do not work on a hybrid Casper as discussed in EIP 1011 now, there won't be any progress on a joint testnet anymore. I don't see sharding and Casper-as-a-Shard to be ready anytime soon. So, actual question:\r\n\r\n1. Is there still the interest among client developers to have a joint testnet, a Ropsten-successor if you want to put it like that?\r\n2. If yes, and I assume most of us are interested in some effort like this, how could it look like if not like the hybrid Casper proposal?\r\n\r\nI want to understand if there is anything we could start working on towards a joint testnet that could be useful for any future main net usage.",

    "body": "**Some pre-notes on testing / timeline**\r\n\r\nI would agree with @AlexeyAkhunov that there should be a stronger emphasis on the tests in the timeline. Are these more or less ready for Constantinople (@winsvega)? I would say that the client dev 4-weeks period should only start once tests are 90%+ finalized.\r\n\r\nI have doubts that this should already rely on the [retesteth](https://github.com/ethereum/retesteth) tool, since this still has a ``Prototype and WIP`` note. Think this is too early and clients already have their custom test setup in place. Seems to me that this would give unnecessary additional time pressure for implementation. Does this add any functional benefit? Or is this just a unified interface?\r\n\r\n**State of EthereumJS VM**\r\n\r\nCan't join todays call, some estimate of the ``EthereumJS`` [VM](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-vm) state:\r\n\r\nWe are more-or-less fully passing the current over-time updated ``Byzantium`` tests and have done some initial work on ``Constantinople``. My estimate would be that we could have an implementation ready within 2-3 month - also depending on some external circumstances.\r\n\r\nRole of EthereumJS VM:\r\n\r\nThe ``EthereumJS`` VM is not currently building the basis of a consensus-critical client, but is relevant for developers to test for Constantinople compatibility in tools like ``Remix`` or ``Truffle/Ganache``.",

    "body": "I also suggest that instead of trying to \"approve\" the list of EIPs for Constantinople hard fork, we instead work on the individual candidate EIPs and release (hard fork) them when they are ready. Current process of bundling changes in the big releases is based on the assumption that doing hard forks is hard, but why? Because we don't cleanly separate the old and the new network - this could be fixed by the practice of changing network Id in each fork. Because we start with underspecified EIPs and figure out the details in a rush just before the fork - this could be fixed by having EIP maturing process include mandatory rough reference implementation (enough to produce conformance tests), conformance tests, and only then full spec. If some more work is done to figure out underspecified and unimplementable things before the final spec, implementation of EIPs in all clients could be a much more straightforward process. If an EIP has a lot of good preparatory work behind it, it should be given some priority in consideration for the hard fork.",

The client will also be developer-friendly, supporting common dApp development (e.g. Truffle and web3) and deployment use cases. This means that the client will support the JSON-RPC APIs used by popular clients (e.g. eth, net, debug, admin, etc.), but not technologies such as Whisper or Swarm. We are focusing on functionality, robustness, and modularity.\r\n\r\nWe will be providing more information in the coming weeks, and we will also continue to increase our community involvement.",
