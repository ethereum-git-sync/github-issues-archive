This feels intentionally timed to have the highest probability of killing the EIP by causing last second uncertainty and doubt in a process that usually airs on the side of caution\r\n\r\nWhy do I need to compare my various use cases to some random proposal by Alexey that isn't even an EIP yet? I could come up with as many use cases for the EIP as needed but mutex is as fine an example as any.\r\n\r\nPlease stop wasting time, playing politics, and sabotaging so I can build dapps with reasonable gas efficiency in 2019.
