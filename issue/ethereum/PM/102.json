    "body": "Totally messed up with a time, 2pm UTC is one hour later on my local and I’ll not be able to participate too. I hope Kobi Gurkan will join the call, he is working on a python implementation. \r\n\r\nOn my side and progress I can add the following:\r\n- everything that was in scope for an original EIP is implemented and now will undergo testing and gas schedule metering\r\n- fuzzy testing is desired, but I’m not sure that it will be done on a code before August\r\n- performance of Rust implementation is better than current BN precompile if one neglects a one-time cost of some precomputations. Most likely pairings prices will be like high base price for a call that covers some precomputations and final exponentiation, with quite small additions per points pair \r\n-ABI is drafted\r\n- scope is also extended to support additions, multiplications and multiexps in G2 for pairing friendly curves\r\n- set of curves will be BLS12, BN, MNT4/6 and Cocks-Pinch generated ones (Ate pairings) for k=6 for now \r\n- I make Rust implementation, most likely python one will be also available for a cross-check. Sage scripts are most likely to be made too. There is no-one yet who expressed a will to make a Go/C++ one\r\n- Difficulty/Performance of Go implementation is questionable with no genetics\r\n- C++ is “trivial”\r\n- Rust code will be computable as a single file library \r\n- I didn’t look into problem of CGo yet, but looks like there are assembly tricks to overcome an inefficiency \r\n- If I’ve missed something please post questions to Gitter chat",
