    "body": "I'd like to raise one final question about EIP-4788: the current design has unbounded storage growth; a simple fix is to swap how the precompile keeps the block root history and bound the insertions by time. however, if we maintain the invariant that the EL does not know about `SECONDS_PER_SLOT` then swapping how the precompile is indexed would mean `SECONDS_PER_SLOT` wasted writes that in practice clients will likely optimize anyway with the CL constant.\r\n\r\nI'd like to make a decision on this: how bad is the state growth (at say 80MB per year) and does it motivate the other design option?\r\n\r\nFrom there, I'd like to move EIP-4788 to \"included\" status for Cancun -- we are trying to put together the Deneb spec on the CL and this cross-layer EIP is a small wrinkle while its status is up in the air.\r\n\r\n",
