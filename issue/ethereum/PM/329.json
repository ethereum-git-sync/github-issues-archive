It also depends on a value to be determined after London (via EIP-3541), however we think the core design is not expected to change significantly.\r\n\r\nThere is an implementation in [geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/22958) and [solidity](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/tree/eof1), and a partial implementation in [evmone](https://github.com/ethereum/evmone/pull/303).",
