  "body": "We are trying to simplify the [EIP-3416](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-3416.md) to focus only on the following, let us know if this is a good approach. Looks promising because less changes might be easy to integrate and less contentious:\r\n\r\n- Median gas premium.\r\n- Dynamic base fee with additive updates.\r\n\r\nIs possible to add these changes after/with EIP-1559, so we can include the needs fields, so can be included in the following fork. Technically, even if we are not fans of the wallet changes, our EIP can be added on top of EIP-1559 as the two improvements: Premium Pricing and Base Fee calculation.\r\n\r\nThx (also tx to @mtefagh)",

    "body": "@timbeiko thanks for your feedback! Were were asked to remove references section from the EIP, but we can compile the references here.\r\n\r\nSound reasonable to re-work 1559 with mainnet data. We can run simulations for 3416 with 1559v1 data and show the improvement we promise.\r\n\r\nthanks for your response, our pitch is that 3416 could give the same or more benefits as 1559 but with a *smaller implementation footprint*. Vis-a-vis, miner pricing changes but no changes to Tx Format and no changes to wallets. But we completely understand that 1559 could be in implementation phase so rolling-back that will be costly. Also, some parts have not been analysed in-length enough (the weighted median possibly, there are some simulations with main-net data but without base fees ). Although the additive changes in baseFee, I saw that is has a lot of positive feedback in the forum, and possibly has more chances to get into \"1559 v2\". My main concern is what is the cost of upgrading all wallets, gas station estimators and light-clients is easy to estimate and might take weeks or months to complete that in July.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\n[1] Median, Mean and Other Fee Price Aggregators Simulated: https://hackmd.io/c6kyRNMuTnKf_SlolmevRg#An-improvement-for-the-premium\r\n[2] Additive Changes in Base Fee better than Multiplicative: https://hackmd.io/c6kyRNMuTnKf_SlolmevRg#Path-dependence-problem-with-EIP-1559-and-a-possible-solution-to-this-problem\r\n",
