  "body": "We need to launch a Ropsten beacon chain to handle the merge of that testnet.\r\n\r\nIn our last CL call, it was [generally decided](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/Hy_VXLb8q#Ropsten-Beacon-Chain-launch) that Ropsten should be unpermissioned but for devs to have the majority of validators (similar to prater/goerli).\r\n\r\nSo this would entail\r\n* deciding on a genesis validator set size and genesis time\r\n* creating a genesis state with well-distributed validators across EL teams, CL teams, EF and launching the chain soon (before end of may)\r\n\r\nI suggest we do 100k vals. This is reasonably resistant to disruptions due to external deposits in the near-term, and it seems likely Ropsten is deprecated not too far out after it's merge\r\n",

    "body": "As discussed on ACD, Ropsten will have a validator set of ~100k. I'd say 10000 validator keys per entity taking part (Assuming that every client team wants to take part) => Validator set of 110012 (9 client teams + EF + Attestant/Vouch + 12 for EF security).\r\n\r\nIf there are entities outside of client teams that would like to take part, please comment below.\r\n\r\nI propose genesis for the ropsten beaconchain on 30th of May (~2.5 weeks from now). That should give us enough time for clients to have releases, blogposts to come out, explorers to be setup. At the same time, it would be an overlap of ~1 week before the proposed merge with Ropsten PoW chain. If we have altair + bellatrix happening in quick succession, the beaconchain would be ready well in advance. ",
