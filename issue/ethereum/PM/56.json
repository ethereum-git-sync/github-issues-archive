    "body": "In my opinion issuance reduction & ASIC fork-off has to happen at the same time. With a issuance reduction only you are only accomodating 'investors' who have a very biased view and only want to make money by reducing inflation, it won't work anyway. As a bad side-effect the network will also experience an extreme shift towards hashrate centralization.\r\nWhat is far more important is utility tokens & projects wanting to build their platform on the Ethereum network to have a stable underlying protocol without the risk of a centralized network and its implications.\r\n\r\nPotential industries will only adopt or even consider their projects when they know the underlying protocol - Ethereum - is absolutely secure as a disruption (i.e. 51% attack, censoring of certain transactions, just imagine one industry trying to sabotage ERC20 token transaction of a competitor for a huge shipment in the shipping industry) could cause huge problems & uncertainty. The real & ultimate value in Ethereum lies in the utility tokens & smart contracts, not in reducing inflation from i.e. 7% to 4.5%. That's just gimmick & fairy dust and a desperate attempt from 'investors' to easen their bags.\r\n\r\nBehold, miners are not less greedy (actually they are supposed to be greedy in this game theoretical protocol) but unlike 'investors' they fulfill a crucial function and bring actual value: security of the network.\r\nSo I'd advise you to reconsider your last stance of making a issuance-only without a ASIC-fork-off.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime ProgPOW is already live on a mainnet. Check out Bitcoin Interest (no endorsement). The block height for the fork was reached today and they're officially & successfully running ProgPOW. You can use that as a 'testnet' if you will & see that the algorithm is flawless and works as intended.\r\nNow it's up to you to lead this project into a success and it will only happen if you uphold the core value of the protocol: smart contracts & decentralization (AKA security).\r\n\r\nEdit\r\nas a bonus: Investors will most likely even make a bigger return that way, in the longer term",

I don't want to imagine the propaganda that will be thrown around by the big ASIC manufacturers when ETH finally switches to PoS.\r\nTheir hardware value & investments will go to zero, while GPU's value doesn't (it can be used for a lot of other stuff and also other coins).\r\nTherefore you will have a smoother transition to PoS if you keep GPU miners in the game.\r\n\r\nIf you embrace ASICs now, miners will slowly adapt & get ASICs themselves and it will be even harder to get consensus and the community split will be more drastic.\r\n\r\nIt is absolutely critical to form an opinion about ASICs fast and clearly communicate what you will do about it.

    "body": "I would like to talk about EIP-1057 (ProgPoW) and EIP-1355 (Ethash1a)\r\nto give a timeline what we, the ethminer community, think what has to happen before we use them. Forking the consensus algorithm isn't as easy as Bitcoin Interest makes it seem. All miners, nodes and even light clients such as wallets have to be updated in order to accommodate the new algorithm. \r\n\r\nMy main concern with ProgPoW is, that it was introduced by a company that specialize in providing special mining software. The open source community needs more time to analyse the characteristics of ProgPow before we can fork. Otherwise for profit companies could sell their mining software which outperforms the open source variants not by 3-5% (like now) but by way more (15+%). This would lead to a centralization of mining power again, controlled by the companies that provide the mining software. \r\n\r\nTherefore, we propose with Ethash1a  [EIP-1355](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1355.md) a minor change in the algorithm which would buy us more time to analyse ProgPoW.

Why wait for Istanbul HF if the solution is found after i.e. 2-3 months?\r\nNo need to risk the big masses adopting to ASICs because then you've crossed the event horizon and you can't go back without a community split.\r\nLuckily right now ASICs are exotic and only found in huge farms and manufacturer's farms.

    "body": "If issuance is reduced without something done about ASICs then it will be completely counter productive. There are no hobbyist ASIC miners. All ASIC miners will ever do is sell everything they mine, and they will sell quickly. Not dealing with this problem now is making a deal with the devil and making it more difficult to change things further down the line. \r\n\r\nFact: Reducing issuance will put pressure on mining economics, such that the proportional of hash owned by ASICs *must* go up. At best you could argue that it might only go up a little bit, but it can only increase.\r\n\r\nSupposedly the issuance reduction is to throw a bone to \"investors\" by cutting down on inflation. I know many \"investors\", and I have never met a single \"investor\" that said \"the reason I'm selling ETH is because inflation is too high.\" No. The reason they're selling ETH is because the price is bleeding more and more, and they're losing faith. Average joe investor is very quickly shedding the belief that ETH is \"the next bitcoin.\" \r\n\r\nCutting the inflation will obviously prop up the price to some degree - in the long run. But you can't make a case for it turning around the current bleeding. The total effect is going to be a few % at best, the kind of swing we see on a daily basis. The net effect of that change will take months to years to work out. \r\n\r\nCut off the GPU miners though, and you've dramatically increased selling pressure on day one after the fork because a much larger percent of mined ETH is going to be dumped by big centralized miners starting immediately after the fork, and it'll never stop. The block reward issuance will reduce the amount of ETH rewarded, but will not significantly reduce the amount of ETH sold by miners on the market. It might even increase it. There is a very real risk that it actually suppresses price in the short term. And at this stage, suppressing price in the short term is suppressing price in the long term.\r\n\r\nAt this early stage you should never lose sight of how immature the market is. \"Investors\" are not responding to fundamentals like inflation rate. \"Investors\" are not looking at supply. They're just not. Most don't even know what it is or where to find it. How else can you explain XLM and XRP having such huge valuations even though only a tiny fraction of the supply is even circulating, and the rest is held by centralized power? By fundamentals those tokens should be near worthless, but instead they're near the top of the pack. All \"investors\" are looking at is the price and the direction it's heading, and handing over mining to ASIC farms is going to increase selling pressure, suppress the price and drive new investors away. \r\n\r\nI can't take the \"there's no time to do anything\" argument seriously if there's actually a simple way to brick current ASICs and at least buy some time. If you ignore the concerns of GPU miners, not only would you be biting the hand that fed you over the past few years, you're trading a friendly idealistic bunch with a large percentage of holders and true believers for ruthless corporations that will not hesitate to bite back. If you dismiss this threat today, by the time you casually get around to dealing with it you'll have a much steeper hill to climb with much more resistance from organized opponents that have no interest in Ethereum whatsoever beyond mining and selling it. They will stir up an order of magnitude more chaos and divisiveness than a bunch of random GPU miners could ever hope to. If the price of ETH actually does pump over the next few years, that's going to be worth billions to Bitmain and friends. If the price dumps, mining returns will drop so low (especially with the BR decrease) that they'll end up owning more and more of it of the mining rewards. In either case, they'll have incentive to battle devs at every step, especially when they're an entrenched power. They're not going to roll over without a fight like most GPU miners. They will not be casually dismissed, and they will derail every and any plan developers have that goes against their interests. You need to cut the cancer out before it grows and spreads. That's why ASIC resistance was a core tenet of Ethereum from the start right? Assuming you can handle this at your leisure is not a safe assumption. Ignore it at your peril.\r\n\r\nI get that punting ASIC resistance to the next fork is the easy thing to do, and reducing inflation is the easy thing to do to increase price. But the easy thing to do is rarely the right thing to do, there will be a price to pay down the line for taking the easy way out today. Every plan the dev team has is in jeopardy if you hand over running the network to people who have zero interest in seeing those plans come to fruition.",

    "body": "**BREAKING NEWS**\r\n\r\nIt will become worse and worse, **the \"E9\" is announced**.\r\nhttps://www.coindesk.com/a-new-line-of-powerful-asic-miners-is-coming-to-ethereum/\r\nJust as I have said, when they fear their investment becoming worthless, which an Ethereum ASIC-fork-off would do, they will try ANYTHING to get ASICs to the masses.\r\nNow what would you do if you have developped an ASIC ~~7.37x~~ **62.2x** more efficient than Bitmain's and you feel a sentiment becoming stronger in the Ethereum community (to fork ASICs off)? **EXACTLY** I would put out a PR right then and there saying I will release ~~7.37x~~ 62.2x more efficient ASIC miners to the market in the beginning of the next year. \r\nThis way they can kill 2 birds with one stone:\r\n1. Put Bitmain, their competitor, under massive pressure, who will now sell their ASICs for throwaway prices, getting ASICs to the masses.\r\n2. Getting ASICs to the masses prevents Ethereum to fork because community doesn't want to when they own ASICs. This protects their investment.\r\n\r\nDo you believe an ASIC ~~7.37x~~ 62.2x more efficient than the E3 isn't long mining on the network?\r\nIf that doesn't make eth devs fork, we definitely know they have a hidden agenda and that [tinfoil hat on] maybe some of the devs are compromised by Bitmain/other ASIC manufacturers. This is a **multi billion dollar market** after all. [tinfoil hat off]\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\nASIC manufacturers are systemically exploiting and straight out scamming consumers out of their hard-earned money, the best case would be the new Zcash miners, let me lay it out for you:\r\nIn June a Zmaster A9 had a price of USD $10,000 and a break even time of around 70-80 days.\r\nIn July/August Zmaster A9 had a price of USD $5000-$6000 and a break even time of around 70-80 days\r\nIn September Zmaster A9 had a price of USD $3000-4000 and a break even time of around 70-80 days\r\nPersonal prediction:\r\nIn October-November Zmaster will be USD $1500-2000 and will have a break even time of around 70-80 days\r\nNote: The ones who bought the Zmaster A9 in June still haven't broken even.\r\n\r\nDo you see the pattern?\r\nFirst they pre-mine, then they manufacture their second gen, then they sell their miners in a very shady way laid out above. Once they sold them they crush difficulty slowly and will soon release their \"Zmaster A9 Grande\" and will do the whole thing over. Each time milking the miner community, as many people are naive and buying into this shady scheme, blinded by break even time which mostly only last 2-3 weeks.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA and AMD are not doing this because\r\n1. They are reputable decades old public companies that haven't their core business in crypto **at all**\r\n2. They would get sued immediately for running a fraudulent scheme\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\n**If ETH doesn't fork ASICs off they are the enabler that allows small time miners to get scammed by ASIC manufacturers. I wonder how they can square that with their conscience.**\r\nEdit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q52CepI1DD8\r\nAnd this isn't just about Innosilicon, I already was interested in mining back in 2012/2013 and I did mine a little with my GPU and I wanted to get myself an ASIC. Back then you would order in march and get your product in November, by that time a more efficient ASIC would have been on the market and youd be delivered a couple thousand dollar brick to your doorstep. It's gotten better but the manufacturers will continue this until there's real world-wide competition. We got another couple years until that happens. So ASICs are bad as of this moment, not because ASICs are bad themselves, but without exception all manufacturers are. You can't even hold them accountable since all are in China.\r\nSo just fork it and be done with this discussion, it's obvious to everyone what has to be done. If Monero can do it I'm sure you can too.\r\n\r\n> At present, the company is still working on developing the product. Customers may begin receiving their miners in April 2019, according to the presentation.\r\n\r\nIf anyone believes that I'm sorry to tell you: You're straight out stupid or the most naive person I have ever met.",

    "body": "> I would like to talk about EIP-1057 (ProgPoW) and EIP-1355 (Ethash1a)\r\n> to give a timeline what we, the ethminer community, think what has to happen before we use them. Forking the consensus algorithm isn't as easy as Bitcoin Interest makes it seem. All miners, nodes and even light clients such as wallets have to be updated in order to accommodate the new algorithm.\r\n> \r\n> My main concern with ProgPoW is, that it was introduced by a company that specialize in providing special mining software. The open source community needs more time to analyse the characteristics of ProgPow before we can fork. Otherwise for profit companies could sell their mining software which outperforms the open source variants not by 3-5% (like now) but by way more (15+%). This would lead to a centralization of mining power again, controlled by the companies that provide the mining software.\r\n> \r\n> Therefore, we propose with Ethash1a [EIP-1355](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1355.md) a minor change in the algorithm which would buy us more time to analyse ProgPoW.\r\n\r\nGood lord this again.\r\n\r\nProgPoW is open source. Anyone with a brain can verify what it does and does not do.\r\n\r\nOn top of that, no, it wasn't introduced by a company - it was a side project worked on by IfDefElse, of which I happen to be a member. This algorithm has _nothing_ to do with OhGodACompany or The Mineority Group. \r\n\r\nWe've literally walked everyone through the code, and the code is nicely commented too on what it does and how it works.\r\n\r\nRegardless, the E9 is out now. Here's a fun fact for you: it's not an ASIC. As in, it's going to be resistant to any of your tweaks. How, you ask? Well, that's a _ton_ of HBM2 in there. And those cores are going to be resistant in algorithm tweaks, because they can just be reprogrammed with some firmware. \r\n\r\nIt's lightcache churn, to the max.\r\n\r\nAnd guess what? There's an even better version coming. \r\n\r\nEnterprise miners will snap them all up, and control a majority of the hashpower, and when you have more than 20%, there are some _wonderful_ exploits you can do.\r\n\r\nI'd like to make a point to the community: I would not throw my real identity in the mix if ProgPoW was not going to do what it says it can do, and if I would somehow personally profit. Have a think, for a long, hard moment, what that would _possibly_ accomplish, and how stupid that would possibly be when everyone and their mother knows who I am.\r\n\r\n@Souptacular I would really like for misinformation and second guessing to stop happening, and I'd like to directly answer any questions the Parity and Ethminer teams have. If the timezones allow, we'll pull in Def and Else, too.",

    "body": "Also, do you support the censorship on r/Ethereum? I made an anti-ASIC thread and it gained huge traction and was #1 on the frontpage quickly accelerating in upvotes.\r\nFirst it was taken off the frontpage, then they even deleted my OP (https://i.imgur.com/26OBf8q.jpg or https://web.archive.org/web/20180915123751/https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/9fyldx/breaking_news_new_asic_with_737x_efficiency_of_e3/)\r\n~~Now its back on (**while still being removed from frontpage**), and I havent heard anything from a MOD why this has happened.~~ NOW it's again back on. Thanks @5chdn there was still no proper reason though.\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/9fyldx/breaking_news_new_asic_with_737x_efficiency_of_e3/\r\n\r\n~~Clearly you have a hidden agenda. Luckily you can't censor me on github.~~ (me to myself: easy on the sips there) but there certainly is one mod who deleted this and it doesnt show in the logfile according to @5chdn \r\n\r\nI hope as many people as possible see this.\r\nIt's very strange how quiet that ASIC question by @Souptacular was in dev meeting 46. A little too quiet. Did some of the ETH devs have behind the doors meeting with ASIC manufacturers?\r\n\r\nI was just informed that it was deleted, I'm the only one that can see it. Maybe still in my cache. Here you go:\r\n![absolutely censored](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32360383/45586632-f1087c00-b8fa-11e8-9798-893add29462c.png)\r\n",
