    "body": "How about we add in a step 1.5, talking about patch proposals for the Istanbul EIPs?\r\n\r\nHere are some examples that we could cover:\r\n- Blake2 - hopefully quick check-in about \r\n  - Should we [reduce the maximum number of rounds](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/152#issuecomment-528053511)? (typical is 12, gas currently limits to ~8M, maximum that can be specified is currently ~4B, 32 bits) Maybe 16 bits (~65k rounds) is sufficient.\r\n  - Should we [reduce the number of bytes of t0 and t1](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/152#issuecomment-526645573) from 4 bytes each to 2 bytes each? (which would limit the total bytes of inputs to ~2^64, rather than the current ~2^128)\r\n- Should we [increase the cost of `EXTCODECOPY`](https://gitter.im/ethereum/AllCoreDevs?at=5d6f92018ab9652541b68e65)? After the SLOAD repricing, it will be cheaper to load a word out of a contract than to load a single storage slot. This disparity *grows* as you load more words in series. (Perhaps this is okay, because loading a linear series of bytes actually is faster than loading a bunch of values out of the storage trie)\r\n- How to deal with contracts that break by increasing SLOAD costs (eg~ Aragon). Some soft proposals I've heard floated:\r\n  - Reduce log costs\r\n  - Reduce `SLOAD` cost to 700\r\n  - Add a `STATICCALLWITHLOGSANDVALUE` (obviously with a better name) and interpret call with default stipend as this new SCWLAV\r\n  - Keep a second gas counter with the old gas costs until hitting the default call stipend ",

After that we can do an `Istanbul` `v4.1` release - this will likely be mid next week. We'll mark this (the `Istanbul` support, so not the VM version release itself) as `beta` since this is only basically tested and there might be last minute changes to some EIPs.",

    "body": "Some mental notes (waiting for plane, won't be able to attend the call):\r\n\r\n * Re Blake 2 vs. 4 byte `round`: Is there a legit use case for anything other than 12? I mean it's nice that we want to be flexible, but do we meaningfully need to? How many rounds are there in real use cases? I really think the number should be adjusted to the use case. 2 vs. 4 byte doesn't seem to matter to me really. If there's a reason for large rounds, 4 seems safer since it can cover any weirdo scenario. If there's absolutely no reason for large rounds, why not 1 byte or why not hard code 12 rounds altogether?\r\n * Re Blake `t` fields. @axic mentioned that the old fields are 128 bits and the new suggestion is 32. That does not compute because he suggested halving them. That said, 32 bits can already index 4GB, so I kind of agree that there's no point in supporting something that is impossible to get into the EVM in the first place.\r\n * Re Blake `m_len` field. This seems a weird addition to avoid Solidity doing proper work :P I kind of get where we're coming from, but still this seems like a weirdo ugly hack to save some loose gas.\r\n * Re EXCODECOPY pricing, I wouldn't try to add new features at the 11th hour. We can analyze what can be cone with EXTCODECOPY and consider updating it after Istanbul, but this seems a random idea that has not yet been really analyzed, so it would just prolong Istanbul.\r\n * Re SLOAD, my only emphasis is to take Net SSTORE into account too, since some rules of that EIP were adjusted to SLOAD being 700. If sload is capped to 700, the SSTORE eip might need to be tweaked too. As for the actual solution, I leave that to @holiman, but I'd appreciate if we didn't start to add dirty hacks all over the place.",

    "body": "> Re Blake 2 vs. 4 byte round: Is there a legit use case for anything other than 12? I mean it's nice that we want to be flexible, but do we meaningfully need to? How many rounds are there in real use cases? I really think the number should be adjusted to the use case. 2 vs. 4 byte doesn't seem to matter to me really. If there's a reason for large rounds, 4 seems safer since it can cover any weirdo scenario. If there's absolutely no reason for large rounds, why not 1 byte or why not hard code 12 rounds altogether?\r\n\r\nThere are potential future use cases that our team has considered for larger rounds, but they're early and I'd rather not speculate on creative applications just yet.\r\n\r\n@zookozcash has also [suggested similarly](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/152#issuecomment-499236824)\r\n\r\nI do think restricting the rounds to something more reasonable considering gas limits, etc is fine- as the gas pricing is per round, this is priced in regardless. As @axic pointed out the round limit doesn't come from the RFC. The question for me is whether we want clients to need to update to an EIP revision before Istanbul.\r\n\r\n> Re Blake t fields. @axic mentioned that the old fields are 128 bits and the new suggestion is 32. That does not compute because he suggested halving them. That said, 32 bits can already index 4GB, so I kind of agree that there's no point in supporting something that is impossible to get into the EVM in the first place.\r\n\r\nNote @axic [withdrew the `t` field modification proposal](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/152#issuecomment-528886590).",
