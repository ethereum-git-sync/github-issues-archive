To start, I'd like to propose the Ethereum Engineering Effort https://github.com/karalabe/eee  (I'll move the repo if there's traction). Curious what you all think!\r\n\r\n> To better explain what I'm dreaming this could become, I've also added a PoC #Ethereum Engineering Process (EEP) for rolling out consensus updates without breaking everything https://github.com/karalabe/eee/blob/master/eeps/eep-1.md. The other obvious immediately documentable EEP would be the EIP process.\r\n\r\nI've been pondering about such a system for a while now. I'm not sure this is the right format, neither am I sure if the community really wants it, but thought I'd bring it up as a proposal that we can debate.\r\n\r\nThis is something the Ethereum Magicians should steward if there's traction; I definitely won't have time to do it, but wanted to create a starting point so everyone's on the same page.",

    "body": "Based on mining pool requests, I'd like to propose updating the `eth_getWork` RPC API (https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC#eth_getwork) with a 4th return value for the block number.\r\n\r\nThe rationale is that more advanced miners (Geth and Parity) not only create a single mining package per round, but recreate the block multiple times when some events trigger (new uncle, high value tx, etc). From the outside however, it's impossible to decide whether a new mining work invalidates the old one (new block), or is just an alternative (better block). This is problematic for mining pools because they don't know whether to give rewards for those shares or not.\r\n\r\nBy adding a fourth parameter returning the block number too, pools can fairly accurately decide if a mining work completely replaces the old one or is just an alternative to it.\r\n\r\nParity already does this, and Geth will ship the next version like this too. Might as well update the specs altogether.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### eth_getWork\r\n\r\nReturns the hash of the current block, the seedHash, boundary condition to be met (\"target\") and the block number.\r\n\r\n##### Parameters\r\nnone\r\n\r\n##### Returns\r\n\r\n`Array` - Array with the following properties:\r\n  1. `DATA`, 32 Bytes - current block header pow-hash.\r\n  2. `DATA`, 32 Bytes - seed hash used for the DAG.\r\n  3. `DATA`, 32 Bytes - boundary condition (\"target\"), 2^256 / difficulty.\r\n  4. `QUANTITY` - current block number.\r\n\r\n##### Example\r\n```js\r\n// Request\r\ncurl -X POST --data '{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"method\":\"eth_getWork\",\"params\":[],\"id\":73}'\r\n\r\n// Result\r\n{\r\n  \"id\":1,\r\n  \"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\r\n  \"result\": [\r\n    \"0x645080cd2bffef917f7a1260d8da54b929193250d243d0f138481fd6480f7b3a\",\r\n    \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\",\r\n    \"0x000010d00eb60cdf4b4361daf59f96eba40e2f8c699adc6780da90bf3ea756d2\",\r\n    \"0x1\"\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```",
