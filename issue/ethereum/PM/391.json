    "body": "Update about \"December Fork Planning\": \r\n\r\nDuring ACD122 (https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/384), we discussed potentially having more than a difficulty bomb in the December upgrade despite having agreed against it previously (see: https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/356). \r\n\r\nOn the call, it was suggested that because EIP-3860 addressed a potential DoS vector, it should perhaps be considered for a December network upgrade alongside the difficulty bomb delay. **After talking to the 4 client teams, the consensus seems to be that the December upgrade should only contain the difficulty bomb pushback and nothing else.** 3/4 of the client teams explicitly preferred this (including the ones most susceptible to issue described in EIP-3860). If any client team/dev disagrees with this conclusion, please comment and/or reach out to me. \r\n\r\nGiven this consensus, I propose the following: \r\n\r\n1. We create a specification for the December Network upgrade under the \"Arrow Glacier\" name to make it clear that this upgrade only contains the difficulty bomb pushback. \r\n2. We create a placeholder EIP to delay the difficulty bomb and include it in this upgrade. \r\n3. On the October 29th AllCoreDevs call, we agree to both the delay for the bomb, and the fork block for the December upgrade. \r\n4. On the November 12th AllCoreDevs call, all clients have a release for Arrow Glacier that we can share. \r\n\r\nAs for EIP-3860 and all the other EIPs currently proposed for Shanghai, once the merge is done being implemented, we should go over them and discuss which of these should be in the first post-merge upgrade (whether that is still called \"Shanghai\" is TBD).

    "body": "@paulmillr to add more color to lightclient's comment: because the difficulty bomb will go off again in December, we will **need** to have an upgrade then. One notable thing about the difficulty bomb, though, is that it only is present on mainnet and not on testnets. \r\n\r\nThis means that a bomb-only upgrade does not need to be deployed to testnets, and can be deployed to mainnet directly. This reduces the time it takes to plan, communicate, and roll out the upgrade. We'd already kind of missed the window to have a proper feature fork in December if we wanted a smooth rollout (see: https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/356), but given the couple EIPs discussed on the last call were very small, we wanted to entertain the idea again. \r\n\r\nAs shared above, client teams prefer to stick with a bomb-only upgrade to keep things simple while we are working on the merge. \r\n\r\n ",
