    "body": "Maybe a good idea to collect all the issues here, so everyone is on the same page and we can focus on resolving problems rather than talking about what happened on the call:\r\n\r\n### Meta issues\r\n\r\n- recently added hashpower caused reduced blocktimes and caused this hardfork to happen much earlier than expected on a Saturday which is by all means the worst time for a hardfork\r\n- hardfork happened only 6 days after Geth release and 1 day after Parity Ethereum release, users had not enough time to upgrade\r\n- not a single miner was mining on the Constantinople chain, it took us two hours to find someone to sync an updated Ropsten node and start mining 4_230_000 while Byzantium chain was happly grinded at ~1 GH/s\r\n- there is no fork monitor available, only http://ropsten-stats.parity.io which does not reveal details about the different chains\r\n\r\n### Client issues\r\n\r\n- Harmony used two different configs for Ropsten, see https://github.com/ethereum/ethereumj/pull/1214\r\n- Parity Ethereum consensus bug in EIP-1283 implementation, see https://github.com/paritytech/parity-ethereum/pull/9746\r\n- Aleth similar bug in EIP-1283, see https://github.com/ethereum/aleth/pull/5316\r\n\r\nAnything else?\r\n\r\n**Edit**: Lane moved this to the forum, makes sense: https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/issues-we-discovered-in-the-ropsten-constantinople-hard-fork/1598",

What is missing there and also here: we need to answer the question: \"What is the plan between now and mainnet hard-fork?\". Clearly, we are not rolling back Ropsten, and keep testing things there. So I propose regularly spawning (and mining) temporary test nets to test transition to Constantinople with any clients that want to participate. It is important to test both the new code (on Ropsten now), and the tools and processes used for transition (not possible on Ropsten anymore).",
