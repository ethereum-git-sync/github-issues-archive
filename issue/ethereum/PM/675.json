    "body": "Some EthereumJS takes on Shanghai HF planning:\r\n\r\n0. **Scope**: We generally perceive a HF including Withdrawals, 4844, Extended-EOF together with the already included EIPs as too big/complex and would prefer to have this separated into (at least) two different HFs.\r\n\r\nRegarding a potential **Shanghai HF in March**:\r\n\r\n1. While the **EOF**/Ipsilon team has made impressive progress we feel that there is still a lot late movement in the specs and  it would be good to have some more dedicated time for local inter-client functionality testing and edge case refinement and we therefore receive a March production date as pretty early, also regarding the fact that all 3-4 additional EOF EIPs are still WIP for many clients.\r\n2. For **Sharding/4844** we are a bit less certain. Judging from the scope of our own implementation, our (incomplete) picture on overall readiness and the fact that KZG commitments are a very new type of underlying base technology we have a stronger tendency though to see March also as a date being very much early for production readiness.\r\n3. We feel comfortable having **withdrawals** included in Shanghai (in March), nevertheless also see withdrawals as a - somewhat - complex EIP bringing in a new type of state transition mechanism which deserves a descent amount of dedicated attention. We also acknowledge the fact that withdrawals have been promised to be delivered to the community \"as soon as possible\".\r\n\r\nPotential **HF timing and scope** ideas:\r\n\r\n4. \"On the other hand\" we also acknowledge the fact that there is a somewhat urgent need from the L2 side for Sharding/4844 and generally a stronger push for both 4844 and EOF to be included (as) early (as possible). One compromise might be to directly schedule and (more or less) determine the scope for two closely following HFs, with a **Shanghai HF in March with the currently included EIPs** and a **4844/EOF \"Cancun\" HF in May/June** (both eventually open for 1-2 smallish EIP additions).  This would guarantee a somewhat earlyish inclusion and at least give some planning security to the EOF/sharding-involved teams.\r\n5. Also possible/ok-ish would be an **\"All-Included + Sharding\" HF in April/May** (with EOF just loosely scheduled for a not-yet-planned following HF) or (a bit less preferred, see 0.) an \"**All-Included + Sharding + EOF\" HF in May/June**.\r\n\r\nThese are just *some* ideas. We are likely ok with other options as well. ðŸ™‚ \r\n",

Will make sure we cover this, first by discussing what we should have in a fork centered around withdrawals (@ralexstokes we'll bring up BLS as part of the Shanghai CFI'd EIPs), and then what commitments we can make for the following fork. \r\n\r\n@mkalinin I've added the Engine API issues for after this during the call. \r\n\r\n\r\n@leonardoalt I've added an agenda item about EIP-663 as well. As a heads up, though, we try and avoid CFI'ing an EIP on the first call it is brought up so people generally have at least two weeks to review them more deeply and aren't surprised that something \"snuck in\" CFI. \r\n\r\n",

Maybe do withdrawals-only testing till holidays to derisk optionality of EOF.\r\nDec ~20th holidays\r\nJan 5th ACD - check if EOF implementations are ready, all functionality tested.\r\nJan 12th CL call - note: shadowforking should start!\r\nJan 19th ACD call - EOF cross-client interop must have been smooth for EOF to continue.\r\n21-29 workshop (incl travel time) - goal: stable EOF/withdrawals mainnet shadowfrok, and 4844 clients all on testnet.\r\nFeb 30+ continue shadow-forking, and public testnets: Sepolia, Goerli, ??. Likely ~1-2 weeks apart each.\r\nMid March: Shanghai hardfork\r\nEnd March: Any 4844 interop corrections\r\nMid April: 4844 mainnet shadowforking\r\nEnd April: margin\r\nMid May: 4844 on public testnets\r\nEnd May (or if delayed, June): 4844 mainnet?\r\n\r\nSo TLDR:\r\n- EOF in shanghai, but ONLY if withdrawals are not delayed.\r\n- 4844 center of next HF, with commitment to parallel work where possible. Aiming for May/June.\r\n\r\nAlso, 1153 IMO is stable and well tested, was a bit unclear during ACD, and should be included in Shanghai IMO, but with the current minimalist mindset it will probably have to go into the next HF along with 4844 (and maybe EOF if that's not ready by start January).\r\n",

    "body": "Cross-posting discord R&D message:\r\n\r\nNote that we aim for a **fast turn-around with Cancun**, ideally *in May/June*, 4844 is a critical improvement for ethereum and so far we were aiming/building towards Shanghai already. So we should continue the already ongoing 4844 testnet efforts, and need client support insofar it does not delay Withdrawals. I believe Cancun should be open for additional proposals, but IMO by start of February every proposal should meet the same support/testing as 4844 to go into Cancun. E.g. EIP-1153 would be a good candidate, or EOF if it slips in January.\r\n",
