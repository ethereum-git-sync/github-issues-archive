A centralized network or slowdown of some components of the network until PoS (14s block time stays the same)? Syncing a new node will take the biggest hit (6 days with 1 CPU core), or 0.75 days with a modern Ryzen CPU.~~~\r\nsee answer by @OhGodAGirl below. On discord chat she said verification time goes from 4ms to 8ms so it's negligible @holiman",

It should be 2 times slower (twice the data being pushed), not whatever it is now (give me a break, it's 4:38AM here, I don't do math in my head at this time).\r\n\r\nI would like to remind all developers to again take a look at the code base and investigate bugs on their own, too, rather than pointing to a bug and using that as an argumentative basis for all the reasons a change cannot be considered.

Basically verification is about a 2x increase. I personally don't think that's a blocker -- we're not going to go another 6M blocks with it anyway, just until PoS... \r\n\r\nMy proposal would be to prepare a separate hf which is decoupled from Constantinople. Because the two really are not technically tied together. If we eventually decide to set both `ConstantinopleBlock` and `ProgpowBlock` to the same number, then fine, but that's not a necessity. \r\n\r\nFrom a testing perspective, the tests for progpow are very different from the tests that are written manually by @winsvega to find quirks in the evm implementation. Tests for progpow require _no_ knowledge about the EVM, so the actual tests could/should be produced by someone else so that process can run in paralell and does not have to take time from the constantinople testbed.

    "body": "> Some testcases and benchmarks for progpow in geth is available here: [ethereum/go-ethereum#17731 (comment)](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/17731#issuecomment-425359131) . Basically verification is about a 2x increase. I personally don't think that's a blocker -- we're not going to go another 6M blocks with it anyway, just until PoS...\r\n> \r\n> My proposal would be to prepare a separate hf which is decoupled from Constantinople. Because the two really are not technically tied together. If we eventually decide to set both `ConstantinopleBlock` and `ProgpowBlock` to the same number, then fine, but that's not a necessity.\r\n> \r\n> From a testing perspective, the tests for progpow are very different from the tests that are written manually by @winsvega to find quirks in the evm implementation. Tests for progpow require _no_ knowledge about the EVM, so the actual tests could/should be produced by someone else so that process can run in paralell and does not have to take time from the constantinople testbed.\r\n\r\nFrom a technical perspective that makes sense, but from a practical/political standpoint it doesn't. First off, by doing the issuance reduction first, you set the stage for a potential ASIC takeover in the intervening weeks/months. Also, segwit2x is very strong in my memory. Just because one faction of stakeholders supposedly \"agree\" to do something, once they get what they want, they no longer have any pressing need to do the thing that they've obviously signaled they don't particularly care for. \r\n\r\nTo be completely frank, the dismissive attitude of the developers prior to the increasing vocal opposition has burned any semblance of trust with the mining community. It's no longer credible to me that developers will support this change post-constantinople, where there would be no more pressure to do so. So I will continue to oppose and rally support to maintain the existing chain until it is confirmed to be  included along with the rest of the proposed changes. \r\n\r\nIt *IS* a necessity that it's tied to the same block.

    "body": "@AlexeyAkhunov \r\n_Premise 1: There are ASICs on the network that are more efficient than existing GPUs. Those ASICs likely also operate in big data centers with access to cheap electricity.\r\nPremise 2: Reducing issuance from 3 ETH to 2 ETH will cause a significant shift towards the more efficient machine (the ASIC)._\r\n**Conclusion: Switching from an ASIC/GPU mixed network to a GPU-only network causes less trouble, than to first switch to an ASIC-only network (that premise 1 and premise 2 imply) and then after a few months to a GPU-only network.**\r\n\r\nDo you agree?\r\n\r\n**PERSONAL OPINION:** I personally believe that when Constantinople rolls around and you do the issuance reduction and the hashrate drops by 30 something percent, the general feel amongst developers will just be: \"meh, hashrate dropped 30%, no big deal\", this would likely drag the implementation out by a couple months, if not to the Istanbul HF.\r\nTaking issuance reduction out will incentivize the devs to keep working on ProgPOW until it is implemented.\r\n\r\nAs Martin has said on the call (and if I understood it correctly), technically it will be feasible to implement it in a fast manner (into Constantinople) but politically/governance-wise it's a problem. I ask: why?\r\nAlmost everyone agrees that ProgPOW will decentralize the Ethereum network and some people say technically it's not too hard to implement, so why let politics come in the way of technical innovation?\r\n\r\nThe 2 best ways forward:\r\n1. Push Constantinople out 1 month (or whatever time is needed, if any additional time is even needed) and implement ProgPOW into Constantinople.\r\n2. Take issuance reduction out of Constantinople and implement ProgPOW in a separate ProgPOW HF.",

By doing so they would significantly reduce the viability of ETH mining to the majority of the smaller miners, thereby increasing centralization by concentrating power within large farms, particularly ASIC farms.\r\n\r\nThe reason they are tied together is very straightforward - the issuance reduction significantly threatens small to medium sized GPU miners, and because ProgPoW takes ASICs off the table it is supportive of small GPU miners. So it balances out.",

    "body": "And may I quote the Ethereum Whitepaper at this point:\r\n\r\n> The Bitcoin mining algorithm works by having miners compute SHA256 on slightly modified versions of the block header millions of times over and over again, until eventually one node comes up with a version whose hash is less than the target (currently around 2192). However, this mining algorithm is vulnerable to two forms of centralization. First, the mining ecosystem has come to be dominated by ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits), computer chips designed for, and therefore thousands of times more efficient at, the specific task of Bitcoin mining. This means that Bitcoin mining is no longer a highly decentralized and egalitarian pursuit, requiring millions of dollars of capital to effectively participate in. Second, most Bitcoin miners do not actually perform block validation locally; instead, they rely on a centralized mining pool to provide the block headers. This problem is arguably worse: as of the time of this writing, the top three mining pools indirectly control roughly 50% of processing power in the Bitcoin network, although this is mitigated by the fact that miners can switch to other mining pools if a pool or coalition attempts a 51% attack.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Whitepaper, ASIC-resistance provides decentralization to the network, the very foundation of any credible cryptocurrency. If it is threatened, the very first priority is to defend the foundation of said cryptocurrency. If nothing is done, and the argument of \"PoS is coming\" is constantly parroted, it would have made sense to just choose SHA256 from the beginning, because back then it was also known that \"PoS is coming soon\". Obviously Ethereum didn't do that and chose to go the way of decentralization and I hope the EF will protect one of Ethereum's most valuable features until PoS is implemented.",

I think many here , are doing really great job, delivering best of their work and so on. But if we look at this whole Etherium as a whole from distance. Its become bigger and it is full of everything. It comes with solutions for future, mechanisms, community, everything... also fear. There is no single person whos responsible for all what happens right? Every one bring 1 piece of their knowledge to something whats called \"soup?\" It is good to talk about facts , and what is likely to happen. If we look at those facts, and drop the fear factor for sec and not blame anyone for anything.  There is a possibility of Asic invasion and loads of problems, if issuance reduction is turned on without Progpow. Fact right? Is it worth testing how its going to be? If aiming for shiny future, should there be elimination of every \"maybes\" on way to get there?",

Only after big community outlash and tons of heated arguments they seem to have gotten more interested.\r\nI'm sure the ETH devs are very fine people but I think there's not enough understanding about the severe consequences of hashrate centralization and it's probably the most pressing problem for the project right now.\r\n\r\nWith regards to issuance reduction my argument stands outlined above. It's all about having a smooth switch, which is best achieved when issuance reduction + ProgPOW go hand in hand.\r\nBy doing it separately you will have 2 problems instead of 0\r\nProblem 1: switching to issuance reduction-only chain might split the chain into ASIC chain and GPU chain 1\r\nProblem 2: switching ASIC-only chain to ProgPOW chain will cause another split and possible intense manufacturer propaganda\r\nYou end up with 3 chains: old chain, ASIC chain and ProgPOW chain\r\n\r\nIf it's going hand in hand:\r\nASIC/GPU-mixed chain straight to the ProgPOW chain, manufacturers will continue mining on the old chain and will maybe get politically involved anyway, maybe not (in the case of Monero Bitmain created Monero Classic (XMC, it's real look it up) but it's a dead shitcoin nobody cares about. But since the manufacturers are not developing the project any further it will quickly become apparent they're only mining it to dump it on the markets, which will result in a quick inevitable death.

I have not seen ProgPOW mentioned anywhere until perhaps couple of weeks ago (perhaps I was looking in the wrong places, I am sorry), so I was completely unaware it was even a thing. I wonder what was the reason for the gap May - September. Do you think Ethereum Core Developers are to blame for that? I suspect they were quite busy with preparing Constantinople EIPs and improving the clients, and the go implementation of ProgPOW appeared only very recently. \"Ms If\" said on that meeting back in May that their team was going to make implementations and core devs will be looking at them. Isn't this what is happening now? Were the implementations ready before and everyone was ignoring them? \"Ms If\" also mentioned that education was missing, and now the education is happening.\r\n\r\nSo I am not very happy with the presumption of mutual distrust and neglect. Lets apply critical thinking instead",
