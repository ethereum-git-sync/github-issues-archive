    "body": "We have brainstormed yesterday together with @timbeiko @parithosh @marioevz @MariusVanDerWijden and other members from the JavaScript team ( @jochem-brouwer @g11tech @acolytec3 @gabrocheleau ) on how a future post-Shandong testnet landscape could look like as we are getting closer to Shanghai.\r\n\r\nOne outcome was that we will deprecate Shandong in favor of a follow-up Shanghai testnet decided upon on ACD. The JavaScript team could then start a new testnet `eof-devnet-0` focusing primarily on EOF (suggestion was to also include Shanghai EIPs EIP-3651 \"Warm Coinbase\", EIP-3855 \"Push0\", EIP-3860 \"Limit and meter initcode\" as some base line), Shandong also already had some heavy EOF focus.\r\n\r\nI would like to discuss in the call if this aligns well with the interests and wants of the Ipsilon team and other EOF involved devs and - if the general idea is welcomed - a potential timeline and launch setup (we would have the full round of the 5 EOF EIPs ready by mid January and could then either do a all-at-once or one-by-one testnet launch).",

    "body": "> IMO we should be looking at launching EOF testnets within the next 2 weeks.\r\n\r\nWe won't have our implementations for the remaining 3 EOF EIPs ready by then, so this could not be a Lodestar/EthereumJS-run testnet then, we could nevertheless help on setting up a Geth-only testnet with our gained Shandong experience and then join with EthereumJS - also other clients - later on. An alternative would be to launch in early January - not sure if would be that much lost by this delay since there is Christmas + Holidays in between anyhow. Then we could also start with Geth, EthereumJS, potentially/eventually other clients as well.\r\n\r\nLet's discuss in the call tomorrow, looking forward to the exchange! ðŸ™‚ ",
