    "body": "[From the previous call's agenda issue:](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/675#issuecomment-1368179239)\r\n\r\n> Could we add a brief discussion/note on tests? Currently, the EOF EIPs are changing rather fast (weekly, if not faster). There are test PRs open in ethereum/tests. However, these are \"useless\": it is unknown on whatever spec of the EIP these tests were generated, thus it is unknown if another client fails the tests if these are really faulty, or, if tests pass, if they are actually valid. If tests are published, an explicit mention/definition to whatever spec of the EIP which is implemented should be noted in these tests.\r\n\r\n> This would help the ecosystem a lot. There are many clients currently which have (internal) tests regarding these EIPs. I find myself writing tests on my own to test against the spec. But this is essentially doing work multiple times: if I want to implement EIP X at version y, and if a client already has tests for that specific EIP and that specific version, then I should be able to just \"copy\" those tests and test against it.",
