    "body": "Another thing to consider for Deneb:\r\n* https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/3175 -- it started as a small change to `compute_proposer_index` function, but it appears that the complexity of this fix is a bit bigger as with the change to `compute_proposer_index` we can't use `get_beacon_proposer_index` inside of `process_operations` anymore as any slashing would change the output of this function. So, `slash_validator`, `process_attestation` and `process_sync_aggregate` undergoes small changes as well.\r\n\r\nThe probability of missing proposal because of a single slashing is trivial. While it increases significantly in the case of correlated slashing, for instance, 10% of slashed validators results in ~1 missed proposal per epoch on average.",
