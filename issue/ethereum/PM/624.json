I posted about this on [EthMagicians](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/shanghai-core-eip-consideration/10777/40?u=timbeiko) yesterday, but in short I think it's important we restart the calls with client teams sharing where they are at, what they see as priorities, etc. before opening the floor up to the various EIP champions. This way, we can have these discussions with a bit more context. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure we'll have time at the end of this call to actually get into in, but I'd expect the call after to be mostly dedicated to this. If you, or other EIP champions, want to attend and possibly discuss the EIP at the end of the call, happy to add it to the agenda. If you'd rather be \"sure\" it gets discussed, then I think scheduling it for the call after is probably best. ",

So we will need to traverse and represent the control-flow graph in time and space near-linear in the size of the original code.  If we succeed at that we will soon-enough need to compile the resulting expanded EVM code to machine code in one pass.\r\n\r\nDynamic jumps defeat all of these requirements -- in their presence the control-flow graph can take quadratic time and space to traverse and represent.  There are proposals to be rid of them, most of them tagged as [Shanghai candidates](https://ethereum-magicians.org/tag/shanghai-candidate).\r\n\r\n[EIP-2315: : Simple Subroutines for the EVM](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2315), together with [EIP-4200: Static relative jumps](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4200),  deprecates JUMP and JUMPI and provides for subroutines and static jumps to replace them.\r\n\r\n[EIP-4750: EOF - Functions](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4750) together with EIP-4200 and the other [Ipsilon EIPs](https://twitter.com/teamipsilon/status/1565292837079597056?s=21.) would also do the job.\r\n \r\nAs currently specified EIP-4750 inhibits inter-procedural optimization of the EVM code because it allows for only one function per code section.  So I've proposed an extension to EIP-4750 that expands code sections from Functions to [Modules](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/4919), but we haven't discussed it much yet.  I think we have yet to converge on the best design.  I have my preferences, but after so many years of effort am open to _any_ design that does the job.",

I just updated the agenda to include everything proposed. @ineffectualproperty, @gcolvin, my plan was to use the next ACD to have open discussions about EIPs and have this one focused on client teams sharing their updates and views of what priorities should be. I've added both your EIPs to the end of the agenda, but realistically, with the long list of other topics to cover, I doubt we'll have time to get to them tomorrow. Letting you know so you don't waste 2h of your time in case you'd rather just come to the next call! ",
