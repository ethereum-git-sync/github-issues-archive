I do not think most of core devs that join the call are necessarily \"championing\" EIP-1559, so it is a bit unfair to ask them to adjudicate political issues like that. Yes, it is political, and important issue, but not sure what is expected from Core Devs on the call? They cannot commit either way on behalf of all people who are for and against EIP-1559, so having this on ACD is just going to make everyone frustrated and disappointed. If they are looking for some kind of pronouncement from Hudson or Tim, this pronouncement can be made in a different place\r\n",

I would want to hear from HODLers as well as someone with real market and economic experience to give assurance it wouldn't wind up making things worse for all stake holders, miners included.",
