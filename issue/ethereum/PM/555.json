    "body": "I'd like to (briefly) discuss the complexity of adding a signature to the [builder-specs getHeader request](https://ethereum.github.io/builder-specs/#/Builder/getHeader).\r\n\r\nContext: [auction - should (header,bid) messages be publicly accessible during the message passing period? mev-boost#112](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost/issues/112)\r\n\r\n* With signature, relays could reveal the builder bid only to the proposer, enabling a sealed-bid auction where builders are not aware of each other's bids, leading to bids on the high end. A sealed-bid auction seems strictly superior.\r\n* Without signature, it's an open auction where builders are incentivised to bid low initially, and outbid each other by small amounts. If we try to mitigate this on the relay by allowing only a single bid per builder per slot, then there's a strong first-mover disadvantage.\r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\n1. What's the amount of work needed?\r\n2. Should we consider adding this now rather than making this breaking change soon after the merge? \r\n\r\nAfter the merge it will require a new API endpoint (version) in the builder-specs (one with and one without signature), and running both endpoints on the relays for some migration period.",

The full checkpoint state is relatively small and bound (e.g. ~50MB) so if a user is already having to get a root out of band, they might as well just get the state and save the p2p complexity (IMO).\r\n\r\nTo download a state from p2p, a user would still need to provide a root out-of-band. So if state or root, the user needs to get it from some authority (or multiple), some node they *trust*, or some other source.\r\n\r\nThat said, just pointing to infura is not the proper end goal and we can and should do better.
