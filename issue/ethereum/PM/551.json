I certainly missed someone/somewhere, apologies.\r\n\r\nI think that Friday nights and Saturday mornings should be treated with the utmost respect, these times are widely accepted to be personal time for social and family events. I argue that infringing on personal time will increase burn-out in our community. Furthermore, scheduling meetings at a time when many cultures normalize alcohol consumption seems like a recipe for poor attendance and engagement from those timezones.\r\n\r\nI think this is low-hanging fruit for the Ethereum community to start to address its timezone inclusion issues.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nEDIT: I'm proposing *future* calls should happen earlier, not this particular call :sweat_smile: \r\nEDIT 2: I'm also open to the change happening after `n` more sessions at this time.",

What I meant is that `lvh` should be returned to `newPayload/fcU` if during `SYNCING` client encounters an invalid payload in the chain it is syncing with. This requires parsing and keeping additional information in memory",
