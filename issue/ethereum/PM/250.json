I wrote up a doc with some of the key ones, though there are certainly others (as well as those outside the EVM proper, like for example moving block structure to SSZ and changing the state tree) that are also arguably worth doing. The portion of applications that would need to be rewritten as a result of these changes is quite small, but it is nevertheless nonzero.\r\n\r\nIt would be good to start talking about this earlier, so that any such changes can be on developers' radar with as long a lead-time as possible.\r\n\r\nhttps://hackmd.io/@HWeNw8hNRimMm2m2GH56Cw/evm_feature_removing",

I think that could make sense, but I would go around it the following way:\r\n1. Introduce new jump instructions which take relative offsets, such as `RJUMP <offset>` and `RJUMPI <offset> <condition>` (R for relative) where offset is a signed value.\r\n2. Change the specification of the current `JUMP <offset>` to `RJUMP <offset - PC>`\r\n3. Remove PC over time, as it is not needed.\r\n\r\nAfter that we can argue that dynamic jumps would not be needed to accomplish your use case, and everything could be static relative jumps.\r\n",
