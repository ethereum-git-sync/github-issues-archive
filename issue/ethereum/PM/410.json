  "body": "[EIP-4399](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-4399.md) proposes to supplant `DIFFICULTY` opcode with `RANDOM` opcode that returns the output of the randomness beacon provided by the beacon chain.\r\n\r\nThis EIP is important to be included into the scope of the Merge as it allows to avoid breaking changes with respect to the way the `DIFFICULTY` opcode is utilized today. Namely, return value of the `DIFFICULTY` opcode accompanied with other inputs is used by smart contracts as a common pattern to get randomness. As the number of the opcode stays the same this EIP prevents backward incompatibilities on the EVM byte code level which means that existing smart contracts that utilize `DIFFICULTY` to obtain randomness won't be broken.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, a beacon chain randomness is exposed in the EVM. Outputs of the beacon chain randomness should be considered as a more strong outputs than either the difficulty or the block hash of the PoW network.",
