    "body": "So that conversation starts off with Hudson saying.\r\n\r\nHudson: I'm having reservations on how open the meeting on the 30th should be, we said we wanted it to be private, but I think maybe it should be more open. Here are some options...\" notes taken, published, livestreamed, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter some further discussion, with no plausible reasons  given for keeping it closed \r\n\r\n(other than Alexy's concern about his research being used in bad faith, which he more recently said that he no longer has concerns about  https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/ethereum-state-rent-for-eth-1-x-pre-eip-document/2018/6?u=hershy)\r\n\r\nGreg and Alexy said this:\r\n\r\nGreg: Once there are meetings across groups, it shouldn't be secret\r\nPress will report whatever they can find, it won't be complete or accurate\r\n\r\nAlexey: If no one else is arguing for it to be closed, let's make it open\r\n\r\nAfter a little more discussion, Hudson sums up thusly:\r\n\r\nHudson: For now, meeting on 30th is not closed but may be closed to anyone but core devs\r\nNotes may or may not be released\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, the consensus in the room, absolutely was not that the call should be closed. The conversation ends with a \"for now it is open\" (with the both-sides-of-the-fence caveat/disclaimer that it \"may be closed\".). And now we find out that it has in fact been changed to closed.\r\n\r\nThat reversal of the \"for now it is open\" must have come after the call last Friday. So, again I ask:\r\n\r\nBeing that the consensus on that all devs call was that the call should be 'open' (or at least recorded), what lead to the decision being reversed?\r\n",

I'm all for shining light :)\r\n\r\n@Souptacular said multiple times on the call last week that the meeting would be open only to core devs and researchers (\"open\" here means open to the usual attendees of the all core devs meetings, i.e., \"core devs\" somewhat loosely and subjectively defined), that it would not be livestreamed/recorded, and that notes will be taken and may or may not be shared.\r\n\r\nI intend to respect his wishes, but I will bring this topic up at the start of the call for brief discussion to ensure we have consensus on this point.",
