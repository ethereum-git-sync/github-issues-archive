Some work has already been done on these besides writing the specs, @wemeetagain is already implementing the first proposal in Lodestar. I also have a testing tool on a Geth branch that validates the implementation of these proposed endpoints.\r\nI suppose people mostly care about Capella these days but API standardization can be a long process so I'd like to start this as a parallel thread :)",
