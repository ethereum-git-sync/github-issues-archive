We're generating distinct values with a small exception - withdrawals. I discussed with @g11tech that this situation is not possible to happen. I mean\r\n```\r\n1. Timestamp = A, PrevRandao = X, SuggestedFee = Y and Withdrawals = B, HeadHash = C\r\n2. Timestamp = A, PrevRandao = X, SuggestedFee = Y and Withdrawals = Z,  HeadHash = C \r\n```\r\nHowever, it sounds like it is possible with Nimbus combos, so we will prepare fix",

    "body": "> That's true. We're generating distinct values with a small exception - withdrawals. I discussed with @g11tech that this situation is not possible to happen. I mean\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> 1. Timestamp = A, PrevRandao = X, SuggestedFee = Y and Withdrawals = B, HeadHash = C\r\n> 2. Timestamp = A, PrevRandao = X, SuggestedFee = Y and Withdrawals = Z,  HeadHash = C \r\n> ```\r\n\r\nwell it should not be possible with any CL since withdrawals is a matter of state unless nimbus is not mapping timestamp with the slot (which for e.g. lodestar does)\r\n\r\nI would like to understand when can two fcUs have everything same except the withdrawals.",
