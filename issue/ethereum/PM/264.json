  "body": "The discussion around EIP-2315 and Berlin (see https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/263) has raised questions about updating EIP statuses as we move EIPs through the network upgrade process. \r\n\r\nWe want more community awareness about EIPs as they get closer to being included in an upgrade, and subsequently deployed on testnets & mainnet so that any issues are raised early in the process. \r\n\r\nBerlin's EIPs currently range from being in DRAFT to REVIEW and LAST CALL, despite blocks having been set for the upgrade. \r\n\r\nOne proposal on discord was to only allow EIPs to be brought up on AllCoreDevs after they have the REVIEW status. Historically, we've also moved EIPs to LAST CALL when blocks were set for upgrades. We could potentially move this earlier in the process (ex: when an EIP is decided to be included in an upgrade). Other suggestions are welcome! \r\n\r\n",

Their process for deciding whether to encode it into their clients as part of a hard fork is not part of the EIP process.\r\n\r\nThe wording above (\"This status signals that material changes are unlikely\")  is *similar* to that of review and last call of [today's EIP-1](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/f1ded2aa9bd7bf52cb7d9dd023d80a9fb7ecebc7/EIPS/eip-1.md):\r\n> Review - An EIP Author marks an EIP as ready for and requesting Peer Review.\r\n>\r\n> Last Call - This is the final review window for an EIP before moving to FINAL. An EIP editor will assign Last Call status and set a review end date (review-period-end), typically 14 days later.\r\n\r\nWhile it is not written down anymore (where should it be written done in the first place?), one would assume that Review or Last Call would be an appropriate status for something considered for a hard fork.",

I've always been advocating changing the status to _Review_ once approved by the ACD and also mentioned it in the core devs meetings.  I make sure to specifically talk about the \"Status\" on the [PEEPanEIP](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cwHXAawZxqu0PKKyMzG_3BJV_xZTi1F) but I think, we've to be more aggressive on creating awareness about the new process. \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29681685/110016842-84181500-7cf3-11eb-8994-cc3947e1bcc5.png)\r\n\r\nI hope we all make an effort to follow the process and avoid landing in such a situation in the future.

Or are you just still early in the process and haven't published something \"officially\" and things are still in discussion or in flow?",

(Ref: [EIP-2378](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2378))\r\n\r\nFrom the EIPIP meeting, the original proposal of _Selection of EIPs for network upgrade_ was updated and [proposed](https://github.com/poojaranjan/Ethereum-EIPs/blob/39181e8d376264d948963b33448a77fa38298164/EIPsForHardfork.md) CFI to be in two steps  - applied, approved. \r\n\r\n**Consider for Inclusion (CFI) applied** is the first stage to signal that a proposal is aspiring for the upcoming network upgrade. \r\n\r\n**CFI approved**: This lists EIPs that obtain rough consensus by clients, and with the submission of well-formed PR, it will be considered by the Core Developers. Clients may independently start implementing the proposals at their convenience. This can be tracked in the [Eth1.0 spec project board](https://github.com/ethereum/eth1.0-specs/projects/1).\r\n\r\nSplitting EIP & Network upgrade process was a long discussion. You may catch up on some last discussion [here](https://youtu.be/fl5MOhbipgY&t=450s) that led to the current process, which is open to continuous improvement. \r\n\r\nHaving said that, the network upgrade process is documented in a blog - [Shedding light on the Ethereum Network Upgrade Process](https://medium.com/ethereum-cat-herders/shedding-light-on-the-ethereum-network-upgrade-process-4c6186ed442c). It has a simple definition for the terms used in the above diagrams. \r\n\r\nNote: The blog will be updated after the ACD meeting if there is no objection to the changes agreed in the last EIPIP meeting. \r\n\r\n(I'll be happy to take more questions related to the EIP standardization process and Network upgrade process if that helps. )",

    "body": "@poojaranjan ah, I honestly thing a blog is not the right format for this. Respectively - otherwise framed - it's great that you are doing this blog to educate on people but this definitely also needs some written down specification. A blog post just won't work as a solid and stable reference with a specification one can get orientation from and where PRs can be targeted against to improve on the specs.\r\n\r\nSorry for this right-out criticism - I am generally more cautious on stuff like this - but when thinking a bit more about this now I get very much convinced that this is *THE* blocker hindering the `EIPIP` process to fully enfold its potential. For me as a dev this just doesn't feel \"existing\" in such a floating format, compared to the specs written down in e.g. the `eth1.0-specs` repo or also the [EIP-1](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1.md) specification.",

It is a better candidate for a Meta EIP (Process EIP) rather than a blog. \r\n\r\nThe process was proposed and [being iterated as a Meta EIP](https://github.com/poojaranjan/Ethereum-EIPs/blob/39181e8d376264d948963b33448a77fa38298164/EIPsForHardfork.md). \r\n\r\nWhile the decoupling of the EIP standardization & Network upgrade process was taking place, another decision was taken - **to keep everything related to the network upgrade out of the EIP GitHub repo**. It was then decided to add a part of the proposal to the [readme section of Eth1.0 spec](https://github.com/ethereum/eth1.0-specs#network-upgrade-process---eth10-specification) and details to be published in form of a blog. And thus the [Pull Request](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/1929) documenting the process as a Meta EIP could never be merged. \r\n\r\nFrom a developers' point of view, I agree that having more information in GitHub would be helpful. I think it's a good suggestion to add more info to the Readme section.",
