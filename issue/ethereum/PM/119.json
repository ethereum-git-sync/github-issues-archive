    "body": "I'd like to bring up hardfork naming as an agenda point. It seems that the fork after Istanbul is already being planned during these calls and I think it would make sense naming that fork and avoiding referring to them as \"istanbul part 1 and part 2\" (or \"phase 1 and phase 2\").\r\n\r\n[Here on Ethereum Magicians](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/more-frequent-smaller-hardforks-vs-less-frequent-larger-ones/2929/33) I proposed to go with Devcon city names.\r\n\r\nHaving thought about this today, I think this is a reasonable suggestion:\r\n1) It is unlikely that anytime soon we run out of names.\r\n2) It removes the risk of bike shedding names for many forks to come.\r\n\r\nExpanding on 1):\r\n- If we end up upgrading every 12(+) months (which seems to be the case so far), then we'll never run out of names to chose from.\r\n- If we end up upgrading every 6 months (which is the hope of many), then we'll run out of names in >5 years. Plenty of time to come up with a new naming scheme in time.\r\n- If we end up upgrading every 3 months (which I think is unfeasible unless a major shift occurs in how forks are deployed), then we'll run out of names in 21 months after Istanbul, assuming 7 upgrades were deployed. I'd call this *a bit unrealistic*.\r\n\r\nThe above of course assumes that Devcons continue to take place every year.  In the unlikely case that Devcons won't be organized in the future, there would be still plenty of time (as shown above) to agree on a new naming scheme.\r\n\r\n(Perhaps a bit prematurely, but I did create meta file named Berlin back in May: [EIP-2070](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/2070))",

If we go with other proposed routes, then we don't have time to carry out security audit. That is, I agree with what @karalabe said on this comment (https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/2200#issuecomment-521571942).",

I'm not sure this gives us a lot because the particular number is less important than the fact we introduce a weird behavior. But on theoretical level it depends on the interpretation what \"calls with stipend only are safe\" mean.\r\n- if \"reentry is not possible\" we can go with 1600,\r\n- if \"the callee cannot change its state\" then 2300 should stay.\r\n\r\nIn case of 1600, it should be defined as `stipend_gas - call_gas` so we don't have to update the spec in case we'd lake to change the `call_gas` in future.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I don't have strong preferences. 2300 is slightly simpler and safer, 1600 is more user friendly because chance of this exception to happen in practice is lower.",
