    "body": "Food for thought about the postponing:\r\n\r\nIndependent of what the actual fix to SSTORE will be, we'll have an issue that the original rule set is already active on Ropsten and Rinkeby under the name Constantinople (not sure about Kovan and the other PoA networks). If we change the meaning of the Constantinople fork to some new feature set, it will be a mess wrt the testnets. Clients (at least Geth for sure) would need to introduce further splitting logic to differentiate between testnet-constantinople and mainnet-constantinople (which still messes up privatenet-constatinople, needing some user configurability). \r\n\r\nMy alternative suggestion - that would keep the fork semantics clean - is to keep the Constantinople feature set as it is currently and introduce whatever fix we dream up in an Istanbul fork. Ropsten and Rinkeby can fork a second time (they must either way, otherwise the EVM on the testnet will behave differently than on mainnet), and mainnet can do a double fork Constantinople + Istanbul at the same block.\r\n\r\nThis would allow mainnet and the testnets to keep the same semantic meaning of the named forks. It's also the classical fork procedure we've always done, so every client will support it without any extra code modifications or behavioral splitting needed. Furthermore it would also allow us to keep all the existing Constantinople tests and just extend the suite with a new fork, instead of remaking everything.",

    "body": "@naikmyeong Not sure we're talking about the same Istanbul. My proposition is analogous to renaming `Constantinople` to `Constantinople 1` and have the fix in `Constantinople 2`, where testnets only need to apply `Constantinople 2` now, but mainnet would apply both 1 and 2 at the same block.\r\n\r\nHowever, to avoid the naming confusion of `Constantinople 1` and `Constantinople 2` after clients already defined what `Constantinople` means, my recommendation is to keep `Constantinople 1` as `Constantinople` and use a meaningful name for `Constantinople 2`, which can be either `Istanbul` or anything else really. \r\n\r\nMy suggestion has nothing to do with any previously discussed hard forks that were named `Istanbul`.",

Timeline for new fork?\r\n     - I personally strongly recommend picking a date on this call, based on what is determined in point 1\r\n     - Most armchair estimates range between 2-6 weeks\r\n     - If devs could be fairly explicit in the things that affect this timeline, would help on comms side, especially if timeline is longer rather than shorter (e.g. tests need to be re-written, testnets need to be dealt with, etc.)\r\n\r\n3. How did this happen? Why wasn't it detected sooner?\r\n    - Who is owning creation of a more thorough retrospective? Timeline? Where can people contribute?\r\n    - Can be very brief, or can be more in depth on call and discuss the good/bad/ugly of what happened. \r\n     - Request for comments on any things that should be included in retrospective (general or specific)\r\n     - https://github.com/ethereum-cat-herders/hard-fork-checklist/issues/1\r\n\r\n4.
