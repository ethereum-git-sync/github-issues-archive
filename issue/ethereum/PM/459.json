On the last call (and quickly after on discord), there seemed to be strong consensus about moving forward with the 3 original EOF EIPs (3540, 3670, 3860), and that was main motivation to include them for consideration on the call. \r\n\r\nThere are a lot of EIPs considered for Shanghai, and we realistically can't do everything, so I think we need to think hard about what we prioritize and how we make sure to not pre-commit to too many things when The Merge is still a WIP. This large set of competing EIPs is what prompted the [original discussion](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/436#issuecomment-1003091709) and I think it's important we get the big picture right before making too many decisions.

Can the new transaction format be used for verification of ZKR batches? If not, and the proofs need to be on the execution layer, EIP-4488 still has its place. \r\n\r\nConsider the most active ZKR today, dYdX: ~80% of costs are batch verification costs, and only ~20% is transaction data. [Brendan from Polygon Zero estimates](https://twitter.com/_bfarmer/status/1471175459593498634) 4488 can drop their verification costs from to <250K gas, and [Bobbin estimates Polygon Miden's ](https://twitter.com/bobbinth/status/1469009030492291073)STARK verification to drop from 5M to <1M gas. In the same thread, [Liron from StarkWare](https://twitter.com/HaymanLiron/status/1469008436817977360) notes that this will reduce dYdX gas costs to sub-100 gas (~500 gas today; only making transaction data cheaper it'll still be around ~400 gas). \r\n\r\nBesides that, EIP-4488 is definitely still simpler. All of this to say: I don't think EIP-4488 should be replaced; rather it should be implemented as soon as possible (IMO it's an emergency that justifies own fork between The Merge & Shanghai - and by this time I'd expect rollups to be more mature too), with the blob transactions rolled out later. EIP-4488 may continue to benefit ZK rollups even after there's dedicated space for transaction data. It'd also make sense to have EIP-4488 first, and then directly go to the more complex version that's more easily forward compatible with danksharding (though I don't understand the technical differences between the simpler version).

If not, and the proofs need to be on the execution layer, EIP-4488 still has its place.\r\n\r\nYes, it can. Basically, you have to use a [proof of equivalence](https://ethresear.ch/t/easy-proof-of-equivalence-between-multiple-polynomial-commitment-schemes-to-the-same-data/8188) to prove that some commitment in the ZKR's particular proof system commits to the same data as the blob KZG (verifying this does NOT require access to the actual blob, only the commitment and one more BLS point as a proof). Then you can do the rest of the ZKR proof as you would normally, knowing that the data the proof is operating over is available.",
