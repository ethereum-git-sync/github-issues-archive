    "body": "There is always a trade off between cost of not getting something perfectly right and the cost of inaction or delay.  1559 is only effective if it's coupled with an actual hard fork.  Unfortunately at the moments these are two different discussions.  I suggest making this EIP some kind of pivotal issue with higher priority as is directly related to the viability and continued success of Ethereum.  So as an agenda item, perhaps a discussion of how soon this should get on the mainnet and how perfectionist we should be?  Many believe a little bit of hurry is needed. ",
