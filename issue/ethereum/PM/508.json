    "body": "In testnet plans we could discuss how we can mitigate a few risks. Of course, the main risk is bugs, and I believe that the sooner we start forking public testnets longer the time we should observe it. Two additional points:\r\n1. All our devnets/shadowforks are controlled by one man-our wizard - @parithosh. Is it worth starting devnet with something closer to public tesnet in terms of validators control? Or should we try it on a real testnet like Sepolia?\r\n2. Misconfiguration. In every hardfork, we've observed some amounts of nodes that were forgotten to upgrade (let's say X). All previous hardforks were significantly less demanding for node operators. Now node operator needs to do a few things:\r\n    a) Upgrade EL\r\n    b) Upgrade CL\r\n    c) Configure JWT Secret between clients\r\n    d) Make sure that there is a connection between clients.\r\nIn theory, people can train it on Kiln, and we can mitigate it with correct announcements and documentation. However, in practice, I believe that longer public testnets will reduce the number X for the next testnet and later for the mainnet. People need to get used to running Ethereum nodes with two apps. From my observation, the configuration was a bit confusing even for devs and technical people (especially JWT/ports in the beginning).\r\n  ",
