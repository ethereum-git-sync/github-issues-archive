I was not on ACD call 90 but after listening to it in its entirety it seemed to get bogged down focusing on solutions without first giving the problem space adequate exploration.  I'm hoping that we can achieve the following.\r\n\r\n- loose understanding of the \"client diversity problem\".\r\n    - What are the areas that have problems?\r\n- general consensus on what things specifically need to be fixed?\r\n    - are people already actively working any of them?\r\n    - are there problems that nobody is focused on (and which we think someone should).  Why isn't anyone working on these thing?\r\n- general consensus on how we move forward\r\n    - what are we in control of fixing, what do we have agency over?\r\n    - how can we support this work?  \r\n    - how can we collaborate more efficiently?\r\n\r\nI have no shortage of opinions about this subject.  I'd encourage [reading this](https://ethresear.ch/t/applying-the-five-whys-to-the-client-diversity-problem/7628) if you are interested in my thoughts on the subject.",

    "body": "Quick announcement: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1057.md will be ready for review on this call two weeks hence, want to reach consensus on status two weeks after that.  Current proposal is as follows.\r\n\r\n## Simple Summary\r\n\r\nA new Proof-of-Work algorithm to replace Ethash that utilizes almost all parts of commodity GPUs.\r\n\r\nWe **Do Not** recommend that this Proposal be deployed at this time.  Rather it is being offered in the spirit of [Ben DiFrancesco's compromise](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-progpow-compromise-pre-proposal/4057) which for our purposes we state simply as,\r\n* This Proposal **is not** being proposed for deployment in any planned hardfork.\r\n* This Proposal should be fully implemented and tested across major clients.\r\n* Clients implementing this Proposal should be deployed and maintained on a testnet.\r\n\r\nThis leaves open the possibility and threat of future deployment.",

    "body": "As mentioned on the call, we (the Quilt team) have put together an Account Abstraction Playground, which you can find [here](https://github.com/quilt/account-abstraction-playground).\r\n\r\nIt bundles our MVP account abstraction implementation in geth with a forked version of solidity with basic AA support and some example contracts, as well as a step-by-step tutorial for getting started. I would recommend to anyone interested to take a look - playing around with AA is really quite interesting.\r\n\r\nAnd to reiterate: This playground is not intended to address the valid questions around AA feasibility. We are still investigating these and will have a dedicated writeup once that's done.\r\n",
