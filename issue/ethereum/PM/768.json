Should ACDE signal support for various designs, or not?  What happens if ACDE proposes support for a for a particular policy and a L2 ignores it or mis-implements it?\r\n\r\nOne example to compare to is the [\"Training Wheels\" schema](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/proposed-milestones-for-rollups-taking-off-training-wheels/11571) for L2s.  It was widely discussed on twitter and ethereum magicians, but I do not recall a formal topic on the agenda for this. \r\n\r\nI would recommend that the advocates for CSR follow a similar pattern and that it not be discussed on ACD, especially since we often fill the time and very relevant subjects are pushed off to the forum.  I don't feel we will be served well filling call time with non-L1 matters when subjects such as [Testnet lifecycles](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/proposal-predictable-ethereum-testnet-lifecycle/11575) got pushed out of consideration.",

    "body": "Agreed with that risk, @shemnon. It's all still very early, so hard to draw super strong boundaries when this is, I think?, the first \"L2 EIP\". That said, we've definitely pushed L1-adjacent items out of ACD (e.g. mev-boost), although it does bubble back up from time to time. \r\n\r\nI think one aspect where ACD can be helpful to a proposal like this is to discuss the technical soundness/potential issues (although it doesn't necessarily have to be on the call). That said, whether this is a good idea is a can of worms we probably should avoid on the call, especially given strong prior opposition to similar schemes for L1. \r\n\r\nI'm inclined to see how it goes, assuming we have time for it. Assuming we have even _more_ time, I think we should have this meta-conversation on the call for a bit too 😄 \r\n\r\nAs a final note, I think we definitely should make Testnet Lifecycles part of the considerations! It might get pushed out from time to time due to more urgent topics, but it's super important, and clearly affects core development. \r\n\r\n",
