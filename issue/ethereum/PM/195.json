We currently have several EIPs open now that introduce new transaction mechanisms and I think there is significant value in getting 2718 approved for inclusion by the Core Dev teams so we don't have to keep reinventing the wheel for each of these things that want to touch the transaction structure.\r\n\r\nIt would be *nice* to also see discussion on inclusion of [Sponsored, expiring and batch transactions](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2711) (2711) as it provides a number of benefits over the current transaction format, but I think this is less critical than 2718.\r\n\r\nFinally, if there is time I would also like to see discussion around [Rich Transactions](https://eips.ethereum.org/eip-2803) (2803).  2803 opens up possibilities for new contract design patterns that provide users with better UX and soft-breaks some anti-patterns that are often used (often in ponzi games and scams) (`isHuman` checks).",

It was mentioned in core devs chat that now it’s largely O(1) (gas price I assume), is it correct?\n\nI’ve mentioned an idea of “flash loan”-like transactions in a chat that would borrow some ETH from miner and then return a borrow after execution, and it would require mining software to relay execution and check for non-commutative behavior. Would it be an interesting direction to think about with potential benefits for end users?",
