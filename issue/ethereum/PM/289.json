The later has never been done before for any crypto currency. I found the admission in the EIP alarming that they have no idea what impact fee burning will have. I would have expected at least two seperate audits before 1559 was accepted since there are different security risks associated with those two.\r\n\r\n1559 lists four securiry concerns, none of which had formal audits, why? Also it may help to understand the guidelines (not sure there are any) if we can list EIPs that have been audited before in the past and why?

    "body": "> Why does the EIP not have a security process?\r\n\r\nEIPs have a security section. It's expected that EIPs are vetted in various discussion forums, and the implementations vetted, tested, audited, just like every single thing that ever touches how clients reach consensus. \r\n\r\n> Take EIP2929 for instance, these access lists could maybe lead to some very sophisticated behavior where an attacker can use the gas used after a message call to determine if a slot was already accessed in a prior call or not (I can't think of a case where this would be useful, but EIP2929 leaks some info on touched storage slots by the gas schedule, based upon if the slot was on the warm slots or not).\r\n\r\nYes. So do you think that behaviour is worse, from a security perspective, than the unbounded state growth which is a clear and present DoS vector against all nodes on the network? And if so, how come you have not raised this in the discussion-forums, or ACD channel or call? \r\n \r\n> I find it also disturbing to know that the YoloV3 testnet to test Berlin hardfork on did not include any EIP2315 (subroutines) transactions\r\n\r\n2315 was fuzzed _quite a lot_. It was also _again_ fuzzed in the first testnet. The idea behind the feature-testnets was to test the features, yolov3 focused on 2930 and 2929, which were new. We didn't focus on the non-features. I think the amount of people who actually sent transactions on yolov3 can be counted on one hand. With fingers to spare.  \r\n\r\n> In general I think we should move to a much more secure EIP process, where there are several stages of security considerations and upgrades in terms of testing (first some basic tests, then when two clients think they are OK, implement ethereum/tests, and also audit these tests to ensure that they cover each case).\r\n\r\nDoes that mean \"the geth team should set up more testnets, and the test-team should work harder\", or does it mean \"we'll take more responsibility for cross-client testing going forward\". \r\n\r\nSorry if I sound angry, I felt a bit personally attacked here, and I probably should have not responded right now. It's a bit annoying that when we do find issues, it's more or less \"ok, thanks, fixed, let's move on\", while when something slips through it's a lot of high and mighty outrage about \"the process\".

Can you elaborate more, perhaps provide some links to the formal audit reports and shed some light on the third party auditors and who funded the audits?\r\n\r\nWhen I did a google search for Ethereum audits I came up with this for 1057, could not find anything on 1559. [https://leastauthority.com/static/publications/LeastAuthority-ProgPow-Algorithm-Final-Audit-Report.pdf](https://leastauthority.com/static/publications/LeastAuthority-ProgPow-Algorithm-Final-Audit-Report.pdf)\r\n\r\nCan you provide a likewise audit of 1559?\r\n\r\nI also found 2.0 has been audited so that makes two audits that I know of, well actually only one for Eth 1.0\r\n[https://leastauthority.com/static/publications/LeastAuthority-Ethereum-2.0-Specifications-Audit-Report.pdf](https://leastauthority.com/static/publications/LeastAuthority-Ethereum-2.0-Specifications-Audit-Report.pdf)\r\n\r\nFound this on Discord 1559-fee-market\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37913635/113352739-eca9e000-92f9-11eb-810d-c67385705d02.png)\r\n\r\nPerhaps Micah has a great point. This is where the distrust of miners and the EIP process began and continues to this day with 1559 being implemented without the same dick move requiring an audit, using Micah's elegant words\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37913635/113353620-30e9b000-92fb-11eb-870f-7887058471e4.png)\r\n\r\nIt also seems there was money allocated for a formal audit from the grant @timbeiko was this ever done?\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37913635/113357126-af951c00-9300-11eb-9e79-32ef90478ccc.png)\r\n\r\n.",
