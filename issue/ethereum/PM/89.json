    "body": "**Update on working groups:**\r\n1. State Fees (rent) - I published first data from the stateless client prototype yesterday: https://medium.com/@akhounov/data-from-the-ethereum-stateless-prototype-8c69479c8abc. Next steps are outlined at the end of the article. This might come into the 4th version of the State Fees proposal\r\n\r\n2. Advanced sync protocol (Red Queen). Andrey has produced a modelling code that simulates the sync with 100 million accounts, and with 1 MiB/sec bandwidth the overhead (due to having to catch up with the current state) is around 20%. I am currently preparing some analysis on the probabilistic estimation of the contract sizes, which could help while syncing contract storage. In couple of weeks we will start prototyping the Red Queens in Turbo-Geth, to arrive at more accurate specification. Currently the description is here: https://github.com/yperbasis/silkworm/blob/master/doc/sync_protocol.pdf\r\nI am thinking of taking the sync protocol into a separate working group.\r\n\r\n 3. I would like to form a new working work on using the beacon chain as the finality gadget for Ethereum 1.x. First steps would be researching the biggest challenges for Beacon chain light client: https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eth2-in-eth1-light-clients/2880, and exploring whether we want to make it natively or virtualised using EVM/eWASM + precompiles.\r\n\r\n4. The probabilistic estimation of contract sizes can potentially be used to bring forward the change J (fixed prepayment for contract storage) from the 3rd version of the State Fees proposal. Currently, it requires knowing the number of storage items in a contract, but if we can efficiently approximate it, this change can be done in the first hard fork. The main benefit is that the increase in the Block Gas limit can be done straight after the 1st hard fork, and not the second.\r\n\r\n5. There might be ways to improve on the contract recovery schemes, I will research and introduce possible improvements into the 4th version of the State Fees proposal.\r\n\r\n6. I am also planning more research into the linear storage because it can integrate much better with eWASM engine (via memory mapping).\r\n\r\n**Update on Turbo-Geth:**\r\n\r\nStarted rebasing to go-ethereum. Currently managed to rebase Constantinopole/Petersburg changes, so that Turbo-Geth now sync past the hard fork. There was a lot of refactoring in go-ethereum lately, that would take a while for me to rebase to.\r\n",
