    "body": "For Berlin, I think what’s important is figuring out is this: \r\n1. When is Istanbul going live on mainnet? \r\n2. Based on that, do we want the next fork to be closed or open to new EIPs? In other words, is anything except the already [\"Tentatively Accepted\" EIPs](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2070) being considered? \r\n3. Based on both of those, do we want to move to either a [Train Station](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-train-station-model-for-network-upgrades/3721/5) or [EIP-Centric model](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-centric-forking/3536)? \r\n\r\nFrom my perspective, I see two likely ways this can go:\r\n1. Istanbul live before EOY, another small fork around April without new EIPs (basically EIP-1962, and maybe ProgPow or other \"Tentatively Accepted\" EIPs), and then we can aim for an October “whatever’s ready” HF. \r\n2. Istanbul early 2020, and an open HF mid-2020 (6 months later), where we add not only the Tentatively Accepted Berlin EIPs that make it to Accepted, but also other EIPs (i.e. the first bits of 1559). \r\n\r\nThere is also the option of moving straight to EIP-Centric forking after Istanbul. Personally, I find this a bit fast, given our previous cadence. I would rather see us getting good at doing progressively shorter forks (i.e. 1 year -> 6 months -> 3 months) over a period of time, rather than going straight to very short upgrades after only having 1+ year cycles.

    "body": "> basically EIP-1962\r\n\r\nIMO, Eip-1962 is _not_ ready. [1962](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1962). I missed the ACD where it was 'tentatively accepted', and I don't understand how that happened. It contains a _huge_ chunk of text, mostly opaque to non-cryptographers. Things like:\r\n\r\n> In the case of limited set of curve the following set is proposed as a minimal:\r\n>\r\n>    BN254 curve from the current version of Ethereum\r\n>    BN curve from DIZK with 2^32 roots of unity \r\n\r\nAn even more detailed spec is available though, [here](https://github.com/matter-labs/eip1962/blob/master/Specification.md). It's huge. You can skip towards the end, [General notices for implementation](https://github.com/matter-labs/eip1962/blob/master/Specification.md#general-notices-for-implementation), where they acknowledge that it's not feasible to expect consensus among clients:\r\n\r\n> \"Garbage in - garbase out\". While any valid implementation will give the same results on the same valid input parameters (that define a legitimate curve), caller can supply random values that would pass the ABI checks and gas estimations, but be meaningless in a sense of operations performed. Such input is called \"garbage\". It's not immediately clean whether or not different implementations will return the same output in this case. This is important for consensus between different implementations and there are two ways to resolve this issue:\r\n\r\nIf I understand correctly, they recommend using one reference client, which, if we were to implement this, I might actually think is the only sane approach. _BUT_ , doing so will force the same library to always be included in every future fork, also 2.0 execution environments (possibly ported to wasm at that time). \r\n\r\nAdding 1962 is basically adding a whole new virtual machine for cryptographic operations, and a _huge_ chunk of code that (I'm guessing) _none_ of the current maintainers of ethereum clients can meaningfully debug nor make sense of.  \r\n",
