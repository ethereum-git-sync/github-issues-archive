RIP 7212 finalised! - rollups that choose to do so can now deploy the secp256r1 precompile knowing that the specs won't change and there won't be an address conflict at 0x100\r\n2. Discussion of EIP-7587 - This EIP reserves the address range 0x100 - 0x1ff for use by RIPs, so we can deploy further precompiles in the future\r\n3.
