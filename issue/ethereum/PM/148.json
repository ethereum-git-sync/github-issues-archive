It should help drastically reduce bandwidth consumption across the entire network by allowing a proper tx propagation mechanism to be implemented vs. the current broadcast everything to everyone all the time.\r\n\r\nI've already posted it to the all core devs channel, people replying until now like it. Unless someone vehemently opposes, we'd like to roll it out in the next Geth release (no fork needed, only a backward compatible networking change).\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/2464.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nEdit: @cburgdorf suggested we do a separate (new) reply message instead of reusing the existing `Transactions` message. This keeps the protocol a bit more obvious and makes it easier to pile request IDs on top afterwards. Updated the EIP accordingly.",

We changed that in Geth too (and immediately got people complaining). Parity implements it as `null` too.\r\n\r\nI think the spec is wrong. While the notion of the pending block is indeed a bit weird, I think having the actual number in there is important, because transaction executions included in the pending block depend on number. Since they do have access to the number, that's contextual info **used** while building the pending block, so we shouldn't just swallow it to adhere to a random spec.",

All the operations I would imagine (Snarks, BLS signatures) have some pairing points hardcoded, so it’s not necessary to check for their subgroup as it can be done either separately (using multiplication) or off-chain. For large fields and groups such checks take 50% of computation time (e.g. MNT4-753 curve)\r\n\r\nUpdate:\r\n\r\nGo implementation [repo](https://github.com/saitima/eip1962)",
