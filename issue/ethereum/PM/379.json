    "body": "Followup on last week's discussion on EIP2046 - \r\n\r\nI brought this up as the scope of precompiles is growing for L2 and alt-eth chains.  In particular nearly all L2 chains have at least one system precompile to initiate exits back to L1.\r\n\r\nThe proposal was to make this proposal impactful by making the whole range \"warm\".  Martin pointed out this would re-open the broken metre attack.\r\n\r\nAfter thinking about it for two weeks I think the way forward may be to re-open [EIP-1109](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-1109-remove-call-costs-for-precompiled-contracts/447), which is a PRECOMPILEDCALL opcode, that would fail if it called anything _but_ a precompile, and mix it with [EIP-2046](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-2046-reduced-gas-cost-for-static-calls-made-to-precompiles/3291/5), which wanted to reduce precompile costs but not make them zero.  The proposed fee would be the same as all other CALL series for warm calls, and any call to a non-precompile (as determined by the chain, so hard forks and other-chain additions like L1 exit precompiles would adjust that set) would fail consuming all gas.\r\n\r\nAs far as when... the next \"open\" hard fork.  It's not important enough to drive a hard fork and not essential to the merge. I posted [this to F.E.M.](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-1352-restricted-address-range-for-precompiles-system-contracts/1151/28) as well.  Considering the timing issue I don't think it needs to be discussed in this meeting but I want to put a bug in peoples minds for when the next feature fork happens. If someone has a good reason why it won't work (like undoing Berlin security fixes) please post it to the FEM thread.",
