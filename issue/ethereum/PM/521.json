    "body": "Yeah, fair concern. It would be good to test this scenario out and see how it performs. \r\n\r\nI'll try and spec something up, so its clearer for everyone interested. \r\n\r\nThe general idea is to implement `CHOKE`/`UNCHOKE` control messages. We take some statistical distribution of timing of messages from our mesh peers. The ones sending us slow duplicates over some period, we send `CHOKE` to. This informs them to stop sending us messages in the mesh, but instead ALWAYS send us gossip in their heartbeat (rather than them randomly selecting us). If we start seeing a bunch of gossip first, then we `UNCHOKE` that node. \r\n\r\nAlso if we see a bunch of gossip from peers not in the mesh delivering us messages first, we may want to add them to the mesh.\r\n\r\n",
