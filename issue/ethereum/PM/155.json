By choosing RandomX, you are fighting with another coin over a hardware base that they have worked very hard to build for and acquire. I donât think thatâs a good faith move.\r\n\r\nYou never want to share hardware bases with a coin. Ethereum has the hardware base because GPUâs were the ASIC for the chain (and PP by extension). \r\n\r\nI think the community discussion needs to be: do we want to keep the principle upheld in the white paper of GPU-only?

    "body": "I move to have Hudsons write up of ProgPow removed from circulation. It is full of his opinions and makes false claims that the \"community\" is against ProgPow. What community are you refering to? ProgPow only affects miners and this is the only community that matters for EIP-1057. The last miner vote was over 95% in favor of ProgPow.\r\n\r\nFinally, as a large scalel GPU miner I have listened to EVERY core dev meeting live. Go back and review all the calls where and Ethash change was proposed (ProgPow was not the first) and Hudson always moved past the discussion as quick as possible obviously hoping it would die. If I did not know better I would say Hudson is on the take by ASIC manufactures. The paper he wrote is garbage and full of his unfounded opinions and seeks to stop ProgPow from happening.\r\n\r\nThe GPU mining community has waited long enough for Ethereum to live up to the yellow paper being ASIC resistance. We were told to wait over two years ago that there were other more important EIPs. This is the only chance we will ever have to stand up against ASICs. In the end history will show how the devs responded or did not respond to ASICs on the network,",

This is why you saw people coming out of the woodwork saying WTF, why is this all of the sudden coming up now? This discussion threw a marketing wrench into them announcing a new ASIC. Now they are just waiting for the Ethereum devs to not move to ProgPow. They have paid all the bashers, paper writers, paper signers to ensure ProgPow does not happen, they have the loudest voices.

Are we really this cowardly not to take on the ASICs this coin vowed to be against when it was created? Stand up ETH devs, stand up to the ASICs now or forever be accused of bowing down to them when they were the most vulnerable.\r\n\r\nIf you move forward now to ProgPow I gurantee you will deal the most serious blow you could ever have done to the ASIC manufacturers.

I am collecting 1-2 people from the pro and anti ProgPoW sides to join and have civil discussion. This is to discuss, primarily:\r\n> \r\n> * Community dissent of ProgPoW.\r\n> * Technical updates on ProgPoW.\r\n> * Next steps for ProgPoW.\r\n\r\nPlease make sure ANY dissent sources are quanitified. Twitter bots or papers with hundreds of signatures of paid ASIC supporters do not qualify as community dissent.\r\n\r\nAlso why is there not a disscusion of \"Community approval of ProgPoW.\" on your list above? It is apparent just the way you are wording this discussion you are again trying to sway the masses that there is some sort of all of the sudden non ASIC community dissent. The opposite is acutally quite true, that there is community approval (do a youtube search of ProgPow and see all the recent videos from the community GPU miners who have posted how to videos). So why state it the way you have?\r\n\r\nAn example of quantifying supporters/discenters in a meaningful way is:\r\n\r\n- GPU miners - 95% in favor (done by network vote last year)\r\n\r\n- ASIC miners - 35% (using Kristy methodology of identifying ASICs on the network)\r\n\r\n- Stake holders - (coin vote)\r\n\r\n- YouTube - (plenty of pro GPU miner support here)\r\n\r\n- Developers\r\n\r\n- Researchers\r\n\r\n- Implementers\r\n\r\n- Twitter (assume 75% bots or trolls)\r\n\r\n- Reddit (same as Twitter)\r\n\r\n- etc...\r\n\r\nWithout quantifying the supporters/discenters how can you make an intelligent unbiased decision? Without it, any decision made will look biased to the side that loses; and to be quite honest the only side that has anything to lose are the GPU miners. The others only have a risk of loss if there are bugs (if missed by your rigourous testing phase prior to implementation), GPU miners WILL without a doubt lose if this get shelved again.\r\n\r\nFinally, if you cannot quantify the data of discenters, then your data is garbage and should not be included in any intelligent decision making process.",
