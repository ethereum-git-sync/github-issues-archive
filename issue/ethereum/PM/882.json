    "body": "Reg Besu client updates: @thomas-quadratic feel free to share where are we regarding the testnet. From my side:\r\n\r\n- trie-key pedersen_hash is working per specs and tested against go\r\n- pedersen_commit(the one used in the trie) is working per specs and tested against go\r\n- the next stop is to expose `prove()` call to the trie per Kev's specs: https://hackmd.io/@6iQDuIePQjyYBqDChYw_jg/H1xXvMatq\r\n- I think it would be good to expose \"pedersen_hash\" for trie-key and \"pedersen_commit\"(in the trie) in separate repo (it can be called rust_verkle_crypto_api) so if other clients want to FFI calls to cryptography they have that ready (issue with rust is that is currently mocking DB for proofs, but pedersen(hash and the commitment) is ready)\r\n\r\n\r\nReg \"verkle in-circuit\": I can share few findings (similar to the previous call, if there's time, maybe it's too early):\r\n- based on zeth(type 1 zkevm from risc0) latest explanation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pBmf839eOA keccak takes more than 50% of resources(cycle count) for the proven block(no more keccak in VKT) . I'm pretty sure it's the same for other zkEVMs (type 1 -> PSE and Taiko that i'm aware of)\r\n- Only proving that \"editing\" the trie is done correctly is needed for zkEVM. Nice article: https://trapdoortech.medium.com/zero-knowledge-proof-deep-into-zkevm-source-code-mpt-circuit-fb2dba6e8ba3\r\n- zkEVMs currently dont care about verkle proofs and how it works - that makes having first benchmarks easier\r\n- I realized \"zk\" teams don't have the resources to benchmark this internally, all they can do is offer grants for external people(and that's a process itself) since VKT has a long way to go until reaching mainnet and there are people thinking that \"the verge\" won't even happen because of the complexity that introduces.\r\n- I have applied for Ethereum support program to get funding for the work since the EPF program is finished in 2 weeks. Plan is to get more benchmarks for various \"zk-verifiable systems\" (halo2-api, noir, cairo, risc0, newer zkVMs) and include more people who are interested in the topic (some of them are already working on this, we are chatting and sharing thoughts). And continue reporting the progress with verkle implementers/researchers in this call and around the whole ethereum community.\r\n- Would be happy to hear suggestions on how should I approach this, the plan is to \"bridge\" the perspective of zk-rollups to verkle change",
