And now all the sudden you think Q2 is gonna be it? Why so sure? Why not Q3, or heck Q4.\r\n\r\nTerrible PR, like my friend said your turning half the community against you by withholding information and consistently lying about the release date of POS. Every time you push back the date, your community loses more faith in the general aspect of this project. There is a huge rumor going around that your going centralized for the shareholders. I personally know 50 people myself that will be dropping this project and i am just one person.\r\n\r\nAnd why cant the merge date be discussed on meeting agendas? Im coming to a more truthful conclusion that the community has no say in this project and its based on what shareholders want.",

We have rough ideas, which we've communicated, but the amount of work and uncertainty around things means that even if we chose a date today, we'd be likely to change it again and, as you said, disappoint the community. The best we can do, I think, is make it clear what we've done so far + what needs to be done. \r\n",
