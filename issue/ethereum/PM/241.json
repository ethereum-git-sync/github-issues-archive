Berlin is coming up and that is more important than ProgPoW talk, especially in light of the fact that there appears to be primarily speculation and no immediate threat (such as an attack actively happening). I would be happy to re-add it to the agenda if you can provide better data pointing to the fact that there is an immediate threat or if there are calls from a client team to bring this up again and they would like to address it.",

Centralization of hash due to efficient miners only sold privately to enterprise doesn't seem to be considered a threat as long as it is done in secret?  If it cannot be proven, it is not happneing?\r\n\r\n",

I've invested hundreds of thousands of USD in mining.  When you are posting in reddit or github or discord I hope you will disclose your DeFi affiliations and biases.  \r\n\r\n1 - You need to publish what the impact of 1559 is.  There's too much anxiety.  I'm working to force a fork with miners.\r\n\r\n2 - Please read this : https://gulovsen.io/proof-of-security/\r\nYou need to very seriously consider what 2.0, POS and the \"internet bond\" means in terms of United States securities laws.  This is no joke.  You are going to destroy ETH as we know it.\r\n\r\nI look forward to speaking with all of you on this open source project call.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nShaun",

    "body": "@catdsnny re: 1559, it is not scheduled for discussion on the call. What do you mean by \"impact of 1559\"? We have a full list of resources available [here](https://hackmd.io/@timbeiko/1559-resources), many of which discuss the technical, economic, and mining impacts. \r\n\r\nre: (2), I'm not sure legal matters have ever been discussed on this car, which is focused on the technical updates to Ethereum. IANAL, nor is anyone on the call, so it does not feel like the best venue to have a productive discussion about this. Also, FWIW, the article you shared is focused on Ethereum 2.0, which is out of scope for this call and is already live.  \r\n\r\nMore generally, we try to keep this call civil and level-headed. Things like implying \"DeFi affiliations\", \"working to force a fork\" and \"You are going to destroy ETH\" are needlessly inflammatory and don't help move forward the conversations around the various topics you are concerned about.

Unfortunately the devs still only think in terms of 51% attack instead of an attack like this that goes unnoticed.\n\nThis article is 2 years old, but it is worse today and I have posted an updated chart on Magicians.\n\nhttps://t.co/pkuSnEnug2?amp=1 ",

IMO the three most relevant things to discuss are (quoted from the doc):\r\n> 1. As Berlin gets wrapped up, have 1-2 calls to discuss the Eth2 Merge and longer-term roadmap before starting to plan the next HF;\r\n> 1. Instead of having only the next call’s agenda available, open the next ~3 months’ agendas in advance. Schedule “important but not urgent” topics in advance, and identify calls on which we expect decisions to be made, so people can attend what matters the most to them.\r\n> 1. Discuss the following on ACD:\r\n>     1. The “bar” we require to discuss EIPs on the call, both for the first time, and repeat;\r\n>     1. ACD Code of Conduct (“Be Excellent to Each Other”?)\r\n>     1. ACD “Mission Statement” (“Ensure the Security & Long Term Sustainability/Viability/??? of Ethereum”?)\r\n\r\nThey are ordered by \"easiest to get consensus on\" to \"hardest to get consensus on\" 😅 ",
