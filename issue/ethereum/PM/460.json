We didn't reach a full consensus, but roughly agreed that we should have both testnets with public validator participation and testnets with a privately-controlled validator set, and that it makes sense to aim to deprecate some testnets over time as they become bloated. \r\n\r\nOpening this issue to track conversations on concrete next steps.

    "body": "My thinking was that Goerli/Prater would have a \"privileged\" set of stakers (e.g., 90% of stake is owned by well known people in the ecosystem who have publicly committed to running a validator full time).\r\n\r\nSepolia on the other hand would be a FFA, where anyone who can get a hold of some Sepolia ETH can stake it and the people with the large holdings commit to *not* using them to prop up the network.  We should expect this to result in Sepolia frequently failing to achieve finality, leaking validators, then achieving finality, repeat.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Sepolia network is so that dapp developers have a public place where they can harden their software against situations that *can* happen on mainnet (failure to finalize).  If you are in early prototype development and you just want to test the happy path then you would use Goerli/Prater.\r\n\r\nNote: If there is some reason to swap that so Goerli is the one that fails to achieve finality and Sepolia is the one that is propped up, that is fine with me.",
