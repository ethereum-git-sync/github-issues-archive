  "body": "**TL;DR: we need to make the following decisions in the next 1-2 ACD calls:**\r\n\r\n* Assuming the merge is not ready by December, do we want to plan for more than a difficulty bomb pushback? \r\n    * If potentially yes, what can we do to minimize any delays or impact on the merge work? \r\n         * Which EIPs do we think should be included? \r\n            * [EIP-2537](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/343), \r\n            * [EIP-3540](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/329), \r\n            * [EIP-2935](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/279),\r\n            * EIP-3074, \r\n            * [EIP-3651](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/357)\r\n    * If not, do we keep the name \"Shanghai\" for the difficulty bomb pushback upgrade? \r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\n**Longer post, more context:**\r\n\r\nWith EIP-3554 pushing back the difficulty bomb, we will need to have a network upgrade in December. \r\n\r\nIn the most optimistic of scenarios, this upgrade could be the merge, but given the amount of open items on the [mainnet readiness checklist](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/blob/master/Merge/mainnet-readiness.md), we cannot be certain of this. \r\n\r\nIf we assume we have a non-merge upgrade, we need to decide whether we want to include anything else aside from another difficulty bomb delay (and whether to keep the name \"Shanghai\" if we only delay the difficulty bomb, or use another \"glacier-themed\" name :-) ). \r\n\r\nIf we only delay the difficulty bomb, the upgrade is drastically simpler to test and implement: it is a single constant change, and will not require to be deployed on testnets prior to mainnet. This means that we could choose the appropriate delay in October, release clients in November, and upgrade in December. \r\n\r\nAlternatively, if we decide to include any \"feature EIP\", then testing and testnet deployements will be needed. Working backwards, and following the London schedule, it means we would need to follow this timeline:\r\n\r\n* **Early December**: mainnet upgrade\r\n* **Early November**: mainnet releases\r\n* **October**: testnet upgrades\r\n* **Late Sept/Early Oct**: testnet releases\r\n* **Late Aug/September**: devnets\r\n* **Early August**: EIPs chosen\r\n\r\nThis timeline would be slightly shorter than London. It is also worth noting that working on a network upgrade would likely delay some of the progress on the merge given that client teams will need to split their focus. For reference, the EIPs that have been loosely discussed for Shanghai so far are: [EIP-2537](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/343), [EIP-3540](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/329), [EIP-2935](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/279), EIP-3074 and [EIP-3651](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/357). \r\n\r\nGiven that the next ACD calls are on July 23 and August 6, unless we have a list of EIPs chosen on the August 6th call, then we will default to not including any non-difficulty-bomb EIPs in the December upgrade.

In this city-name era, the only two-word update is Muir Glacier, which is both a non-feature update and somewhat a \"unplanned update\".\r\n\r\nTwo questions:\r\n- Should \"unplanned\" updates follow the city names?\r\n- Will the merge update be called \"The Merge\", another name, or a city name?\r\n\r\nI am slightly leaning towards keeping the city names for every feature update (including the merge), as long as there is a single feature apart from the difficulty bomb. And keeping everything else with a different name.\r\n\r\nIn case there will be only a difficulty bomb change, I suggest we look for another retreating glacier perhaps in so far unrepresented regions, such as Africa or Oceania: *[Arrow Glacier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_Glacier)* or *[Tasman Glacier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haupapa_/_Tasman_Glacier)* sounds like an interesting one.
