    "body": "> How will the contract check whether the user making the tx is authorized or not, if they can't pull state to check anything?\r\n\r\nWill answer this first as it seems like a big misconception. AA transactions cannot read _external_ state. That is, a transaction with target account T can read the state of T, but not the state of anything outside of T. The state of T would be able to store data representing nonces and the like. And yes, the source code itself would include public keys and the like.\r\n\r\n> The txpool in Geth contains on average 5000 transactions all the time. That means after each block at worse we'd need to rerun 5000 x 400K gas computations just to check what's still valid and what isn't. That's 200 blocks' worth of computation, which would take 40 seconds on average on mainnet.\r\n\r\nThe invariant that pre-PAYGAS code cannot access external state (ie. state other than the state of the account contract itself) means that you only need to re-process transactions for accounts that were modified by other transactions. This already puts a cap, though conceivably I suppose one could have a block that touches 5000 accounts.\r\n\r\nHowever, it turns out that we can completely solve this problem. Because we're only allowing one pending transaction at a time, the only possible case where a transaction with some target account T would need to be reprocessed would be modifications that come from the outside (ie.some transaction with target T' that then calls into T). But account contracts are not allowed to accept external calls. Hence, the only case we need to worry about is T' sending ETH into T (including eg. through self-destruct). We make this a non-issue by simply banning pre-PAYGAS execution from using the BALANCE opcode.\r\n\r\n(Needless to say this would also require banning environment opcodes eg. TIMESTAMP, DIFFICULTY....., though there are safe ways to modify the proposal to allow access to those too but that's not needed for v1)\r\n\r\nSo if we do this there would never be any reprocessing required; nothing other than transactions with some target would be able to modify the validity of other transactions with the same target, and the one-pending-transaction rule ensures that that only happens in a few edge cases involving eg. tx replacement to bump gas fees, rogue miners, etc.\r\n\r\n> That will break many invariants and will break also all existing APIs that DApps rely on. I'm not sure this is something we can pull off on Ethereum any more.\r\n\r\nThis should be discussed more. My proposal had a version that doesn't break the invariant. Also note that there are backwards-compatibility-preserving strategies, eg.the existing API could simply return only the data related to the first time some transaction was sent. Users acting \"normally\" should not run into cases where they generate duplicate transactions.",

    "body": "@vbuterin already responded to the points on accessing state - it cannot access external state, and for AA accounts, there is a one pending tx rule initially.\r\n\r\n> That will break many invariants and will break also all existing APIs that DApps rely on. I'm not sure this is something we can pull off on Ethereum any more.\r\n\r\nThis would not affect current accounts and would only break AA accounts (which there are none that exist yet).\r\n\r\n> Doesn't this make your user onboarding use case non functional?\r\n\r\nWhy would it make it nonfunctional? It depends on the application. If an application maps a contract per user, then the contract could be deployed with initial gas to pay on behalf of the user. Also, lets say in an application such as bounties, each bounty may be its own contract with eth allocated for gas.",
