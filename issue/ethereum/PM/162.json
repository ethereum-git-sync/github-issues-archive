    "body": "Returning back to [ethereum/EIPs#2046](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/2046):\r\n- SHA256 function was found to NOT depend on current `CALL` cost pricing and simultaneously hugely overpriced. Recommended to change to 10 + 6 gas per word (32 bytes) from the current 60 + 12 per word\r\n- Ripemd160 function was found to NOT depend on current `CALL` cost pricing and simultaneously hugely overpriced. Recommended to change to 12 + 4 gas per word (32 bytes) from the current 600 + 120 per word\r\n- Blake2f function was found to NOT depend on current `CALL` cost pricing and simultaneously strangely priced. Recommended to change to 5 + 1 gas per three(!) rounds(!) from the current 1 gas per round. Typically it's 10-12 rounds for the Blake2s/Blake2b, so the main benefit here is removal of the huge `CALL` cost\r\n- BN_ADD function was found to NOT depend on current `CALL`, but was underpriced. It's recommended to change it to 300 gas from the current 150 gas if `CALL` cost is reduced\r\n- BN_MUL function was found to NOT depend on current `CALL` and was well-priced. It's recommended to change it to 6300 gas from the current 6000 gas to account for a worst-case input parameters (largest hamming weight of the scalar)\r\n- BN_PAIRING function was found to be well priced, no adjustments are necessary. Although I would recommend parity to switch from `bn` package to `pairing_ce` or EIP1962 implementation cause those are significantly faster\r\n- MODEXP - there was a [EIP](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2565) merged that did NOT perform artificial corrections for `CALL` cost, so we can conclude that function can be treated to NOT depend on current `CALL` cost\r\n\r\nBonus:\r\n- keccak256 function was found to consume 10 gas + 4 gas per word (32 bytes) compared to the current 30 + 6 per word (OpenEthereum implementation is just a wrapper on top of `tiny-keccak` package). Fancy part is that 0, 32, 64 and 128 bytes take the same amount of time, so may be pricing should be changed to elaborate this. Most common use case of Merkle trees would benefit from this, and pricing itself would be more precise. Note that this may be implementation dependent for Rust, but most likely not due to the nature of the sponge construction with 1600 bits of internal state.",

For Blake2f I place random data everywhere and manually control number of rounds (first 4 bytes as BE encoding of uint32). For `point_add` and `point_mul` I take a generator and multiply it by random 248 bit scalar (to not overflow the group order value using RNG). For `point_mul` worst case scalar is `[255] * 32` cause there is no check that the value is in range (smaller than modulus). For pairing I do the same, make N pairs by producing random points in a same manner (now you also need to multiply G2 generator by random scalar).\r\n\r\nI believe that hardware dependent part is only a constant of 35_000_000 gas/second using `ecrecover` reference on my machine. We could expect hardware dependency on 32-bit machines or ARM processors, but for modern 64 bit Intel/AMD only one constant should matter.",
