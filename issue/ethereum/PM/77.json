    "body": "Here's a small what-if calculator I made for your convenience to see for yourself how ProgPoW Original vs. [ProgPoW 3-phase](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/73#issuecomment-459154834) (my proposal for a better ProgPoW deployment) would play out for you personally.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32360383/52146658-b2365100-2664-11e9-9c2d-f621a470be7c.png)\r\n\r\n[Link to view only the preset values at 15c per kW/h](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oDLhqAEU9IRZBKK-UEactQfUhrCf1S30frIPXJBm4ZE/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n[Link to copy to your own Google account to be able to edit your own version](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oDLhqAEU9IRZBKK-UEactQfUhrCf1S30frIPXJBm4ZE/copy?usp=sharing)\r\n[Link to the .ods file (LibreOffice)](https://filebin.ca/4VYFwY8DLtdM/ProgPoW_calculator.ods)\r\n\r\nAssuming a 70% infestation of ASICs of the Ethereum network a ProgPoW 3-phase deployment would initially be almost 1000% more profitable for a hobby miner paying 15c per kW/h. \r\nA ProgPoW 3 phase implementation economically disincentivizes ASICs ([reiterated by Linzhi](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/73#issuecomment-459413940)), while with a static ProgPoW implementation ASICs would be up and running after a few months again.\r\n\r\nIn this example I ignore that the hashrate of ProgPoW 3-phase (phase 1) would actually be higher, but it doesn't matter since all GPUs would rise in hashrate at the same time, thus they have the same relative speed, which wouldn't change this calculation.\r\n\r\nIf ProgPoW gets adopted we need to make sure it benefits Frank, 19, living in mom's basement, owner of a 12 GPU rig.\r\nWe don't need to make sure that Tom, 43, owner of a 50,000 GPU megafarm paying 2-3c per kW/h benefits overproportionally from the change in comparison to Frank.\r\n\r\nMy goal with this is the growth of the Ethereum network and growth of cryptocurrency as a whole. The best tool to grow the network is by word of mouth to friends and relatives by hobby miners and other enthusiasts. If you cut them off you will have an isolated circle of insiders that ultimately derive value of Ethereum because all they care about is pleasing their investors who sometimes couldn't care less for cryptocurrency.\r\n[This article sums it up very nicely](https://hackernoon.com/cryptos-secret-sauce-c67b133a5565)\r\n\r\nDON'T FORGET WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32360383/52146288-9da58900-2663-11e9-9818-db93ebdb6f95.png)\r\n\r\n",

As if they \"unintentionally\" forgot to tune _for the most used commodity hardware used for Ethereum mining_.  They decided to change parameters only after taking a lot of heat from the community, before that they showed 1000 \"technical\" explanations of how everything is perfectly tuned.\r\n_I very much love_ how they say \"unintentionally causes **some** AMD GPUs to be compute limited\", why don't they instead say \"unintentionally causes AMD **Polaris**, the **most widely used chip** used for mining Ethereum to be compute limited\"\r\nLet's stop talking about this right here though, don't want to make this the topic of discussion, we can use reddit for that).",

    "body": "I agree with Ethereum core devs that they need to completely step back from this debate and not give it a platform on their dev channels (youtube calls, github issues, reddit posts).\r\n\r\nThis issue basically decides who gets to mint new coins, and the ETH dev team should not be acting like the US Federal Reserve. They should not be inviting third party developers with unproven codebases into their midst and letting them whisper into their ears.\r\n\r\nWe can all admit that a lot of money is at stake, and if ETH devs provide a platform for this debate on their channels, they expose themselves to the potential of backhanded dealings, bribery, coercion. The only way for users to trust developers in the future is for them to remain completely impartial on this issue.\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/5chdn/status/1090752365190438912\r\n\r\nAs far as I understand it, some developers publish user-facing statements regarding what they consider to be a consensus among them. I agree with their consensus that the developers should remain completely impartial. While it may be true that some developers might have slightly different opinions, it comes off as extremely weak-willed if ETH appears to have developers bickering on Twitter.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, any potential audit of progPOW would not be conclusive, it does not address the problem of misaligned economic incentives. Third party auditing firms should have absolutely no say in decisions related to coin governance. Finally, third parties would be exposed to the same bribery and coercion as ETH devs.\r\n\r\nIf ifdefelse likes progPOW, they should launch their own coin instead of trying to co-opt Ethereum.",

    "body": "I partially agree, they should not be the deciding factor, but they need to offer the platform so users have the possibility of expressing themselves and ultimately decide with their hashrate.\r\n\r\nI heard about a voting that should apparently take place on Ethereum via block messages. This is a very bad idea if we assume that ASICs are far better organized (because central) and if ASICs are more than 50% of the network, it's an instant loss anyways.\r\n\r\nInstead they should IMO definitely ditch Ethash in its current implementation because it's proven to be ASIC infested (https://www.asicminervalue.com/miners/innosilicon/a10-ethmaster-485mh), there's no point in doing a vote on the current/legacy chain when ASICs are able to vote, when the vote is about GPU mining.\r\nYou don't want Kazakhstan being able to cast their political vote in France, right?\r\n\r\nSo what I would ultimately like to see is the developers setting a block height on which the PoW fork has to take place. All proposals that are reviewed and have successfully been run on testnet then all get simulataneously activated on fork day and each GPU miner can decide which chain to go for. Eventually after some days we will have a clear picture and the devs can announce to support the strongest chain and the GPUs from the loser chain(s) will be economically incentivized to join the longest chain and the loser chains slowly die off.\r\n\r\nThat is the most impartial way this can be done and the fairest one to all participants.\r\n\r\nPossibilities I currently see:\r\n1. ProgPoW (IfDefElse) - _temporarily kicks off ASICs_ & +60% power\r\n2. 3-Phase ProgPoW (MoneroCrusher) - _economically disincentivizes ASIC until PoS_ & +10%+30%+60% power (that is if IfDefElse don't accept my proposal)\r\n3. Ethash + small tweak (with the rationale that PoS is coming soon anyways and new ASICs wont get created to mine for e.g. 1 year) - _temporarily kicks off ASICs_",
