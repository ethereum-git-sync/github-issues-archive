The proposed change says that CL must not surface an error if the method call fails, but it also implies that CL must make this call. This is done to avoid user to see any warnings in their log related to `exchangeTransitionConfiguration` because it may upgrade CL client first and after that upgrade EL. If this soft deprecation isn't needed we can go hard and remove this method on both sides at the same time.",

One solution we came to is to allow a couple CL folks to join as EIP Editors, with the ability to force-merge CL EIPs. This would hopefully reduce the friction of using EIPs, and allow more CL people to become familiar with the process. If we have time, I can give a 2-3 min recap of the conversation and make a call for CL editors 😄 ",

    "body": "Regarding the date for the Capella fork on Sepolia, Lighthouse is happy to go ahead with a fork date of late March. I've heard March 27th being suggested, I support that date or anything similar.\r\n\r\nLighthouse is currently maintaining a `capella` branch separate to our mainline `stable`/`unstable` branches. We're confident to call the `capella` branch feature-complete and ready for public testnets.\r\n\r\nOver the next couple of weeks we will work on performing a holistic review on `capella` then merging it into our mainlines branches. Our goal is to publish a fully-fledged `v3.5.0` release which will be Sepolia Capella ready, before the Sepolia fork. In the worst case, we will publish a special non-mainnet, release-candidate for Sepolia which will enable the Capella fork there.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line is that our implementation is ready to go and we're just working on the finer details of getting it into a release which does not block testnets.",
