With the removal of the PC operation all PC is relative, and Besu has an optimization where we don't have to slice up the code in the EVM.  Change the verbiage to something like this in `CALLF`\r\n```\r\n8. Sets `current_section_index` to `code_section_index` and `PC` to the first byte in the code section, and execution continues in the called section.\r\n```\r\nand remove `, and PC is set to 0.` from the Execution section. This aligns with making PC unobservable in EOF, clients would be free to set their own mappings.\r\n\r\n\r\n[EIP-3155 EVM trace specification](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3155) interactions\r\n* How do we reflect code section in the EIP-3115 format?  (PC=0 from the prior section may impact this too, but it could be defined as PC relative to the start of the code section)\r\n* Do we want to put the return stack items in the trace as an option (like memory)?",
