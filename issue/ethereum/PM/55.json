Three competing EIPs to delay the difficulty bomb and reduce/maintain the block reward:\r\n    a. [EIP-858](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/858) - Delay bomb and reduce block reward to 1 ETH per block.\r\n    b. [EIP-1234](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/1234) - Delay bomb and reduce block reward to 2 ETH.\r\n    c. [EIP-1295](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1295) - Delay bomb, keep rewards to 3 ETH, change other factors such as POW incentive structure.\r\n2. [Constantinople EIPs](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/53)\r\n  a. [EIP 145: Bitwise shifting instructions in EVM](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-145.md)\r\n  b. [EIP 1218: Simpler blockhash refactoring](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1218). We are delaying this one until Istanbul.\r\n  c. [EIP 1014: Skinny CREATE2 ](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/1014)\r\n  d. [EIP 1052: EXTCODEHASH Opcode](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1052)\r\n  e. [EIP 1283: Net gas metering for SSTORE without dirty maps](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1283)\r\n2. Client Constantinople Updates\r\n3. Constantinople Testing\r\n4. (If we have time) Changing PoW algorithm to be ASIC resistant. There is renewed interest from miners to implement [ProgPoW](https://github.com/ifdefelse/ProgPOW#progpow---a-programmatic-proof-of-work).\r\n\r\nDifferent articles/links regarding potential issuance reduction conversation:\r\n- [A Case for Ethereum Block Reward Reduction to 2 ETH in Constantinople (EIP-1234)](https://medium.com/@eric.conner/a-case-for-ethereum-block-reward-reduction-in-constantinople-eip-1234-25732431fc77)\r\n- [Reddit discussion of the above article](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/92g404/a_case_for_ethereum_block_reward_reduction_in/?st=JK4MT60F&sh=257437dd)\r\n- [Eric Conner's Updated Twitter Thread](https://twitter.com/econoar/status/1034137784154382336)\r\n- [Coinvote (79 participants): What should be done regarding proof-of-work issuance until Casper is ready?](https://www.etherchain.org/coinvote/poll/298)\r\n- [FEM Forum: EIP-1234 vs EIP-1227: Constantinople Difficulty Bomb & Block reward](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-1234-vs-eip-1227-constantinople-difficulty-bomb-block-reward/807/)\r\n- [Bitfly Twitter Post on Miner Opinion](https://twitter.com/etherchain_org/status/1031443277118144513)\r\n- [FEM Forum: Final Request From the GPU Mining Community](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/final-request-from-the-gpu-mining-community/1050)\r\n- [EIP 1295 Presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15n7Vur8wwlfDK6ZXwohUc95rXOUIXo7j/view)\r\n- [Ethereum’s Economic Breakpoint: An Analysis](https://crypto.omnianalytics.io/2018/08/23/ethereums-economic-breakpoint-an-analysis/)",

Choosing between one or two eth/block is an unnecessarily coarse resolution. 1.15 eth per block will match bitcoins inflation rate, and exceed it when uncle rewards are considered, so going all the way up to two just because it's a whole number and is one of the options above completely loses sight of the objective.",

    "body": "For a more uniform and predictable block time, a reduction of difficulty is in order, namely deferrance of the difficulty bomb.\r\n\r\nAt this point what seems urgent is a measure to support the price and prevent a further fall.  Most effective way is reduction of miner rewards.  The 1 eth per block sounds the most promising of the three, as it most prudently addresses the urgency at this critical time.  I would prefer the issuance to be even smaller, for the same reason.  Miners will be winners too.  Comrades -- Ethereum can dive really really deep, and not come back for a long time if nothing is done.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the voters have spoken.  But I believe the option of capping the supply must also come back on the table. [EIP 960](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/960)",

I try to follow all the calls and last one I feel it was pretty \"conflicted\" at least looking at the comment stream. \r\n\r\nDo you have an establish consensus method to reach a decision? Is it a vote? will the decision on point 1 happen in the meeting or at a later point in time or in a different forum? Maybe having clear expectations on how that decision will be made could help.\r\n\r\nAnyway just my 2 cents. Much love, keep up the work!",

If we ignore, will the community have faith in the next vote proposal? if miners say this is not representative because no ASIC resistance was introduced, does it excuse the fact that they didn't vote for their favorite EIP (I guess 1295 or 1227)? if they haven't, does that mean they lost their right to complain? questions, questions...\r\n\r\nWhat's for damn sure is that this community urgently needs a defined guidance to properly vote on important issues. Weighted ETH vote on Etherchain is a good start. Now we need a clear process. I propose to add to all upcoming EIP voting proposals the ability to vote: \"This vote should be void\" so at least it gives a chance to voters to express their interest to propose another vote. Also, voting periods should be shorten so we don't waste so much time in debating and voting things that eventually go nowhere (a month is way too long, I propose 2 weeks).\r\n\r\nClosed vote results: What should be done regarding proof-of-work issuance until Casper is ready?\r\n                                                                                         \tVotes\tEther Voted\t%\r\nEIP-1295                                                           \t                    7\t             283.2   \t0.2\r\nEIP 1234                                                                                     31\t            41938.5\t27.7\r\nEIP 858\t                                                                                  129\t   108882.9\t72.0\r\nEIP 1227\t                                                                                    3\t                   65.5\t 0.0\r\nTotal\t                                                                                  170\t   151170.1\t100%\r\n**Winner by a landslide: EIP-858**",

    "body": "@Souptacular Can you please add **EIP 960** into the agenda as it is a fairly straight forward proposal to bring to the table for discussion. Technically it would be very easy to integrate into the Constantinople hardfork and at this stage I feel many others would also support the topic of an ETH hardcap being discussed as we are in the stages of addressing an unnecessary amount of inflation that has been long known about. Please see Vlads Medium post from all the way back to the beginning of 2017 for reference about this: https://medium.com/@Vlad_Zamfir/the-case-for-smaller-block-rewards-fb0eab38e15c\r\n\r\nThe 2 popular choices for block reward reduction thus far have proven to be EIP858 with 1 ETH per block and 2 ETH per blocks with EIP 1234. Keeping the block reward the same at 3 ETH shouldn't even be an option really with over 99% of the community vote weighing in favor a needed reduction:\r\n\r\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/9bc8i9/monthlong_ethereum_issuance_reduction_coin_vote/\r\n\r\nMaybe 1.5 ETH could be some form of compromise?\r\n\r\nI would like to point out that current ETH inflation schedule is not what was originally projected back in 2016 as per V's post here for reasons relating to the difficulty bomb delay: https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/5izcf5/lets_talk_about_the_projected_coin_supply_over/dbc66rd\r\n\r\nThis is a strong justification for lowering the block reward.\r\n\r\nThere has been some good discussion happening so far about a hardcap on the Ether supply, and is one of the most commented on EIP's: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/960\r\n\r\nAt 32 ETH per staking validator node, in theory if the hardcap was set at 128,000,000 this would mean a total of 4,000,000 validator nodes if all Ether was staked. Just some food for thought in relation to Vitaliks 120-140M proposal :)\r\n\r\nPersonally I feel a hardcap would greatly help demonstrate more maturity of the Ethereum Project. Perhaps this is something we can discuss as a community! Hope to be able to hear about it.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",

The 4m validator nodes you are quoting is therefore incorrect and too optimistic. Implementing a hardcap doesnt demonstrate any sort of maturity without scientific data to support it and if once proven reductions in the hardcap can always be implemented in the PoS stage of Ethereum through a burn mechanism.\r\n\r\nThe justification for a reward reduction seems to be to stop any continued fall in price. Some have tried to tie the reward to environmental impact while at the same time suggesting it would lead to an increase in price. Such logic is flawed because the $ cost of mining would continue to be the same should there be a price increase post reward reduction and therefore have no impact on the no. of miners.\r\n\r\nConsidering all reward reduction proposals are effectively an attempt to \"bailout\" ETH token holders who have bought ETH for speculative purposes at a high price, I think it would considerate to include EIP-999 in the discussion as a higher priority for a \"bailout\".",

    "body": "Above all else, we need to come up with a final answer sooner rather than later. Uncertainty is depressing for everybody and shows a real lack of governance ability. Crypto is watching and nobody wants to be the laughinstock i.e https://www.coindesk.com/ethereums-october-upgrade-could-be-29-billion-blockchains-biggest-test-yet/\r\n\r\n@econoar proposed a few days ago on reddit that we must work on a process to vote on proposals.\r\n\r\nThis is my 2 cents:\r\n\r\n- To the argument \"well I didn't even know about the vote happening\", I say each and everyone should be responsible for its own investment and opinion and do its due diligence. It was a month long vote that has been shared and discussed thousands of times on Reddit and Twitter. It's a bit of an easy excuse but anyhow this is what I would propose to solve it: **Etherchain NFTs airdrops for each vote proposals to every Ethereum address**. This way, noone can say they didn't know about it\r\n- to the argument \"well screw this vote, it missed the whole point\", I say ok that's fair and there should be an **automatic vote option within each and every vote proposal that says \"None of the above\"** which, if winner, voids the entirety of the vote\r\n- to the argument \"well I don't care, it doesn't mean anything to me\", I say ok fair enough, we call that the blank vote option and there should be an **automatic vote option within each and every vote proposal that says \"I don't care\"** which, if winner, makes the next vote the actual winner.\r\n- to the argument \"well I don't get it and would rather let the core devs handle it\", I say sure, it makes sense. **There should be an automatic vote option within each and every vote proposal that says \"I trust the core devs to make the right call\"** which, if winner, lets the core devs make the call.\r\n- to the argument, \"well voting with a weighted approach using addresses' ETH amount is unfair to the masses that can't afford large amounts\", I say the opposite is also true in the sense that among two people with the same wealth, the larger investor is considered to take more risk and should have a bigger voice. The traditional electoral system works pretty much the same way with lobbyists doing their thing. This is a point to be discussed though.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis way, it should simplify everything moving forward and we have an urgent need to make it all simpler, readily available (i.e. etherchain NFTs airdrops) and complete (i.e. all automatic voting proposals additions listed above).",

I am all for a PoW algo switch - but logistically that is a HUGE ask in two months time. I may be wrong, and it may be possible to implement it into the client codebases and be thoroughly tested before. I would love to be pleasantly surprised by a fast rollout. We will also do anything we can to help in the process. But if a rushed rollout puts network security at risk - I don't think it's worth it.\r\n\r\n@chfast's EIP-1355 _looks_ like it may be a stopgap solution, but I am no algo engineer. If EIP-1355 gets the job done with minimal security risk, I'm all for it. If it can be done in this fork then we can also have quantifiable evidence to support a change to issuance at the next fork, if no other monetary policy schedule is adopted (please please please let's do this).",
