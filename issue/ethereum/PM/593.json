  "body": "## Meeting Info\r\n- [Aug 18, 2022, 11:30 UTC](https://savvytime.com/converter/utc-to-germany-berlin-united-kingdom-london-ny-new-york-city-ca-san-francisco-china-shanghai-japan-tokyo-australia-sydney/aug-18-2022/11-30)\r\n- Duration: 60 minutes\r\n- Youtube Recording: [Ethereum Cat Herders channel]()\r\n- [Zoom Join Link](https://ethereumfoundation.zoom.us/j/84584961070?pwd=M1ozNkIxQXlESTN3TWlVWS9kMTBEZz09)\r\n\r\nüìÜ  Subscribe to the [Ethereum Protocol Call calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/1?cid=Y191cGFvZm9uZzhtZ3JtcmtlZ243aWM3aGs1c0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t) for future calls\r\nüíª  Join the Ethereum R&D Discord for continued discussion\r\n\r\n‚≠ê [KZG Ceremony Specs Repo](https://github.com/ethereum/kzg-ceremony-specs)\r\n‚≠ê [Ceremony Resources](https://github.com/tvanepps/KZG-Ceremony-Resources)\r\n\r\nNotes from Kev:\r\n\r\n1)  Landing page should focus on the value of the ceremony and less on the cryptography behind it\r\n2)  POAP should be given after the user has verified that they were included in the final ceremony. \r\n3)  Remove usage of cookies for returning users who did not contribute\r\n4)  Start an MVP frontend for DevCon which will have the same theme as the final designs\r\n\r\nExpanding:\r\n\r\n1) As a regular user, we want to feel like the activity we are doing is important and explaining the cryptography doesn‚Äôt convey this. Instead, we can explain to the user, what impact they will have on the Ethereum ecosystem, if they contribute honestly.\r\n\r\n2) There are two attestations for the ceremony that a contributor can make. The first is that they participated in a trusted setup and can be done once they‚Äôve contributed (in the middle of the ceremony). The second is that their participation was included in the final output of the ceremony. This can only be done once the ceremony has completed. We want to incentivise users to come back and share the second attestation and we do this by only giving them the POAP at this stage.\r\n\r\n3) Currently in the designs a user can sign in with github/Ethereum and they will need to sign some message in the case of Ethereum. If they do not contribute, and come back again, we use cookies to ensure that they don‚Äôt need to sign some message again. We can remove cookies by changing the workflow such that when a user signs in, they should be aware that they will immediately be placed into the queue to contribute. We can check if a user has contributed before by checking their ID in the ‚Äúglobal‚Äù transcript. Noting from the last meeting about the transcript now including oAUTH IDs such as github/Ethereum.\r\n\r\n4) With DevCon fast approaching, we want an MVP design and not the final product that we are viewing on figma which will take a considerable amount of time. This MVP should include the ability for users to add their own randomness by keyboard smashing or (if possible) recording mouse movements. Ideally, we want this MVP to have the same theme as the final figma drawings that we are currently seeing, so its not a shock when we iteratively change ot the final version.\r\n\r\nAction steps from meeting:\r\n\r\n- Finalise responsibility for the MVP regarding frontend (HTML/CSS/JS)\r\n- Explore the possibility of having a darker vibe(theme) for the ceremony",
