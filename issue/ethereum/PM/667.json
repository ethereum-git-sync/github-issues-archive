    "body": "If there's time, can we discuss potentially releasing some backwards compatible changes:\r\n- Reduction in nodes per long-lived subnet: https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/issues/2749\r\nThis can be released entirely in a backwards compatible way, but the net result will be less nodes on long-lived subnets. There is a constant (`SUBNETS_PER_NODE`) that we can set to minimize the impact on the transition. \r\n- Ipv6 dual-stack support. We've been working towards enabling this throughout all our protocols. First step is enabling ipv6 on our bootnodes which gives an entry-point for ipv6 compatible nodes to connect and advertise ipv6 support. This is also backwards compatible.\r\n\r\nNot to be released, but discuss some ideas/work towards automatic NAT hole punching, which may also help finding extra nodes on long-lived subnets. ",
