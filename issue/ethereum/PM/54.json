I was sick during the last meeting, sorry.\r\n\r\nJust some thoughts that I will raise before the call: \r\n\r\n- ~~858: this does not address the difficulty bomb at all. Unless someone champions to discuss this, we should drop it in this discussion. I just brought it up recently because I'm pedantic and this indirectly conflicts 1234 but should not be the focus part of this debate.~~ it does now.\r\n- 1227: I have not seen a single voice (apart from the author) that wants to increase the block reward, so it's safe to say we go with either status quo or reduce it (1234). Can provide some references at the call.\r\n\r\nAlso, now that hybrid Casper is off the table, we should discuss 958 again (ASIC resistance), there is a strong community sentiment in favour of having this dealt with. Edit: Just noticed, 958 is not an actual EIP. Not sure how to discuss this properly then.",

EIP 858 could be edited to include a difficulty bomb delay or a separate EIP could be authored. Without a bomb delay the network would halt. Nobody is arguing for that.",

Itâ€™ll all go down in flame. Even Joe Lubin, super bullish on everything Ethereum fears about price going to unsustainable levels.\r\nIf rewards reduction means a change in the algo to limit asics then fine.

    "body": "Hereâ€™s what we can expect from miners in opposition to the block reward reduction EIPs, along with thoughts on each one. \r\n\r\n**But Iâ€™m going to have to shut off my operations!**\r\n1) Mining is a commoditized, highly competitive business. Without continuous price growth, mining costs will trend up towards mining revenue in the long term. Therefore, no matter if the inflation is 7% or 50%, some miners will always be at risk of becoming unprofitable when inflation decreases. We are not in a unique situation here.\r\n\r\n2) If miners shut off their operations, it will be the least efficient miners shutting off first.  This lowers difficulty and increases profitability for remaining miners until we reach an equilibrium.  It's perfectly normal for the least-efficient miners to reach a point where they must upgrade their hardware/operational efficiency or risk becoming unprofitable. This is normal.\r\n\r\n3) Based on historical data, reduction in block reward has a very small effect on hashrate. (source: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DlTEyKBV4AERGtB.jpg:large).  If a miner does need to shut down because of a reduction in block reward with Constantinople, that means they were probably in the bottom few percent of miners by efficiency.\r\n\r\n**This is catching us completely by surprise!**\r\nThe difficulty bomb is hard-coded into the protocol, which would have gradually decreased mining revenues in the status quo. Last year, the difficulty bomb delay was coupled with a corresponding reduction in per-block-reward.  A reduction in block reward with Constantinople is not unexpected news.\r\n\r\n**Ethereum hashrate will plummet, causing the network to be vulnerable to attacks!**\r\nBased on historical data, reduction in block reward has a very small effect on hashrate. (source: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DlTEyKBV4AERGtB.jpg:large). Hashrate is currently well over 3x what is was at this time last year.\r\n\r\n**Bitmain will control the network if we decrease inflation, because ASICS**\r\nThereâ€™s no evidence of this. The Antminer E3 is marginally more efficient than the 1080 Ti in terms of hashes per unit electricity. Also, Bitmain has little to no ETH on their balance sheet according to their IPO docs. Yes, the new (not yet shipped/verified) Innosilicon A10 may be more efficient per hash than the 1080 ti but is also well over $5000 USD. And the NVIDIA 2080 Ti is also coming in September. Overall, this is not yet a major threat to the network and shouldnâ€™t preclude a reward reduction at this time. There will always be competing hardware, and some people will always have access to better hardware than others.  Though I do agree that it may be worth adding additional ASIC resistance into the protocol (but Iâ€™m not too informed on the tradeoffs to consider in that decision)\r\n",

Block rewards have dropped and hashrate has continued increasing. There's no period in history where a block reward has ever caused a massive decrease in hashrate. None. In all cases the hashrate reduction has been small and temporary. Would love to see data supporting otherwise.\r\n\r\nIt just doesn't make sense to say that block reward reduction from $17.5M/day to $10M/day coincides with a +5% increase in hashrate but another drop to $6.6M/day (what it would be at 2 ETH/block assuming no price change) would cause a massive, network-threatening drop in hashrate. Its just conjecture.",

    "body": "Hey all!\r\n\r\nTomorrow is the meeting and one of the agenda topics is potential issuance reduction. I have invited a number of guest participants to explain their opinion.\r\nThis includes:\r\n- a large mining pool.\r\n- a statement from the largest mining pool (pasted below).\r\n- a few smaller miners.\r\n- 2 Redditors in favor of an issuance reduction.\r\nThis is in addition to the normal participants and core developers.\r\n\r\nI sent an e-mail to these participants and will re-post it here for the sake of transparency:\r\n\r\n> Thank you for participating in the All Core Devs call tomorrow to discuss issuance reduction. It means a lot to get different perspectives from different stakeholders in the ecosystem.\r\n> \r\n> The meeting starts at 10AM US Eastern Time, 14:00 UTC (https://savvytime.com/converter/gmt-to-germany-berlin-united-kingdom-london-ny-new-york-city-ca-san-francisco-china-shanghai-japan-tokyo/2pm).\r\n> \r\n> The agenda for the meeting is located here: https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/54\r\n> \r\n> Here is how I imagine things going down:\r\n> 1. We discuss agenda items 1-4.\r\n> 2. Agenda item 5 is issuance reduction. I will have each participant involved in the discussion quickly introduce themselves and which EIP they support (if any). Please keep your intro to under 30 seconds.\r\n> 3. We will first discuss if there should be a reduction in issuance at all.\r\n> 4. We will use rough consensus to determine if there should be a reduction. If so we will discuss how much of a reduction.\r\n> \r\n> Here is where I think things stand right now. Miners seem to care more about implementing a new PoW algorithm in order to disable ASICs from mining on the network. There may be able to be a sort of compromise between issuance reduction and implementation of a new PoW algortihm such as ProgPoW (https://github.com/ifdefelse/ProgPOW#progpow---a-programmatic-proof-of-work). The timing of such a change is still up in the air, but as it stands getting it into Constantinople seems unlikely due to our timeline to prevent block times from increasing drastically. All of the above is speculation, but something to keep in mind. \r\n\r\n\r\nHere is the statement from Ethermine mining pool:\r\n\r\n> We have reached out to our miners and from their response it is clear that the most important point for them is to include a PoW change to obsolescence ASICS. Regarding the block reward, their opinion is somewhat ambivalent, some prefer an increase (obviously), some argue for it to remain the same and a small fraction wants it to be reduced. Regarding the difficulty bomb most of the argue for a delay and no complete removal. This is also the position Ethermine will take as a proxy for our miners.",

Bitmain is a chinese company no one except a few insiders truly knows what is really on thier books.\r\n\r\nEven if they are not mining directly as they claim I would expect they have some subsidaries not linked directly to the parent that they have sold thousands of Asics to.\r\n\r\nRemeber the hash rate spikes of oct 2017 and January 2018 , were all in times of extreme gpu shortages.  A basic brand rx580 was selling for $700 , A nvidia 1070ti was at $900 and all retailers were limiting sales to 1 gpu per month in somecases or 1 of any brand per order.\r\n\r\n yet the hashrate went up that month from 200k  if i remeber to 240k\r\n\r\nNo one could sell that many gpus at the time.  The october jump was even a worse scenario.... gpus were basically unavailable \r\n\r\nto the point larger farms were renting entire aircraft to buy directly from the source.\r\n\r\nIn that case the hash rate went from 90k to 150k in two months.\r\n\r\nIf you cant put two and two together still , you must work for an Asic manufacturer lol",

    "body": "There is basically zero profit right now for normal gpu miners , The majority of the inflatonary eth you are so worried about is going to large asic mega farms.  Dropping the issuance with no algo change basically seeds the entire pow network to them and thier Ilk. \r\n\r\nNo sane proposal would advocate for this \r\n\r\nLol if you think its bad for the holders of eth imgine the pain for miners , 20 percent less value of the mined asset and a 30 percent increase in the global hashrate as the sugar on top.\r\n\r\nMost miners I know have already quit",

    "body": "Yes, there are entirely way too many miners at this stage. A tsunami of miners flowed in back in January when this space was overheating. Now that this space has declined 80% to 90%, unfortunately, this space cannot support a billion miners anymore. What can I say? No one said life was fair. We all suffering here not just miners. No one has $3,000,000,000 to give to a billion miners anymore.\r\n\r\nSometimes things have to get worse before they get better. It's like pulling a cavity tooth. Yes, it hurts for a day but then you come out on the other end and you get better health afterward. \r\n\r\nTrust me as an economist, once Eth price starts to go back up miners will be happy again. \r\n\r\n",
