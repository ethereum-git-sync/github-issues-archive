    "body": "I've recently seen two major objections to EIP-2315.\r\n\r\n> 1. It did not provide security guarantees that it was not designed to provide.\r\n\r\nThe proposal we had previously  agreed to specified a simple two-stack mechanism for returning from jumping to and returning from subroutines.  No more, no less.  This mechanism was first proposed for EIP-615 in 2016, has been a standard approach since 1970, and should not be controversial by now.\r\n\r\nThe current Draft shows how to provide security guarantees.  Essentially: deprecate dynamic uses of JUMP and JUMPI, and use RETURNSUB rather than a dynamic jump to return from subroutines.  Precise rules are stated and an algorithm given for enforcing them.  When and how to start enforcing those rules can be a separate discussion.\r\n\r\nEIP-615 proposed immediate arguments to JUMPSUB, which are not backwards-compatible.  EIP-2315 requires instead that jump destinations be pushed as constants, and thus remains backwards-compatible.\r\n\r\n> 2. It did not provide evidence of potential users.\r\n\r\n_Such evidence would not be appropriate in a technical specification_.\r\n\r\nAt this point I can say that over the years that I have been working on subroutines for the EVM many people have expressed support for my proposals, especially people doing various forms of static analysis.  I cannot make a list, but it goes well beyond two compiler teams.  EIP-2315 has been publicly announced for long enough that there are no doubt others waiting to use it.\r\n\r\nSo far as compiler teams being users, if we do deprecate static jumps then all compiler teams will require another mechanism for returning from subroutines.  EIP-2315 provides a good one.",

The [EVM encapsulation format](https://notes.ethereum.org/@axic/evm-object-format#Encapsulation-format) I think is what the first step should be. From there we can impose rules on the EVM bytecode that will make evolution easier.  \r\n\r\nThe restrictions around multi-byte instructions because of the EVM's tolerance of invalid opcodes restricts too much space for evolution, and the design for subroutines suffered because of that.",
