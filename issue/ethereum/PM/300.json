  "body": "2-5 minutes to call for comments on EIP-3436, which proposes fork choice rules for clique.\r\n\r\nEIP - https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3436\r\n\r\nWithout these rules a clique network can deadlock with as few as 1 missing validator when all validators have seen all contested blocks. Goerli did so twice in early March prior to it's Berlin upgrade.\r\n\r\nGeth has the second rule already implemented (prefer the shorter chain) but that only addresses one of the early March deadlocks, as the second deadlock had equal height on both forks.  This proposes two more clique specific rules that should keep validators from deadlocking and provides an absolute ordering in the final case (lowest hash).\r\n\r\nThis does not impact any current or future hard fork for mainnet, so it can be prioritized appropriately.  The goal is to move it into final call if there are no counter-proposals.",
