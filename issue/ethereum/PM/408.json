In parallel, work with Barnabe and researchers to understand if this proposal solves the problem that actually needs to be solved\r\n-  In the next ACD meeting, Ansgar & Lightclient will explain why this proposal must get in with the Merge upgrade. The goal will be to get clients' consensus to proceed with the proposal.\r\n\r\n",
