  "body": "## Sept 19, 2022 Update\r\n\r\n**We discussed this issue on #616 and agreed to move forward with the process detailed [here](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/shanghai-core-eip-consideration/10777) while ACD/CL calls are paused.**\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n## Original Issue Text\r\n\r\nUsing this issue to keep track about conversations related to Shanghai planning. \r\n\r\nFirst discussed on ACD129, prompted by this comment: \r\n\r\n> Can we please discuss on what we want to concentrate for Shanghai? There are quite a few potential items, and it's unlikely that we'll manage to do all of them, so we'll have to pick which to work on first. I see the following candidates:\r\n> - [EIP-1153](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1153): Transient storage opcodes\r\n> - [EIP-2537](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2537): Precompile for BLS12-381 curve operations \r\n> - [EIP-2935](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2935): Save historical block hashes in state\r\n> - [EIP-3651](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3651): Warm COINBASE\r\n> - [EIP-3540](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3540): EVM Object Format (EOF) v1 + [EIP-3670](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3670), [EIP-3690](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3690), [EIP-4200](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4200)\r\n> - [EIP-3855](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3855): PUSH0 instruction\r\n> - [EIP-3860](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3860): Limit and meter initcode\r\n> - [EIP-4396](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4396): Time-Aware Base Fee Calculation\r\n> - [EIP-4444](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4444): Bound Historical Data in Execution Clients\r\n> - [EIP-4488](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4488): Transaction calldata gas cost reduction with total calldata limit\r\n> - [Statelessness gas cost changes](https://notes.ethereum.org/-fJSOrnYQl-mqoWKpaTIsQ) (Verkle Tree HF1) and the groundwork necessary for it (unhashed state + sync)\r\n> - Post-Merge Beacon ETH withdrawals\r\n\r\n> To clarify, the point is not to go through each and every of these proposals in detail during this call, but rather to get a feel of what we want to prioritize for Shanghai.",

They make for a big meal, but no bigger than EIP-615 was.  A reasonable order of inclusion would be as follows.\r\n\r\nThese are essential for most of the remainder.\r\n- [EIP-3540](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3540): EVM Object Format (EOF)\r\n- [EIP-3670](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3670): EOF - Code Validation\r\n- [EIP-3860](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3860): Limit and meter initcode\r\n\r\nThese provide static jumps and subroutines.   EIP-4200 does not depend on EIP-2315.\r\n- [EIP-4200](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4200): Static relative jumps\r\n- [EIP-2315](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2315): Simple Subroutines for the EVM\r\n\r\nThis specifies additional validation to constrain JUMP, JUMPI , static jumps and subroutines -- thus providing a higher level of safety than promised by EIP-615.  It depends on the object format, validation, static jumps, and subroutines.\r\n- [EIP-3779](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3779): Safer Control Flow for the EVM\r\n\r\nThis is in early design stage.  It provides multiple code sections, procedures with defined interfaces, and a frame stack for disciplined use of memory.\r\n- [EIP-4573](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4573): Entry Points and Procedures for EVM Code Sections \r\n\r\nAnd these are independent of the others, and can be included independently.\r\n- [EIP-3855](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3855): PUSH0 instruction\r\n- [EIP-1153](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1153): Transient storage opcodes\r\n",

The main options now are either the introduction of [blob-carrying transactions](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/459#issuecomment-1029529089) or, if too complex, EIP-4488-style CALLDATA cost reduction.

    "body": "To save some time, here are my thoughts around EIP-1153\r\n\r\n- It's a nice feature, of course we'd want it\r\n- However, it's been a backburner-nice-to-have since 2018, the reason (I think) being that it doesn't revolutionize anything, just makes certain usecases easier/cheaper/(safer?). \r\n- And it is quite nontrivial to implement, \r\n- And also needs a lot of efforts to fully test\r\n- The implementation must also be tested from a DoS perspective (a quick napkin calculation tells me that with `30M` gas, up to `9MB` of data can be stored, which is probably fine, but there are journalling to take into consideration too -- this would entail a journal with 300K items to roll back)\r\n- Unfortunately, we have a _lot_ of things competing for inclusion in Shanghai. In \"competition\" with those, I would _not_ pick 1153 to be selected. \r\n- Also, I'd be curious to hear what @AlexeyAkhunov thinks about it. Still want it? ",
