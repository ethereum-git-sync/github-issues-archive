About EIP86 (a.k.a EIP-208), there is a difference between the EIP pull-request and the implementations. Which should be fixed?\r\n3. Metropolis updates - specifically an update on where each client is at in implementation and an update on the tests. Some accepted EIPs are not yet specific enough to form a protocol consensus. What is the next action by whom?\r\n\r\nPlease provide comments to add or correct agenda topics.",
