Testing & [EIP 1085](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1085): Common genesis.json format scheme across all client implementations\r\n2. Client Updates\r\n3. Research Updates\r\n4. [EIP 908: Reward clients for a sustainable network - When each transaction is validated, give a reward to clients for developing the client](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-908) - When each transaction is validated, give a reward to clients for developing the client and provide a reward to full nodes for validating the transaction ([Ethereum Magicians thread](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-908-reward-full-nodes-and-clients-for-a-sustainable-network/)).\r\n5. [EIP 1057: ProgPOW, a programmatic Proof-of-Work](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1057) - an alternate proof-of-work algorithm - “ProgPoW” - tuned for commodity hardware in order to close the efficiency gap available to specialized ASICs. [Technical details](https://github.com/ifdefelse/ProgPOW#progpow---a-programmatic-proof-of-work).\r\n6. [EIP 210](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-210): Blockhash refactoring - @holiman wants to finalize a few points:\r\n  a. the original intent (no semantic changes to `BLOCKHASH` -- only gas changes) versus the current spec (semantic changes), and \r\n  b. whether to make it nicer to ABI-call it, and \r\n  c. whether to add genesis lookup in there. \r\n  d. Fixes for EIP-210 blockhash contract: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/1094.\r\n[See this summary document](https://notes.ethereum.org/s/HJXvL-h0f#).\r\n7. [EIP 1051](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1051): Overflow checking for the EVM\r\n8. [EIP 1052](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1052): EXTCODEHASH Opcode\r\n9. [EIP 1087](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIP/eip-1087): Net gas metering for SSTORE operations\r\n10. Concerns that using native browser VMs for running eWasm is not DoS hardened. See [this comment](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/40#issuecomment-390006104\r\n) and [this comment](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/40#issuecomment-390114286).\r\n11. Constantinople hard fork timing and what to include (continuing conversation from last call).\r\n12. Core dev meeting discussion & changes - scope of agenda items, role of participants, etc.\r\n\r\nPlease provide comments to add or correct agenda topics.",

I read it not as a technical specification of exactly what needs to be implemented when, but instead a discussion about an interesting idea. What I want from an EIP is to be able to see the _exact_ steps that a client/evm/transaction processor will need to change.\r\n\r\nBased on that, there can be a technical discussion about consequences, drawbacks, benefits, complexity etc. Right now, I think it's too vague to actually have a discussion around.

And these would be weird cases where the not-mining results in high-value auctions not going to the highest bidder etc. The second best way would be if the hash rate tripled in a short period of time and that period of time was outside the normal explained by many people joining the system.\r\n\r\nRegarding forking. I am always against forking if possible. Because of my work I have been pitching Ethereum to banks, big-4 consulting firms and other mature industries. They are almost always only considering hyperledger. When I talk about Ethereum their first question is \"who owns it\" and then \"what is the governance process\"? My answer is \"the people that have commit access\" and \"in 15 minutes they can push a change that will basically auto-update the whole network\". If we want to change this reputation and actually change the underlying truth then we will need to defend vigorously against unnecessary forks.\r\n\r\nIf you are still vying for 1057 and have new arguments then let's continue this discussion there. You can @-mention me there.",
