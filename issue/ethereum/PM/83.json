I don't think it's necessarily a role, it's just doing the work. I have stuck my hand up to volunteer for the communication, project management, and organization so far, and have been doing the work. There still needs to be a technical expert role as well. Should we write down what we want from the role / what the tasks are? Is this something that will be compensated? If it's not compensated, unclear why we need this as a label.\r\n\r\nI am not against the label, but want to understand the purpose of it. As well, having someone responsible for the next hardfork, and deciding if that is 6 months or 9 months after Istanbul, would also be good to flesh out.\r\n\r\n## In Person Meetings\r\n\r\nOn 2(e), the [Istanbul & ETH1x Roadmap Planning meeting, April 17th & 18th, is now confirmed](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/istanbul-eth1x-roadmap-planning-meeting-april-17th-18th-in-berlin/2899) -- please let us know if you're coming [via the signup form](https://goo.gl/forms/3B7t932MY23E19Dw1).\r\n\r\nIf we want to meet again, that timing should be decided soon, so that people can plan ahead.\r\n\r\nDepending on what the goals of the meeting are, either late July (post July 19th implementation deadline) or mid September (post Aug 14th testnet upgrade).",

    "body": "> Requesting to add again EIP-1418 for discussion. Code owner @AlexeyAkhunov\r\n\r\nThank you for writing this EIP! Now I finally looked at it closer thank before. This is a state rent EIP created in September 2018. It is mostly in line with the series of pre-EIP proposals I have been publishing (though with different terminology, for example, stipend vs pre-payment, name of the fields are different), though with some differences (for example, it requires eviction priority queue that was in State Rent proposal 1 and was then removed for simplicity) and with some things not explicitly spelled out (like contract recovery, or the way the contract storage size is introduced). I think it is not practical to try to encompass the state rent into 1 EIP. I would like to ask @fulldecent to consider this EIP to be subsumed by State Rent research happening within Ethereum 1x working group.",
