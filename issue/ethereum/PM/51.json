[EIP-858](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/858) - Reduce block reward to 1 ETH per block.\r\n    b. [EIP-1227](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/1235) - Delay bomb and change rewards to 5 ETH.\r\n    c. [EIP-1234](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/1234) - Delay bomb and change rewards to 2 ETH.\r\n    d. [EIP-1240](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/1240) - Remove the difficulty bomb entirely.\r\n5. Constantinople hard fork timing and what to include (continuing conversation from last call).\r\n  a. [EIP 145: Bitwise shifting instructions in EVM](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-145.md): pretty well-formed, but not 100% implemented or tested.\r\n  b. [EIP 210: Blockhash refactoring](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/210).\r\n  d. [EIP 1052: EXTCODEHASH Opcode](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1052).\r\n  e.

    "body": "I build [miximus](https://github.com/barrywhitehat/miximus) and [semaphore](https://github.com/barryWhiteHat/semaphore) both of which will use the ec verification. Currently this costs ~2.5 USD which is quite expensive. There are some optimizations I can do such as using [Groth16](https://github.com/barryWhiteHat/miximus/issues/20) but reducing the op code price is still the biggest reduce in this cost that is available. \r\n\r\nRough Data:\r\nWith groth16 we're down to 560k gas\r\nWith EIP 1187, we'd be down to 230k\r\nWith EIP 1108, we'd be down to 108k\r\n\r\nThere is some problems with the current curve altbn128 which can have its security reduced to ~110 bits using a [number sive optimization](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/1102.pdf) so [zcash is moing to a new curve](https://blog.z.cash/new-snark-curve/)  which i would like to follow them to because of \r\n\r\n1. It brings security back to 128 bits. \r\n2. I can reuse other zcash tools like bellman easily. \r\n3. I can use the jub jub curve that they embedded to make pedersen commitments. Which will reduce the proving requiremtns from 7 mintues (currently, tho with optimizations i can get to 40 seconds but requires a few GB of RAM) to 7 seconds (40 mb of memory)\r\n4. I can use jubjub to make a signature scheme that is varifiable inside a snark. Which would allow me to batch transactions together and do some really cool scaling stuff. \r\n\r\nI raised the idea of adding BLS12-381 privately with some core devs and their opinions were to wait for EWASM. I can still do 3 and 4 in the current curve but i lose on the benefit of using zcash's and already quite well reviewed work. \r\n\r\nTL;DR \r\n1. Update gas prices for EC OPs as EIP 1187 EIP 1108 is definitely a good idea with very little downside. \r\n2. BLS12-381 would be nice but if not its not the end of the world. And i will just follow them with EWASM. ",

    "body": "The higher the mining reward, the more expensive it is to double spend with less than 50% hashing power.  If you assume no single actor controls 50% of hashing power then higher mining rewards translates to fewer confirmations needed to secure (economically) a transaction since the number confirmations required for strong economic guarantees of finality is a function of total value transferred per second and miner reward per second (including fees).\r\n\r\nA chain with little value transfer per second has significantly less need for hashing power than a chain with more value transfer per second, so I think comparing chains is not a useful measure here.\r\n\r\nWhat would be a useful measure is an idea of how much value is transferred per second on Ethereum, since this dictates how much money an attacker can make via a double spend attempt.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this is very hard to compute for Ethereum due to contracts having non-eth value transfers.  Also, the above analysis ignores attackers with greater than 50% hashing power, which is a bigger problem with small chains.",

    "body": "With today's current profitability, a miner buying a brand new GPU will likely take ~1.5 years to pay off. ASIC's have entered the market, if purchased today it would take ~.5 years to pay off. That is to say that the current price, reward per block, difficulty, block time, and network hashrate do not change. Even with current delays to POS, I would and have advised someone not to purchase any mining equipment due to issues with profitability. By decreasing the rewards per block without lowering block times and difficulty, you will have effectively cut of GPU mining in favor of ASIC. Furthermore, operation costs maybe become to high, GPU's will be turned off first due to the higher operating costs and network hashrate will drop, again favoring ASIC.",
