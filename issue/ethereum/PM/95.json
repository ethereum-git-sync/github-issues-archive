It has been de-facto inactive. We would like to re-connect with the Swarm team next month to discover if it is possible to re-form this group together with the Swarm team.\r\n2) Emulation/Simulation. We had presentation from Vanessa at Standford, and Zak at Berlin meeting, which was cool. However, it is not currently clear how to proceed here. More discussions and clarification needed if we were to bring this group back.\r\n\r\nAnother Working Group is required around Consensus Tests (the work Dmitry is currently doing), but it is not clear yet how this group would be structured, because it is unique in the sense that it addresses a cross-cutting concern, rather than focuses on a specific set of changes in Ethereum.\r\n\r\nRegarding Turbo-Geth, still mostly using it for the Stateless Clients prototyping (now \"Shades of Statefulness\"). But there are plans to move some of the code into another client to allow a larger team to work on it.",

Are we sure these are not already implemented by someone ? Google/Cloudflare?\r\n\r\nYes, I'm aware of this problem and there are two options for this:\r\n- Sacrifice the efficiency \r\n- There is a trick of making Go to call external C library without such overhead using some assembly.\r\n\r\nBenchmarks will show if overhead is comparable to execution time or not, but in the worst case the second approach can be taken.\r\n\r\n",
