  "body": "Given that the difficulty bomb is expected to go off sometime in July, we will want London to hit mainnet then. \r\n\r\nIf we want a reasonable delay between picking blocks, going live on testnets, and going live on mainnet, this means we need to roughly follow the following timeline:\r\n* July: Mainnet\r\n* June: Testnets\r\n* May: Blocks chosen, London testing done \r\n* April: Select final EIPs + Reference Testing + Wrap up ephemeral network testing \r\n* March: Select initial EIPs + Start ephemeral network testing \r\n\r\nIn other words, given we are already late-February, we should start thinking about what we want to see included in the London  YOLO-nets (along with the difficulty bomb pushback (see [EIP-3238](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3238))) if we want to not be rushed in implementation and deployment. This will be a bit of a change from our current process, as we'll need to start working on London before Berlin is live. ",

    "body": "I'd like to raise the point that if we go for this planning, we essentially end up having to plan two HFs in parallel (also Berlin #248). This is uncovered ground. This would also imply that (assuming that the scheduled Berlin HF time is accepted) we would have a gap of about 2.5 months between the two forks. This is very little time. In the past, we have seen that, due to circumstances, we usually end up delaying these HFs. I'd therefore say that this planning is very optimistic.\r\n\r\nI'm a bit afraid that in practice, this is going to happen:\r\n\r\n(1) We schedule Berlin around the time when the difficulty bomb kicks in (I also consider 2.5 months before it \"around\" this time).\r\n(2) Due to parallel HF planning, we end up that London gets delayed a lot (assuming London has additional EIPs besides the difficulty bomb delay which is likely to be in this HF). Due to the difficulty bomb kicking in, we end up that London would be a MuirGlacier-like fork (only delay the bomb), which would be unfortunate.",

    "body": "> I'd like to raise the point that if we go for this planning, we essentially end up having to plan two HFs in parallel (also Berlin #248). This is uncovered ground. This would also imply that (assuming that the scheduled Berlin HF time is accepted) we would have a gap of about 2.5 months between the two forks. This is very little time. In the past, we have seen that, due to circumstances, we usually end up delaying these HFs. I'd therefore say that this planning is very optimistic.\r\n> \r\n> I'm a bit afraid that in practice, this is going to happen:\r\n> \r\n> (1) We schedule Berlin around the time when the difficulty bomb kicks in (I also consider 2.5 months before it \"around\" this time).\r\n> (2) Due to parallel HF planning, we end up that London gets delayed a lot (assuming London has additional EIPs besides the difficulty bomb delay which is likely to be in this HF). Due to the difficulty bomb kicking in, we end up that London would be a MuirGlacier-like fork (only delay the bomb), which would be unfortunate.\r\n\r\nI agree to focus on Berlin and combine it with difficulty bomb reset ",

    "body": "_(Apologies in advance for the long comment!)_\r\n\r\nLondon timing was brought up extensively again in ACD 110 today. \r\n\r\nThere are a few factors to consider here, namely:\r\n1. The difficulty bomb going off;\r\n2. The fact that there may not be another feature fork post-London;\r\n3. The desire to keep London slim to get 1559 deployed ASAP and ship London before (1) happens; \r\n4. The community support we've seen for some proposals (e.g. 3074) and the time it would take to implement/audit them. \r\n\r\n@vbuterin helped roughly estimate when the difficulty bomb would go off, using the following code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> current_blknum = 12252201\r\n>>> blocks_per_month = (86400 * 30) // 13\r\n>>> future_blknum = current_blknum + blocks_per_month * 4\r\n>>> diff_adjustment = 2 ** ((future_blknum - 9000000) // 100000 - 2)\r\n>>> current_difficulty = 6467102703670090 \r\n>>> diff_adjust_coeff = diff_adjustment / current_difficulty * 2048\r\n>>> diff_adjust_coeff\r\n0.0870482469842078\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis means that 4 months from today (120 days), on August 14th, we are likely going to see a ~9% increase in difficulty due to the bomb. At 3 months (90 days, July 15th), that value is ~2%, and for 5 months (150 days, Sept 13), it is ~34%. This implies that the latest we realistically want to fork mainnet would be around mid-August: beyond that, the bomb's effects worsen rapidly. \r\n\r\nAssuming mid-week forks, this is what timelines could look like for a July vs. August London:\r\n\r\n| Date        | July London        | August London   |\r\n| -------- |:-----------------:|:----------------:|\r\n| Aug 11    |                               | Mainnet Fork     |\r\n| July 21   |                               | Rinkeby Fork     | \r\n| July 14    | Mainnet Fork       | Gorli Fork           |\r\n| July 7     |                              | Ropsten Fork     |\r\n| June 23 | Rinkeby Fork      | Clients Released |\r\n| June 23 | Gorli Fork            |                              |\r\n| June 16 | Ropsten Fork      | Client Freeze      |\r\n| June 2  | Clients Released |                             |\r\n| May 19  | Clients Freeze    |                             | \r\n\r\nIt seems to me that if we want to ship London in July, then we need to agree to a final set of EIPs in the next ~2 weeks. On the other hand, if we want more time to decide (and get the results of the pending 3074 audit, for example) because we believe that this is the last change to include potentially valuable changes for a long time due to the merge, then we can aim for London to happen mid-August and give ourselves a bit more breathing room.

    "body": "Difficulty bomb update, courtesy of @tjayrush of [TrueBlocks](https://github.com/TrueBlocks): \r\n\r\n**TL;DR**: we can expect the difficulty bomb to become noticeable in ~300k blocks, or in ~45 days at around block 12900000. Blocks 1 (July 28) & 2 (August 4) [proposed for mainnet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y3yyTqeqRO1O2UFVkNkHK_V5oRulZd6y-JJbSnKYrb4/edit#gid=2083529482) would fall in this period, while blocks 3 & 4 would happen after the next difficulty bomb increase. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFrom @tjayrush: \r\n\r\n![YhcYMKnH](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9390255/122973275-ea2db400-d345-11eb-8e8c-8988ead45916.jpg)\r\n\r\n> You can see from the first epoch that the green line bends down when the block start slowing down. I'm not see any lowering, but I expect it will start to bend soon. \r\n\r\n![_ktYef9B](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9390255/122973385-07628280-d346-11eb-8308-268d1190d393.jpg)\r\n\r\n> This chart shows that the bomb is basically flat until it starts to explode and then it explode more and more quickly. You can just barely see it starting to appear at the very right hand side. You can judge it compared to the other explosions. Each step is a 100,000 block period.\r\n\r\n![8JwbyqU_](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9390255/122973505-29f49b80-d346-11eb-911f-983d148d67a5.jpg)\r\n\r\n> This one shows the various bombs laid on top of each other. The vertical line is where the previous bombs started appearing. You can see that as the height of the bubbles goes lower (slower blocks). Different bombs gets slower depending on hash rate, but it's not noticeable until it gets further into the bomb.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ",

    "body": "> while blocks 3 & 4 would happen after the next difficulty bomb increase.\r\n\r\nEven after that, the effect won't be that large. You can see this in the first chart above. It usually takes a few periods after crossing the horizontal dashed line before its effect becomes observable.\r\n\r\nThe other two charts show the same thing. You can summarize the way it behaves like this: \"Blocks take 14 seconds and are perfectly predictable until they're not\" and \"You have enough time once the bomb starts becoming apparent to respond.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the things that I'm trying to dispel with these charts is the thought that predicting when the bomb will happen is hard to predict. It's not. It's quite easy.\r\n\r\nIt's more difficult to predict how quickly it will get bad once it starts appearing, but it's easy to see it coming.",
