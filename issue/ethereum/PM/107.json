It doesn't touch consensus, just makes network peering more robust by defining a `forkid` that peers can advertise and cross validate, allowing them to more easily decide if a remote peer will be useful or not (same chain, same forks).\r\n\r\nThe EIP only **defines** this *fork identifier*, it does not care how it is exchanged between peers. The reason is to keep the schema definition separate from networking details (we'd include it in the `eth` handshake and `enr` too, but those require their own EIPs, so better keep this one short).\r\n\r\nWe would definitely like to include a preliminary version of this in Geth v1.9.0 to see how helpful it is; and I don't think many people here care much about networking experiments, especially ENR and discovery v5 extensions, but we though we should nonetheless mention it if anyone wishes to discuss it before we roll it out in its current form.\r\n\r\n- Current EIP text (not yet merged, not even in draft): https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/9f8e59d0f39418df350811be8cb02fa7be14d3a3/EIPS/eip-2124.md\r\n- EIP PR: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/2124",

The aleph team can judge how much time they would need to finish the job.\r\n- It did not go through Last Call when it should have because there was a time when Core EIPs did not go through that process.\r\n- It has been under discussion in the community for a long time, saw a lot of review as an EIP issue, was formally specification by @seed, and has been under review on the Magicians for three months.\r\n- If we still do want a Last Call we need to schedule it. I am unavailable the week of July 15.\r\n\r\nRegardless, I'm wanting to get to some consensus fairly soon as to whether we are moving this forward, whether in this fork or a later one.",
