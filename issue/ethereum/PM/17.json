A transaction hash no longer uniquely identifies an execution, since a transaction at least theoretically can be included in multiple blocks, or multiple times in a block.\r\n             ii. Do we need to modify rpc-call which assumes hash = unique execution, to return a list of transactions instead of a single element?\r\n            iii. What side-effects does the breaking of this invariant have on the clients?\r\n\r\nIt was in last weeks and I'm not sure we came to conclusions on every point.",

    "body": "EIP 186 Comments from chat channel\r\n\r\nVitalik: \"I want to re-bring up EIP 186; I think we are more than secure enough with ETH at these levels (or even at $50) and wasting more electricity than some countries is tragic so we could use a decrease\"\r\n\r\nAvsa: \"The plan for Casper is to start with a slow transition from PoW, right? Is the idea to have a slowly decreasing reward? Maybe if we set a slowly decreasing schedule now - which then has a slight uptick when PoS comes around, it might be an actual incentive for miners to move to the PoS chain when that is ready\"\r\n\r\n\"I am also tentatively in favor of it with we can justify it in terms of incentiziation. I am against it if it’s heavily dependent on ether price or if it’s about pure economic planning\r\nMaybe what is needed for this conversation to move forward is a clear proposal with numbers backing it up: reduce to X on Y date then changes to N when PoS comes etc. We also need to account for black swans: what if the new ice age comes, Casper isn't ready and ether is under $20?\"\r\n\r\nNick: \"My own opinion on this has evolved; I'm tentatively in favor of at least a modest reduction.\r\nExactly because it's a step towards the reduced issuance Casper is likely to have.\"",
