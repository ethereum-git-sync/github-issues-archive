    "body": "I'd like to bring up https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/603 - the only curve being added to Byzantium/Constantinople is alt_bn128 and limiting the network to that has some disadvantages:\r\n\r\n- No JS implementation of that curve (and not many easy-to-use implementations in general)\r\n- Curve is more complicated as it has groups G1 and G2 and knowing which one to use and how to use them leads to more mistakes if you're just trying to use it as a non bilinear curve\r\n- Basically completely unsupported by the community compared to secp256k1\r\n- With just alt_bn128 opcodes smart contracts are unable to manipulate transaction signatures for native ethereum transactions, which is a big drawback as if you did have those opcodes you could do cool things like check aggregate signatures and whatnot\r\n\r\nThere are many smart contracts right now that use a solidity secp256k1 eclib that assumed that secp256k1 opcodes were going to be added in metropolis, and rewriting them (correctly) to use alt_bn128 is non-trivial if you don't understand the properties of that curve.\r\n\r\nI think it's worth considering adding this EIP for Constantinople, it's an easy 5 line addition in the major clients as they already have to support secp256k1 by default, and the curve itself has been heavily profiled and studied so there shouldn't be any surprises in terms of gas costs. It would be beneficial to the smart contract dev community to add a curve that has wide support in terms of libs and tooling, as well as it being the curve that native txs use for sigs in Ethereum and many other major cryptocurrencies (which is useful if you're implementing relays/pegs).",

    "body": "Wow... I personally believe this is also ridiculous, while I was championing the other side of the issuance reduction with many other miners, this is taking it too far. I'm not a fan of HFs with new chains coming online, I believe it devalues the entire community by doing so but I also have to say this, you made a change without consulting the part of the community it most affected. You talk all the time about community consensus yet did no due diligence with the community into this change other than 'a few reddit posts' as Hundson repeated many times and an outdated, extremely biased carbon vote from a completely different EIP.\r\n\r\nYou then proceeded to justify the change in an extremely underhanded way, that it pays miners the same post fork than what they got before due to your negligence by not pushing back the difficulty bomb when it should have been done. When you finally do try to explain why it is happening and give reasoning around it (after multiple attempts by us to have you do so), you tell us 'Well it's too late to change anything now either way as testing is in progress' so we really have to take those reasons with a grain of salt. This is what happens when you put yourselves forward as a team who works on community consensus and then ignores a massive part of it.\r\n\r\nWhile I do hope this dies out quickly and we can all continue to work together, united behind ETH and the ETH community, I really do hope you guys have learned from this for future updates.",
