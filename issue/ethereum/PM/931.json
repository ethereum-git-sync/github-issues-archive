(Considering the proposal is already in \"Final\" status and may not accept any specs change even if suggested during testing with other EIPs.)\r\n\r\n- Should we move the file for EIP-7212 out of EIPs GitHub Repo as it is now being pursued as a Rollup proposal instead of an \"Ethereum mainnet\" proposal?\r\n\r\nIf we choose, \"Standard Track - Core\" for RIP proposals, we must consider updating [EIP-1](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1#eip-types) according to which \r\n>  `Standard Track - Core` are improvements requiring a consensus fork as well as changes that are not necessarily consensus critical but may be relevant to [“core dev” discussions](https://github.com/ethereum/pm). \r\n\r\nI'd appreciate the client devs' and EIP/RIP Editors' responses.
