That alpha *will not* be updated in time for Capella (but might be for Goerli/mainnet). Anyone using it shouldn't expect it to survive Capella. No one should be using it for production, anyway.",

[#244](https://github.com/ethereum/beacon-APIs/issues/244), happy to progress it if there's a PR, probably not going to get to the beacon-api PR first at this point, though I have raised a teku issue for it. SSE subscriptions are possible from the teku perspective, if that's what's required.  Endpoints would potentially be more reliable, you may miss things if a disconnect happens at a bad time.\r\n\r\nRe. [#301](https://github.com/ethereum/beacon-APIs/issues/301), potentially makes more sense to me than SSE, but happy to look at both.\r\n\r\nWhile on the topic of beacon-apis, it's becoming a blocker that the 1.3 spec is not yet released. beacon-apis was waiting for 1.3 to be versioned so we could release the Capella api version, but now 1.3 seems to be leaking a lot of Deneb configuration, it's starting to look like we won't be making a clean version of the beacon-apis before merging all the Deneb endpoints into the spec.\r\n\r\nIf we could get guidance on the plan for the spec, whether 1.3 is going to be wrapped up for Capella, or if it's continuing on? Otherwise at the moment the beacon-apis is basically stalled.\r\n",
