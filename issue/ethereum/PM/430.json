  "body": "# Result update: It will be **`Bellatrix`** ✨\r\n\r\n\r\n## Breakout Room Announcement\r\n### Let's make it finalized in the breakout room call\r\n- **Meeting Date/Time**: Monday 2021/12/20 at 14:30 GMT\r\n- **Meeting Duration**: no more than 1 hour\r\n- **Zoom link**:  https://us02web.zoom.us/j/81803836899?pwd=N0srSDljVUlDYXRGVkRtNWoyUFRyZz09\r\n- All \"B-\" star name candidates: https://notes.ethereum.org/@hww/stars-of-B\r\n- **Agenda**:\r\n    - talk about the candidates\r\n    - vote via zoom polling or emojis\r\n\r\nAnyone who wants to champion your favorite candidate, welcome to join the call!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Background\r\nThis is a proposal of continuing using star name themes in CL protocol upgrades (HFs).  💫\r\n\r\nIt was previously discussed in [EthMagicians thread](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/ethereum-roadmapping-improvements/6653), previous implementers calls, and Eth R&D discord. But we haven't made a decision yet.\r\n\r\nI think  the rough consensus is:\r\n1. Name CL upgrades with some star names.\r\n2. Post-merges, either we keep naming EL upgrades with city names OR changing to star names.\r\n\t* The former would be more flexible. If we have a CL+EL release, `Capella-Cancun` sounds not bad.\r\n\t* The latter is simpler if the future CL/EL upgrades are also bound together.\r\n\r\nAnyways, it’s time to choose a B-star name for CL!\r\n\r\nThe benefits are:\r\n* There are so many cases that devs use the terminology “merge” but not about The Merge in code.\r\n    - Or on the other hand, it was funny to see a The Merge PR with a *[DO NOT MERGE]* label.\r\n* For git blame hygiene, the earlier we decide it, the sooner we can move/rename the directories and files.\r\n\r\n## Action proposal\r\n- [x]  Nominate the name candidates in the thread until **Dec 13th**\r\n    - Hint: It's good to add some **description of why this star name is cool!**\r\n- [x] Choose the top 4 popular names\r\n    - To GitHub users: please use **positive emojis** (👍) to signal your preferences!\r\n- [x] Finalize the name [Dec 20th]\r\n    - Option 1: Have another [POAP.vote](https://poap.vote)\r\n        - The previous vote elected [Altair](https://poap.vote/poll/46)\r\n        - Vote period: TBD\r\n    - Option 2: Make decision in implementers call on Dec 16th\r\n    - Option 3: Make a decision in the Breakout room meeting\r\n\r\n~~Let's discuss the proposal and timeline in the call today (#429)~~\r\n\r\n## Good name properties\r\n\r\nIMO the good code name has to be:\r\n* Alphabetical order, the second HF should **start with B**\r\n* Not too long for typing\r\n* Not too short to cause confusion\r\n* Uniqueness\r\n* Neutral, not negative\r\n* Bonus: a star that is visible with naked eyes 👀\r\n",

Perhaps we can find something based on the B-star for (B). [Arcadia Planitia](https://news.westernu.ca/2021/05/mars-glaciers/) is the name of a region on Mars with \"glaciers\" :-) \r\n\r\nFor (C), I can channel my inner Danny Ryan and say that \"serenity is about scalability and pos and The Merge is only half those things\". (C) really is The Merge, imo. I think we should keep using this as there's already some community awareness around it. ",

    "body": "[`Beta Lyrae`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_Lyrae) is a close binary star: not one, but _two_ stars in close enough orbit that their [Roche Lobes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roche_lobe) have overlapped. One of the stars is large, faint, and slowly losing mass to the other, while the second is small, hot, and gaining mass over time. The denser star is surrounded by a thick accretion disk that shoots out jets from this ongoing mass transfer. (It probably looks pretty cool. Here's an [artist's rendering](https://iaaa.org/beta-lyrae/)).\r\n\r\nThe larger, now-shrinking star probably evolved first, and was originally the more massive of the two. Once its fuel was depleted and its time had come, it grew into a giant, merged with the gravitational pull of its partner, and started slowly transferring its mass. \r\n\r\nMaybe this is all too tortured a metaphor for The Merge, but there's a story here about two systems in close orbit evolving together into one. (Check with a real astronomer, though. I'm just a guy who took \"Intro to Astronomy\" ten years ago and read a bunch of stuff on Wikipedia!).\r\n",
