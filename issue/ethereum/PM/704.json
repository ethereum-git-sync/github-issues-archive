    "body": "Part of the SSZ-ification of the trees in the block is not just the tree commitment, but also how the list items get embedded as leaf values. Current MPT has 32+ long values and thus hashes them, not entirely sure, but seems like this behavior overlaps with the tx-hash behavior. With SSZ depending on the integration, we might lose that: i.e. you can't reconstruct the root of the tree from just the tx-hashes as values (as currently available in the `eth_getBlockByNumber(n, false)` RPC). And CL definitely doesn't have this (different hash function, hash-tree-rooted opaque-tx bytes).\r\n\r\nWe'd have to modify the CL to not make a HTR of opaque txs, but of the keccak hashed opaque txs (if the tx hashing even stays consistent between all future tx types) ",

    "body": "I think if anything we want to drive more things to SSZ, rather than pulling RLP or MPT concepts into the consensus layer.\r\n\r\nThis is what I think we should aim for:\r\n\r\n1. `receipt_root`: define a SSZ-encoding `Receipt` for receipts and replace this root with the hash tree root of a `List<Receipt, SOME_BOUND>`\r\n2. `transactions_root`: define a SSZ-encoding `Transaction` for all transaction types and replace this root with the hash tree root of a `List<Transaction, SOME_BOUND>`\r\n3. `withdrawals_root`: define a SSZ-encoding `Withdrawal` for the withdrawal object and replace this root with the hash tree root of a `List<Withdrawal, SOME_BOUND>`\r\n\r\nNote: the `state_root` will change in spirit w/ the move to Verkle tries. Everything else has a \"flat\" RLP encoding that isn't too bad to work with no matter which layer of the stack you are standing on.\r\n\r\nAnother idea from discussing this with @etan-status is to change how `block_hash` is computed -- keep data as-is but define a `Header` format where the block hash is now the hash tree root of this `Header` object.\r\n\r\nAnd if we really want to go all the way, we can even consider swapping big-endian RLP data to little-endian SSZ data so that the headers match across EL and CL. But I feel this may be too invasive of a change.",
