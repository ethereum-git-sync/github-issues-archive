  "body": "I am using hardhat and trying to run the SMTChecker. Normal compilation (sans checker) works fine, but a very simple contract (e.g., just `AccessControl`), will consistently cause a crash, apparently due to running out of memory (the particular error message varies, but I have seen the crash occur at the point that total system memory usage maxes out). This should repro on Ubunto 20.04 and 22.04.1, and on solidity 0.8.9 , 0.8.15, and 0.8.16, and with or without high system memory usage prior to compilation. The issue doesn't repro with a completely empty contract, but will repro when an empty contract imports `AccessControl`. `AccessControl` is a pretty fundamental tool, so I think the checker is hard to use for much if it crashes on even that. In one case, I tried to use the `contracts` setting to limit the checker to just the main contract, but this didn't work for my complex contract. I also tried turning off optimization for the dummy contract, but this didn't seem to help.\r\n\r\nFollow up question - since SMTChecker isn't working, what _should_ i do?\r\nThere are an enormous number of verification options, and I'm having a hard time figuring out which is best.\r\nIdeally, I'd like something pretty rigorous (or else I might as well just test) but also pretty easy to use.\r\nSince I've already written a bunch of assertions targeting the SMTChecker, ideally I'd get some other system to check these assertions, perhaps w/ minor tweaks.\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nExample error message:\r\n```\r\nPress ENTER or type command to continue\r\nAn unexpected error occurred:\r\n\r\nRangeError [ERR_CHILD_PROCESS_STDIO_MAXBUFFER]: stdout maxBuffer length exceeded\r\n    at new NodeError (node:internal/errors:371:5)\r\n    at Socket.onChildStdout (node:child_process:461:14)\r\n    at Socket.emit (node:events:520:28)\r\n    at Socket.emit (node:domain:475:12)\r\n    at addChunk (node:internal/streams/readable:315:12)\r\n    at readableAddChunk (node:internal/streams/readable:285:11)\r\n    at Socket.Readable.push (node:internal/streams/readable:228:10)\r\n    at Pipe.onStreamRead (node:internal/stream_base_commons:190:23) {\r\n  code: 'ERR_CHILD_PROCESS_STDIO_MAXBUFFER',\r\n  cmd: '/home/un/.cache/hardhat-nodejs/compilers/linux-amd64/solc-linux-amd64-v0.8.9+commit.e5eed63a --standard-json'\r\n}\r\n\r\nshell returned 1\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version: 0.8.9, 0.8.15, 0.8.16\r\n- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): IDK?\r\n- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): vim lol\r\n- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: IDK? just trying to compile w/ checks\r\n- Operating system: Ubuntu 20.04, Ubuntu 22.04.1\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nContract:\r\n```\r\n// Contract based on https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/erc1155\r\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\r\npragma solidity ^0.8.9;\r\n\r\nimport \"@openzeppelin/contracts/access/AccessControl.sol\";\r\n\r\ncontract Ctr is AccessControl {\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHardhat config:\r\n```\r\n/**\r\n * @type import('hardhat/config').HardhatUserConfig\r\n */\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n   solidity: {\r\n     version: \"0.8.9\",\r\n     settings: {\r\n       optimizer: {\r\n         enabled: true,\r\n         runs: 1000\r\n       },\r\n       modelChecker: {\r\n         engine: 'all',\r\n       }\r\n     }\r\n   },\r\n   networks: {\r\n      hardhat: {},\r\n   },\r\n}\r\n```\r\nrun `npx hardhat compile`",

I'm not really sure why I didn't see this complaint before - I'd think this warning would be front and center regardless what version of solc i'm using or what contract i'm targeting. I also don't recall the instructions saying we needed to install these, perhaps I skimmed the instructions too quickly and missed it, or perhaps i was reading instructions for 0.8.9.\r\n\r\ni tried, essentially, `sudo apt install libz3-dev libz3-4` but that didn't seem to do any good.",
