  "body": "The existing Solidity ABI encoding is poor design for several reasons:\r\n\r\n**Problem:**  \r\n   I want to be able to appended the results of governance proposals dynamically to the function calldata\r\n\r\n**Issue:**\r\nEncoding design is erratic, the structure of the encoding, causes dynamic parameters to be injected earlier in the encoding, to be aware of the offset.\r\n\r\n  1. There is no deterministic way to know what data is being sent, making it difficult to ensure the integrity of the data.\r\n  2. There is no way to extend the calldata, making it difficult to add new functionality to contracts without breaking existing ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Proposal.**\r\nAll parameters should be serialized seqentially, so the function selection can be swapped and additional calldata can be appended.",
