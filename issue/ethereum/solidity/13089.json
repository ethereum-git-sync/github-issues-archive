  "body": "## Abstract\r\n\r\nUtilize `codecopy` to optimize struct initialization, calldata generation, and other memory based steps\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nStruct initialization requires a memory word to be left as 0s, and when creating a new struct (or array), it is repeatedly copied to zero out memory (as the compiler may have written temporary data to it). Additionally, when performing a call to another smart contract with some constants, `pushN` opcodes are used to load the words on the stack followed by `mstore`. Both of these are relatively inefficient and each get more expensive the larger the struct/more static inputs to the call there are (the calldata optimization explicitly applies to static inputs).\r\n\r\nBoth of these can be improved at the cost of bytecode size.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nFor struct initialization:\r\n1. Keep a running maximum of word size for all structs instantiated in a contract\r\n2. Assign a data section in a contract that would put 0 bytes equal to the size of the largest struct\r\n3. Instead of `mload(zero_word) dup push(mem_loc) mstore, ... push(mem_loc) mstore`, for a given struct of a particular size, perform a `push(struct_size) push(zero_byte_codechunk) push(mem_loc) codecopy`\r\n\r\nFor calldata:\r\n1. Analyze static inputs of calling a contract\r\n2. Assign a data section in a contract that would hold the partially formed calldata, put 0 bytes in of dynamic input\r\n3. Codecopy to the expected location in memory, mstore dynamic inputs\r\n4. If there are dynamic length inputs at beginning/middle, delay the codecopy in the code until we know where to place the static data \r\n\r\nThis kind of optimization likely applies to other things as well, like `keccak256`, `log`, etc.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nShould be compatible?\r\n",
