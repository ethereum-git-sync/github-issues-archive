    "body": "Hm, this is interesting.  Right now Truffle Decoder already assumes that any contract can emit events from any library (due to delegatecalls).  Roughly speaking -- first it checks the contract's ABI, and for each event scans the corresponding AST for more info (if possible -- if it can't find it then it just uses the info from the ABI).  Then it does the same for all libraries in the project.\r\n\r\nHow to handle free events, if those become allowed, is an interesting question.  \"Effective ABI\" is kind of hacky but it might be the most compatible thing.  I think adding library/free functions to the ABI field proper would be... confusing.  It certainly would cause problems with Truffle Decoder as it is -- I mean, I can alter Truffle Decoder, obviously, but it's not obvious to me what the proper way would be.\r\n\r\nLike, let's say we're trying to decode a library event emitted by a particular contract; imagine this event has been added to the contract's ABI.  Truffle Decoder (as it currently exists) will see the ABI entry, say \"Oh, this event was defined in this contract\", check the AST for it, fail to find it, and say \"Darn, I guess we just have to decode in ABI-only mode\".  When in fact, it could have found the AST information had it checked elsewhere.  And had the event *not* been in the ABI, it would have eventually done so (checking library ABIs, then scanning the appropriate ASTs for more info).  So putting the event in the ABI means we get *less* info out.\r\n\r\nNow, OK, like I said, that's just how Truffle Decoder *currently* works, not necessarily how it *has* to work... but still, you see the trouble, right?  It adds a lot more \"anything can come from anywhere\", if an event given in a particular contract's ABI doesn't have to be defined in that contract or one of its ancestors!\r\n\r\nSo yeah, maybe `effectiveABI` -- or maybe better yet, `extraABI`, which would contain *only* the extra stuff?  And you could combine it with the ordinary ABI to get the full \"effective ABI\".\r\n\r\nI dunno.  If you're doing free events, I guess you have to do something like this.  But if you don't do free events, then it probably makes more sense to leave things as-is at the moment...",

    "body": "Thanks for shedding some light on how truffle decoder works with event!\r\n\r\nMaybe one thing to consider before we adding something like 'extraABI`: I think it would be far better to find a solution that maybe needs some implementation work in truffle (as well as solidity) but \"just works\" in a backwards-compatible matter. We could add another field to each ABI entry that is not defined in the contract, for example. I think having to scan two different items in the ABI that might even theoretically conflict with each other is far inferior to scanning a single list and maybe doing some extra work identifying the item in the AST.",

    "body": "Thanks for your answer, @chriseth!\r\n\r\nNow I get the difference. This is mostly about libraries and delegate calls, right?\r\n\r\nThis is tangentially related, but I think it will be useful to understand the whole picture: \r\n\r\nA very common problem that people have when testing smart contracts is that lots of times when sending a TX to a smart contract, you also want to decoded another contract's events, because of internal transactions/messages.\r\n\r\nCurrently, this is not trivial with most javascript libraries, but it could be if their design acknowledges this usecase, and doesn't do events decoding on a per-contract basis. I think this would mean trying to decode all the events in the project though.",

    "body": "Here's an idea for how to handle this in a way that's more possible for tools like Truffle Decoder to handle.  So, let's say that `abi` is changed to include any events that can be emitted, as discussed above.  (Where here I'm assuming we're ignoring delegate calls, and just listing ones that can be emitted by this particular bytecode without a delegatecall, because that's what's discussed above.)\r\n\r\nMaybe this would be fine if additional corresponding information were added to the AST?  Like right now the AST for a contract has `linearizedBaseContracts`; maybe it could also have `internalizedLibraries` or something, listing all libraries it has inlined code from?\r\n\r\nThat doesn't cover the case of file-level events, but I think those are maybe less of a problem than the library problem?\r\n\r\nAlternatively, maybe one could even put directly in the AST a list of AST IDs of events the contract can emit!  (Where again by \"can emit\" I mean the same thing as above, i.e., these would correspond to the ones listed in the ABI (not necessarily in the same order).)  That doesn't really seem like something that should go in the AST, I'll admit, but it would certainly do the job...\r\n\r\nAnd then these same ideas can be applied to the error case as well, obviously.",
