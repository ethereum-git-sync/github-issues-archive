    "body": "@chriseth I think I have figured out a way for how to do this. It would require client side interpretation but it is possible to do. If we can unwind the stack trace, there are places where we are more likely to have gotten this error rather than not. We can simply attribute throws/invalid jumps to certain strings based on location of said throw. This can be interpreted by the client based upon where it died. Perhaps sticking \"interpretation tags\" alongside the binary might provide better error handling when interacting with the chain. ",
