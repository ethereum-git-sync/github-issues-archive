  "body": "## Abstract\r\n\r\nCurrently, there's no way of doing error inheritance, this proposal would allow users to define an error extending from another in something similar to the following format:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n// .selector == bytes4(keccak256(\"InsufficientBalance(uint256)\"))\r\nerror InsufficientBalance(uint256 value)\r\n\r\n// .selector == bytes4(keccak256(\"ERC20InsufficientBalance(uint256),InsufficientBalance(uint256)\"))\r\nerror ERC20InsufficientBalance(uint256 value) is InsufficientBalance(value)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nThere's already some interest in standardized custom errors as seen in [the EIP-6093 discussions](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-6093-custom-errors-for-commonly-used-tokens/12043/17), and having a way of inheriting from these standard errors would allow some business logic customization \r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nA custom error should be allowed to extend from another similarly to the way contracts are extended:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n// Contract definition\r\ncontract Test { ... }\r\ncontract TestExtended is Test { ... }\r\n\r\n// Constructor\r\nconstructor(uint256 value) {}\r\nconstructor(uint256 value, uint256 another value) Test(value) {}\r\n\r\n// Errors\r\nerror InsufficientBalance(uint256 value)\r\nerror ERC20InsufficientBalance(uint256 value) is InsufficientBalance(value)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen an error is single (doesn't inherit), the selector remains the same, but for inheriting errors the selector can be computed by the first 4 bytes of the keccak256 of the error names comma separated following the same inheritance order as in contracts inheritance.\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n// From an original selector, selector remains\r\n// bytes4(keccak256(\"InsufficientBalance(uint256)\"))\r\n// And for a child, the string follows the C3 linearization algorithm\r\n// bytes4(keccak256(\"ERC20InsufficientBalance(uint256),InsufficientBalance(uint256)\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternatively, the inherited selectors can be ordered in the same way as error names and put in memory before the rest of the arguments so the origin of the error can be traced to a specific contract. This way extending from standard errors without losing the selector would be possible.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nNot breaking",

    "body": "I have 2 use cases in my mind\r\n\r\n1. It allows users to extend from standard errors without losing contextual information. \r\n\r\nFor example, in [EIP-6093](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6093), there has been interest in more specific errors without redefining the error or breaking the standard. It will similarly benefit users of OpenZeppelin contracts who extend a contract behavior but some errors don't fit into their added business logic. \r\n\r\nWe can also have error libraries for generic errors. We tried this approach in [this PR](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4261) but decided that the errors library was not expressive at all and custom errors that are too generic might confuse.\r\n\r\n2. The selector trace I'm proposing would be a security feature, it would allow for keeping the error interface consistent with the standards even after extending from an error. I consider this an important addition because error selector decoding is [already suggested](https://dev.to/george_k/embracing-custom-errors-in-solidity-55p8) by the community and it's another interface to maintain. Note that an ERC165 version for error interfaces would likely help but I'm not a fan of that approach.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Now that I read myself I think this issue is more about extending without losing the selector rather than allowing inheritance on itself",
