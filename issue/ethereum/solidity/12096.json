  "body": "**Problem**: Solidity currently does not offer a way to do a high level delegatecall.\r\n\r\nFor example, to mimic a high level delegatecall to the following interface:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\ninterface I {\r\n    function f(uint) external (uint);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\none has to do the following:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nI impl = I(0x...);\r\nrequire(address(impl).code.length > 0);\r\n(bool sucess, bytes memory ret) = address(impl).delegatecall(abi.encodeWithSelector(I.f.selector, (...));\r\nrequire(success);\r\nuint ret_value = abi.decode(ret, (uint256));\r\n```\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n**Proposal**: Library interfaces.\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nlibrary interface I {\r\n    function g(uint) external returns(uint);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, the following is a high level `delegatecall`, that behaves exactly like the above code:\r\n```solidity\r\nuint ret_value = I(0x...).g(...);\r\n```\r\n\r\nEffectively the main difference between interfaces and library interfaces are that the former does a `call` or `staticcall`, whereas the latter does a `delegatecall`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nInheritance: should we allow libraries to inherit from library interfaces? \r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nlibrary interface I {\r\n    function f() external;\r\n}\r\n\r\nlibrary L is I {\r\n    function f() external {\r\n        // the actual implementation\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThey can be used as types and variables similar to how interfaces are used. This should cover applications mentioned in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11695 (except for `new`).\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nlibrary interface I {\r\n    function f() external;\r\n}\r\n\r\nlibrary interface J {\r\n   function g() external;\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract C {\r\n    I immutable impl1;\r\n    J impl2\r\n    // Dynamic linking\r\n    constructor(I _impl1, J _impl2) {\r\n        impl1 = _impl1;\r\n        impl2 = impl2;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // Now impl1.f() and impl2.g() are high level delegate calls.\r\n\r\n    // some upgradability features\r\n    function update_impl2(J _impl2) {\r\n         impl2 = _impl2;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n",
