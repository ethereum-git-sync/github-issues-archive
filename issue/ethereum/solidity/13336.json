I think it's the default for the RTD theme and lots of other projects do this with their docs. Probably for readability and because it does look neater in places where things are not wide enough to require horizontal scrolling.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think @franzihei?",

I would hope the target demographic of this page are people who know how to resize a browser window.  😅\r\n\r\nThe *actual* design best practice is to have your page be responsive to the environment the user is using, which means shrinking/expanding based on available real estate.  For accessibility reasons, you shouldn't assume everyone is viewing the site with the same resolution, font size, zoom level, etc. and at the moment if the user increases the font size (but not zoom) things get even worse and the user cannot compensate by increasing the width of their browser window.  Unfortunately, most designers are incredibly lazy and build websites like PDFs where they are only usable at a specific well defined resolution/font/size.",

    "body": "I'm personally a fan of enforcing some max width on the container to limit the width of any given line of text. Seems to be a common UX approach across the web, e.g. Google, NY Times, Medium, MDN (although there's certainly counterpoints, like Wikipedia). Enforcing a max length of lines of text tends to improve readability.\r\n\r\nFWIW you can see we do this on ethereum.org:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8097623/182677762-6dfae052-7dbd-4754-9289-c90cd2cbe2fb.png)\r\nAlthough you'll see we do still have some open discussion on this: https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org-website/issues/4026 - I think in general it's a widely debated topic & different people have different preferences.\r\n\r\n",

Number of characters is not a function of number of pixels unless the font size is fixed (which it isn't for anyone with accessibility settings that change font size)\r\nC. It is highly unlikely that there is a single optimum for all use cases.  Reading a novel is quite different from reading an encyclopedic article or reading a docs site.\r\n\r\nI *personally* find the docs site notably better with the change I implemented (can be enabled against live site with a simple CSS change), so at best one could argue it is subjective.  For docs sites I rarely read entire lines, I skim through looking for section headers or code blocks that have what I'm l,oking for and then usually just read a code example.  It is quite rare that I actually *read* (in the traditional sense, like a novel) anything significant.",
