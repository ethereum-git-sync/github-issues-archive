  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nThe Yul documentation states that Yul variable declarations and literals can be annotated with types.  Of course, it also states that currently the only type in the EVM dialect is `u256`, making this not very useful, but still, it's documented as being possible.  Despite this, attempting to do this currently, even with the one type that is supposedly available -- `u256` -- yields a compile error.\r\n\r\nThere's an additional issue here, in that the documentation also demonstrates types `uint256` and `uint32`, even though these types are not supposed to exist (unless `uint256` is supposed to be an alias for `u256`).\r\n\r\nThese latter types, that are not supposed to exist, should probably be removed from the examples in documentation (unless `uint256` is added as an alias to `u256`).  Meanwhile either the type `u256` should be added, or the documentation should be updated to no longer assert that it exists.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version: 0.7.1\r\n- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): default\r\n- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Truffle\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\npragma solidity ^0.7.1;\r\ncontract AssemblyTest {\r\n  function test() public {\r\n    assembly {\r\n      let x: u256\r\n      pop(3: u256)\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```",
