    "body": "@ChrisChinchilla here is a draft for \"fallback / receive split\". I'll put it here until we have the new repo:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFallback function in 0.5 and prior is used for two different purposes. One of them is safe and rather easy to understand but the second one is a low-level functionality that can easily lead to bugs if not done properly. Because of that, we split the fallback function into two different functions following thes.purposes:\r\n\r\nFirst function: react when being sent ether. Can be used to reject the transfer, emit an event, forward ether (caveat) and other similar things. This is the safe part of the fallback function that is usually the only one that is needed. In 0.6.x, ure the \"receive\" function for that. The function is called if the contract is invok d without any data, i.e. without a function to be called. .send() and .transfer() call the receive function\r\n\r\nSecond function: implement proxy contract that forwards function calls. If a contract is invoked but no function in the contract matches the function identifier in the call data, then the fallback function is runs. This allows to implement functionalities that are split across multiple contracts or where the actual implementation of a contract is stored elsewhere.\r\nExample: simple proxy contract\r\n\r\nWhat is the danger in the way it was done in 0.x?\r\nProblem: implement fallback function and only expect it to be called on ether transfers. It will still be run if the intended function is missing from the contract. Even worse: no error will be reported at runtime.\r\nExample: need a good example. The problem is that if a fallback is implemented that takes ether, then it will result in some benefit to the caller. So we could have an example where a contract executes something and takes a fee in ether and you can also send it ether to do something else.\r\n```",
