    "body": "The issue discussed in the original thread was being able to compile Solidity contracts from a JVM toolchain as easily as you currently can from Node.js, right? So perhaps there is no need to provide a full JNI interface to the C++ API. As long as a JVM app can fork to a native `solc` executable and read it's standard JSON output (perhaps with a thin Java wrapper to make things nice) it should be fine.\r\n\r\nI mention this because those platform-dependent Maven builds may be easier to create and maintain than a full JNI bridge.",

    "body": "Did a little bit of a feasibility study on this tonight.  I cloned Renjin and built it to get a copy of gcc-bridge.  gcc-bridge appears to work in two steps.  The first step transforms GCC intermediate language into JSON via a GCC plugin.  The second step takes the JSON files and attempts to generate Java classes that have equivalent semantics.\r\n\r\nI modified the CXX_FLAGS to load the plugin.  Unforunately, the plugin only works for gcc 4.7 (and I think gcc 4.6).  gcc 4.7 is older than gcc's full C++11 support.  We can't build jsoncpp on that.  Even after I modified the build system to use my usual gcc (5.4) for jsoncpp, it's not enough.  We have build breaks in `NameAndTypeResolver.cpp` , `RPCSession.cpp` and `AsmPrinter.cpp`.  The `NameAndTypeResolver.cpp` and `RPCSession.cpp` breaks are probably a simple fix, but the `AsmPrinter.cpp` break appears to actually be caused by using a copy of boost that wants gcc > 4.7.\r\n\r\nEven if we elected to fix these breaks, we'd basically be forcing ourselves to stay pre-C++11 in order to keep up gcc-bridge.  Unless, of course, gcc-bridge were to support newer compilers.",
