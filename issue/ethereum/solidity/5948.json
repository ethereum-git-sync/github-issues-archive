Those lambdas will only be called much later in ``ContractCompiler::appendMissingFunctions``. This doesn't seem to cause problems so far (it seems all types are still living at that point), but we should consider binding copies of the shared pointers in the lambdas instead to ensure that everything still lives when the lambdas are actually called.\r\n\r\nMaybe on a closer look it'll turn out that it's fine as it is, but we should double-check.",
