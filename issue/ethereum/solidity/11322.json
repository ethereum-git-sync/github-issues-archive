  "body": "@axic has recently suggested using [bumpversion](https://pypi.org/project/bumpversion/) to handle updating version in files where it is hard-coded. Here's the [`bumpversion` config used in EVMC](https://github.com/ethereum/evmc/blob/master/.bumpversion.cfg) for example.\r\n\r\nLooks like the original project is unmaintained, so we should use one of the forks instead. Maybe [bump2version](https://pypi.org/project/bump2version/)?\r\n\r\nCurrently I see that we have version hard-coded in the following places:\r\n- [`PROJECT_VERSION` in the main `CMakeLists.txt`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/v0.8.4/CMakeLists.txt#L24).\r\n- `robots.txt` (see #11317)\r\n- Changelog (should we automate the creation of the new `(unreleased)` section at the top?)\r\n- The release checklist (though we probably do not want to update this one).\r\n\r\nBefore closing please make sure these are the only ones.",
