  "body": "## Abstract\r\n\r\nCurrently, the fuzzing binaries link against a custom built `libFuzzingEngine.a` that is built in the ubuntu 19.04 docker image\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/324cc71b13a2e1ebf1fe34397d085832b89076a4/.circleci/docker/Dockerfile.ubuntu1904#L67-L75\r\n\r\nossfuzz guide suggests not doing this (see https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/issues/832#issue-255774655)\r\n\r\nThe main motivation seems to be that coverage instrumentation flags for building libFuzzingEngine.a keep changing, so it's best to transparently use `-fsanitize=fuzzer` to use whatever instrumentation flags clang deems fit.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nEssentially\r\n  - remove `libFuzzingEngine.a` from the list of linked libraries from all fuzz targets\r\n  - add a link flag `-fsanitize=fuzzer` for each of them\r\n\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nNA. Once this is implemented, `libFuzzingEngine.a` may be removed from ubuntu19.04 docker image since it will no longer be used.\r\n\r\nFrom [libfuzzer docs](https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html)\r\n\r\n> Recent versions of Clang (starting from 6.0) include libFuzzer, and no extra installation is necessary.\r\n\r\n> If modifying CFLAGS of a large project, which also compiles executables requiring their own main symbol, it may be desirable to request just the instrumentation without linking:\r\n\r\n> clang -fsanitize=fuzzer-no-link mytarget.c\r\n\r\n> Then libFuzzer can be linked to the desired driver by passing in -fsanitize=fuzzer during the linking stage.",
