    "body": "We could try creating a nice structure for the semantics tests while extracting - if that works we can later sort the syntax tests into that directory structure (at least if at some point syntax and semantics tests will end up being somewhat merged).\r\n\r\nI would prefer ordering by features being tested, but as @chriseth mentioned a lot of tests will match/test multiple features, so we need some kind of order of precedence for this to work... Personally I don't have any kind of complete list of features that are being tested in mind...\r\n\r\nWe could also split into two general kinds of tests - those testing that something works (without warning) and those who cover all cases under which a particular error/warning should be triggered. While the first kind of tests should be sorted by features, the latter could be sorted by compiler component, file name and even class/function name or line number (well maybe that's too much) in which the error is triggered, as @Marenz suggested.",
