    "body": "Hi @ZigBalthazar \r\nI  think i have understood your  problem correctly , correct me if I am wrong\r\nIf you want to push a large number of items to the array and then read all of them using the getMyArray function, you may indeed encounter high computational pressure if the array becomes very large. Solidity view functions are executed locally on each node, and their execution time depends on the complexity of the code. Reading a large array in a view function using a loop can lead to higher gas consumption and longer execution times, which can be problematic if the array contains thousands of items.\r\n\r\nHere's an example of how you can push items to the array and then read them using the getMyArray function:\r\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\r\n\r\ncontract MyContract {\r\n    uint[] myArray;\r\n\r\n    function pushToMyArray(uint[] memory values) public {\r\n        for (uint i = 0; i < values.length; i++) {\r\n            myArray.push(values[i]);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function getMyArray() public view returns (uint[] memory) {\r\n        uint[] memory result = new uint[](myArray.length);\r\n        for (uint i = 0; i < myArray.length; i++) {\r\n            result[i] = myArray[i];\r\n        }\r\n        return result;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nIn this example, the pushToMyArray function allows you to push an array of values into myArray. The getMyArray function reads the entire array using a loop.\r\n\r\nAs the size of myArray grows, the gas cost and execution time of the getMyArray function will increase. If myArray contains several thousand items, reading it in a view function could become computationally expensive and may exceed gas limits.\r\n\r\nTo handle large datasets more efficiently, you might consider using pagination or off-chain processing techniques. Additionally, keep in mind that Ethereum 2.0 and other scaling solutions aim to improve the scalability of the Ethereum network, which can help mitigate some of these issues in the future.\r\nplease reply asap\r\n",
