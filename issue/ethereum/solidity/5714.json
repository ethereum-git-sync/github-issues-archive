  "body": "<!--## Prerequisites\r\n\r\n- First, many thanks for taking part in the community. We really appreciate that.\r\n- We realize there is a lot of information requested here. We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.\r\n- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:\r\n\t- [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)\r\n\t- [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)\r\n- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.\r\n- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThe arguments for SHL, SHR, SAR are put in reversed order in the final bytecode.\r\n\r\nWhen you write code like `(SHL 1 2)` it should rather mean `1 << 2` not `2 << 1`. But the output bytecode is `600260011b00`. So the stack has `1` at the top before the `SHL` is executed and in all shift operators in EVM the top stack argument is taken for the shift amount.\r\n\r\nThis is different from other arithmetic instructions like `DIV`, `SUB`, etc., where the top stack item is the first argument of the operator. This is also probably the reason of the bug.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version: LLLC, the Lovely Little Language Compiler\r\nVersion: 0.5.3-develop.2018.12.20+commit.88255332.Linux.clang\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n```\r\necho '(SHL 1 2)' > sar.lll && lllc/lllc sar.lll\r\n600260011b00\r\n```",
