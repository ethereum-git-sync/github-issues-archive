It seems to happen because in the contract I deploy another contract. Without it there is only one swarm hash.",

    "body": "@mtbitcoin there a couple of different things here:\r\n- I propose that Etherscan should support accepting a `zip` or a `tar` file with all the sources and a field to define the main contract name. Unfortunately `solc-js` doesn't yet support imports, but the regular `solc` does.\r\n- The best solution on top of this would be to use the [standard JSON interface](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/using-the-compiler.html#compiler-input-and-output-json-description) because that works via both `solc` and `solc-js` without issues and you have full control over the files. Again, accepting a `zip` / `tar` and creating the appropriate JSON is the right way to go.",
