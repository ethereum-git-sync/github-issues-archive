  "body": "When compiled using 0.8.19, this works fine.\r\n\r\nWhen compiled using 0.8.20, the contract deploys but is non-functional.\r\n\r\nSee:  https://arbiscan.io/address/0x504ada2360ac822faf7ac703b350fadc8d931211#code\r\n\r\nIn File 16, you'll see for example:  `bool public constant isRECustodian = true;`, but if you click the `Read Contract` tab you'll see that it returns `false` (or rather, it returns nothing at all and Arbiscan just shows `false`).  This is similarly true with all the other values\r\n\r\nWhen reading `amountRecovered` using a dummy parameter like `0x1234567812345678123456781234567812345678`, we see this:  `Error: Returned error: invalid opcode: PUSH0`\r\n\r\nI note that using `push0` was a new feature in 0.8.20\r\n\r\nPerhaps it's \"not a bug, it's Arbitrum's problem for not supporting push0\".  But it would be helpful to know how to disable `push0` generation, if that's the case.  And it's probably worth some documentation.  It's a confusing trap to fall into.\r\n\r\n",
