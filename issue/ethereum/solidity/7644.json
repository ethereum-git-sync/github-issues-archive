    "body": "@christianparpart Let's talk about it in the next meeting. I'm really not sure myself - I always found it strange to say that ``liblangutil`` is supposed to be language independent, even though it contains ``EVMVersion`` and even worse the token list (you can't get much more language specific than that...)...\r\n\r\nShould we even reuse the same token list for yul as we currently do? Actually that doesn't make any sense to me... Maybe we should think about making ``liblangutil`` *really* language independent, e.g. by templateizing over the Tokens and moving ``EVMVersion`` to ``libevmasm``, where it fits much better? And use a separate token list for yul?\r\n\r\nActually I would like having a top-level root namespace called ``solidity``, but then again *not* for ``yul``... so maybe three top-level ones? One for ``solidity``, one for ``yul`` and one for stuff shared by both (which will be the hardest to name, but maybe ``langutil`` would be fine? I.e. making the other util and evmasm ones sub-namespaces of that one?)\r\nOr maybe having everything in top-level ``solidity`` would be just as fine... I don't know, I was never good at naming things.\r\n",
