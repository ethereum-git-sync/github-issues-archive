The other is not considering contracts as the most derived at all.\r\n\r\nFrom a usability point a view, when analyzing a contract, I think most other contracts present (in the same SourceUnit or imported) would not be analyzed as \"the most derived\", similar to how bytecode is not generated for most contracts, but usually just for the \"most derived\" which will be deployed. Because of that, I see this more like an \"include list\", and would prefer having a compiler option for it, instead of marking most contracts as \"do not analyze\".\r\n\r\n",
