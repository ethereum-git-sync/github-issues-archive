The compiler can then create the required override function or do a copy / paste of the overridden function into the derived contract.\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nusing [base].[method]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nI don't believe this would break backwards compatibility as the former method could still be used with the newer method providing a more readable and less verbose path for future development.\r\n",
