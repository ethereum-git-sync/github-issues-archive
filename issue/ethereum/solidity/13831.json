  "body": "## Page\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/cheatsheet.html#order-of-precedence-of-operators\r\n\r\n## Abstract\r\n\r\nI was reviewing code that looks something like this\r\n```solidity\r\na & b == b\r\n```\r\nso to check the correctness of the expression I went on the Solidity Docs to understand operator precedence. I know that operators with higher precedence are executed earlier than operators with lower precedence in the case that you do not have wrapping braces. What I see is that the `&` bitwise AND operator has a precedence of 7, and the `==` equality operator has a precedence of 11.\r\nNow my expectation was that the code above is the same as\r\n```solidity\r\na & (b == b)\r\n```\r\nBut when tested, it actually is the opposite, even though `&` has lower precedence than `==`. The expression is evaluated as\r\n```solidity\r\n(a & b) == b\r\n```\r\n\r\nBased on this, I think Solidity actually uses higher operator precedence for the `&` operator than for the `==` operator, which contradicts the documentation and should be updated.",
