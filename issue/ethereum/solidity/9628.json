  "body": "Inspired by the issue in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9622\r\n\r\nI'm not entirely sure this is a good idea - but Yul will probably be used for highly-optimized low-level implementations. Arguably those will be manually optimised and will just disable the optimiser, but the better the optimiser gets the more valuable it may be even in such use cases. But as demonstrated in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9622 there may be cases where the optimiser actually interferes.\r\n\r\nWhile tweaking the optimiser sequence may or may not help here, what might really help would be annotations in Yul that affect optimisations.\r\n\r\nIn particular two come to mind: ``inline`` and ``noinline``. But there may be more e.g. a ``don't rematerialize across this boundary`` annotation, etc. They would need to be carefully chosen not to interfere with any optimiser step and I'd imagine them always only acting as \"hints\"...",

I still think it would only be syntactical and won't really affect the optimiser, I'll elaborate a bit more on that there and would try to keep this here about decorators in general and try to stick to the inline example, because I think that's the most promising first choice for a thing like this.\r\n\r\nApart from that I think there's three questions:\r\n- Do we think this is beneficial to have at all? Are there conceptual pro's and con's?

    "body": "The problem in #9622 was a recursive function that only worked for a limited number of recursive calls due to the 1024 stack slot limit of the EVM. That's something that's hard for the optimiser to recognize (it would need to guess whether a recursion is meant to be deep or only shallow). Before #9622 I'd say that's an artifical problem, but the issue is proof that stuff like that actually happens for people.\r\n\r\nSo the solution was to reduce the local variables on stack during the recursive function call (up to manually using customly allocated memory frames to store locals, arguments and return values, instead of the stack) - but the optimiser makes that very hard, because it doesn't know what you're trying to achieve and inlines, resp. CSEs variables contrary to the manual stack optimisation.\r\nAn easy way to do it would be either\r\n```\r\nfunction eval() { evalPre() eval() evalPost() }\r\n//@noinline\r\nfunction evalPre() { }\r\n//@noinline\r\nfunction evalPost() { }\r\n```\r\nor\r\n```\r\nfunction eval() {\r\n  {\r\n    // evalPre\r\n  }\r\n  //@cse-guard or @variable-guard\r\n  eval()\r\n  {\r\n    // evalPost\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere ``evalPre`` and ``evalPost`` manage the arguments, return values and \"locals\" in memory frames. But the optimiser messes up both - in the first case it inlines (basically arriving at the second case) and in the second case it reuses variables from the top part in the bottom part during CSE, increasing the recursive stack strain. (hence the hints that could prevent this in both cases)\r\n\r\nIn the end the \"solution\" was to use ``--yul-optimizations \"\"`` to enable stack optimization, but not have CSE mess up the intended stack layout (I'm actually not quite sure why the hard-coded post-optimization steps didn't also mess things up, but it happened to work fine in that particular case).  We could argue that this is a very special case which needs manual magic trickery anyways, but yeah - it made me wonder whether fine-tuning the optimiser might make sense, since highly optimised custom complex routines like that are well within the expected use of Yul I guess.",
