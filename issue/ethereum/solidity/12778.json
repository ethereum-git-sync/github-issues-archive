  "body": "## Description\r\nThe compiler seems to treat pointers to functions taking `calldata` arguments as if they had `memory` arguments instead. You cannot assign them, pass into a function of use in `abi.encodeCall()` even when the target type exactly matches the type of the function pointer.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n### `calldata` is not accepted\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract C {\r\n    function f(function (string calldata) external) external {}\r\n    function g(string calldata) external {}\r\n\r\n    function main() external {\r\n        function (string calldata) external ptr = this.g;\r\n        abi.encodeCall(this.f, (this.g));\r\n        this.f(this.g);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```\r\nError: Type function (string memory) external is not implicitly convertible to expected type function (string calldata) external.\r\n --> test.sol:6:9:\r\n  |\r\n6 |         function (string calldata) external ptr = this.g;\r\n  |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n\r\nError: Cannot implicitly convert component at position 0 from \"function\" to \"function\".\r\n --> test.sol:7:32:\r\n  |\r\n7 |         abi.encodeCall(this.f, (this.g));\r\n  |                                ^^^^^^^^\r\n\r\nError: Invalid type for argument in function call. Invalid implicit conversion from function (string memory) external to function (string calldata) external requested.\r\n --> test.sol:8:16:\r\n  |\r\n8 |         this.f(this.g);\r\n  |                ^^^^^^\r\n```\r\n\r\n### `memory` is accepted instead\r\nOn the other hand this compiles without errors:\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract C {\r\n    function g(bytes calldata b) external returns (bytes calldata) {\r\n        return b[2:5];\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function main() external returns (bytes memory) {\r\n        function (bytes memory) external returns (bytes memory) ptr = this.g;\r\n        bytes memory b = \"123456789\";\r\n        return ptr(b);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI checked in Remix and it even properly slices the `memory` string argument even though we only support slicing `calldata`.\r\n\r\nThis should probably be disallowed given that you can't normally pass in `memory` arguments to functions taking `calldata`. Also, when the functions are `internal`, the compiler does produce an error:\r\n```\r\nError: Type function (bytes calldata) returns (bytes calldata) is not implicitly convertible to expected type function (bytes memory) returns (bytes memory).\r\n --> test.sol:7:9:\r\n  |\r\n7 |         function (bytes memory) internal returns (bytes memory) ptr = g;\r\n  |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n- Compiler version: 0.8.12",

For the caller, it does not make sense to even distinguish `function (string calldata) external` and `function (string memory) external`.

But then I think this behavior is surprising to users (it was to me) and at the very least, we should document this and the error message should have a hint suggesting to use the `memory` version instead.\r\n\r\nOr maybe we could adjust syntax to make it less puzzling? I see two possibilities:\r\n- Make the `calldata` and `memory` variant interchangeable. Allow assignment both ways.\r\n- Drop the location from external function pointer syntax altogether since it's meaningless.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?",

Even more so, assuming we *were* to keep allowing both ``memory`` and ``calldata`` arguments in external function types, they would need to be implicitly convertible in both directions, which is conceptually bad (implicit conversions have to define a proper partial order) and counterintuitive. The only way around that would be to not consider them separate types, but merely alias syntax for the *same* type, which is even weirder.\r\n\r\nSo I'm still strongly in favour of disallowing ``calldata`` arguments in external function pointers.",
