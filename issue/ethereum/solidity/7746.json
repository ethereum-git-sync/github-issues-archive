As an exception, identifiers defined in the “init” part of the for-loop (the first block) are visible in all other parts of the for-loop (but not outside of the loop)\r\n\r\nCould we clarify that identifiers defined in the \"init\" part of the for-loop (the first block) only includes those in the same nesting level (or something to that effect) as the for-init block, and more importantly does not include identifiers defined inside nested blocks within the for-init block?\r\n\r\nFor example, in a vague sense, the identifier `x_0` is in the \"init\" part of the for loop, but not visible in other parts of the for loop because it is inside a nested block of the for-init block.\r\n\r\n```\r\nError: Identifier not found.\r\n  for {{let x_0 := 0x100}} x_0 {} {}\r\n                           ^-^\r\n```",
