It's just a messy wishlist right now and a lot of it may end up never being implemented.\r\n\r\n@ekpyron suggested creating some document to track them instead. Maybe we should have issues only for more concrete stuff we actually intend to implement in the near future.\r\n\r\nBut since you're clearly interested in this one, I'll reopen it for the time being just so that it remains more visible.",
