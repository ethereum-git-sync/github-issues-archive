    "body": "Hey, i am Juan working for @nomiclabs , was told to take a look at this. The project was cloned and built in a **MacOS** **Catalina** machine, with no issue. This was tested on a clean machine, only installing **XCode** previously, as explained in the documentation. The result was the expected build folder in which the solc binary can be found. This binary was tested on other machines with success.\r\n\r\nWith the flag correctly [set here](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/CMakeLists.txt#L15) **Solidity** declares it is supporting MacOS of 10.14 and greater (Mojave and Catalina), which roughly correspond to 70% user market share and probably more for developers. Architecture-wise, there is no issues since all Mac machines are **x86-64 processors** since 2007.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the **Solidity Team** already has everything set up for **MacOS** distribution. Only thing that is left is to add this to the release process, building it on a **MacOS** machine CI.\r\n\r\nI can tell the tasks in [.travis.yml](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/.travis.yml#L132) regarding **MacOS** are commented. along with some comments regarding older **MacOS** versions (10.9-10.12) which **Solidity** should not support, due to the requirement of the function `std::visit`. What would be the issue you guys are having with these tasks? ",

If the binary releases would be available there, the tools could provide the option to decide whether to use solc-js or use solc binary.\r\n\r\nAs a starting point, i would generate binary releases on github, the same way you guys are releasing linux and windows versions. Unlike windows and Linux, MacOS binaries all have the same architecture and, as i explained earlier, you guys already set the flag correctly for supporting all 10.13 and 10,14 MacOS, this means that by compiling the binary on any 10.13 or greater MacOS machine, the resulting binary is ready for distribution as it will be compatible on any other 10.13 and 10.14 MacOS",

In order to use that function, the target has to be set to `10.14` or higher or else an error will be prompted: `Call to unavailable function 'visit': introduced in macOS 10.14`. Even though it may sometimes work on older versions, one can't be sure since the deployment target is raised. ",
