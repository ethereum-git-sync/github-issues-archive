    "body": "We discussed it on the call today:\r\n1. It's very low priority until there's actual demand for it but we wouldn't mind having this feature. Moved to Icebox for now. It's tagged as `good first issue` so anyone is welcome to try, but it's not necessarily an easy issue for someone new (hence `difficulty: medium` tag).\r\n2. An important thing would be for the error message to clearly indicate which members prevent the struct/tuple from being comparable. @Marenz suggested that there should even be a way to tell the compiler to skip those members, though I think it would be hard to find readable and unobtrusive syntax for this.",
