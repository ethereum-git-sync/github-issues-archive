  "body": "## Abstract\r\n\r\nThe yulInterpreter should be able to bail out if it encounters a program like this\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  for (let i := 1} i {}\r\n  {\r\n  } \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nThere is a \"timeout\" at the moment, but it is based on the trace size, which assumes that every program has a side-effect. In addition to a trace-based timeout, it would be nice to have a timeout based on the number of interpreted steps. \r\n\r\nEach operation on the interpreter counts for one step, and we expose a parameter called something like `maxSteps` that defaults to say `10000.` On the interpreter reaching this limit, it throws an interpreter terminated assertion.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nI think implementing this should be straightforward. The main thing to understand is where to increment the \"step counter.\"",
