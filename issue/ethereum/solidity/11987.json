You can have an extra message if you specify a secondary location - but that's not what they were meant for and if would be weird if secondary location was pointing at the same thing. But maybe it would make sense if you made it point at the `public`/`external` keyword?\r\n\r\nYou could also issue two errors, one with \"info\" severity meant to contain just this extra suggestion - but there's the risk that the user will want to hide info messages.\r\n\r\nNeither of these seems particularly nice so I I'd go with just tweaking the text unless you can figure out a nicer solution.",

I then tried to rebuild the compiler with the updated tests. The original error was still there.  \r\n\r\nThis leads me to think: 1.) I have not updated the correct test; or 2.) I am building the compiler incorrectly.  @cameel, do you have any advice? Thanks again! \r\n\r\n\r\n(The main locations of the error message is dataLocations/publicFunction and types/mapping. The updated files can be found on my branch.)",

If you are sure you did, I'd suggest manually modifying expectations in all tests that have this message to see which ones fail. Then you can use a debugger to see which path the compiler takes there. If that's still not enough to figure this out, you can also submit a draft PR with your code and these failing tests and we'll take a look.",
