You can have an extra message if you specify a secondary location - but that's not what they were meant for and if would be weird if secondary location was pointing at the same thing. But maybe it would make sense if you made it point at the `public`/`external` keyword?\r\n\r\nYou could also issue two errors, one with \"info\" severity meant to contain just this extra suggestion - but there's the risk that the user will want to hide info messages.\r\n\r\nNeither of these seems particularly nice so I I'd go with just tweaking the text unless you can figure out a nicer solution.",

I am building the compiler incorrectly.  @cameel, do you have any advice? Thanks again! \r\n\r\n\r\n(The main locations of the error message is dataLocations/publicFunction and types/mapping.

    "body": "Well, there are just too many of them. We've actually been chasing small improvements for too long and they've been siphoning off a lot of our focus that should have gone into major language features.\r\n\r\nStill, I think that improving the error messages is a kind of issue that should not be just dismissed and closed as stale. It's still very relevant.\r\n\r\nWe'd welcome a contribution here, though, judging from the previous attempt, we'd still have to find some time to give some guidance here before we can mark it as a `good first issue`.",

    "body": "I'm sorry, but we won't solve this issue any time soon. The implementation effort and, even if outsourced, the reviewing effort is larger than the benefits. Generally, this kind of analysis and helpful suggestions on a case-by-case basis is of course nice, but can, for now, be done externally to the compiler in a linter, static analysis tool or IDE.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't mean that the issue is not valid and that it wouldn't be *better* to solve this in the compiler, but we currently have to focus on the overreaching language development, which will make a lot of finer error message distinctions like this obsolete or will at least significantly change the way they would have to be implemented.\r\n\r\nTherefore, to avoid raising wrong expectations, I'm closing this issue. In the future, when we have made sufficient progress on the core language, we can revisit and then again allow issues about error- and diagnostics-cosmetics like this.\r\n",
