Multiple tagged or untagged `@notice`s are concatenated together.\r\n\r\nThe question we had whether untagged comments are for the user or the developer. If they are for the developer, then we should have the following rules:\r\n- Only one `@notice` tag is allowed, and it is exported for the user documentation.\r\n- Remove `@dev`. Anything untagged is concatenated and exported as \"dev documentation`.",
