  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nHi, I would suggest that the error message for attempting to compile an abstract contract be improved.  When I attempted to compile a contract I had accidentally made abstract, I got an error message me telling me that the compiled contract was not found; I thought this was a bug in `solc` until I realized I had accidentally made my contract abstract!  An error message explicitly mentioning abstract contracts would be more helpful; then I would have known right away that there was an abstract contract involved.\r\n\r\nThank you!",
