In order to that a report must be built using the tools here (https://scan.coverity.com/download). It seems the tool is quite large (~600 Mb), so preferable a docker image should be used instead (I'm sure someone made one already).\r\n\r\nTravis integration guide: https://scan.coverity.com/travis_ci",
