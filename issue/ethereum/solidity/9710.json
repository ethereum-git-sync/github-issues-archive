A sequence of bytes starting with `0xc0` is not an UTF-8 encoding of any Unicode character. The fact that in some other encoding it might map to a valid Unicode character is irrelevant here since Solidity only supports UTF-8.\r\n\r\n> So my question is - what do we want to achieve here? Support multiple input file encodings, or just UTF-8?\r\n\r\nOnly UTF-8. The goal here is to make `splitSources.py` properly split files no matter what encoding they use, without assuming whether it's UTF-8, latin-1 or whatever else. My issue with the script currently is simply that it makes that assumption while it does not have to because it does not need to interpret the content. Or rather it only has to interpret a very small bit of it - the separator. As long as it can find the ASCII encoded `==== Source:` in there, it should be able to split the file without failing on a `UnicodeDecode` error.",

    "body": ">They aren't. A sequence of bytes starting with `0xc0` is not an UTF-8 encoding of any Unicode character. The fact that in some other encoding it might map to a valid Unicode character is irrelevant here since Solidity only supports UTF-8.\r\n\r\nWhat I meant to say was `doesn't contain invalid Unicode characters`, but yeah, `0xc0` is not valid UTF-8, however is valid Latin-1 encoding.\r\n\r\n> Only UTF-8. The goal here is to make `splitSources.py` properly split files no matter what encoding they use, without assuming whether it's UTF-8, latin-1 or whatever else. My issue with the script currently is simply that it makes that assumption while it does not have to because it does not need to interpret the content. Or rather it only has to interpret a very small bit of it - the separator. As long as it can find the ASCII encoded `==== Source:` in there, it should be able to split the file without failing on a `UnicodeDecode` error.\r\n\r\nI guess read in binary then and match and split by `==== Source:`? This would then allow us to pass it as is to the compiler, which will then be responsible for the failure instead of `splitSources.py`?\r\n\r\n",
