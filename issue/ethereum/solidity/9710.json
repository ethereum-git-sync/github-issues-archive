It's just preprocessing before the actual test.\r\n\r\nIt's still possible to split a multi-source file even if it contains invalid UTF-8 sequences so it's better to do so and let the compiler fail down the line instead of having two different layers where things can fail in different ways.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n- Compiler version: 0.7.1-develop.2020.8.31+commit.8c8eca3e.Linux.g++",
