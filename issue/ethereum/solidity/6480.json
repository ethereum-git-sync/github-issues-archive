  "body": "Follow-up of #6449 \r\n\r\nSince we now support `break` statement in for-loop, we could move loop condition into loop body for the ease of further optimizations.\r\n\r\nFor example,\r\n```\r\nfor { } lt(i, exponent) { i := add(i, 1:u256) }\r\n{\r\n    result := mul(result, base)\r\n}\r\n```\r\ncan be rewrite to\r\n```\r\nfor { } true { i := add(i, 1:u256) }\r\n{\r\n    if lt(i, exponent) { break }\r\n    result := mul(result, base)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt this moment, seems like loop conditions expressions are the only exception of SSA transformation. This can cause trouble when we want to apply optimizations which relies on SSA transformation. (#6449 is an example)\r\n\r\nAnd the control flow graph should be isomorphic(?) before and after the transformation. So it probably should not be harder to optimize if we analyze the control flow correctly.",

    "body": "Since we are planning some transforms that would have problems with for loop conditions, it is probably now a good idea to introduce this transform. At the same time, it would be good to undo the transform again in the cleanup phase of the optimizer, since for loops with actual conditions are much easier to read.\r\n\r\nThe post block cannot be easily moved as soon as there is a `continue` statement in the loop, so we should be careful about it. Removing dead code in for loops could be its own optimizer step, since I guess it will often lead to the loop being transformed to a simpler construct altogether. It might also make sense to consider (tentative) loop unrolling.",
