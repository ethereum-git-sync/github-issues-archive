  "body": "This came up frequently and has been recently discussed under #9829. One of the uses of `abi.encodePacked` is for it to perform concatenation.\r\n\r\nMany EIPs use snippets to explain the rules and many libraries rely on `abi.encodePacked`. The first impression is that they actually rely on the weird \"encoding\" it performs, but a closer look reveals that in many cases they only rely on the concatenation feature. In many cases the concatenation is used to add a prefix prescribed by [EIP-191](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-191). An example for actual data encoding is [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712#definition-of-typed-structured-data-%F0%9D%95%8A). \r\n\r\nWhile it is a bit unfortunate that standards (aka EIPs) rely on Solidity snippets, it is something we likely can not change, but we can improve the language so that confusion is also minimised in those standards. Having `concat` instead of `encodePacked` I think would go towards that. (I believe this confusion lead to [libraries adding support](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/utils/hashing/#utils--solidity-hashing) for \"encodePacked\".)\r\n\r\nI propose to introduce `concat` which takes a variable number of `bytes memory` as an input and returns a single `bytes memory`.\r\n\r\nQuestion A: should it also allow fixed bytes (i.e. `bytesNN`) as an inputs, which are tightly packed and not zero padded? Or should we in parallel [finally implement conversion between fixed and variable bytes types](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9170)?\r\n\r\nQuestion B: should we start adding functions as members of types, i.e. `bytes.concat()`? If yes, is that a breaking change? I guess it is, because libraries could extend those types already.",

A ``concat`` with a variable number of arguments can first sum up all length and allocate a huge chunk of result memory once. Iterated ``concat``s with two arguments would allocate a whole bunch of temporary arrays in between, but all of them will be required until the last one was created. And the size of the last one is unknown until you created all of the ones up front - that seems like a pretty hard problem to reduce to a single allocation in the end.\r\nApart from that we should have variadic templates, then we could move it to the standard library either way ;-).",
