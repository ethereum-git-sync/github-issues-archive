Encode it (https://www.base64encode.org/)\r\n> 3. Go to `remix.ethereum.org/?code=[encoded code here]`\r\n\r\nDo you know if there's a way to do that for Yul snippets? I see in the URLs that there are parameters for optimizer settings, version, evm, etc. but I don't see one for language (even though you can set it to Yul in the compiler sidebar). I tried `lang=yul` and `language=yul` but no luck. Adding links for Yul snippets in #11697 would be very easy so if Remix supports that, it would be nice to have it too.\r\n\r\nTagging @yann300.

    "body": "@yann300 Thanks! I actually didn't know that. This does not seem to be documented in [Remix URLs & Links with Parameters](https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/locations.html). I only see the `gist` parameter there.\r\n\r\nBut anyway, I'd still be in favor of just using a higher limit. Having to deploy code snippets somewhere when docs are built would complicate docs build process. All of our code examples currently fit under 8000 chars which is still something most browsers can deal with. I think going for separately hosted snippets would only be worth it if we really had tons of very long examples.",
