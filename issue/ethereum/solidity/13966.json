    "body": "Thanks for the report! I can confirm that this is reproducible with node v16.19.0 and Solidity 0.8.18 as well.\r\n\r\nThe discrepancy is definitely not intended. It might be coming from the fact that `soljson.js` is compiled to 32-bit wasm. It can address less memory so it could just be running out of it earlier than `solc`, which is a 64-bit binary.\r\n\r\n> What is interesting is that I can comment out functions `f4` and `f5`, and `solcjs` will still reject the program. However, if I replace the commented out functions with repeating simple line comments e.g. `// // comment` then `solcjs` will successfully compile it. Here is [comment.txt](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-js/files/10722701/comment.txt).\r\n\r\nThis sounds like the issue is in processing long comments. By switching to line comments, you're basically breaking a single huge multi-line comment into lots of small comments that will be processed separately. The file is 1.6 MB so the comment can't possibly be long enough to actually exhaust available memory but maybe e.g. the regex parser we use is not particularly efficient. We do have issue reports related to that already: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12208.\r\n\r\n> Furthermore, the produced binary executes successfully using evmone.\r\n\r\nYeah, this part is not surprising since it's a crash during compilation. Still, good to know.\r\n\r\n> However, running `solc --bin Test.sol` will successfully compile the program. \r\n\r\nInterestingly, I managed to crash `solc` as well but only with the new codegen:\r\n```bash\r\nsolc Test.txt --via-ir\r\n```\r\nAnd then only on a release build. A recent build from `develop` does not crash this way, so I could not check where the stack trace leads to. It looks similar to https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13496 though.\r\n\r\nIn any case, this does look like a bug. I'm going to transfer the issue to the main repo because the crash is clearly inside the binary and not in the JS code.",

    "body": "ok so that's probably not just the comment then.\r\n\r\nI investigated this now and I think we're just running into the limits of the 32-bit memory space. It seems to be simply because of now much memory solc eats to process such a big contract. Not saying it cannot be improved to use less RAM but that would be just a matter of better optimization and not really a bugfix.\r\n\r\nI confirmed this by trying to remove as much as possible from `Test.txt`. At first I was able to remove quite a few blocks and then removing anything would resolve the crash. Then I started duplicating a single line to compensate for removed code and with enough repetition the crash always returned. When copies of that lime became the only content of the file I started simplifying it, each time replicating it more and more times until I got to the simple `0;` repeated 200k times. This still reproduces the error:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n{\r\n    printf 'function f() {'\r\n    for i in {1..200000}; do\r\n        printf '    0;\\n'\r\n    done\r\n    printf '}'\r\n} > input.sol\r\nnpx solcjs --bin input.sol\r\n```\r\n\r\nFurther proof is that simply removing the indent from the above makes the crash go away. But then increasing the loop count to 800k brings it back again. It's just the memory overhead of processing such a big file.\r\n\r\nIt's very possible you could crash `solc` that way too if you gave it a file that's large enough but you'd also have to have a ton of RAM. I tried giving it ~200 MB of input but I had to kill it when it ate 60 GB RAM and was still going.\r\n\r\nSo it seems to be more of a performance issue. It's not great that wasm is so limited because we always consider it as the canonical build you could use anywhere. But we might have to just live with it until 64-bit wasm becomes a thing.\r\n\r\n@ekpyron @axic Do you think we can do anything concrete here or should we close this as \"wontfix\"? tl;dr is that extremely large `.sol` files given as input make the wasm binary run out of memory and crash.",
