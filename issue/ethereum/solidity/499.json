Having an explicit fallback method in the interface ABI would also signal that to the outside world.\n\nSide notes:\n- solc accepts the `constant` modifier on the fallback function\n- it also accepts output parameters\n- and rejects input parameters:\n\n```\ntests:2:14: Error: Fallback function cannot take parameters.\n    function (uint a) constant returns (uint) {\n             ^------^\n```\n\nIf the constant modifier and output fields are allowed that is a bit more reason to have in the interface ABI. If they are an oversight and shouldn't be allowed, than it can be argued it doesn't belong to the interface.\n",

Is there a plan to change that?\n\nI think the fallback method is useful, but to get rid of them, you could:\n- throw if the dispatcher doesn't find a matching method\n- have a flag in the contract disabling the fallback (I think you have that on pivotaltracker somewhere)\n\nI do like the fallback function. I am not fully sure it should or shouldn't have constant and output modifiers, but heavily leaning towards that it shouldn't.\n\nGiven it could be enabled or disabled via a keyword in the future, I really think it should have its own entry in the JSON ABI interface.\n",
