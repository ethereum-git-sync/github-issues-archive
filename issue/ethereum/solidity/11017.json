For example, if you want to call `function getFoo()` on a contract you don't call `Contract.setFoo()`.  I think for software developers, it is natural to expect that `contract.receive()` will call the `receive` function on `contract`.  Seasoned Solidity developers will know that `receive` is a special function, and newbies will hopeful get a link to details about the `receive` function when they read the docs about how to send ETH.\r\n\r\nIf we call it `remit`, a newbie contract developer will go looking for a `remit` function on the recipient contract and may even *write* a `function remit() payable` function on the contract, because that is what one would *expect* to happen when you call a function on an address.",

    "body": "> I think something like `max` is more explanatory and it also allows us to remove `gasleft` at some point.\r\n\r\n> I wonder why allow specifying the gas in the first place and not just passing all gas available? If we want to get rid of `gasleft()` that means we perhaps want to also get rid of gas observability, and as such why have `{gas: ...}` in the first place.\r\n\r\n@chriseth @axic  Is it ok to get rid of gas observability? Some mass operations will become impossible.\r\nFor example, according to [this research paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3276486), many contracts are using this pattern, which is bad:\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract NaiveBank {\r\n  struct Account { \r\n    address addr;\r\n    uint balance;\r\n  }\r\n  Account accounts[];\r\n  function applyInterest() returns (uint) {\r\n    for (uint i = 0; i < accounts.length; i++) {\r\n      // apply 5 percent interest\r\n      accounts[i].balance = accounts[i].balance * 105 / 100;\r\n    }\r\n    return accounts.length; \r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe function will not be able to finish if `accounts` holds too many elements; it will throw an out-of-gas error.\r\nThe paper suggested the way below:\r\n```solidity\r\n  Account accounts[];\r\n  uint nextAccount;\r\n  function applyInterest() returns (uint) {\r\n    for (uint i = nextAccount; i < accounts.length && msg.gas > 100000; i++) {\r\n      // apply 5 percent interest\r\n      accounts[i].balance = accounts[i].balance * 105 / 100; \r\n    }\r\n    nextAccount = i < accounts.length ? i : 0;\r\n    return accounts.length; \r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI understand it's better to use a \"pull\"-style than a \"push\"-style. However, it may be essential for some contracts to do such unbounded mass operation. How can they achieve this if `gasleft` is removed?\r\n",

A simple  combination of `SLOAD` and `SSTORE` costs 20,800 gas. If this combination is placed inside a loop, then the function can at most run 600 loops before hitting the block gas limit.

    "body": "I mostly agree with @axic and @MicahZoltu here. I think the `transfer` function should not specify the gas at all. But a silent breaking change sounds dangerous. Maybe we can deprecate `transfer` and have a new function, say `msg.sender.pay` that is equivalent to `call(gas(), ...)`. It's unfortunate that developers use `transfer` to a contract where the gas stipend is not enough and have their funds stuck forever. \r\n\r\nHowever, the problem with `transfer`, `remit` or `pay` is that the name is too generic and hides all the gas subtleties. The call option, `{gas: max}` solves this problem. Perhaps there should also be a `{gas: stipend}` option.\r\n\r\nMaybe an alternative solution is to deprecate both `transfer` and `send` and have functions with more descriptive names in our planned standard library. For example, `transfer_allGas(address _a, uint _value) returns (bool success)` and `transfer_onlyStipend(address _a, uint _value) returns (bool success)`. ",

The equivalent would be `.call{gas: 0, value: non-zero}(...)` and `.call{gas: 2300, value: 0}(...)`. I guess one advantage for `{gas: min}` for stipend would be to prevent users from hardcoding the stipend. Also, it allows for an easy replacement for users upgrading their contracts and were relying on `transfer` as a re-entrant safe way to send Ether. \r\n\r\nAlso, why do you think people should not be using transfer with only stipend?",
