  "body": "This is more or less a brainstorming issue about which dialects in Yul we can expect in the future.\r\n\r\nThe dialect is defined by the built-in functions, the list of types (which are already given by the parameters and return parameters of the built-in functions) and the default type.\r\n\r\n - EVM(version): EVM opcodes (depending on version) operating on u256, default type: u256\r\n - EWasm: wasm builtins (minus floating point) operating on i64, i32, default type: i64\r\n - YulIR(version): EVM opcodes (depending on version) operating on u256 plus `calldataload4() -> u256`, default type: u256\r\n - TypedYulIR(version): variants of EVM opcodes (depending on version) - to be defined, maybe intermingled with some opcodes taken from wasm, operating on u256, u224, u192, p160, u128, u120, u96, u64, u32 and bool, defaul type: u256\r\n\r\nIn the above, version is always an EVM version (hardfork name).\r\n\r\nTranslations are defined (in a way similar to what we do for ewasm) between those dialects:\r\n\r\nYulIR -> EVM\r\nYulIR -> EWasm\r\nYulIR -> TypedYulIR\r\nTypedYulIR -> EVM\r\nTypedYulIR -> EWasm\r\n\r\nIn the long run, YulIR will probably be fully replaced by TypedYulIR",

    "body": "It would also be nice to remove this extra complexity of `Language` and `Machine` in `libyul/AssemblyStack`:\r\n```\r\n        enum class Language { Yul, Assembly, StrictAssembly, Ewasm };\r\n        enum class Machine { EVM, EVM15, Ewasm };\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we could encapsulate machine/target into dialect, then all we need is a dialect and a translation map. Perhaps having a target and a dialect would be natural as well, but unfortunately there is an overlap between dialects and targets for EVM: EVM15 just specifies a dialect of EVM.\r\n\r\nI would suggest to adopt the \"target triplet\" idea from other compilers (which usually goes as `<machine>-<vendor>-<os>`) and change it to our needs: `<machine>-<dialect>-<subdialect>`, where all fields are lowercase and only `[a-zA-Z0-9_]` are valid symbols. The `subdialect` (and the preceding dash) can be omitted if there's none. I would consider \"yul\" a machine under this.\r\n\r\nRemember, the current configurations in use are:\r\n- Inline assembly (EVM, untyped, default type u256, EVM version)\r\n- Yul (EVM, typed, default type u256, EVM version)\r\n- Ewasm (typed, default type u64, no EVM version)\r\n\r\nWhat we want to support as a minimum (to replicate everything we have currently) is the following:\r\n- `evm-<hardfork>` -- the EVM machine target for a given hardfork\r\n- `ewasm-<hardfork>` -- the ewasm machine target for a given hardfork (and the only supported configuration is `ewasm-byzantium`)\r\n- `evm-eip615` -- machine target for what we call EVM15/EVM1.5 now\r\n- `yul-evm-<hardfork>` or `inlineassembly-<hardfork>` -- the untyped EVM used in inline assembly\r\n- `yul-solir-<hardfork>` -- the Yul Solidity IR for a given hardfork\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "> 1. Remove `--assemble`, `--strict-assembly`, `--machine`.\r\n\r\nI think this is a good idea. The way `--assemble`/`--strict-assembly`/`--yul` + `--machine` + `--yul-dialect` options interact with each other is pretty complicated and I spent too much time trying to wrap my head around it back when I was working on #9074. It's not documented and they do not map in a simple way to the internal `Machine`, `Language` and `Dialect` types.\r\n\r\nHere's a table from that PR (now a bit simpler since `--yul` and `--assemble` are disallowed with `--machine wasm` and result in an error):\r\n\r\nMachine: `ewasm`\r\n|                     | dialect: not specified  | dialect: `evm`   | dialect: `ewasm`      |\r\n|---------------------|-------------------------|------------------|-----------------------|\r\n| `--strict-assembly` | ewasm                   | strict assembly  | ewasm                 |\r\n| `--yul`             | (error)       | strict assembly  | ewasm                 |\r\n| `--assemble`        | (error)  | strict assembly  | ewasm                 |\r\n\r\nMachine: `evm` or `evm15`\r\n|                     | dialect: not specified  | dialect: `evm`   | dialect: `ewasm`      |\r\n|---------------------|-------------------------|------------------|-----------------------|\r\n| `--strict-assembly` | strict assembly         | strict assembly  | (error)               |\r\n| `--yul`             | typed Yul               | strict assembly  | (error)               |\r\n| `--assemble`        | loose assembly          | strict assembly  | (error)               |",
