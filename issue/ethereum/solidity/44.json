    "body": "\"1: This is an infinite loop. The web vm deals poorly with those, probably because it's being given too much gas to play with.\"\n\nHow is it an infinite loop? Is it strictly because of your third point or am I missing something Solidity specific? As for incrementing the length, I did that because the following code doesn't work properly.\n\n```\nfunction test() public returns(uint8)\n    {\n        uint8[] testing;\n        testing[0] = 1;\n        testing[1] = 2;\n        testing[2] = 3;\n\n        delete testing[1];\n\n        uint8[] testing1;\n        uint8 k = 0;\n        for (uint8 i = 0; i < testing.length; i++) {\n            if (0 != testing[i]) {\n                testing1[k++] = testing[i];\n            }\n        }\n\n        return testing1[0];\n    }\n```\n\nFor some reason the method fails (returns 0) right after the `testing[0] = 1;` portion. Thus, I'm still confused if I'm supposed to increment the length of the array or if Solidity changes the length when I set a value to a new location. One or the other must work so the dynamic array gets appropriately resized.\n",

    "body": "Yes, it's only infinite because testing.length itself keeps increasing when you're incrementing another array's length.\n\nThe way Solidity is intended to work, as I understand it, the length of the array must be set before an item on that array is accessed. Otherwise, an exception should be thrown.\n\nSo a[a.length++] should never work, since it accesses an item at an index beyond the array's current size before adjusting the array's length.  \nIf you split things into two statements, like\n\n```\n    if (0 != testing[i]) {\n        testing1.length += 1;\n        testing1[testing1.length - 1] = testing[i];\n    }\n```\n\nthen you're not accessing an array out of bound. \nUnfortunately, incrementing the length of `testing1` still increments the length of `testing`.\nThat's definitely broken, and a bit annoying to work with, but you can get by with something like:\n\n```\ncontract c {\n\n    function test() public returns(uint8) {\n        uint8[] testing;\n        testing.length = 3;\n        testing[0] = 1;\n        testing[1] = 2;\n        testing[2] = 3;\n\n        delete testing[1];\n\n        uint8[] testing1;\n        uint len = testing.length;\n        for (uint8 i = 0; i < len; i++) {\n            if (0 != testing[i]) {\n                testing1.length += 1;\n                testing1[testing1.length -1 ] = testing[i];\n            }\n        }\n\n        return testing1[0];\n    }    \n}\n```\n\nTo split the problematic behaviors seen here into minimal reproducible bits, here's a contract with a few methods showing each problem:\n\n```\ncontract c {\n    function throwsCorrectly() returns (bool) {\n        int[] a;\n        a[a.length];\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    function shouldThrowButDoesnt() returns (bool) {\n        int[] a;\n        a[a.length++];\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    function shouldReturnZeroButDoesnt() returns (uint) {\n        int[] a;\n        int[] b;\n        a.length = 6;\n        return b.length;\n    }\n}\n```\n",

If you use things like `int[] b` you create a local variable that points to storage. Not assigning it is an error (which is not yet detected by the compiler) and will result in it pointing to the first storage variable. This is why you see these effects.

That's why I told Solidity to use the value before incrementing it.\n\n\"What you probably want is int[] memory b.\"\n\nI'll give that a shot. Thank you.\n",
