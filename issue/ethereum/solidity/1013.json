    "body": "I'm not sure this is on point, but for generic code like this:\r\n```\r\nfunction (uint myParam) public pure returns (uint) {\r\n    uint param2 = someFunction(myParam);\r\n    return someOtherFunction(param2);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIt costs less gas, because it uses less memory to do something like this:\r\n```\r\nfunction (uint myParam) public pure returns (uint) {\r\n    myParam = someFunction(myParam);\r\n    return someOtherFunction(myParam);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nHowever, there are cases where this could be much more difficult to read: you cannot assign the variable you are working with a meaningful name other than the one it previously had. Thus, if you want to reuse this variable, you have to keep the same name in order not to use another memory slot.\r\n\r\nWhat I had in mind was something like this:\r\n```\r\nfunction (uint myParam) public pure returns (uint) {\r\n    uint alias param2 = someFunction(myParam);\r\n    return someOtherFunction(param2);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nwhere, at compile time, every instance of param2 is replaced by myParam. It would thus allow to save some gas and to improve code readability. Furthermore, if, after an `alias a = b`, the compiler does not authorize the use of `b` anymore, I don't see any side-effect that would occur.\r\n\r\nI don't know whether that's possible, nor whether you had this case in mind when discussing this idea. If this is not on point, please tell me and I would be happy to delete my comment and open an appropriate issue :smile: \r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Right, if the more readable version produces suboptimal code, please just open a separate issue and we'll see what we can do. We'd rather improve the optimizer than add new syntax just to work around its deficiencies. Also note that the upcoming Yul-based codegen has a much more powerful optimizer and that generator is going to become the default in the near future. You can pass the `--experimental-via-ir` option to solc to use it - before submitting an issue please make sure that the new optimizer doesn't already handle it better.",
