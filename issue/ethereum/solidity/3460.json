  "body": "I just started to play around with the `solidity` sources @ c696803f0b61c7a77e3b438c256791b22add9d7a. After running the test-suite, I noticed that the used stack is not large enough to run the JuliaParser/recursion_depth test.\r\n\r\n```\r\n➜  solidity ./build/test/soltest -- --no-ipc\r\nRunning 1056 test cases...\r\nunknown location:0: fatal error: in \"JuliaParser/recursion_depth\": memory access violation at address: 0x7ffee8b04310: invalid permissions\r\n/tmp/solidity/test/libjulia/Parser.cpp:240: last checkpoint: \"recursion_depth\" test entry\r\n\r\n*** 1 failure is detected in the test module \"SolidityTests\"\r\n```\r\nI use OS X (10.13.3) with clang (Apple LLVM version 9.0.0 (clang-900.0.39.2)).\r\n\r\nHowever, I was able to find out that this problem is not clang specific, it is specific to the default stack-size of OS X, that seem to be 8MB. The JuliaParser/recursion_depth test will fail, if only 8MB of stack is available.\r\n\r\nI would recommend to change the linker flags in `cmake/EthCompilerSettings.cmake` to ensure that the default-stack size is never used - it may differ on some systems. It is very important to have consistent execution environments. \r\n\r\n```\r\n…\r\nif (\"${CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_ID}\" MATCHES \"Clang\")\r\n…\r\n  # The default stack-sizes may be different. We set the stack size to be 16MB manually.\r\n  set(CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS \"${CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS} -Wl,-stack_size -Wl,0x1000000\")\r\n```\r\n`CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS` should  define the stack-size of 16MB for all supported toolchains.\r\n\r\nAs `cpp-ethereum` seem to use a very similar version of `cmake/EthCompilerSettings.cmake`, it may make sense to change the linker flags there too.\r\n",
