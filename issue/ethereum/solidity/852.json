    "body": "Im gonna go play doom while this gets worked out. If your dev team needs anything just message me. I have been working on this project since 2011(sortof). Can I get more involved with the team. I am really the best at python. Who should I email if I want to help serpent? I also have a fleshed out DAPP idea. I just can't get anything to work! before this year I was using windows, which is taken care of like an adopted child. Now that I am on ubuntu I have run into all sorts of kerfuckles. I would hold developers to a higher standard, but this time we are dealing with a sort of self aware network. What the deal with geth? can it play music yet?\n",

Yep - Doom it up :-)   That's the best idea.\n\nAll of the development chat is happening using Gitter, which just uses your GitHub account, so just head over to an appropriate group (often 1-1 with repos) and offer your help.\n\nSerpent is an interesting one.   Piper Merriam has just been reviving it, and updating it to work with Python 3.0, and I am sure they would love more hands on deck there.\n\nFor example:\n- https://gitter.im/ethereum/cpp-ethereum\n- https://gitter.im/ethereum/go-ethereum\n- https://gitter.im/ethereum/pyethereum\n- https://gitter.im/ethereum/pyethapp\n- https://gitter.im/ethereum/serpent\n- https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity\n",

    "body": "I think you guys did this on purpose to halt all people wanting to support eth(POW, prisoner of war/(proof of work) chain). Really good war strat. I think napoleons ;) brother told him to do that same tactic.  really smart. If people have a chain (from the before times) they can catch up and use a geth --clean geth --update and still run the kigigger. Though if new buckets(think south korea backing the dao strike with new nvida 10 series for 3 years(i mean your team would just fall apart on that. as would the geth eth economy. thus it would be as profitable as lisk.)) where to pop up they would need to be gendered right away, eth or that which goes by many names. either way get me more involved. I never get a google+ poke. I would love to create a FART circle on google plus for KGB like goals in your solc(think cccp) government. \n",
