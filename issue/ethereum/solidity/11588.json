  "body": "Related to #11580 and #11582.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nCurrently `bytes.concat()` accepts zero literals because they're implicitly convertible to fixed bytes. After my fix in #11580 they're treated as `bytes1` but user might just as well expect `bytes32` or any other width. This introduces ambiguity and I don't see much use for zero literals in practice so we should disallow this.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell zero is the only exception. Other integers are not implicitly convertible and thus not accepted.\r\n\r\n## Backwards-compatibility\r\nNormally this would be a breaking change but this use case was broken and only fixed in 0.8.6 (#11580) so as long as we do it in the same release it can't break any valid code.",

    "body": "While working on this I discovered that the situation is more complex than I thought:\r\n- `bytes.concat()` is actually broken for 32-byte fixed bytes literals. Fails on an assert in codegen because the type checker lets them through while codegen does not handle them properly. So that's another bug similar to #11580 and #11581.\r\n- Zero is not the only literal implicitly convertible to fixed bytes after all. Hex literals (e.g. 0x12345678) are convertible fixed bytes of the same length so 32-bytes ones should work too.\r\n    - So we do not want to disallow `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000` even if we disallow `0`.\r\n    - My fix in #11580 \"broke\" `bytes.concat(0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000)` by making the codegen use `bytes1`. It did not matter much though because, as I said above, codegen was not handling that case correctly anyway (would try to use `bytes` if the assertion was not there).",
