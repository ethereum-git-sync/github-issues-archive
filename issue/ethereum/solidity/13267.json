The search result seems to be from `develop`, which our `robots.txt` block. We only allow `latest`, `v0.7.6` and latest release. The question is - why is `develop` still getting indexed (and appears in results before those other allowed versions) if we blocked it?",

    "body": "`disallow` will stop Google from indexing/crawling the **contents** of the page, not the URL itself. This is why the URL for previous versions still appear but the meta description does not. [Reference from Google](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/robots/robots_txt#disallow)\r\n\r\nTo stop a URL being indexed by Google, you must add `<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"noindex\">` to relevant pages to assist with SEO. Funnily enough, you will have to redact the `disallow` field from the root robots.txt i.e. [this file](https://docs.soliditylang.org/robots.txt) to allow Google's web crawler to read the relevant tag s.t. that it will not index it [Reference from Google](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/block-indexing?hl=en). I noticed that there are robots.txt for each directory which will be ignored as Google or search engine crawlers only reference the root directory.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that once the `noindex` tag is added, it will not be removed from search results until it is crawled. To expedite that, using the URL Inspection tool from Google will allow you to request an index. [URL Inspection tool](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9012289). \r\n\r\nAlthough the pages will be removed **after** Google's crawlers reach your page again, it does not necessarily mean the desired pages will be in their desired rankings after a search so keep that in mind for SEO. \r\n\r\nHope that helps!",
