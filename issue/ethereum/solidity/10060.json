    "body": "> But if I enable ABIEncoderV2, I get the warning as:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> Warning: This is a pre-release compiler version, please do not use it in production.\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nDid you by chance mean some other warning? This one is not related to ABIEncoderV2 at all. You get it if you build the compiler in development mode.\r\n\r\nIf you're building the compiler yourself and want this warning to go away, just place an empty file called `prerelease.txt` in the root of the repository before the build. Making it empty tells the build system that it's not a pre-release. Or use a source bundle from the release page (e.g. [source for 0.7.3 is here](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/download/v0.7.3/solidity_0.7.3.tar.gz)) where we include it automatically.\r\n\r\n> After enabling ABIEncoderV2 :-\r\n\r\nThe only warnings I get when compiling this example on 0.7.0 are:\r\n```\r\nWarning: SPDX license identifier not provided in source file. Before publishing, consider adding a comment containing \"SPDX-License-Identifier: <SPDX-License>\" to each source file. Use \"SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED\" for non-open-source code. Please see https://spdx.org for more information.\r\n--> /tmp/test.sol\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I think your problem might be different. Could you show me how exactly you're invoking the compiler?\r\n\r\nBy the way, we're considering enabling ABIEncoderV2 by default in one of the future breaking releases (see #9609) and this is literally what you're requesting but I don't think this would fix your problem if adding the directive manually doesn't already.",
