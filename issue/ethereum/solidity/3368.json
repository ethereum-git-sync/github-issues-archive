  "body": "Currently the function for making raw calls is `call`, however the documentation (p42 https://media.readthedocs.org/pdf/solidity/develop/solidity.pdf) specifies that \r\n\r\n> It is not possible to access the actual data returned (for this we would need to know the encoding and size\r\n> in advance).\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to have a way to make a raw call returning the raw return value. Or to have a raw call where the return value can be specified.\r\n\r\nIt should work like:\r\n`var (x, y) = callReturn[uint, string](bytes4(keccak256(\"fun(uint256)\")), 5778));`\r\n\r\nThat's a real need, in my case for action callback https://github.com/kleros/kleros-interaction/issues/13.",
