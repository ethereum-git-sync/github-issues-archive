We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.\r\n- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:\r\n    - [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)\r\n    - [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)\r\n- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.\r\n- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.\r\n\r\n*Delete the above section and the instructions in the sections below before submitting*\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nenum defined from the Inherited interface of interface doesn't look up.\r\n<!--Please shortly describe the bug you have found, and what you expect instead.-->\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version: 0.8.21\r\n- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): 0.8.21\r\n- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Hardhat\r\n- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: localhost\r\n- Operating system: Linux\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease provide a *minimal* source code example to trigger the bug you have found.\r\nPlease also mention any command-line flags that are necessary for triggering the bug.\r\nProvide as much information as necessary to reproduce the bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\ninterface A {\r\n    enum Z{\r\n        Y\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    struct X{\r\n        Z z;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\ninterface B is A{\r\n    enum W{\r\n        V\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    struct U{\r\n        W w;\r\n        Z z;\r\n        X x;\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract C {\r\n    function D (uint8 a) public pure returns(B.X) {\r\n        return B.Z(a);\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    function E (B.X b) public pure returns(bool) {\r\n        return b == B.Z.Y;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    function F (B.Z c) public pure returns(B.Y memory) {\r\n        return B.X(c);\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    function G (B.Z d) public pure returns(B.Y memory) {\r\n        return B.Z(B.Z.Y, B.X(d));\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    function G (B.Z d) public pure returns(B.Y memory) {\r\n        return B.U(B.W.V,, B.Z.Y, B.X(d));\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```\r\nTypeError: Member \"Z\" not found or not visible after argument-dependent lookup in type(contract B).\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, here is another issue similar to the above things.\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\ninterface G {\r\n    event H (uint);\r\n}\r\n\r\nlibrary I {\r\n    function J (uint _j) internal {\r\n        emit G.H(_j);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```\r\nInternal exception in StandardCompiler::compile: C:\\Users\\circleci\\project\\libsolidity\\interface\\Natspec.cpp(89): Throw in function class Json::Value __cdecl solidity::frontend::Natspec::userDocumentation(const class solidity::frontend::ContractDefinition &)\r\nDynamic exception type: struct boost::wrapexcept<struct solidity::langutil::InternalCompilerError>\r\nstd::exception::what: Solidity assertion failed\r\n[struct solidity::util::tag_comment * __ptr64] = Solidity assertion failed\r\n```\r\n\r\n```[tasklist]\r\n### Tasks\r\n```\r\n",
