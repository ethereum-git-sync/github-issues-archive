  "body": "This is another approach to #14495, with the ultimate goal of detecting issues like #14494.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to compare the bytecode output from normal compilation and one from compilation with randomized AST IDs. The randomization can be done by exporting the AST, processing it and reimporting.\r\n\r\nThis could be done in two ways:\r\n- By adding the import/export option to [`prepare_report.py`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/v0.8.21/scripts/bytecodecompare/prepare_report.py).\r\n- By adding randomization in [`ASTImportTest.sh`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/v0.8.21/scripts/ASTImportTest.sh).\r\n\r\nThe latter will probably be quicker to do. The former is likely more future-proof though. We will rewrite `ASTImportTest.sh` in Python eventually and perhaps we should even change it to work more like `prepare_report.py`, i.e. generate a report.",
