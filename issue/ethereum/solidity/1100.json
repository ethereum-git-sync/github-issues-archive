  "body": "Solidity has `struct` by which arbitrary complex data structures can be created and referenced through named members. I find struct's, as a type, are particularly handy when coupled with a library through the `using X for Y` convention.  But for some complex types names aren't necessarily needed but they can't be passed to functions and libraries (or I don't know how)  without a `struct` wrapper....\n\n``` javascript\nlibrary LibFoo {\n    struct MyUneccessaryStruct {\n        mapping (uint => mapping (uint => string)) IWishIDidnotHaveToDereferenceThisNameEveryTime\n    }\n\n    function libFunc(MyStruct self, uint a, uint b) internal {\n        return self.IWishIDidnotHaveToDereferenceThisNameEveryTime[a][b];\n    }\n}\n\ncontract Foo {\n    using LibFoo for LibFoo.MyUneccessaryStruct;\n    LibFoo.MyUneccessaryStruct bar;\n    function foobar(uint a, uint b, string message) returns (string) {\n        bar.IWishIDidnotHaveToDereferenceThisNameEveryTime[a][b] = message;\n        return bar.libFunc(a,b);\n    }\n```\n\nWhat I would like to see is a type definition keyword (`typedef`) to simplify and enhance the usability of complex types in the following sense...\n\n```\nlibrary LibFoo {\n    typedef mapping (uint => mapping (uint => string)) MyComplexType;\n\n    function libFunc(MyComplexType storage self, uint a, uint b) internal returns (string) {\n        return self[a][b];\n    }\n}\n\ncontract Foo {\n    using LibFoo for LibFoo.MyComplexType;\n    LibFoo.MyComplexType bar;\n    function foobar(uint a, uint b, string message) returns (string) {\n        bar[a][b] = message;\n        return bar.libFunc(a,b);\n    }\n}\n```\n",

This identifier type might be `bytes32` in all cases.\r\n\r\nAs a result, it'd be difficult to look at the code where this ID type is used and discern what kind of record it is. If everything is `bytes32`, there's no semantic indication what kind of `struct` it refers to. Further, if a library defines methods that performs lookup by ID, users of that library are forced to do something like `using Lib for bytes32`, instead of something more semantic.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, in the course of development, it might become clear that `bytes32` is not the correct data type to use for certain IDs, and then the developer would have to find all and only the relevant `bytes32` declarations and change those.\r\n\r\nBy allowing something like `type widgetId = bytes32`, it'd avoid all of these problems, and I suspect not break much else in the language.",

    "body": "Practical use case for user-defined type aliases: https://hackernoon.com/beware-the-solidity-enums-9v1qa31b2\r\n\r\nThe article presents a problem where you use enums in a contract and later you want to be able to add new values to that enum without having to recompile the contract. Currently Solidity adds runtime checks that reject values other than ones included in the enum definition which makes this impossible. We have a feature request to remove the check (#9986).\r\n\r\nI think that this use case would be better served by being able to define a custom integer type with a set of constants (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9986#issuecomment-708521338). Constants are already there so we're just missing the support for custom types.",
