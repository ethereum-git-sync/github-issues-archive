    "body": "- Yes, I think it is reasonable to expect more changes in Types where it would be useful to have access to pragmas.\r\n\r\nObviously, the second question is more complicated. I think it would be too unwieldy to get some context everywhere that could possibly use a Type. Since solc is inherently single-threaded (with no plans to change this right now), you could pass it in as a static field in the Type class. Another solution would be to pass it in as a constructor argument.\r\nWhat to pass in: Maybe just a TypeContext class with some useful information. It could just start with pragmas.",
