  "body": "We'd like to have an easy way to preview posts in [solidity-blog](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity-blog) PRs. We used to do this via Netlify but support for that has been dropped.\r\n\r\nThe blog is just a static Jekyll site and our CI jobs attach it as an artifact so just visiting `index.html` could work. Unfortunately looks like the image links are relative to domain root and don't lead to the right locations. CSS and JS have the same issue.\r\n\r\nFor example in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity-blog/pull/161 you can find the post among [artifacts of job 892](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity-blog/893/workflows/9c429223-6e80-49cb-a747-6974e4c28023/jobs/892/artifacts), specifically [`2022/02/03/solidity-developer-survey-2021-results/index.html`](https://892-232799436-gh.circle-artifacts.com/0/2022/02/03/solidity-developer-survey-2021-results/index.html), which is served from circle-artifacts.com.\r\n\r\nThe goal here is to find a workaround that would let us preview the post rendered in CI. Some ideas:\r\n- We could have a second CI job that renders a version with adjusted links (changed either via Jekyll config or via simple replacement).\r\n- We could find a way for CI to serve the artifact directly at domain root. It seems to me that it's simply the `/0/` part after `circle-artifacts.com` that breaks things.",
