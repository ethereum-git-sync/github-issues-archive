Whenever the delegate revokes his votes he loses out on the weight that has been assigned to him by the voter when his vote was already cast.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't make sense to use an `if/else`. The delegate should be receiving the weight regardless, like this:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\ndelegate_.weight += sender.weight;\r\nif (delegate_.voted) {\r\n    proposals[delegate_.vote].voteCount += sender.weight;\r\n}  \r\n```\r\n\r\n## Pull request\r\n\r\nI'm used to adding a PR after the issue, so I'll keep this empty for the moment and update later.",
