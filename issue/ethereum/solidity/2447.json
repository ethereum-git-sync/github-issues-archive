Namely, I've made a start on [some documentation for LLL](http://lll-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) which I want to get done asap, and I'd like to get my [ERC20 LLL code](https://github.com/benjaminion/LLL_erc20) benchmarked and then deployed in the wild. It needs a bit more work; I might refactor it to use `set` and `get` now that they are working again!\r\n\r\nSo it might be a few weeks until I get to this (never mind the day job...), but happy to take it on in due course.",
