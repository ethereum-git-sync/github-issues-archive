Maybe a contract could have its own private key that can be used in this way? Thanks in advance.\r\n",

This wouldn't give you a signed message, but the protocol would ensure the message was sent by that contract.",

    "body": "Hi @leonardoalt and thanks for the reply.\r\nThe purpose of my question was to create a blind signature, independent of the human factor. I completely agree that Smart Contracts are not suitable for this purpose because of their transparency. Nevertheless, since the execution of Smart Contracts is essentially based on a random oracle model, I could imagine the option that the miner / the node (first) executing contract could make this blind signature based on its own private key (or a one-time private key derived from its own). The public keys for verification of the signature could be stored on the blockchain.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
