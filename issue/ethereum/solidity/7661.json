  "body": "## Description\r\nMy impression is that many security vulns now are inherent to the use of solidity; i.e. the language wasn't design with enough Security by Design and by Default in mind. This happens to a lot of new technologies : the rush to get it out there often outweighs security concerns.\r\n\r\nTo change this could be hard, but at least here are some pointers : http://langsec.org/papers/langsec-cwes-secdev2016.pdf and http://www.cs.ru.nl/~erikpoll/papers/language_based_security.pdf Please let me know if i can help here or that this was useful.",
