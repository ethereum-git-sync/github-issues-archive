However, the expressions `type(Enum).max` and `uint(type(Enum).max)` are currently only known towards the end of the code generation. To do this properly, we need better support for compile time constant evaluation. See https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3157. However, maybe it is possible to create special cases for `uint(...)` and `type(Enum).max` to deal with this easily. Similar examples are `type(uint8).max`.",

It's related but the problem seems to be not in evaluating it (you can already assign `type(...).max` to a constant and it gets evaluated at compile time) but in the analysis being aware that it's a constant at the point where it's used to size an array.\r\n\r\nI think it could be solved in a way similar to #12928, i.e. by just marking the expression as pure. May also need moving the evaluation of `type(...).max` earlier in the analysis but this seems like something that we should be able to evaluate as soon as we have the enum definition parsed.",
