  "body": "While investigating an incorrect token award bug in an ERC20, it's come to light that there is an apparent inconsistency in casting with regard to the exponential operator `a**b`. In particular, the output casts to type `b` rather than type `a`.\r\n\r\nSo when calculating a decimal place exponent `10**exp` where `exp` is defined `uint8 exp = 3` the output is truncated to 8 bit giving the answer of `232` rather than `1000`.\r\n\r\nIf the base is definded as `uint8` and exponent of longer type, e.g.`uint`, the compiler will throw an implicit conversion error which indicates the output should be of type base and not exponent.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't seem to be affected by non-compound parameters which are all cast to 32bit slots anyway.\r\n\r\n\r\n    contract PowerOfTest {\r\n        // Returns 232\r\n        uint8 public placesA = 3;\r\n        uint public EXP_A = 10**placesA;\r\n        \r\n        // Returns 1000\r\n        uint public placesB = 3;\r\n        uint public EXP_B = 10**placesB;\r\n    \r\n        // Returns 1000\r\n        uint8 public placesC = 3;\r\n        uint public EXP_C = 10**uint(placesC);\r\n    \r\n        // Type uint256 is not implicity convertable to expected type uint 8\r\n        // uint public EXP_D = 3;\r\n        // uint8 public placesD = 10**EXP_D;\r\n    \r\n        // Returns 1000 for `pow(10, 3)`\r\n        function pow(uint base, uint8 exponent) returns(uint)\r\n        {\r\n            return base**exponent;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        // Returns 232 for `pow(10, 3)`\r\n        function pow2() returns(uint)\r\n        {\r\n            uint8 EXP_D = 3;\r\n            return 10**EXP_D;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n ",

    "body": "The result type of any binary operator in Solidity (also admitting that `**` as a non-commutative operator should be treated differently) is a type that can fit both argument types. The result of the expression `a**b` is always the \"larger\" type of `a` and `b`. Note that the type of the variable the result of the expression is assigned to does not influence the type of the expression itself.\r\n\r\nAs a solution, I would suggest to use `uint(10)**placesA` and the compiler should add a warning whenever the base of a `**` operator is a constant.",
