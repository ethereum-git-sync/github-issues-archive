We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.\r\n- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:\r\n    - [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)\r\n    - [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)\r\n- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.\r\n- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.\r\n\r\n*Delete the above section and the instructions in the sections below before submitting*\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\n<!--Please shortly describe the bug you have found, and what you expect instead.-->\r\n\r\nThe `--import-ast` option of `solc` is failing to correctly recognize the AST generated by an empty `let` statement.\r\n\r\nThis bug prevents `solc` from passing the `test/libsolidity/semanticTests/inlineAssembly/inlineasm_empty_let.sol` test case.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version: commit `7df949edb22598e9d946660020c5390d0ce81bf8`\r\n- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): `shanghai`\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease provide a *minimal* source code example to trigger the bug you have found.\r\nPlease also mention any command-line flags that are necessary for triggering the bug.\r\nProvide as much information as necessary to reproduce the bug.\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n// Some *minimal* Solidity source code to reproduce the bug.\r\n// ...\r\n```\r\n-->\r\n\r\n1. Generate the AST in JSON format: `solc --combined-json ast inlineasm_empty_let.sol > ast.json`\r\n2. Compile using the `--import-ast` option: `solc --import-ast ast.json`\r\n\r\n`solc` should report an error: `Error: Failed to import AST: Expected \"nodeType\" to be of type string.`\r\n\r\nThis appears to be due to the `createVariableDeclaration` function in the `libyul/AsmJsonImporter.cpp` file not handling an empty `value` appropriately.",

    "body": "Hi @lum7na, thanks for your report.\r\nThis problem can be triggered by the following minimal code snippet:\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract C {\r\n  function f() public pure {\r\n    assembly {\r\n      let x\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nYou are right, this is a problem with `AsmJsonImporter::createVariableDeclaration`.  The generated `ast` does not have a `value` object associated with the variable and that is not checked against, resulting in a `Json::nullValue` being passed to `AsmJsonImporter::createExpression` where the error originates from.\r\nI think that simply safeguarding against a non-existent `value` object in `AsmJsonImporter::createVariableDeclaration` should be enough to fix this problem.",
