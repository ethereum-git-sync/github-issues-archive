In other words, could one set these in a way where the inputs could be determined by external oracles/contracts? Or would this be/should this be explicitly disallowed?

    "body": "Yeah, this came up again, since with yul-codegen we will use overflow-checked math by default - and for that it makes almost no difference, whether the checks are against powers of two or not (apart from the fact that the constants used might be more expensive to store).\r\nSo with yul codegen\r\n```\r\nfunction f(uint8 a, uint8 b) ... { uint8 c = a + b; ... }\r\n```\r\nIs basically the same as\r\n```\r\nfunction f(number<0,255> a, number<0, 255> b) ... {\r\n    number<0, 255> c = number<0, 255>(a + b); // downcast that throws on out-of-range errors\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWhere for the latter any other range would be valid as well at insignificant additional cost.\r\n\r\nAnd the question was, why to only allow this kind of logic specifically for powers of two, where ranges of real-world quantities are rarely accidentally powers of two.\r\n\r\nI actually think this is a nice direction to go - we could at some point only allow the old sized integer types in ``unchecked`` blocks altogether.",

    "body": "We're considering this for 0.7.\r\nWe need to solve the following issues:\r\n - Are non-arithmetic operations allowed?\r\n - How will these types be represented in the ABI?\r\n - What about ranges exceeding 256-bits?\r\n - Do we need/want type aliases to alleviate verbosity in casting? Would those help or confuse?\r\n\r\nMy first reaction to those:\r\n - At first non-arithmetic operations are not allowed, but only possible via casting to bit-sized types. We can think about supporting them in a second step.\r\n - I think the types should all have proper ABI types, but we need to come up with a good, future proof naming schema and should probably get non-solidity feedback about this.\r\n - 256-bits is the maximum range for the first implementation. ``number{0,2^256} + number{0,2^256}`` is valid, but it has an inexpressible type that only supports one operation: namely downcasting.\r\n\r\nAlso we need to define behaviour in weird cases, e.g. ``number{0, 10} a; number{20,30} b = number{20,30}(a);`` should probably be a compile-time error, since it will always have to revert.\r\n\r\nIf it makes things easier a first implementation could also have some restrictions, e.g. we can start with only ranges of the form ``number{0,max}`` and extend to signed ranges later (but it may in fact be straightforward enough to do both in one go). But especially precisions, if we want them in the long run, I would postpone for a second step.\r\n\r\nAlso we should write some example code to evaluate the syntax and its readability, especially wrt casting/converting.\r\n\r\nGimmick for a future step: we could allow implicit downcasts, whenever the compiler can deduce that the actual value will be in range, i.e. ``number{0,100} a;`` could be implicitly convertible to ``number{0,50}``, after a ``require(a <= 50)`` or inside an ``if (a <= 50)`` or inside an ``if (a <= b)`` for ``number{0,50} b``, etc.",

    "body": "And yeah... I just used ``number{min,max}`` as syntax placeholder, but we need to decide on a final syntax as well of course. I think we decided against any syntax involving ``<...>`` in the past, since it's hard to parse, but we could also just look into working around that, if possible. I'm not sure if a syntax for a finite set of exact discrete values (as @axic suggested above) is too useful... maybe it is, but arithmetic on them - depending on how that would work - could be hell... so I'd stick to a single range per type at least as first step (as also suggested by @axic above).",

    "body": "Syntax-wise ``number{min: 0, max: 100}`` would of course be future-proof and fit the create2 and gas/value syntax nicely - but I'm afraid it's too verbose... with that we'd probably really need to allow user-defined aliases...\r\n\r\nRegarding casting: maybe we should actually evaluate how much effort range-tracking would be:\r\n```\r\nnumber{0,100} a; number{0,100} b;\r\nrequire(a + b <= 100);\r\na = a + b; // fine without casting due to imposed constraints!\r\n```\r\ncould be much nicer than having to use\r\n```\r\nnumber{0,100} a; number{0,100} b;\r\na = number{0,100}(a + b); // looks weirder and makes it less explicit that this may revert\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut tracking ranges well enough might be (too) tough. It might be enough to only consider constraints of the exact form ``expression <= constant`` (and ``constant <= expression`` or with any other comparison operator). Or we can restrict to all linear constraints - that'd also be easy to solve.",
