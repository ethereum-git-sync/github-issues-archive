    "body": "@chriseth I have manually compared the Linux and wasm reports for 0.3.6 and bytecode differs only in a handful of cases. All of these contain libraries and the only difference is this small fragment:\r\n\r\n```patch\r\n< 03063fc68da5\r\n---\r\n> 0306cbf55226\r\n```\r\n\r\nI investigated this and turns out it's the version stamp for libraries added by [`injectVersionStampIntoSub()`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/v0.3.6/libsolidity/codegen/CompilerContext.cpp#L175-L180):\r\n```c++\r\nvoid CompilerContext::injectVersionStampIntoSub(size_t _subIndex)\r\n{\r\n\teth::Assembly& sub = m_asm.sub(_subIndex);\r\n\tsub.injectStart(Instruction::POP);\r\n\tsub.injectStart(fromBigEndian<u256>(binaryVersion()));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the stamp in each case consists of `03` `06` (corresponding to 0.3.6) followed by the first 8 digits of the commit hash.\r\n\r\nSurprisingly, `cbf55226` is not a valid commit and definitely not the commit `v0.3.6` points at (988fe5e). It's probably the commit ID that was created after the script cherry-picked necessary fixes. It should not happen though because I did set `commit_hash.txt` to get the same commit ID as in the emscripten case. This method worked for >= 0.4.0 (bytecode reports match emscripten) so I wonder if 0.3.6 maybe just did not not support `commit_hash.txt`? I need to check that.\r\n\r\nAnother unexpected thing is that I did not see for >= 0.4.0 is that there are a few files for which one of the binaries errored out and the other did not.\r\n\r\n### Full bytecode diff\r\nHere are the whole reports if you want to take a look:\r\n- [report-solc-emscripten-wasm32-v0.3.6+commit.3fc68da5.js.txt](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/files/5867576/report-solc-emscripten-wasm32-v0.3.6%2Bcommit.3fc68da5.js.txt)\r\n- [report-solc-macosx-amd64-v0.3.6+commit.988fe5e5.txt](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/files/5867577/report-solc-macosx-amd64-v0.3.6%2Bcommit.988fe5e5.txt)\r\n\r\nFor convenience, here's one of the test cases that have this difference in the bytecode:\r\n```patch\r\n1c1\r\n< test_06bdc56c19e023d03ff89762979800ef24c770577d9138159f8b62b30650da2b_solidityendtoendtest_cpp.sol:D 6060604052607c8060106000396000f36503063fc68da55060606040526000357c010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000090048063eee9720614604157603d565b6007565b60556004808035906020019091905050606b565b6040518082815260200191505060405180910390f35b60008160020290506077565b91905056\r\n---\r\n> test_06bdc56c19e023d03ff89762979800ef24c770577d9138159f8b62b30650da2b_solidityendtoendtest_cpp.sol:D 6060604052607c8060106000396000f3650306cbf552265060606040526000357c010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000090048063eee9720614604157603d565b6007565b60556004808035906020019091905050606b565b6040518082815260200191505060405180910390f35b60008160020290506077565b91905056\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Full bytecode diff for a test case where one of the binaries errors out\r\n```patch\r\n< test_17921e1d1ec89741ca84ac79266675a6e3afb8a468111859ace1e73eaf606c30_gasmeter_cpp.sol: <ERROR>\r\n---\r\n> test_17921e1d1ec89741ca84ac79266675a6e3afb8a468111859ace1e73eaf606c30_gasmeter_cpp.sol:test 606060405260c68060106000396000f360606040526000357c010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000090048063b3de648b146041578063e420264a14605757603f565b005b605560048080359060200190919050506081565b005b606b600480803590602001909190505060b3565b6040518082815260200191505060405180910390f35b600781111560a357600160956008830a60b3565b0160016000508190555060af565b60016000600050819055505b5b50565b6000600160005054905060c1565b91905056\r\n> test_17921e1d1ec89741ca84ac79266675a6e3afb8a468111859ace1e73eaf606c30_gasmeter_cpp.sol:test <NO METADATA>\r\n```\r\n\r\n",
