This way error code messages are not baked into the contract itself, which is wasteful.\r\n\r\nSuggestion:\r\n\r\n// my sol file .sol\r\n```js\r\nrequire(someAssertion, error\"my-error-code-message\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n// compiled build .json\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n   \"abi\": [],\r\n   \"bytecode\": \"0x\",\r\n   \"errors\": {\r\n       \"0\": \"my-error-code-message\",\r\n   },\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nError codes are registered in order, are unique, and properly map to the output in the build. We do this in Yul+ and it has been a huge savings for larger deployments.\r\n\r\nNotation is similar to hex\"\", i.e. error\"\".\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nNot sure on this one.",
