  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nI believe that this is a bug in the compiler, in which, under very specific circumstances, a `require` statement does not emit the given error-message.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version: 0.8.12 (optimizer-runs: 20000)\r\n- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): Ganache 7.0.1\r\n- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Truffle 5.4.33\r\n- Operating system: MacOS\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract MyContract {\r\n    struct Set {\r\n        address[] _values;\r\n        mapping(address => uint256) _indexes;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    Set private addressSet;\r\n\r\n    function test(address[] calldata addresses) external {\r\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < addresses.length; i++)\r\n            require(add(addresses[i]), \"already exists\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function add(address value) internal returns (bool) {\r\n        return _add(addressSet, value);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function _add(Set storage set, address value) private returns (bool) {\r\n        if (set._indexes[value] == 0) {\r\n            set._values.push(value);\r\n            set._indexes[value] = set._values.length;\r\n            return true;\r\n        } else {\r\n            return false;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWhen function `test(addresses)` is executed with an address which has already been passed to it in a previous execution, it should revert with an error-message `\"already exists\"`.\r\n\r\nIndeed, this error-message is emitted when we do so in two different transactions:\r\n```\r\nawait myContract.test([ADDRESS1, ADDRESS2]);\r\nawait myContract.test([ADDRESS1, ADDRESS2]); // reverts with `already exists`\r\n```\r\nHowever, when we do so in a single transaction:\r\n```\r\nawait myContract.test([ADDRESS1, ADDRESS1]);\r\n```\r\nThe transaction reverts with `exited with an error (status 0) after consuming all gas`.\r\nI suppose that this error-message is a Truffle and/or Ganache implementation detail, so theoretically, the bug is there and not in the compiler.\r\n\r\nHowever, each one of the following observations leads me to believe that this is in fact a compiler issue:\r\n1. The correct error-message is emitted if we change the input type from a dynamic array `address[] calldata addresses` to a static array `address[2] calldata addresses`.\r\n2. The correct error-message is emitted if we \"merge\" function `_add` into function `add`, as if some different \"stack behavior\" took place during runtime, and somehow made this work correctly. I would tend to relate this to the passing by reference of variable `addressSet` from function `add` to function `_add`, but using this variable in function `_add` directly (i.e., not via the reference input variable) results with the same (wrong) error-message.\r\n\r\nPlease find below the full Truffle test:\r\n```\r\nconst MyContract = artifacts.require(\"MyContract\");\r\n\r\nconst ADDRESS1 = \"0x1234567812345678123456781234567812345678\";\r\nconst ADDRESS2 = \"0x8765432187654321876543218765432187654321\";\r\n\r\nasync function assertRevert(promise, message) {\r\n    try {\r\n        await promise;\r\n        throw null;\r\n    }\r\n    catch (error) {\r\n        assert(error, \"Expected an error but did not get one\");\r\n        assert(error.message.includes(message), `Expected an error with '${message}' but got '${error.message}' instead`);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract(\"MyContract\", (accounts) => {\r\n    let myContract;\r\n\r\n    beforeEach(async () => {\r\n        myContract = await MyContract.new();\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    it(\"revert in the 2nd transaction\", async () => {\r\n        await myContract.test([ADDRESS1, ADDRESS2]);\r\n        await assertRevert(myContract.test([ADDRESS1, ADDRESS2]), \"already exists\");\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    it(\"revert in the 1st transaction\", async () => {\r\n        await assertRevert(myContract.test([ADDRESS1, ADDRESS1]), \"already exists\");\r\n    });\r\n});\r\n```\r\nAll of the above seems to hold also when `optimizer-runs = 200`, and even when `optimizer-enabled = false`), so this is probably not a compiler optimization issue.",

    "body": "I did a quick test in Remix by adding this function and the code reverts properly:\r\n```solidity\r\n    function testTest() public {\r\n        address[] memory addresses = new address[](2);\r\n        addresses[0] = 0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890;\r\n        addresses[1] = addresses[0];\r\n        this.test(addresses);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I think it's likely either a bug in how Truffle encodes parameters for the call or a problem in the test itself.\r\n\r\nBefore we dig deeper - can you make sure your test is correct? One thing that stands out to me is that you do not use `await` with `myContract.test()` when you use it in combination with ` assertRevert()`. Are you sure it will wait for the promise to be resolved? I've been bitten by this in the past when I was using Hardhat with Waffle matchers. Something like this:\r\n```typescript\r\nawait expect(contract.foo()).to.changeEtherBalances([a, b, c], [x, y, z]);\r\n```\r\nwould not fail even when balances did not match, as long as there was more than one balance to compare. In the end I traced it to the fact that it must be `await expect(await contract.foo())` to work. On he other hand I did not have to do this with `to.be.reverted` so it's a bit inconsistent. There could be a similar problem here, just with Truffle's helpers.",

As long as we're considering a bug in the compiler not the underlying EVM it should not matter. An external call from the contract and one via a transaction should result in the same exact code being executed. My example shows that the contract does revert with properly encoded input so the problem must be elsewhere.
