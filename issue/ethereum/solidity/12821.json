  "body": "<!--## Prerequisites\r\n\r\n- First, many thanks for taking part in the community. We really appreciate that.\r\n- We realize there is a lot of data requested here. We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.\r\n- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:\r\n    - [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)\r\n    - [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)\r\n- Ensure the issue isn't already reported (check `feature` and `language design` labels).\r\n\r\n*Delete the above section and the instructions in the sections below before submitting*\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Abstract\r\n\r\nOn several occasions I wished I could write lookup tables like so\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nuint256[256] constant lookup = [1,2,3,4, /* data */];\r\n\r\nfunction lookup_demo(int256 x) internal pure returns (int256 r) {\r\n    assert(x < 256);\r\n    r = lookup[x];\r\n} \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe expected behaviour here is for solc to compile this down to a Yul `data` object and a `datacopy` to scratch followed by and 1mload`, which in turn results in an EVM `codecopy + mload` instruction. Unfortunately instead I get\r\n\r\n```\r\nTypeError: Type uint8[256] memory is not implicitly convertible to expected type uint256[256] memory.\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!--Please describe by example what problem you see in the current Solidity language and reason about it.-->\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nI am not aware of an alternative with the same constant gas cost. It also appears I am not the only one looking for such a feature (see [this](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/51415/how-do-i-make-an-efficient-lookup-table) stackoverflow question).\r\n\r\n<!--In this section you describe how you propose to address the problem you described earlier, including by giving one or more exemplary source code snippets for demonstration.-->\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\n<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow any developer to implement the functionality.-->\r\n\r\nPossible solutions for lookup table in order of my personal preference:\r\n\r\n1. Allow use of `data` objects and `datacopy` in inline assembly.\r\n2. Support `code` as a full fledged read-only address space alongside `memory` and `storage`.\r\n3. A language feature that allows for constant plain arrays using data objects and datacopy as in example code above.\r\n4. Allow use of `verbatim_*_*` in inline assembly (some hacks using `PC` can make it work).\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nShould be no concerns.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nAll language changes that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity.\r\n\r\nPlease describe how you propose to deal with these incompatibilities.\r\n-->\r\n",
