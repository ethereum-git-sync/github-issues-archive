This reading gets more costly with Istanbul and thus we might consider skipping it if we can determine that the slot is not used by anything else.\r\n\r\nThe risk is that making this decision could introduce a bug and users might also want to use the rest of the storage slot without solidity being aware.\r\n\r\nOne example is of course inline assembly, but the other example is contract upgrades that add new storage variables.",
