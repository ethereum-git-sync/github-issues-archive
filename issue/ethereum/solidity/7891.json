  "body": "When types smaller than 32 bytes are written to a storage slot, they are always \"ored\" into the data already at that slot, which means that we first need to read the data. This reading gets more costly with Istanbul and thus we might consider skipping it if we can determine that the slot is not used by anything else.\r\n\r\nThe risk is that making this decision could introduce a bug and users might also want to use the rest of the storage slot without solidity being aware.\r\n\r\nOne example is of course inline assembly, but the other example is contract upgrades that add new storage variables.",
