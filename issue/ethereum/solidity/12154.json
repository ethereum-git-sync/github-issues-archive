They should be selectable on the CLI too.\r\n\r\nAlso, `--ewasm` on the CLI currently includes the output of EVM->Ewasm translation. I think we need to define a new output for it, both on the CLI and in Standard JSON.\r\n\r\nFinally, the outputs available in the assembler mode in Standard JSON are not documented. They should be listed in [Using the compiler > Input description](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/using-the-compiler.html#input-description).\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\nAdding new options on the CLI and in Standard JSON is a backwards-compatible change.\r\n\r\nThe only potentially incompatible part is the removal of the translation output from `--ewasm` but since the output selection on the CLI  was introduced very recently (not even merged yet: #12074), I think we should not consider this change breaking.",
