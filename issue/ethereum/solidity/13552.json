This is not a problem until we try to post-process the output and run into problems like #13544.\r\n\r\nSince the formatting is irrelevant most of the time, I think `cmdlineTests.sh` should be using `jq` on the output and expectations to reformat them before diffing.\r\n\r\nWe'll also need a way to disable this to keep tests for the `--pretty-print` CLI option functional. I'd go with that I suggested in #7665, i.e. disable this mode when a file called `no-pretty-print` exists in the test directory.",
