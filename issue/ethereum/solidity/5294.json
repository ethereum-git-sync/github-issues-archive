  "body": "The Yul AST makes heavy use of strings. We should abstract the string class into something that behaves better with respect to comparison and copy.\r\n\r\nProposal (names are not the best for now):\r\n\r\nCreate a singleton database (`StringDB`) that maps strings to unique identifiers (and allows efficient forward and reverse lookup).\r\n\r\nReplace all occurrences of `std::string` in the Yul AST by a new class `uniqueString` with the following properties:\r\n - constructor from `std::string` or `char*` performs a lookup in the `StringDB`. If the string exists, the unique ID is stored. If it does not exist, a new unique ID is requested, the string is stored in the DB and stored.\r\n - copy and move constructors and assignment operators are default\r\n - `operator<` and hash function are based on the unique ID.",
