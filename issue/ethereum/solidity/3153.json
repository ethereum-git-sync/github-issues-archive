  "body": "An ABI file contains items defining each object type: `function`, `event`, `fallback`, and `constructor`.\r\n\r\nThe `fallback` function, obviously, doesn't have a name (since the fallback is a function with no name).\r\n\r\nThe `function` and `event` types have a JSON field called name. This makes it easy to write code to automatically parse the input data of a transaction (as we do with QuickBlocks's **grabABI** program).\r\n\r\nFor some reason, the `constructor` has no name even though it's clearly there in the source code (i.e. and it actually carries the name of the smart contract).\r\n\r\nIf a `name` field existed in the ABI file, one could write code to grab an ABI from a smart contract from somewhere (Etherscan, ENS, wherever) and one would know the contract's name. As it is, if one wants that information, one must look outside the ABI file.\r\n\r\nSuggestion: add a name field to the constructor object in an ABI using the name of the smart contract for use in various tools.",

    "body": "I come at everything I do from the direction of a \"forensic accountant.\" By this, I mean trying to account for or audit the transactions on a contract with nothing but an Ethereum address.\r\n\r\nThe ABI faces in two directions. It faces into the EVM, and I understand that here it would serve little purpose, but it also faces out to the world. It's this second case I was thinking of.\r\n\r\nIf I have only an address, I'm hoping someday to ask ENS (or Etherscan if I must) for an ABI (if there is one), and if there's a name there, I get a little bit more information than I would otherwise.\r\n\r\nI always forget that Solidity is not the only game in town, but this is the solidity repo. Would adding a name field to the constructor's ABI break other languages in some way? (Does anyone know what percentage of contracts are written in Solidty?)\r\n\r\nPlus--the name is already there, so it seems trivial to include it. Minimal work. Greater than zero benefit. May I kindly ask what the downsides might be?",
