    "body": "Hello there.  I'm a newer Solidity dev with a C++ and compilers background. I've found the Contributing to Solidity 101 doc, the [Workflow for PRs doc](git@github.com:morganjweaver/solidity.git), and the PR Review [Checklist](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/ReviewChecklist.md) doc, and intend to submit a PR.  Please let me know if there is anything _not_ covered in the documentation that I should know.  I've also got the gitter solidity-dev channel open. Thank you!  \r\n\r\nAlso: since the callcode deprecation warning is most similar, I wanted to verify that I should include inline assembly in the check + warning, unlike callcode--is this correct?",

    "body": "Hi there and thank you very much for wanting to contribute!\r\n\r\nYes, ``callcode`` may be a good reference for emitting the deprecation warning on the solidity level - that was done a long time ago and the code base has changed a lot since, but the ``StaticAnalyzer`` should still work pretty much the same.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed there should also be a warning about ``selfdestruct`` in inline-assembly, resp. Yul - the place to look for that would be ``libyul/AsmAnalysis.cpp`` - but we can also start with a PR that only addresses Solidity and take it from there!\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask for any help you may need here or in the gitter/matrix channel - unfortunately, it seems like we're in different timezones, so we may have to rely on asynchronous communication.\r\n\r\nI hope https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/contributing.html will be a good enough reference to get you started e.g. on running the test suite. https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/contributing.html#writing-and-running-syntax-tests and running ``isoltest`` should be the most relevant for this issue.",
