  "body": "Variables can be declared `constant` which allows:\r\n- literals\r\n- (arithmetic) expressions\r\n- and function calls to \"pure\" functions, which is a hardcoded list of: `keccak256`, `ecrecover`, `sha256`, `ripemd160`, `addmod`, `mulmod`, `new` (for creating objects only, such as arrays)\r\n\r\nCurrently whenever a constant expression is used, the entire expression is placed into the output. This is of course reduced/optimised, but that is mostly restricted to operations on literals and some edge cases.\r\n\r\nWe should consider one or more of the following:\r\n1. split `constant` into two, `constant` which only allows literals and `constexpr` which allows more complex expressions\r\n2. do not allow \"pure functions\" above which result in a call (`ecrecover`, `sha256`, `ripemd160`)\r\n3. allow every pure function, not only the above subset\r\n4. evaluate `constant` or `constexpr` in a VM during compilation time and use the result only (this VM could be a subset of the EVM, since many features are not required)\r\n\r\nObviously 2 and 3 contradict eachother. I would opt for 2. unless 4. is implemented and then 3. could be allowed.\r\n\r\nSomewhat relevant is #715.",
