We had an old PR to support special comments in yul for source location annotations. I'll look it up and put it in an issue. But this is not strictly related to #10152, but more to feature completeness.\r\n>\r\n> However, what about `generatedSources` in the case of the IR?\r\n\r\n@chriseth\r\n> (...)\r\n> ah actually maybe we do need it\r\n> because the sources of internal routines should point to the generated sources instead\r\n> so the whole IR should be a single 'generated source'\r\n> and if we have a \"high level source location\" for a line of Yul, then its source location is that, otherwise it's the location in the IR file and the IR file is the generated source",
