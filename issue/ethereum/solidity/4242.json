  "body": "I'm part of a team that is building an [open-source explorer for an Ethereum sidechain called POA](https://github.com/poanetwork/poa-explorer) and we'll be implementing a contract verification feature. In order to verify older contracts, we'll need to compile a given source code in any specified solidity version. \r\n\r\n(We've already considered using the already compiled JS versions, but our team agrees that the C version would suit us better.)\r\n\r\nI've been trying to compile solidity's older versions (since the first one available v0.1.2), but I'm getting some missing files errors, for example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:31 (include):\r\n  include could not find load file:\r\n\r\n    EthDependencies\r\n\r\n\r\nCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:32 (include):\r\n  include could not find load file:\r\n\r\n    EthExecutableHelper\r\n\r\n\r\nCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:33 (include):\r\n  include could not find load file:\r\n\r\n    EthCompilerSettings\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe that this is related to the changes in the building process throughout the versions. I already had a similar error from the issue https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/86. It seems that there were some documentation to solve it but it were deprecated or moved https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/86#issuecomment-142718682 ðŸ‘‡  \r\n\r\n> I added an alternate way to build the repos in the wiki. It does not utilize the umbrella project but clones/updates only the repos required for a project in the current directory and then builds them. You can also give that a try if you want to build only solidity:\r\n> \r\n> https://github.com/ethereum/webthree-umbrella/wiki/building\r\n\r\n\r\nI've tried using some of the [current dependency install scripts](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/scripts/install_deps.sh) hoping that it could bring any old important deps but it doesn't seem to solve the problem.\r\n\r\nAny tips on how I could accomplish that given the current build process? \r\n",
