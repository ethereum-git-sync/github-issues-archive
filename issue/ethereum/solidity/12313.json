We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.\r\n- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:\r\n\t- [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)\r\n\t- [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)\r\n- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.\r\n- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.\r\n\r\n*Delete the above section and the instructions in the sections below before submitting*\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\n<!--Please shortly describe the bug you have found, and what you expect instead.-->\r\n\r\nWhen compiling the following code with optimizer enabled, solc always optimizes for contract size regardless of the \"optimize-runs\" arg.\r\nThe doc says the greater the runs-arg the more it is optimized for execution. So I would expect the optimizer to use PUSH32 at some point instead of PUSH4 and SHL. Is it possible to disable this specific \"optimization\" somehow? \r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    mstore(0, 0xa9059cbb00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n## Got:\r\n```\r\nasm: 63a9059cbb60e01b60005200\r\n\r\nPUSH4 0xa9059cbb\r\nPUSH1 0xe0 \r\nSHL\r\nPUSH1 0x00\r\nMSTORE\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Want: \r\n```\r\nPUSH32 0xa9059cbb00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\r\nPUSH1 0x00\r\nMSTORE\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version: `Version: 0.8.10+commit.fc410830.Linux.g++`\r\n- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): `london`\r\n- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix):\r\n- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client:\r\n- Operating system: `linux`\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n```\r\n# test.yul\r\n{\r\n    mstore(0, 0xa9059cbb00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nsolc --optimize --optimize-runs=999999 --strict-assembly test.yul\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease provide a *minimal* source code example to trigger the bug you have found.\r\nPlease also mention any command line flags that are necessary for triggering the bug.\r\nProvide as much information as necessary to reproduce the bug.\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n// Some *minimal* Solidity source code to reproduce the bug.\r\n// ...\r\n```\r\n-->\r\n",
