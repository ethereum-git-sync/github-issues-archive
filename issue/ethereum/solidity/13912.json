Or in other words, even with the `via-ir` pipeline and optimizer enabled, using the default steps, I sometimes face stack-too-deep errors. What additional optimizer steps, if possible, I could add to resolve it? My usual way of solving this is using structs currently.",

    "body": "In general doing less inlining might make them go away but that would usually be an overkill and may also make your code less efficient overall just to work around a problem at a single spot.\r\n\r\nYou may be able to get rid of the problem by moving code around instead - these issues are usually pretty ephemeral and just changing the order or calls or sizes of variables or struct fields can make them randomly go away, which may be good enough to solve some localized instances of it when it's just a small recent change causing it.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately there's no magical step to fix this problem. Or rather, the magical step is the stack to memory mover and it's always applied, independently of what other steps you choose. If you're still getting \"stack to deep\" with via-ir and optimizer enabled and you have nothing in your code that would prevent the mover from being applied (recursive functions or non-memory-safe assembly blocks), then this is something that we need to fix in the compiler.\r\n\r\nIn that case the best you can do is to help us track down the problem. Trimming you code to a small repro like https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13906#issuecomment-1417335621 and submitting a bug helps a lot.",

    "body": "Back to the original issue here: the way to do that would be to expose ``loadimmutable`` to inline assembly - but since that mechanism is actually rather weird and bound to still change, I'd rather not expose it further than it needs to be right now. Given the discussion, I actually don't think there needs to be assembly access to immutables, before https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13723 / https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13323 - so I'm closing this as a consideration for/after the implementation of those instead. Feel free to reopen if there is compelling need for this earlier than that.",
