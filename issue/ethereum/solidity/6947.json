We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.\r\n- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:\r\n\t- [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)\r\n\t- [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)\r\n- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.\r\n- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/e78500a1994a8dec7f328d4ad8764e79c80b2faf/libevmasm/RuleList.h#L92\r\n\r\nis redundant (and buggy?) because the rule preceeding it is always picked up for any `mulmod` operation.\r\n\r\nBuggy because the encoded transformation is not correct `a*b mod c != a*b`\r\n\r\n<!--Please shortly describe the bug you have found, and what you expect instead.-->\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version: latest develop",
