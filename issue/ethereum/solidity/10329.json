Is there any blocker for adding missing build to [solc-bin WASM distributions](https://binaries.soliditylang.org/wasm/list.json)?\r\n\r\nMostly a matter of time and lack of urgency. Last time I did mass rebuilds it took some fiddling to get stuff below 0.6.0 to build. \r\n\r\nThere is an asm.js binary available in [bin/soljson-v0.5.17+commit.d19bba13.js](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/blob/gh-pages/bin/soljson-v0.5.17%2Bcommit.d19bba13.js). Wasm binaries are faster but asm.js are still fully usable. If you're downloading the compiler in a script, you should really have a fallback to `bin/` if you don't find a specific version in `wasm/`.\r\n\r\n> There is [a published version in the NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/solc/v/0.5.17) that actually bundles `soljson.js` file in the package. Could somebody check if it fits to the distribution and if so, add it?\r\n\r\nIt's the asm.js binary I mentioned above.\r\n\r\n> Still, would it be possible to do anything with the missing 0.5.17 WASM release in historcal builds archive?\r\n\r\nI talked with @chriseth and we decided to try to rebuild it now. So it'll become available soon unless it turns out it needs some wild workarounds to build.",
