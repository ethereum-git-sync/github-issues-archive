This would have the following defined currently:\r\n- `.signatures` returns `bytes4[]` corresponding to the method signatures of the contract\r\n- `.name` returns `string` as the name of the contract\r\n\r\nThe signatures could be utilised by proxy / filter contracts and for a way to implement interface checking between contracts (along the lines of https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/165).\r\n\r\nTwo other possible methods:\r\n- `.pragma(<key>)` returns `string` of the actual pragma value or empty string if not set (or should the return type depend on the pragma type?)\r\n- `.super` returns `meta[]` corresponding to all the direct superclasses\r\n",
