  "body": "## Abstract\r\n\r\nCurrently, interface only allow functions declared as external. In the implementation, the function can be declared public to extend the scope. However sometimes complexify inheritance patterns (see Motivation bellow). By allowing functions to be declared as public in interfaces, we would improve the composability of contracts\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nLets consider the following code\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\ninterface ISomething {\r\n    function doSomething(bytes32) external;\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract Something is ISomething {\r\n    event gotSomething(address indexed sender, bytes32 value);\r\n\r\n    function doSomething(bytes32 value) public override {\r\n        emit gotSomething(msg.sender, value);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract SomethingElse is ISomething {\r\n    bytes32[] public values;\r\n\r\n    function doSomething(bytes32 value) public override {\r\n        values.push(value);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nabstract contract SomethingExtra is ISomething {\r\n    function doSomething(string calldata value) external {\r\n        doSomething(keccak256(bytes(value)));\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract Composed1 is Something, SomethingExtra {}\r\ncontract Composed2 is SomethingElse, SomethingExtra {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis doesn't compile because `SomethingExtra.doSomething(string)` can't access `ISomething.doSomething(bytes32)` that is declared external. A simple fix here would be to do \r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-        doSomething(keccak256(bytes(value)));\r\n+        this.doSomething(keccak256(bytes(value)));\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut when using Composed1, the \"sender\" of events triggered using the string variant would not be correct. Also, calling `this.doSomething` is possibly more expensive because of redirection gas cost when working with a proxy.\r\n\r\nAnother option is to do\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-interface ISomething {\r\n-    function doSomething(bytes32) external;\r\n+abstract contract ISomething {\r\n+    function doSomething(bytes32) public virtual;\r\n```\r\n\r\nand this would be seamless here, but from my experience, this often result in override specification nightmare, because the \"interface\" everything inherit from is actually not declared as an interface.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nAllow functions in interfaces to be declared as public. There function will have to be implemented publicly. Implementing them using an external function would be an error. Any contract that inherit the interface would be able to call that function. In particular, abstract contract that inherit the interface but don't implement the function would still be able to call it.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nThis doesn't affect the code that currently compile as the behaviour of the compiler with external functions declared in interfaces.",

By allowing interface functions to be `public`, that special treatment is extended to internal functions as well, improving usability by requiring less manual disambiguating overrides.\r\n\r\nAs I've mentioned [before](https://forum.soliditylang.org/t/thoughts-on-override-a-b-syntax/767), we are desperate for ways to write our contracts so that they don't require developers to write overrides to manually disambiguate something, when the compiler could in theory do it for them without causing problems.\r\n\r\nAllowing `public` in interfaces seems like an easy improvement in that direction.",

We've planned to relax and overhaul the override requirements in cases like this in response to https://forum.soliditylang.org/t/thoughts-on-override-a-b-syntax/767 for quite a while, either by just doing https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12665 or even going beyond that - it's unfortunate that we haven't gotten around to this just yet, I'm sorry about that, but we've staged it as part of our roadmap for this year (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13727).\r\n\r\nI'd say that solving this properly on the level of fixing the override-error-logic is preferable to complicating the interface rules and allowing public interface functions.\r\n\r\nAre we in agreement that fixing the override rules will solve this issue?",

    "body": "@Amxx About the `MyGoverner` example, I feel that an automatic `clock` resolution doesn't make sense at a high level. There is an `external` function `clock` defined in `IERC6372`. It gets overridden in `IGovernor`. Another implementation gets `overriden` in `ERC6372Timestamp`. It doesn't feel right to automatically resolve the conflict in `MyGovernor`.\r\n\r\nInheritance is already far too complex that it should be. I'm uncertain if adding additional rules for this sub-category is the path we should take. I understand in this specific example, the automatic resolution may be the correct one. But I think the inheritance rules should be generalized, and it hurts the language to have separate rules for every single cases.\r\n\r\nThe following is how I would fix the code (even though I'm not a fan of the `override(...)` syntax):\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n  abstract contract MyGovernor is Governor, ERC6372Timestamp {\r\n      function clock() public view override(IGovernor, ERC6372Timestamp)  returns (uint48) {\r\n          return ERC6372Timestamp.clock();\r\n      }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n",

That is why I limited that to public function.\r\n\r\nTechnically, adding `internal` function to interfaces would improve inheritance discovery even more, but would add data about non-public facing functions in the interface, which IMO would be going too far. Abstract contract feels like the right abstraction here.\r\n\r\nI'd like the interface to be the \"pure\" object we want them to be ... but then this purity goes against writing clean code because we need to re-declare things with another visibility and then resolve the conflicts we introduced. At that point I favor code readability and cleanness to absolute purity of interfaces.\r\n\r\nNote that this purity is already broken by the \"payable\" keyword.",
