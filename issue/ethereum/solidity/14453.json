  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nIn the `sources` output in Yul mode (when present), the ID of each source is given as `1`, instead of `0`.  This is inconsistent with Solidity's general practice of 0-indexing sources.  Worse yet, it's inconsistent with the numbering elsewhere in the output, namely, the source map and the AST; both of these will give the ID as `0`.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version: 0.8.21\r\n- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): default\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nAny Yul source code will do, just make sure to request ASTs in the output (about which see #14452) so that you get `sources` output.  Also good idea to request the source map as well for comparison.",
