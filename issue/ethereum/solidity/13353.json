    "body": "Hi @michprev !\r\nThanks for your report. Type identifier strings are not part of the public interface and exist just to make function names unambiguous. In particular, these identifiers can change at any time between releases and parsing them is not reliable - depending on your use case, maybe you rather need specific debugging data from the compiler? [13720](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13720) and [13157](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13157) might be of help.\r\nGiven that, we won't pursue optimizing those identifiers for decoding and thus we are closing this issue.",
