We should disallow them to prevent this.\r\n\r\nWe have already disallowed unbalanced BiDi embedding/override characters in #10326. This is unfortunately not effective against the trick described here.\r\n\r\nSee [How to use Unicode controls for bidi text](https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-bidi-unicode-controls) for details on how these characters work.",
