  "body": "The IR pipeline is non-experimental now but our [bytecode compare job](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/v0.8.17/.circleci/config.yml#L1469-L1504) still uses the legacy codegen. We should add extra runs with `--via-ir`.\r\n\r\nI think it's enough to do this for CLI. We might also switch the JSON runs to `--via-ir` but I don't think it's necessary to run them for both codegens.\r\n\r\nNote that solc-bin has a [bytecode compare PR check](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/blob/gh-pages/.github/workflows/t-bytecode-compare.yml) that's implemented separately. Not sure if we want to update that one. Running it with one codegen already provides most of its value (which is making sure that the binary is not damaged). The binaries submitted to solc-bin are expected to have gone through the full bytecode comparison in the main repo anyway.",
