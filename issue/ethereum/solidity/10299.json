    "body": "Sure. The problem is that checks in this part of `CommandLineInterface::parseLibraryOption()`:\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/09578e7e22326ed60cb696685d18981f629cf075/solc/CommandLineInterface.cpp#L678-L748\r\nand this one in `StandardCompiler::parseInput()`:\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/09578e7e22326ed60cb696685d18981f629cf075/libsolidity/interface/StandardCompiler.cpp#L836-L871\r\nare not the same. In particular:\r\n- CLI checks address checksum but Standard JSON does not.\r\n- CLI checks if the address is empty but Standard JSON does not. This check is redundant because we still check address length later but if it's there, it should be in both places.\r\n- The checks for invalid characters are different (one uses `fromHex()`, the other relies on `h160` constructor throwing exceptions). They are probably equivalent but there's really no reason for them not to be identical.\r\n\r\nSo the idea would be to make these checks as close as possible. I think it would be best to extract the validation into a single function called from both places.\r\n\r\nThe PR should include at least minimal commandline tests covering these new cases (unless they're already covered - please check). Here are some of the existing tests:\r\n- https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/tree/develop/test/cmdlineTests/linking_standard_solidity/\r\n- https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/tree/develop/test/cmdlineTests/linking_solidity/\r\n\r\nThere are more in subdirectories starting with `linking_`.\r\n\r\nNote that soltest does not execute these tests. There's a separate script for running them: [`test/cmdlineTests.sh`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/test/cmdlineTests.sh).\r\n\r\nWe also have tests covering this code in [`test/libsolidity/StandardCompiler.cpp`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/test/libsolidity/StandardCompiler.cpp) but these are more suitable if you actually want to check the results in some more complex way. For just testing the error message command-line tests should be enough.",

Also looks like `web3.js`, whch a lot of them use depends on `@ethersproject/keccak256`. Might be a bigger problem for tools that use CLI with `--standard-json` (Brownie, dapp-tools) but they still usually let you download the compiler so they likely already have a way to verify keccak checksums (we only added SHA256 for binaries very recently).\r\n\r\n> Does it create an error or a warning?\r\n\r\nIt's an error:\r\n```c++\r\n \t\tif (!passesAddressChecksum(addrString, false)) \r\n \t\t{ \r\n \t\t\tserr() << \"Invalid checksum on address for library \\\"\" << libName << \"\\\": \" << addrString << endl; \r\n \t\t\tserr() << \"The correct checksum is \" << getChecksummedAddress(addrString) << endl; \r\n \t\t\treturn false; \r\n \t\t}\r\n```\r\nBut it would not be hard to change it to a warning.
