([example](https://goerli-optimism.etherscan.io/tx/0x175fb60ef815fdfd96945a360594be529ecf201b5e51bda2a90698fdaeb73013))\r\n\r\nMy question is whether the `solc` compiler can remove whitespaces between function parameter arguments at compile time or at least issue a warning that there are whitespaces in between function parameter arguments.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\nI believe this applies to all Solidity versions that support [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) if I'm not mistaken. \r\n",

    "body": "The compiler just sees a regular memory string here - i.e. there's no real difference between ``abi.encodeWithSignature(“functionSignature(param1Type,param2Type)”)`` and\r\n```\r\nstring memory x = “functionSignature(param1Type,param2Type)”;\r\nabi.encodeWithSignature(x);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd for an arbitrary statement like ``string memory x = “functionSignature(param1Type,param2Type)”;``, in general, there is no way to tell if this is meant to be a function signature or any other kind of string, in which you may very much *want* explicit whitespace.\r\n\r\nSo given that, I don't think warning about the whitespace nor automatically removing this is an option.\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, what we can consider, is adding compiler-constructs for constructing suitable strings from properly typed expressions in the language, similar to how we have builtin constructs for computing selectors of functions.\r\n\r\nSo e.g. for\r\n```\r\ncontract C {\r\nfunction f(uint a, uint b) external {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWe currently have ``f.selector`` being based on the hash of the signature ``f(uint256,uint256)``. We *could* add something like that as ``f.signature``. However, that would not really match all the cases occurring in EIP-712, e.g. structs.\r\n\r\nEventually, it would be nice to have sufficient compile-time-constant expression evaluation and reflection in the language to actually be able to safely synthesize such strings at compile-time, but that's far away in the future, so the question is whether we can do something now that will help in these cases.",
