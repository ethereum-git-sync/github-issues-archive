So any terms that may not be familiar to such an audience would be good to be defined.\r\n\r\nFor example, one of the docs mentioned ABI, without the full meaning. So I then had to look up ABI, which there were many results for, and finally found Application Binary Interface. Even having a link to this article would be good, so I edited this. Other examples that weren't clear I have already edited.\r\n\r\nIf I had not learnt VBA and had been learning C++ then a lot of the terms would be confusing for me.",
