  "body": "After binary search a la code deletion, I finally found what was causing my stack disturbance: casting an address as a contract and then incorrectly referencing variables in that contract (without parentheses). Putting the parens in fixes it, but it is hard to find in a larger contract, so maybe the compiler could give a more helpful response. Also, it's odd because function comparison doesn't seem to bother the compiler.  \r\n\r\ncontract B {\r\n\r\n       uint public b;\r\n       uint public c;\r\n }\r\n\r\ncontract A {\r\n\r\n        function d() {\r\n\r\n                B BB =  B(0);\r\n\r\n                // the following works\r\n\r\n                BB.b() < BB.c();\r\n\r\n                // but this is disturbing\r\n\r\n                BB.b < BB.c;\r\n\r\n        }\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\nI've spent a bit of time now poking around in the compiler, so if someone wants to give me a hint, I could tackle this one.\r\n",

    "body": "Thanks a lot, @illuzen ! The proper fix would be to disallow the comparison operator for function types. This is determined by the `binaryOperatorResult` function on the type classes (in `Types.h`). Currently, the default implementation in the Type base class is to allow comparison operators for all types. Most of the derived classes then again disallow it by returning the empty `TypePointer()` for that function (this signals that it is not possible).\r\n\r\nI think a better default implementation would be to only allow it if `commonType(shared_from_this(), _other)` is non-null and is a value type.\r\n\r\nIf you need any more realtime help, please try to reach us on https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity-dev",
