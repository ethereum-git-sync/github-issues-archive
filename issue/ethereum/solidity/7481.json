I've seen this error before on Ubuntu, when people use the stock z3 (which is old).\r\nSince you're on Ubuntu, I assume you have a custom installation of Z3 4.8.5. What could be happening is that you have both versions (stock and custom) installed, and CMake is preferring the old one for some reason.",
