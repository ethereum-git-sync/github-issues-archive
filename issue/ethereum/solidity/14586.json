  "body": "## Abstract\r\n\r\nCurrently the JSON-based assembly output in Standard JSON is called `legacyAssembly`, which makes it seem deprecated. While that was the original intention, we moved away from that and we should rename it to make that clear.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nCurrently we have two assembly formats:\r\n1. `assembly`/`--asm` (text)\r\n1. `legacyAssembly`/`--asm-json`/`--combined-json asm` (JSON)\r\n\r\n`legacyAssembly` was called that ever since Standard JSON was introduced.\r\n\r\n@chriseth says that the legacy format was not machine-readable, and he wanted to remove it eventually. Though it's not certain if it was really the same as current legacy format (the non-machine-readable one was apparently text, not JSON). See also [comments from @chriseth and @axic on a related bug](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8171#issuecomment-588184845).\r\n\r\nWe're actively using the legacy JSON format for the assembly import feature that's being implemented (#13673) and it seems that if it had problems with ambiguity, those were resolved long ago. For this reason we decided to keep it after all.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nMake `\"evm.assemblyJson\"` a valid value for Standard JSON `outputSelection`.\r\n- It should produce the same JSON output that `\"evm.legacyAssembly\"` does, but under a key called `assemblyJson`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Backwards compatibility\r\n- `\"evm.legacyAssembly\"` should keep working exactly as it does now.\r\n- Selecting `\"*\"` should not include `\"evm.assemblyJson\"` for now to avoid including the same, very verbose information twice or breaking the compatibility. We may change that in the future.\r\n- Selecting both at the same time should be allowed.",
