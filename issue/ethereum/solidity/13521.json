  "body": "The `new` operator now supports the \"CREATE2\" opcode, by using the syntax `new MyContract{salt:xx}(<constructor params>)`\r\nCalling this method in a view context prior deployment let us get the \"counterfactual\" address.\r\nBut once the contract is deployed, there is no easy way to get its address: \r\nWe have to use the \"messy\" format of\r\n```\r\n        return keccak256(abi.encodePacked(bytes1(0xff), address(this), salt, keccak256(abi.encodePacked(\r\n                type(MyContract).creationCode,\r\n                abi.encode(<constructor params>)\r\n            ))));\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis method would work, but has several drawbacks:\r\n- an ugly boilerplace, easy to mis-type\r\n- no type-checking on constructor parames\r\n\r\n### Suggestion:\r\nadd a new `action` parameter to the \"new\" operation, in addition to the \"salt\", with the following values:\r\n- `action: create`. This is the default, which will attempt to create the contract, and fail if CREATE2 fails (it is already exists)\r\n- `action: address`. Just calculate the address, but don't attempt to create it\r\n   e.g. `addr = new MyContract{salt: 0, action: address}(...)`\r\n- `action: auto`. Calculate the address (using **action:address**). If it is already deployed, return this address, otherwise,  perform **\"action: create\"**\r\n",
