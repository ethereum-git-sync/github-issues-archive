With Geth's bloom filter implementation it can take many seconds to find a log with the correct topic.\n\nIn order to retrieve data quickly from the blockchain it needs to be in state because state slots are properly indexed. Logs are really only useful for watching for live updates, unless the block number of the log is stored in state.\n\nI think `indexed` is very bad developer experience because it implies that logs have a capability that they do not.\n",
