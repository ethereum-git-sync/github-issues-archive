    "body": "Hi @GeorgePlotnikov , maybe this issue is not really a good first issue for someone starting out, because it could demand understanding of how other test classes are implemented. I am not sure how long you are digging into solidity or how much time you are dedicating to it. So in order to give you more options, I'd like to suggest some other good first issues:\r\n - [Pretty print expected json output of command line tests](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7665)\r\n - [Errors reported for modifier overloading should outright say that overloading is not allowed](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12332)\r\n I just wanted to give you more options and remark that this is a medium size task, so if you are new, you might want a smaller one.
