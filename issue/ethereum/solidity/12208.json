The original repro has some special chars in it and a contract but the bug seems to be specifically in the SPDX comment parsing and a very long comment is enough to trigger it. In GDB I get an enormous stack trace that just keeps printing. It's somewhere in the C++ regex library. I think it recurses too deeply. Probably the pattern we use is not very efficient and backtracks too much.\r\n\r\nFor me it starts crashing at exactly 29069 `x` chars in the comment. I suspect that on different machines the exact limit might be different.",
