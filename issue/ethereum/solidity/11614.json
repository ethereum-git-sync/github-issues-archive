This could ~be a security issue if the current directory happens to contain a malicious library with that name~ load the wrong library or not find the right library depending where the user happens to run it from.\r\n\r\nIt would be better to search relative to the test directory, especially when `--testpath` option is used to specify that directory.\r\n\r\n~It should be using the directory where the executable is located as a base instead.~ As an additional heuristic it could look for the library also directly in the directory where executable is located. I think it should not look in the current working directory at all (unless it just happens to match one of the other dirs it searches).",

For example I always build out-of-tree and I run `soltest` from the build directory and not repo directory so in my case you won't find a good relative path from the working dir either. I always have to specify `--testpath` to make it find tests:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ntest/soltest -- --testpath ~/projects/solidity/test\r\n```\r\n\r\n> Also it should look in the same paths in which it expects to find the test cases themselves.\r\n\r\nOK, that sounds like a better alternative. But it's still not what we're doing right now so it requires a change. Currently test path and library path are independent. They're both initialized to current working directory. If the user overrides the test path with `--testpath`, `soltest` still looks for libs relative to the working dir and not the dir containing tests.",

As far as I'm concerned we can just remove that altogether and just document that `libevmone.so` has to be in somewhere the dynamic linker can find it on its own (maybe stating that ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/of/evmone`` works).

The expected location of the lib changes depending on where you are in the filesystem when you invoke `soltest` so in some cases it will be found, in others it won't. A more \"fixed\" location (like something relative to test dir) is much more predictable in my opinion.",

I think that looking relative to `--testpath` would work in more use cases (which means less problems for people who try to contribute).\r\n\r\nI actually find the idea of searching the working dir for libs pretty weird in general. We can kinda get away with it for `soltest` due to the way we call it but I'd find it strange with pretty much any other executable. Executables usually get installed globally and called from various unrelated locations.",
