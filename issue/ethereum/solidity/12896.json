    "body": "Fair enough. I applied the label because I think this is just a matter of adding a special case for errors (and maybe also events) in [`TypeChecker::typeCheckTypeConversionAndRetrieveReturnType()`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/v0.8.13/libsolidity/analysis/TypeChecker.cpp#L1753-L1876). \r\n\r\nActually, instead of special-casing it in the type checker, maybe it's better to extend [`FunctionType::toString()`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/v0.8.13/libsolidity/ast/Types.cpp#L3093-L3120) for errors and events. Not sure if that won't break someting (i.e. like formatting the type for AST/ABI output or something?) but if so, leaving it as is and instead adding a separate function that calls it and handles events and errors specially should still be safe.\r\n\r\nIn any case, this seems like a relatively simple, isolated change.

Add a special case in [TypeChecker::typeCheckTypeConversionAndRetrieveReturnType()](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/v0.8.13/libsolidity/analysis/TypeChecker.cpp#L1753-L1876) to allow conversion from `FunctionType` with `Kind::Error`.\r\n2. Add `Type::humanReadableName` which calls `toString` by default, and override it for `FunctionType` with `Kind::Error`.",

You can use `MyInterface.MyCustomError.selector`, which is already `bytes4`. @nishant-sachdeva is also currently working on adding that for events too (#12581). Not sure we really need an alternative mechanism for doing this. `.selector` should be more intuitive since it's how it works with functions and for functions we definitely do not want such a conversion.",

It would be most helpful to try to take over some of the older PRs and finish them. For example #12166 has been stalled for a long time now and is up for taking.",
