  "body": "# FEATURE REQUEST\r\n\r\n## Abstract\r\n\r\nThe `require` are very helpful and easy to understand, but the problem with `require` statements is that they store a string as an error message. And strings are not much gas optimized. To make the contract gas optimized we use custom errors within `if-else` statements. Which are not quite sometimes easy to understand especially when they get rooted in.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nI think we can solve this problem by making `Require` statements revert `Custom Error` instead of string.\r\nCheck This:\r\n```solidity\r\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\r\n\r\nerror Owner__ChorChorChor();\r\n\r\ncontract Owner {\r\n    address public owner = msg.sender;\r\n\r\n    function newOwner(address _newOwner) public OnlyOwner {\r\n        owner = _newOwner;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    modifier OnlyOwner { //Instead of this \r\n        require(owner == msg.sender, \"Chor! Chor! Chor!\");\r\n        _;\r\n    }\r\n    modifier OnlyOwner { // this would be perfect\r\n        require(owner == msg.sender, revert Owner__ChorChorChor(); );\r\n        _;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nIDk C++, I wish I could make a PR with this functionality.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n",

    "body": "(I'm sorry to revive a closed thread, but...)\r\n\r\nNot being able to use `require` with the new custom errors is indeed a barrier when porting code from older `solc` versions.\r\nDenying the existing logic and using `if` / `revert` doesn't help readability IMO, and adds one more step which can be error prone when porting large codebases. I know you can opt out and keep using strings, but it's a pity to do so given the advantages of the new custom errors.\r\n\r\nI don't know how hard it would be to implement or if there are any considerations that are being left out, but moving forward with a proposal like the one described in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7877#issuecomment-1174358430 would be very much appreciated.\r\n",
