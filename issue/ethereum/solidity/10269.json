Googling lead me to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1301850/tools-to-find-included-headers-which-are-unused. You could also do some research into it, since the stack overflow answer might be outdated.\r\n\r\nSo try to pick one such tool and then run it on the repo, then try compiling to see if it works.\r\n\r\nMight be useful: https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.3/installing-solidity.html#building-from-source\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask questions if you are stuck.

    "body": "@TerranCivilian If it's like CLion then there will be some false-positives and I think we won't want to hook that up into the CI. A script that we can run manually from time to time might still be useful though.\r\n\r\nHere are tools I suggested the last time:\r\n- [cppclean](https://pypi.org/project/cppclean)\r\n- [include-what-you-use](https://include-what-you-use.org)\r\n\r\n`cppclean` seems unmaintained so I'd try `include-what-you-use` if you want to take this further.\r\n\r\nBut overall, maybe you'd like a task where you'd get a chance to work more with C++ than Bash? If so, take a look at these two easy ones: #11553, #11583. The first one is extremely simple. The second is still simple and also adds a nice small feature so should be pretty satisfying to implement :)\r\n\r\nImport removal is nice to have but also very low priority. I actually expected many more of them to be removed so either the problem is smaller than we thought or the tools for finding them are just not good enough.",

    "body": "I had a deeper investigation on `include what you use` tool.  The result I got is not as good as I expected. It generates a lot of useful points. However, I got also points that are absolutely wrong e.g. \r\n- in Exceptions.cpp tool suggests to add `#include <iosfwd>` for `std`\r\n- in CommonIO.cpp it suggest to add `#include <bits/termios-c_cc.h>` which leads to `error \"Never include <bits/termios_c_cc.h> directly; use <termios.h> instead.\"`\r\n\r\nGenerally, after applying fix from the tool I end up with tons of compilation errors.
