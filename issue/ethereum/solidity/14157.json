I believe it makes sense to support it on Solidity language layer.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nbytes32 constant public STATE_TYPEHASH = keccak256(\r\n    \"State(\"\r\n        \"uint256 nonce,\"\r\n        \"uint256 totalSpent,\"\r\n        \"uint256 totalRefunded\"\r\n    \")\"\r\n);\r\n```\r\n=>\r\n```solidity\r\nstruct State {\r\n    uint256 nonce;\r\n    uint256 totalSpent;\r\n    uint256 totalRefunded;\r\n}\r\n\r\nbytes32 constant public STATE_TYPEHASH = type(State).typehash;\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nNot sure",

    "body": "I really like that idea. I feel like instead of calling it `State`, the semantics `Topic` would be nicer. Also, I would like to add a further request for commonly known type hashes such as the one for [`permit`](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612).\r\n\r\nInstead of doing the following (or the approach in the feature request above):\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nbytes32 private constant _PERMIT_TYPEHASH = keccak256(\"Permit(address owner,address spender,uint256 value,uint256 nonce,uint256 deadline)\");\r\n```\r\n\r\none could simply query the type hash like the following without importing the `EIP-2612` interface itself (i.e. `Permit` is already built-in):\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nbytes32 private constant _PERMIT_TYPEHASH = type(Permit).typehash\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would require restricting the namespace for `type` but I feel that it's becoming less error-prone like that due to common mistakes made such as the usage of `uint` alias in the hash.",
