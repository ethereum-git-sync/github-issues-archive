Instead we always have to split this up, potentially creating temporaries in the process, on a case-per-case-basis. So in order not to clutter IR generation with all that boiler-plate (even more so because it's easy to get wrong), ``IRVariable`` does this automatically.\r\n\r\nBut as a result, Yul-IR hardly every actually generates such yul assignments directly, but rather hides that away in having ``IRVariable``s assign to each other - which decreases the readability and usability (it's a hassle to correctly insert complex expressions into Whiskers templates this way, etc.).\r\n\r\nThat being said, it's not entirely clear what amount of tuple support in Yul would be needed, s.t. we can get rid of something like ``IRVariable`` entirely - there's still the issue of type conversions (which ``IRVariable`` attempts to deal with implicitly - although it has been argued whether that was a good or a bad idea) and Solidity has stuff like nested tuples, etc. (so we'd need to flatten) and even stuff like ``(x, (y, z)) = (f(), g());`` (which we should probably actually disallow).\r\n",
