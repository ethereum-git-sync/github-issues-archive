Currently linking is a fairly clunky process and the idea of code upgradeability is very difficult to create. Versioning is something that we should be looking to create a deeper integration of especially insofar as it concerns potential security threats from user error. \r\n\r\nLibraries should be able to go through multiple versions and contracts should be able to grow from and gain greater usage from these libraries down the line. It should definitely be contemplated carefully insofar as the syntax for this is concerned.

    "body": "@OTTTO The typical solution to create an interface for a library is to create an abstract contract but that doesn't allow you to use the 'storage' keyword. And if you try to create an \"abstract library\" i.e. a library with only function signatures, truffle (at least, not sure about straight solcjs) throws a \r\n```\r\nTypeError: Member \"libraryFunction\" not found or not visible after argument-dependent lookup in library iLibrary\r\n      iLibrary(libraryAddress).libraryFunction(data);\r\n```\r\n\r\nClearly its not generating the function selector correctly. It's probably not paying attention to the storage keyword even when it is in the signature (abstract library version of iLibrary). Either way, I can't be bothered. I'll be sticking with the delegatecall solution to save myself the headache. Link me to a functional repo as a POC if/when you really figure out how to do this.",

    "body": "I believe the ability to call Libraries dynamically (similar to Contracts) would be a very useful feature of Solidity.\r\n\r\nCurrently my team is working on an upgradeable system where Libraries can be swapped out (upgraded), and we have resorted to using assembly blocks to do a delegate calls on these Libraries where the addresses aren't known at compile time, and do not remain constant as the system is upgraded.\r\n\r\nIt would be really great if we could simplify those blocks to something like `LibraryThing(libraryAddress).doSomething()`, similar to how Contract methods can be called `ContractThing(contractAddress).doSomething()`.",
