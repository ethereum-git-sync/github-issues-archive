  "body": "Hello all of you. This is my first post here, so pardon any commonplace mistakes. \r\n\r\nFirst let me explain my development environment. I am using Ganache for a experimental blockchain, Jupyter Notebook to play around with the Web3py front-end code and Remix for the Solidity smart contract code.\r\n\r\nAll 3 tools are communicating through a custom RPC ( through 127.0.0.1:7545 ).\r\n\r\nI am trying to insert some custom data ( a string ) to the Data field of the transaction.\r\n\r\nI succeed at doing this while i am transacting between two Ethereum Accounts;\r\n\r\n`web3.eth.sendTransaction({\r\n    'from' : dummy_account_1,\r\n    'nonce': nonce,\r\n    'to': dummy_account_2,\r\n    'value': web3.toWei(1, 'ether'),\r\n    'data' : my_custom_string,\r\n    'gas': 3000000,\r\n    'gasPrice': web3.toWei('50', 'gwei'),\r\n})`\r\n\r\nHowever, when i try to do the exact same thing with a smart contract,\r\n\r\n`web3.eth.sendTransaction({\r\n    'from' : dummy_account_1,\r\n    'nonce': nonce,\r\n    'to': smart_contract_address,\r\n    'value': web3.toWei(1, 'ether'),\r\n    'data' : my_custom_string,\r\n    'gas': 3000000,\r\n    'gasPrice': web3.toWei('50', 'gwei'),\r\n})`\r\n\r\ni get the following error\r\n\r\n`'message': 'VM Exception while processing transaction: revert', 'code': -32000`\r\n\r\nThis brings to mind a few observations;\r\n\r\n1. I know that the data field has different uses. If a contract is being created, the data field of the corresponding transaction will contain the contract creation code. If a function from the smart contract is being called, the data field of the transaction involved will contain **function invocation** data. Account to account transactions simply ignore the data field as of yet.\r\n\r\n2. Would it be possible to send a transaction to the contract that would not call any function in the smart contract at all ? instead the **DATA** field would only contain some arbitrary string.\r\n\r\n3. The reason for doing what is mentioned in point 2, is to transfer some ether to the contract, while keeping some pertinent and relevant information about that transfer in the **data** field.\r\n\r\nMy main intention is to modify that **data** field by inserting some data into it myself, and to send the corresponding transaction to the Smart Contract.\r\n\r\nHence, if anyone could shed some light on the issue, suggest any plausible alternative methods and help me clear up any misconceptions i might have about the Ethereum protocol or maybe even Solidity itself, i would be most grateful.",
