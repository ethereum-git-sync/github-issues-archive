    "body": "I think the way to approach this, @chriseth, would be to flip to building-from-source in `install_deps.sh` for Ubuntu - as I'm doing for json-rpc-cpp in my cpp-ethereum branch.    Then we're not dependent on PPA at all, and work identically across all versions.    Easy win for other distros too.\n\nI also flipped to build-from-source for CryptoPP in the same place, again because of issues in the old version shipped with Trusty.\n\nI would actually propose that we drop the PPA entirely as a source of external dependencies, and use it (them, when we split cpp-ethereum and solidity PPA) ONLY for publishing our binaries, not for hosting binaries for external packages which aren't new enough by default.\n\nSee https://github.com/bobsummerwill/cpp-ethereum/blob/merge_repos/scripts/install_deps.sh#L389.\n\nCC @chfast.\n",

    "body": "Yes - adding sub-modules for external dependencies is something which I think it a very sensible option for us to consider.\n\nIt gives us complete control of versioning and build-options and lets us all avoid all the packaging-system variance madness there is within Linux and the lack-of-packaging system for Windows.\n\nThe cost is that for external packages which are large (like Boost, LLVM) this can add a huge amount of time to the build process.   In TravisCI, where we already up against the 48min limit, this might not even be possible.\n\nBut yeah - something to try for sure.\n",

It will be like that.\n\nYou could either just download the external package (as Pawel does), or in jsoncpp's case, you would probably just add it as a sub-module.\n\nI started doing something very similar for the cross-builds here:\n\nhttps://github.com/doublethinkco/jsoncpp\n\nPawel could probably guide you best as the pattern he used there.\n",
