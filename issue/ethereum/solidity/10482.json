We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.\r\n- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:\r\n\t- [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)\r\n\t- [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)\r\n- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.\r\n- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThe type name `bytes0000000032` is valid. I expect that leading zeroes should be disallowed, otherwise they might make people think that octal-formatted integers are permitted for sizing types (e.g. `bytes040` is disallowed and not interpreted as `bytes32`). Really, the fact that these numbers are not treated as octal is entirely an artifact of `boost::lexical_cast<int>`, as used [here](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/liblangutil/Token.cpp#L133).\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version: latest\r\n- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): ?\r\n- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): ?\r\n- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: ?\r\n- Operating system: macOS\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nUse zero-prefixing in sized types, such as `bytes032`.\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\r\npragma solidity ^0.7.0;\r\ncontract MyContract {\r\n    bytes0000000032 x;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Possible Remediation\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nint parseSize(string::const_iterator _begin, string::const_iterator _end)\r\n{\r\n  if (_begin == _end || '0' == *_begin)\r\n    return -1;\r\n\r\n  try\r\n  {\r\n    int m = boost::lexical_cast<int>(boost::make_iterator_range(_begin, _end));\r\n    return m;\r\n  }\r\n  catch(boost::bad_lexical_cast const&)\r\n  {\r\n    return -1;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```",
