  "body": "Currently the compiler will always include the metadata at the end of runtime + initcode. The metadata consists of version, hash, and potentially the experimental flag.\r\n\r\nIn the pipeline the only flag we have is to disable the inclusion of the hash, but the version field is always included.\r\n\r\nWhile I really like having this there, removing it from the runtime code becomes quite challenging, because one needs to dissect the initcode. Why would someone remove the metadata? To pass code purity checks.",
