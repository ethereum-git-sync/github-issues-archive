  "body": "Current Problem: \r\n\r\nSuppose I have a file structure for a module `foo` as such:\r\n```\r\n. \r\n├── contract_bundles\r\n│   ├── bar\r\n│   │   ├── 1.0.0\r\n│   │   │   └── bar.sol\r\n│   │   └── 2.0.0\r\n│   │       └── bar.sol\r\n│   └── dee\r\n│       └── dee.sol\r\n└── foo.sol\r\n```\r\nAnd the following contents in the files set as:\r\n\r\nfoo.sol:\r\n```\r\nimport \"bar/bar.sol\";\r\nimport {Dee} from \"dee/dee.sol\";\r\n\r\ncontract Foo {\r\n\tBar bar;\r\n\tDee dee;\r\n\tint version;\r\n\tfunction Foo() {\r\n\t\tversion = bar.Version1();\r\n\t}\r\n\tfunction callDee() {\r\n\t\tversion = dee.version();\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\ndee.sol:\r\n```\r\nimport \"bar/bar.sol\";\r\n\r\ncontract Dee {\r\n\tBar bar;\r\n\tint public version;\r\n\tfunction Dee() {\r\n\t\tversion = bar.Version2();\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n1.0.0/bar.sol:\r\n```\r\ncontract Bar {\r\n\tfunction Version1() returns (int) {\r\n\t\treturn 1;\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2.0.0/bar.sol:\r\n```\r\ncontract Bar {\r\n\tfunction Version2() returns (int) {\r\n\t\treturn 2;\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently I can get this to compile using the following command:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsolc dee/=./contract_bundles/dee/ foo.sol:bar/=./contract_bundles/bar/1.0.0/ $dee/:bar/=./contract_bundles/bar/2.0.0/ foo.sol\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Mid issue writing update \r\nDocumentation complaint: I was about to complain about the fact that there is no way to reference an already created prefix from a remapping. While trying out different potential syntactical ways that would be intuitive I actually found that a brilliant one works and isn't at all documented (that being the $ reference approach above). \r\n\r\nPrior to finding this out I had been referencing the actual directory `dee.sol` was housed in to make a module (aka: `./contract_bundles/dee/:bar=./contract_bundles/bar/2.0.0/`). This *NEEDS* to be documented. \r\n#### End update\r\n\r\n\r\nI find this command missing an important feature (possibly 2):\r\n- There is no way to define the present working directory and maintain `module` targeting. Believe me...I've tried `./:`, `.:`, and even `:`. None of these ways work. There are times (from a package management perspective) where you do want to blank define the `pwd` and use a remapping only for this module.\r\n- There may be utility in the ability to exclude a directory from a remapping prefix. Currently that is not possible (perhaps something like a `!` rather than a `:` to define a module). \r\n",
