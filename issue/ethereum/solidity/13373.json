    "body": "To be honest, it wasn't meant to be a minimal example. I chose it because it's still relatively simple while showing two interesting things:\r\n1. You can have tuples at any nesting level. Argument list as a whole is a tuple but structs are also affected.\r\n2. It's very common for a length field of some dynamic type to be overwritten but that's not the only possible case. Putting something dynamic in a struct/array makes it dynamic.\r\n\r\nI don't mind adding another example, but I don't see what more it would add. Why do you think we need one?\r\n\r\nAlso, this is just as minimal:\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract C {\r\n    function f(bytes32[1] calldata c) external {\r\n        abi.encode(\"dan\", c);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nOr this:\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract C {\r\n    error E(bytes, bytes32[1]);\r\n    function f(bytes32[1] calldata c) external {\r\n        revert E(\"dan\", c);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```",
