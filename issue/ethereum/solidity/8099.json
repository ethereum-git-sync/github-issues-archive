We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.\r\n- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:\r\n\t- [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)\r\n\t- [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)\r\n- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.\r\n- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\n<!--Please shortly describe the bug you have found, and what you expect instead.-->\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version:\r\n- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings):\r\n- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix):\r\n- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client:\r\n- Operating system:\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease provide a *minimal* source code example to trigger the bug you have found.\r\nPlease also mention any command line flags that are necessary for triggering the bug.\r\nProvide as much information as necessary to reproduce the bug.\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n// Some *minimal* Solidity source code to reproduce the bug.\r\n// ...\r\n```\r\n-->\r\nWhile every example mentions that they support \">=0.4.22 <0.7.0;\". \r\nBut in fact, a lot of them don't.
