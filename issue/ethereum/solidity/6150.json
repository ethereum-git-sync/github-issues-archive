  "body": "I think it would be cool if solidity could say \"skirrt\" every time it made an error instead of the saltine-cracker \"revert\". Compilers like truffle and remix-ide can play a 4-tone MIDI \"skirrrt\" sound. When i get a revert error i always feel bad because it means i have to debug the EVM. But if my code skirrrted instead, i would at least feel better about it when i had to debug the EVM",
