It is a large monolithic single C++ file, which takes a long time to compile and is hard to maintain.\r\n\r\nWe want to move as many test cases out to individual files under `test/libsolidity/semanticTests`.  They should be grouped logically, by following the grouping in SolidityEndToEnd.\r\n\r\nHave a look at existing test case in both places to see how they operate.\r\n\r\n(This was previously designed/discussed in #3486, but creating a new issue to be more helpful.)",
