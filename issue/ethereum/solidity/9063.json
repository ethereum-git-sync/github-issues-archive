A template area would be similar to a template library in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/869#issuecomment-624541988 in that only functions with internal calling semantics, type definitions and maybe interfaces are allowed - nothing that can or is expected to be deployed at an address.\r\n\r\nSyntax:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnamespace <name>[T1, T2] {\r\n   struct X {\r\n       T1 a;\r\n       T2[] b;\r\n    }\r\n    function f(X calldata, T2) returns (uint) {\r\n        ...\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```",
