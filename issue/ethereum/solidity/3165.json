Actual implementations using those contracts can achieve a lower gas cost for their use cases.\r\n\r\nAlso note that support for the old precompiles are part of the language due to historical reasons, simply there was no efficient way to implement them as libraries, not even support for libraries existed. \r\n\r\nI hope in the long term even the old ones can be moved into libraries.",
