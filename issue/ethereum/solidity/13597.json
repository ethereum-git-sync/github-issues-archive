At the same time this has been sitting here for a while untouched because, reducing a 15k LOC project into a small example is quite tedious. It's not hard, just needs some effort, and we'd be happy to reopen this if you could get us something more along the lines of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13906#issuecomment-1417335621. You can do that by starting with what you have and gradually removing stuff. Removing those imports, contracts, functions, function bodies, comments that can be removed while still triggering the bug. Otherwise it's difficult to even look into the problem because a repro of this size is hellish to debug.",

    "body": "We need a complete self-contained example that we can compile and reproduce the error. This snippet alone is not enough unless it reproduces it on its own. The thing with \"Stack too deep\" errors is that the thing that seems to trigger it is just just a random thing that tips it over, not the cause in itself. The actual cause is the particular complex arrangement you have in your code (and that's also the reason why the compiler cannot really tell you where exactly it happens, there's no single place). We need to look at the code as a whole and that's only feasible when it's a relatively small example. If it's too large, we have to reduce it ourselves by removing stuff until there's nothing more we can remove.",
