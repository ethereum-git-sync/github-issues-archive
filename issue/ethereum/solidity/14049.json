  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nThe assignment of `Immutable Variable` in the `constructor` function may be incorrectly assigned under the influence of subsequent inline assembly code (for example `msotre`).\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version:\r\n- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): <=0.8.19\r\n- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Remix\r\n- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: EVM execution environment \r\n- Operating system: Windows\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n###\r\nThe expected behavior of the following code is that `a` is `0x4B20993Bc481177ec7E8f571`, but is eventually assigned the value `msg.sender`.\r\n```solidity\r\npragma solidity ^0.8.19;\r\ncontract C {\r\n    address public immutable a;\r\n    constructor() public {\r\n        a = 0x4B20993Bc481177ec7E8f571ceCaE8A9e22C02db;\r\n        F(msg.sender);\r\n    }\r\n    function F(address witnessAddress) view public returns(address){\r\n        assembly{\r\n            mstore(0x80,witnessAddress)\r\n        }\r\n        return a;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21294029/225047237-ccaa92aa-f953-41e5-900b-5642689288f2.png)\r\n### Reasons\r\n\r\nThe reason for the above problem is that, unlike other source code compilation results, the assignment of an `immutable -variable` is first `mstore` in the `memory` area starting at `0x80`, and then `mload` is used to save the variable to the `stack` area after the `constructor`â€™s user code is executed, and `mstore` is executed again after `codecopy` to modify the `bytecode` content.\r\nThis means that the code after the `immutable-variable` assignment may still affect its execution logic. For example, `mstore.`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nThrough the collection of open-source [projects](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+lang:solidity+mstore%280x80+count:all&patternType=standard&sm=0&groupBy=repo), we can easily find a large number of functions that use the `mstore` operation.\r\nFor example, [the following code snippet](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/thec00n/etherscan_verified_contracts/-/blob/contracts/0xec424a2a841a6c77d270fd91bd885ccb06392be5_Admin.sol)\r\n```solidity\r\nfunction initialize() internal view {\r\n       ...\r\n        assembly {\r\n            ...\r\n            mstore(0x80, sload(0))\r\n```\r\nThis means that mstore operations are common, and we need to be wary of such operations being called in `constructors` that have `immutable variables`.\r\n\r\n### Fix\r\n\r\nWe suggest giving some `warning` about the above problem in the compilation result to warning users of the above risk.",
