    "body": "Hi @axic and @cameel  - I saw this is a good first candidate issue and started doing some work specifically with the SemVer error reporting. You can see a draft PR here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12487\r\n\r\nI just wanted to check before continuing work on this whether you are happy with the implementation and some questions:\r\n- I'm not sure what error codes we should throw or where I can find typical error codes - this is currently failing in the CI since for development purposes I've just made the error code 1465.\r\n- I added the BOOST_THROW_EXCEPTION in the catch since some invalid parsed expressions did not throw - is this okay or would this break some of the language compilation?\r\n\r\nAfter your guidance I would be up for moving onto the other scanner errors to try improve the reporting.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know and thank you :)",
