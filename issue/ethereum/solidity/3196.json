  "body": "# Feature request: Add `constructor` modifier\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\n\r\nSolidity currently has no special syntax to distinguish a constructor from a function. A constructor is simply a function whose name equals that of the contract.\r\n\r\nThis introduces a dependence between the name of the contract and the constructor that is easily overlooked when refactoring code, and can have disastrous consequences: If the contract is renamed, but the constructor isn't, the constructor becomes a public function callable by anyone. This allows the state of the contract to be reset or modified by an adversary. There are examples of such a vulnerability in real-world contracts, e.g. in [the case of Rubixi](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/06/19/thinking-smart-contract-security/).\r\nI have also encountered this issue during smart contract audits.\r\n\r\n## Suggested solution\r\n\r\nI suggest the following path for fixing this issue:\r\n\r\n*In a first phase*, solidity should introduce a new `constructor` function modifier. The compiler should emit a warning when it encounters a constructor that does not carry the modifier. It should emit an error if it encounters a function that isn't a constructor but that carries the modifier. Here are some examples showing the desired behavior:\r\n\r\n**No warning**\r\n```\r\ncontract Foo {\r\n   function Foo() constructor {\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Warning**\r\n```\r\ncontract Foo {\r\n   function Foo() {\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Error**\r\n```\r\ncontract Bar {\r\n   function Foo() constructor {\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n*In a second phase*, use of the `constructor` modifier would be made mandatory, perhaps as part of the 0.5.0 release. Having a constructor without the `constructor` modifier would result in an error instead of a warning.\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgements\r\n\r\nI would like to thank Florian Tram√®r (@ftramer) and Phil Daian (@pdaian) for comments & feedback.",
