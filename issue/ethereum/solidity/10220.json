  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nPrior to solc 0.6.0, the statement `arr.push(x, y);` would give the error-message:\r\n```\r\nWrong argument count for function call: 2 arguments given but expected 1...\r\n```\r\n\r\nStarting from solc 0.6.0, the same statement gives the rather confusing error-message:\r\n```\r\nMember \"push\" not found or not visible after argument-dependent lookup...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt feels like your internal state-machine has been unable to find a matching \"prototype\" for this \"function\".\r\nOr perhaps this is just a subsequent result of the changes made in `push` (not returning a value) starting from solc 0.6.0?\r\n\r\nIn either case, since `push` is a keyword (rather than a function) in the perspective of the user, it doesn't quite make sense to emit this error-message.\r\n\r\nMoreover (and worse), this message implies that `push` cannot be used on the operand, which implies that the operand is not a dynamic storage-level array (even when it is).\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version: 0.6.0 or higher\r\n- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): any\r\n- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): any\r\n- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: any\r\n- Operating system: any\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\npragma solidity 0.6.0;\r\n\r\ncontract Test {\r\n    uint256[] private arr;\r\n\r\n    function func(uint256 x, uint256 y) public {\r\n        arr.push(x, y);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n",

It says it's about overload resolution but it's a symptom of the same problem so I added your case there.\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this issue as a duplicate to keep the discussion in one place so if you have any comments, please post them in #9607. The issue is already in the implementation backlog so you can expect it to be fixed in one of the upcoming releases.",
