    "body": "Thanks for the report, but the documentation is correct. `hex\"12\"` is a hex string literal of length 1 and cannot be assigned to a value of type `bytes2` (length 2). It may look like it has 2 characters but in such a literal each 2 digits represent a single byte. Here it contains a single character with ASCII code 12, i.e. the \"form feed\", often represented with the `\\f` escape sequence. It's not equivalent to string literal `\"12\"`.",

    "body": "Ah, wait. I misinterpreted your report because you put part of your description in the title and I missed it. Thought you were pointing out that this should be allowed and it's not.\r\n\r\nYeah, this looks like a bug. I checked and it does compile. Both with hex and non-hex literals. Literals are convertible to fixed bytes not only when they're the same exact length but also when they're shorter. And apparently it's been working that way forever (all the way down to 0.1.2).\r\n\r\nNow the question is - is it just a documentation bug or did we actually intend for them not to be convertible? @chriseth?",
