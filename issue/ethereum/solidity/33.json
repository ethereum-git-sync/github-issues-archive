  "body": "@hynese asks:\n_Anyone know if it's possible to rotate a uint256 by 8 bits? I can't seem to find any suitable operators ;(_\n\n(There is no lower level EVM opcode for SHL/SHR/ROR/ROL, I checked. So they must be emulated.)\n\nIt would be nice to implement:\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libsolidity/ExpressionCompiler.cpp#L1071\nor this:\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libsolidity/ExpressionCompiler.cpp#L1067\n\nUsing this: (and testing, of course!)\n_Shifting left by N is equivalent to multiplying by 2^N._\n_Shifting right by N is (if you are using ones' complement) is the equivalent of dividing by 2^N and rounding to zero._\nsource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#Arithmetic_shift\n\nSHL(input, bits) = input \\* (2^bits)\nSHR(input, bits) = input / (2^bits)  (then round to zero?)\nWikipedia has some code describing how to do rotate using shift, this is probably the most optimal way: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_shift#Implementing_circular_shifts\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/2835469/how-to-perform-rotate-shift-in-c#answer-2835503\n\n(This also has applications for some cryptographic code, although such code is probably optimized by not using an emulated rotate/shift, it would simplify the logic of it.)\n",
