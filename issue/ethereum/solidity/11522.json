    "body": "I played with the example a bit and here are some observations:\r\n- It seems to require that fairly specific base combination: contract that inherits from a contract imported from another file which has a function that calls a function that calls an internal library function.\r\n- It does not happen with free functions. Only internal library functions.\r\n- Putting the contracts in the same file, removing inheritance or removing one of the functions in the chain makes the error go away.\r\n- Once the you have that basic pattern in the code (functions, calls, contracts, etc.), adding more stuff does not seem to affect it much.\r\n\r\nThis must be related to the control flow graph PRs that went in this release so pinging @Marenz.",
