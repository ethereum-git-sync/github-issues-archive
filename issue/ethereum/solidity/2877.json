(Sadly, I'm hard-pressed to pull actual examples of this resulting in security vulnerabilities out of my hat, but I do vaguely remember this having been an issue as recently as last year, around `TheDAO` hack.)\r\n\r\nFor this reason, ConsenSys even [suggests prefixing event names with `Log`](https://github.com/ConsenSys/smart-contract-best-practices/blob/5e14839219b146ee1ae11b2e3c585ac2136078e9/README.md#differentiate-functions-and-events), \"to prevent the risk of confusion between functions and events\".\r\n\r\n### A solution\r\n\r\nPropose introducing a new keyword, tentatively named ~~`log`~~ `emit`. So, instead of:\r\n\r\n``` solidity\r\nevent Transfer(address from, address to, uint256 _value);\r\n// ...\r\nTransfer(from, to, value);\r\n```\r\n\r\nwe would have:\r\n\r\n``` solidity\r\nevent Transfer(address from, address to, uint256 _value);\r\n// ...\r\nemit Transfer(from, to, value);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis makes a (general) semantic differentiation between a function call and logging of an event. (It also renders Consensys' recommendation obsolete.)",

That means an event is so impulsive that its endurance tends to zero like triggering a gun shot.",

While with `emit` I have the impression that I do not care about what happens afterwards (light analogy: I send out the light, but I do not care where it goes).\r\n\r\nNote that emitting light and triggering a gun both send out something, but when triggering a gun, I implicitly include the mechanism of the gun.
