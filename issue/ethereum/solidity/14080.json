  "body": "## Abstract\r\n> **NOTE: This seems to only be breaking if you do another external call from a contract with address(0). e.g. in the example below, if callA returns address(0).**\r\n\r\n`try/catch` only catches the very first external call although it allows multiple external calls to be tried. This could be a bit of a footgun if a single external call is not warned or enforced or if each of the external calls in the \"try\" block are not tried.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\n<!--In this section you describe how you propose to address the problem you described earlier, including by giving one or more exemplary source code snippets for demonstration.-->\r\nThis can be slightly confusing when you do something like: `try IContractB(contractA.callA()).callB() {} catch {}`\r\nThis will revert if the function `callB` doesn't exist on the address returned by `contractA.callA`.\r\n\r\nThe interfaces:\r\n```\r\nIContractA {\r\n  function callA() external returns (address);\r\n}\r\n\r\nIContractB {\r\n  function callB() external;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nIt would make more sense to:\r\n1. not allow multiple external calls to be tried (compiler error)\r\n2. try each of them separately\r\n3. warn that you have multiple external calls in a try \"block\" (compiler warning)\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nSpecifications 2 and 3 would likely be backwards compatible, but Specification 1 would probably break code which violates this rule when they update their solc if this change was made.",
