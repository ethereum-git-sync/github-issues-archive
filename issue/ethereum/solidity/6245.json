  "body": "I've seen at EthCC that solidity 0.6.0 will includes keywords `override` and `virtual`. This is awesome! However, an additional keyword to delete function could be very nice to have.\r\n\r\nExample, I have a smart contract `A` that implements a complexe ownership mechanism and a `verify(something)` function. I could want to have a smart contract `B` i herite all of `A`'s code, except for the `verify` function that will be replaced (but not overriden) by `verify(something different)`.\r\n\r\nThis will reduce the cost of deploying `B` and reduce the risk of error when calling the `verify` function.",

In that case, I don't think this is a good idea because it is incompatible with inheritance rules:\r\n\r\nIf `x` is an instance of `B` which inherits from `A`, then the full interface of `A` has to be available on `x` because you can always convert `x` to the type `A`.\r\n\r\nNote that functions that are essentially unused because they are overridden will not be part of the bytecode - this should already be the case now.",
