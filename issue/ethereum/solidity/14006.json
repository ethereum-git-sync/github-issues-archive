We do want to have it eventually, it's not that we don't see the usefulness :) For now the recommended workaround is just to keep using an attached method (i.e. `exp()` added with `using for`). That's also the workaround for cases where you'd want an operator working on different types. Over time these quirks should disappear. What we delivered in 0.8.19 is just a MVP that we could do without committing ourselves to premature decisions regarding the type system.",
