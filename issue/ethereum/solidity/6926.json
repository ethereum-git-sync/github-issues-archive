We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.\r\n- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:\r\n\t- [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)\r\n\t- [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)\r\n- Ensure the issue isn't already reported (check `feature` and `language design` labels).\r\n\r\n*Delete the above section and the instructions in the sections below before submitting*\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Abstract\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease describe by example what problem you see in the current Solidity language\r\nand reason about it.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nBoost version incompatibilities may introduce bugs in solidity. Examples are #6667 and #6870 \r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn this section you describe how you propose to address the problem you described earlier,\r\nincluding by giving one or more exemplary source code snippets for demonstration.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdd a nightly CI (one each) for boost >=1.65 <= 1.70\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThe technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The\r\nspecification should be detailed enough to allow any developer to implement the functionality.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTBD",
