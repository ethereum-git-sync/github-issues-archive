  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nWe (@chatziko, @MichaelXanth) ran into an optimizer issue that can be reproduced in the following minimal contract: \r\n```solidity\r\npragma solidity ^0.8.18;\r\n\r\ncontract Test {\r\n    function v1() public {}\r\n    function v2() public {}\r\n\r\n    function equalityTest() external returns(bool) {\r\n        return v1 == v2;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`equalityTest()` returns`false` when the optimizer is disabled. However, with the old optimizer enabled, the equivalent functions `v1` and `v2` are merged into one, causing `v1 == v2` to be `true`. I am not sure whether there is a clear specification of function type comparison, but the two functions have distinct selectors so it makes sense to consider them as non-equal. In any case, the optimizer should not alter the contract's semantics.\r\n\r\nThis behaviour does not appear in the Yul optimizer.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version: 0.8.18\r\n  - Also with the unreleased 0.8.19\r\n- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): istanbul\r\n- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): hardhat\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nCompile the above contract with and without the optimizer.\r\n\r\nThe produced bytecode can be compared below:\r\n\r\nhttps://library.dedaub.com/decompile\r\n\r\nNon-Optimized MD5: e1a4db0287ad6624f24ab4adbc61475b\r\nOptimized MD5: 531e2a5364fdbc3e00c9733a4372d948\r\n\r\n\r\n",

If the optimizer collapses identical internal functions, the described behaviour is at least in some sense consistent.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, ``this.v1`` and ``this.v2`` are *external* function pointers, which actually involve encoding the address of ``this`` and the selector together. For those, the optimizer changing the behaviour of an equality comparison would definitely be a serious bug.\r\n\r\nJust to make this distinction clear here - all that being said, it still seems a bit weird and misleading that this happens - out of my head I'm not quite sure what to do about this. An option would be to disallow comparisons of internal function types altogether - although there might be uses for that.",
