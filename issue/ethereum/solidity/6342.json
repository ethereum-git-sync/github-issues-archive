    "body": "Please correct me if I am wrong, but there are a couple of parts to this:\r\n\r\n* Recover when there are parse errors\r\n* Output AST information even if it is incomplete.\r\n\r\nLet me elaborate on these two. \r\n\r\n@chriseth suggests specific examples that I think fall into of the general method described in [Efficient and Comfortable Error Recovery in Recursive Descent Parsers](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8ec1/6b0f5d9fd4ebb3dd5a5d2ce5c85df382c9c5.pdf?_ga=2.66202926.1641430271.1553456907-1338304767.1553456907).\r\n\r\nHere ')' , '}', and ';' are examples of symbols when seen often trigger the completion of a production rule (or production function), such as for an expression, a block statement, or a statement respectively for each of those symbols.\r\n\r\nAnother kind of recovery, not mentioned above but mentioned in the cited paper, is where there is a token that is expected and missing, for example contract name after the word `contract`. Recovery here just adds that token.\r\n\r\nBalancing expediency with a full solution, what I'd propose to do is implement something along the lines of what @chriseth suggests, but doing it more along the lines mentioned in the paper. In doing it this way, some simple errors can be caught and we can see results more quickly, while leaving open the possibility of handling fine-grained or other kinds of situations later. Improving error recovery an be incremental.\r\n\r\nDoing a general solution described in the paper would probably require an automated a way to compute these \"first\" and \"follow\" sets which would need to be done every time the grammar changes.  On the other hand, extending on the simple \"gobble until recovery symbol\" idea, one could generalize that approach a little bit more and compute some these \"first\" and \"follow\" sets by hand. By starting with the higher level productions (contract, function, compound statement) and working down the the lower-level ones (e.g. statement, assert statement, expression),  error recovery can be added incrementally on a grammar production (or recursive procedure)  basis.\r\n\r\nBut even if there were some sort of recovery in place, there is second problem to address: even when there _is_ some sort of failure, solc should still spit out any AST information it has, even if incomplete. \r\n\r\nFor example: suppose there are two functions and only one of them has an error, let's say the 2nd one, and we just can't recover from it, then at least output AST for the first function can be emitted.\r\n\r\nThoughts?
