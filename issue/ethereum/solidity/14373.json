  "body": "- **Motivation**:  The Transpiler must have both primitives and essential types, this includes Max size of a given type and/or its limitations.\r\n\r\n- **Objectives**: The transpiler is to provide seamless conversion of Solidity code to C++, ensuring that the essential types are properly translated and handled. This involves mapping Solidity's primitive types, such as bool, uint, int, address, bytes, string, bytes32, fixed, ufixed, enum, mapping, and struct, to their corresponding C++ equivalents.\r\n\r\n- **Success Criteria**:\r\n\r\n1. Accurate mapping of Solidity types to their corresponding C++ types.\r\n2. Handling of type limitations, such as the maximum size of integers or fixed-point decimals.\r\n3. Proper conversion of complex types, such as enums, mappings, and structs.\r\n4. Preservation of the semantics and behavior of the Solidity code in the generated C++ code.\r\n\r\n- **Dependencies**: This step is essential to the foundation of the transpiler to work.\r\n\r\n- **Risks and Mitigations**: Ensuring that the chosen C++ types are compatible with the intended behavior of the Solidity code. Careful analysis and testing should be conducted to verify the compatibility and resolve any inconsistencies.\r\n\r\n- **Resource Allocation**:  Rules and code generation will be changed to fit this criteria.",
