They are all different from pure-ness, because pure expression can have side-effects on memory.\r\n\r\nAlso, the concepts of side-effect-free-ness above do not have to mean that the expressions have zero effects on memory: Allocating a new memory array could be considered side-effect-free, but maybe this could be better handled in a lifetime or usage tracking module.
