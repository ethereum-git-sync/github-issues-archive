The documentation format works well for a lot of things already, why would we need to have a different format for developer documentation as long as it is clearly separated?\r\n\r\n>Do you see something wrong with this?\r\n\r\nThere is nothing wrong, its just that if this is to be interpreted/implemented by 10 different persons, they will provide you 10 different results.\r\n\r\ne.g., I interpret \"Clean Separation\" differently than e.g. leonardoalt , I categorize \"high quality contributors\" differently than e.g. you, I assess the current doc-format differently than you.\r\n\r\nWhat I want is this:\r\n\r\n- If I sent some developer to a project (e.g. Solidity), then I want to be able to say \"Focus on the DEV folder and do the project-setup, ignore anything else\" or \"get an overveiw of the SRC folder - ignore the rest\".\r\n\r\nI possibly \"sent\" myself to a project, executing some task whilst placing myself in a role (e.g. do this coding-taks, fulfill this bounty etc.).\r\n\r\n## Sample\r\n\r\nFixing the Solidity Project takes around 50 to 100 tiny steps. Problem: nearly each and every step can be \"discussed to death\". So, it must be performed nearly as a whole, to be efficient, to become visible. I've done several of them to demonstrate how a reworked project would look&feel. Newcomers and high-quality-devs (or high-sensitivity/productivity devs) can judge it best.\r\n\r\n(EDIT: to clarify: this does not mean that the existent devs are not high-quality etc.! Its just that they know the project \"blindly\", so they lost the ability to assess its simplicity.)\r\n\r\nHere is the landing-page. From here, visitors are relayed to USER or to DEVELOPER (Solidity itself)  documentation:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/lazaridiscom/solidity/blob/laz-rework/README.md\r\n\r\nI will see to it to apply #5429 and a few more things till Monday, so you can discuss it if you have the time (I somewhere saw that you meet Mondays).\r\n\r\nBeside the Structure, there is of course Content (where there real \"fighting\" starts...). I always strive for the Goal \"Zero Docs, as System is Self-Documenting\" (never achieved this fully, though...).\r\n\r\n(note: this is not the most difficult part of a rework.  But if this is not done, then the difficult parts on code-levels are more or less useless)\r\n\r\n## Benefits / Goals\r\n\r\n* Core Developer work is simplified\r\n* Lowered Barrier to (Project) Entry\r\n* Issues can be handed out to external workers with much lesser effort\r\n* some things more...\r\n",

    "body": "Hello, one of Zeppelin devs here. We are happy to clarify anything related to the audit. @lazaridiscom if you have questions, just ping me.\r\n\r\nWe reported a good bunch of things to fix, but most of them were not high-severity, and none of them are uncommon for a project on the 0.x phase. Some of them are even chosen trade-offs to bootstrap a project. However, note that the Solidity team started to work on the issues as soon as we started conversations, long before we published the results. And they continue improving in all the topics we reported, which has been very encouraging for us because in order to continue building our products at Zeppelin we need to trust that the processes they are building will lead us to an amazing 1.0 Solidity release.\r\n\r\nNow, if I may give an opinion nobody asked... :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: As a community we have to verify their work, and offer suggestions and hands. That part is awesome. But I think that the disagreement on this discussion became emotionally loaded very quickly, which is understandable but not productive. Note that there is still a long way to go until we reach 1.0, and that there are many many ways to solve the problems we find. Maybe we need to restructure the repo, maybe we can solve this with better docs, maybe we need both; it is hard to know right now, but everything we do is an experiment with small iterations that helps us get closer to the right solution. This project is very demanding so we have an extra role that's to support the people leading it, even when we disagree. As long as they listen and discuss openly, it's very easy to backtrack a little and try the other idea when things aren't going as expected.\r\n\r\nAn issue is not the right place to discuss this, so sorry for continuing the thread. There is a gitter solidity community channel that sounds like a better place to continue talking.\r\n\r\npura vida.",
