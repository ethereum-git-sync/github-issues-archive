  "body": "As I understand, every **public state variable** will have a corresponding **external getter function** with the same name (but can have necessary input parameters for some cases). \r\n\r\nMy question is what if I have a function _with the same signature_ (function name and input parameter types) as this auto-generated getter function?\r\n\r\nI've experimented with the following simple contract in Remix, and I found the explicitly defined function (here `number()`) seems to **shadow** the auto-generated getter function.\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\npragma solidity ^0.4.21;\r\n\r\ncontract TestFunctionStateVariableNameConflict {\r\n    event log(uint256 number);\r\n    uint256 public number = 111;\r\n    function number() public pure returns(uint256) {\r\n        return 222;\r\n    }\r\n    function print() public {\r\n        emit log(number);  // This will output value 111 (as the state variable)\r\n        emit log(this.number());  // This will output value 222 (as the function number())\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere I found the log output of function `print()` are 111 and 222. If I change the signature of function `number()` (e.g., add an unused input parameter `bool unusend`), the result will be both 111 as I expected, since the getter and explicitly defined function now have different signatures.\r\n\r\nWhat's more, if I move the declaration of `uint256 number` to the end of the contract body (so it is after the declaration of `function number()`), I will be given a TypeError for `emit log(number)` and a DeclarationError for `emit log(this.number());`. It seems when dealing with `emit log(number);`, Solidity thinks here `number` is a function and so give a TypeError; and when seen `uint256 public number = 111;`, it thinks there's already an attribute named `number` (the function) and so give a DeclarationError.\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\npragma solidity ^0.4.21;\r\n\r\ncontract TestFunctionStateVariableNameConflict {\r\n    event log(uint256 number);\r\n    // uint256 public number = 111;\r\n    function number() public pure returns(uint256) {\r\n        return 222;\r\n    }\r\n    function print() public {\r\n        emit log(number);  // This will lead to a TypeError\r\n        emit log(this.number());\r\n    }\r\n    uint256 public number = 111;  // This will lead to a DeclarationError\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, my question is: should there be constraints between state variable names and function names in Solidity, especially when public state variables have their auto-generated getter functions? If so, what is the precise rule and where can I find it in any documentation.\r\n",
