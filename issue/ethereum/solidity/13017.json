  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nThe behavior of dynamic storage arrays with struct type is inconsistent and the compiler output is not helpful. I would expect that `pop1` and `pop3` be semantically equivalent; that is, `.pop()` would return the last array element and delete it. However, the error message for `pop3` suggests that a type of tuple is return by `.pop()`. \r\n\r\nWhen I treat it as a tuple as suggested, the error message says there's a different number of components... Ideally one could cast this tuple to the struct type or receive the struct type and manually reference values, but neither works with `.pop()`. \r\n\r\nSee also that the number of components is different when accessed via index versus using pop (`pop2` vs `pop4`).\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version: Version: 0.8.13+commit.abaa5c0e.Darwin.appleclang\r\n- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): NA\r\n- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): NA\r\n- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client:  NA\r\n- Operating system: MacOS\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\nRun `solc test.sol`\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\npragma solidity =0.8.13;\r\ncontract Test {\r\n  struct MyStruct{\r\n    uint num;\r\n    bytes32 info;\r\n  }\r\n  MyStruct[] myStruct;\r\n  function add(uint a, bytes32 b) external {\r\n    myStruct.push(MyStruct({num: a, info: b}));\r\n  }\r\n  function pop1() external returns(MyStruct[] memory myMemoryStruct) {\r\n   if (myStruct.length != 0) {\r\n     myMemoryStruct = new MyStruct[](1);\r\n     myMemoryStruct[0] = myStruct[myStruct.length - 1];\r\n     delete myStruct[myStruct.length - 1];\r\n   }\r\n  }\r\n  function pop2() external returns(MyStruct[] memory myMemoryStruct) {\r\n   if (myStruct.length != 0) {\r\n     myMemoryStruct = new MyStruct[](1);\r\n     (uint a, bytes32 b) = myStruct[myStruct.length - 1];\r\n   }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  function pop3() external returns(MyStruct[] memory myMemoryStruct){\r\n   if (myStruct.length != 0) {\r\n     myMemoryStruct = new MyStruct[](1);\r\n     myMemoryStruct[0] = myStruct.pop();\r\n   }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  function pop4() external returns(MyStruct[] memory myMemoryStruct) {\r\n   if (myStruct.length != 0) {\r\n      myMemoryStruct = new MyStruct[](1);\r\n     (uint a, bytes32 b) = myStruct.pop();\r\n   }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n```\r\nError: Different number of components on the left hand side (2) than on the right hand side (1).\r\n  --> test.sol:21:6:\r\n   |\r\n21 |      (uint a, bytes32 b) = myStruct[myStruct.length - 1];\r\n   |      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n\r\nError: Type struct Test.MyStruct storage ref is not implicitly convertible to expected type uint256.\r\n  --> test.sol:21:6:\r\n   |\r\n21 |      (uint a, bytes32 b) = myStruct[myStruct.length - 1];\r\n   |      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n\r\nError: Type tuple() is not implicitly convertible to expected type struct Test.MyStruct memory.\r\n  --> test.sol:28:26:\r\n   |\r\n28 |      myMemoryStruct[0] = myStruct.pop();\r\n   |                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n\r\nError: Different number of components on the left hand side (2) than on the right hand side (0).\r\n  --> test.sol:35:6:\r\n   |\r\n35 |      (uint a, bytes32 b) = myStruct.pop();\r\n   |      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n```",
