I think there are only few real-world cases, where people would want that. We can exclude some cases:\r\n - modifiers that have no code after the `_`\r\n - functions that are external-only and do not have any \"important\" code after the inline-assembly block (to be debated)\r\n - functions that are not called from other functions",
