  "body": "Apologies if this is more of a question for EVM, than Solidity.\n\nBasically what I am doing is trying to find the cheapest (in gas) way to build up a string (using dynamic bytes), but in a non-linear fashion.\n\nThe following works:\n\n``` js\nstring memory holder = \"     \";\nbytes memory ret = bytes(holder);\nret[0] = 0x30;\nret[1] = 0x31;\nret[2] = 0x32;\nreturn string(ret);\n```\n\nOutput is: 30313220\n\nBut the following will be truncated to the last access:\n\n``` js\nstring memory holder = \"     \";\nbytes memory ret = bytes(holder);\nret[2] = 0x32;\nret[1] = 0x31;\nret[0] = 0x30;\nreturn string(ret);\n```\n\nOutput is: 30\n\nOf course I have digged deeper and found out the very simple reason. Solidity compiles the above into MLOAD + MSTORE instructions, and those according to the the yellow paper, will set the size of the memory to that index (truncate).  Therefore by the last ret[0] it will be truncated to 1 entries.\n\nSimple way to confirm this behaviour:\n\n``` js\nstring memory holder = \"      \";\nbytes memory ret = bytes(holder);\nret[2] = 0x32;\nret[1] = 0x31;\nret[0] = 0x30;\nret[3] = 0x20;\nreturn string(ret);\n```\n\nOutput is: 30000020\n\n_What is the best way to do this properly?_ Mappings work, at a cost.\n",
