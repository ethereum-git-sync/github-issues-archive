    "body": "While this could still have some uses, even with custom errors (when they store a message string as one of the parameters), I think that the need for this is much less pressing now, and it may not be worth implementing at all. At least not specifically as a measure targeted at errors. It could be a generic mechanism for embedding string templates in metadata but that I think should be considered and designed from ground up, taking into account the new language features that we added in the last 3 years.
