    "body": "I mainly prefer `--combined-json` for it's easy commandline use – I can get all of the compiler outputs of interest with a relatively simply one liner.\r\nAs far as I can foresee there would be nothing fundamentally limiting to migrate dapptools to use `--standard-json` besides the obvious labor involved in architecturing everything to support the new format. Many features that have been introduced into `--standard-json` have been neglected in `--combined-json`, so if that pattern is to continue we would probably migrate anyway. \r\nMy preference would of course be to simply get `--combined-json` up to feature parity, as requested in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10274.\r\n",
