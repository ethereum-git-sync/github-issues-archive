The comment should include the type.\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract Proxy {\r\n  /// @solidity:storage-layout address\r\n  bytes32 private constant _IMPLEMENTATION = keccak256(\"proxy.implementation\");\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nThere's no backwards compatibility issue.\r\n",

    "body": "I'm not sure I fully understand what is being requested here. You want to be able to annotate that a certain constant could have been a variable and would have been taking up a storage slot then?\r\n\r\nWhat is the expected output? What would happen if there were two such constants next to each other? Or if it's followed by a variable that actually takes up the slot?\r\n\r\nOverall, this might be something that would be solved as a part of a feature for overriding the storage layout generated by the compiler. We have a bunch of feature requests for that:\r\n- #597\r\n- #4519\r\n- #8353\r\n- #12513\r\n- #12920\r\n\r\nIs there anything here that would not be covered by these? For example if we had #4519 you could just put an explicit gap next to such a constant to \"reserve\" its slot.",
