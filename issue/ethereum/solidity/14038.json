    "body": "I tried to analyze this and I can reproduce it but can't really see why the legacy version reverts. I did manage to reproduce it with Remix, so it's an actual bug though. The only real difference is that the reverting code leaves the stack clean, while the non-reverting one leaves extra stuff on it.\r\n\r\n### Minimal repro\r\n```solidity\r\nfunction freeFunction() {}\r\n\r\ncontract C {\r\n    receive() external payable {\r\n        payable(this).send(0);\r\n        freeFunction();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function f() external {\r\n        payable(this).transfer(0);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt fails on legacy and passes via IR. The free function call and a mix of `send()` and `transfer()` seem to be the necessary elements to trigger it. It's reproducible only with optimizer disabled.\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\nThe revert on legacy goes away if you remove the call to the free function. This is weird because it should be a no-op. To check what's going on I compiled the example above with and without `freeFunction()` call on 0.8.19 and compared the asm output.\r\n\r\n```\r\nsolc test.sol --asm --debug-info none\r\n```\r\n[with-free-function-call-unoptimized.asm.txt](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/files/10943518/with-free-function-call-unoptimized.asm.txt)\r\n[without-free-function-call-unoptimized.asm.txt](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/files/10943519/without-free-function-call-unoptimized.asm.txt)\r\n\r\nThere are minor differences in layout (different tag names, an extra unconditional jump), but ignoring that, the only thing that could be causing it seems to be this bit:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n     tag_1:\r\n       jumpi(tag_2, calldatasize)\r\n       address\r\n       0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff\r\n       and\r\n       0x08fc\r\n       0x00\r\n       swap1\r\n       dup2\r\n       iszero\r\n       mul\r\n       swap1\r\n       mload(0x40)\r\n       0x00\r\n       mload(0x40)\r\n       dup1\r\n       dup4\r\n       sub\r\n       dup2\r\n       dup6\r\n       dup9\r\n       dup9\r\n       call\r\n-      swap4\r\n-      pop\r\n-      pop\r\n-      pop\r\n-      pop\r\n-      pop\r\n-      tag_7\r\n-      tag_8\r\n-      jump     // in\r\n-    tag_7:\r\n       stop\r\n```\r\n```diff\r\n-    tag_8:\r\n-      jump     // out\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is the body of the `receive` function. The \"before\" version in this diff is the one with the free function call. It pops 5 values from the stack after `call` and then jumps to the empty `freeFunction()` and back.\r\n\r\nI thought that it might be popping too much, but after counting the slots it does not seem to be the case. If did not make some mistake, the stack just before `call`, with \"squashed\" dups and swaps looks like this:\r\n```\r\n       [11] and(address, 0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff)     \r\n       [10] mul(iszero(0x00), 0x08fc)\r\n       [09] 0x00\r\n       [08] mload(0x40)\r\n       [07] 0x00\r\n       [06] mload(0x40)\r\n       [05] sub(mload(0x40), mload(0x40))\r\n       [04] mload(0x40)\r\n       [03] 0x00\r\n       [02] and(address, 0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff)     \r\n       [01] mul(iszero(0x00), 0x08fc)\r\n```\r\n\r\n`call` consumes 7 of of 11 items and returns one. We're left with 5 and these are consumed by `pop`s. The unconditional jumps afterwards just consume `tag_7` and `tag_8` and then we reach `stop`. with an empty stack\r\n\r\nInterestingly, the optimized version does not revert, even though it looks like it should leave the stack in the same state:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsolc test.sol --optimize --asm --debug-info none\r\n```\r\n[with-free-function-call-optimized.asm.txt](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/files/10943555/with-free-function-call-optimized.asm.txt)\r\n[without-free-function-call-optimized.asm.txt](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/files/10943556/without-free-function-call-optimized.asm.txt)\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n    tag_1:\r\n      jumpi(tag_2, calldatasize)\r\n      mload(0x40)\r\n      address\r\n      swap1\r\n      0x08fc\r\n      swap1\r\n      0x00\r\n      swap1\r\n      dup2\r\n      dup2\r\n      dup2\r\n      dup2\r\n      dup2\r\n      dup9\r\n      dup9\r\n      call\r\n-      pop\r\n-      pop\r\n-      pop\r\n-      pop\r\n-      pop\r\n-    tag_7:\r\n       stop\r\n```\r\n\r\n@chriseth @ekpyron Any idea why one reverts and the other does not?",

    "body": "My suspicion is that this is not really a semantic difference between codegens but just a result of minor differences in gas consumption due to different optimization.\r\n\r\nThe difference might be caused by whether after the chain of nested `send()` calls there is enough gas left to execute the extra opcodes. If there is, the top-level `receive` successfully ignores the return code from `send()`. Otherwise it reverts out of gas, making `f()` revert as well due to its use of `transfer()` rather than `send()`.\r\n\r\nI'm not that well versed in all the subtleties regarding how much gas is forwarded and what reverts when so I could be wrong. Someone has to confirm this.",

Also, low level calls without valid signature need to be somehow tied to fallback function if exists. May be for now, I simply be extra careful and consider recursion before filing an issue.",

In general, we do want this stuff to be tested... so yeah, maybe it's enough to just be aware of these cases for now - it drove me nuts the first time I saw a case like this until I got what happened and it was probably similar for Kamil now :-) - but once you know it's not too hard to see what's happening.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I'm closing this issue as a non-issue for now.",
