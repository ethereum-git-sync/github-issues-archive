    "body": "The auto-generated function does have a different signature than the one in the interface. The one in the interface requires an external and an internal implementation, while the internal implementation is missing for the auto-generated function. There is no way to call `totalSupply()` internally in `Token`. Sorry that the keyword `public` for auto-generated functions is misleading here. If you change `AbstractToken` to `function totalSupply() external constant ...`, it should work.",
