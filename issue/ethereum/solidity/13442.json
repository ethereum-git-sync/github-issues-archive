    "body": "The peephole optimizer rules in the PR look quite extensive to me. We should try to do as much as possible in the rulelist. Of course, the rulelist does not know if the expression is followed by a jumpi.\r\n\r\nIn the example from the linked godbolt code, there are some expressions that strike me as unoptimized:\r\n\r\n1) ``iszero(eq(value, iszero(iszero(value))))``\r\n2) ``eq(iszero(iszero(var_a)), 0x01)``\r\n\r\nThe first could be turned into a rather complex simplification rule, because it is the condition to check for a bool to be cleaned. If in a bolean context, we could simplify the whole thing to `shr(1, value)`, but we don't know if we are in a boolean context. We could simplify to `iszero(iszero(shr(1, value))` and hope the peephole optimizer will do the rest (which already has a rule for iszero iszero jumpi).\r\n\r\n2) This could be done by ``eq(iszero(X), 0x01) -> iszero(iszero(X))``",
