    "body": "Another way to reproduce it is to compare `super` with `this`:\r\n``` solidity\r\ncontract C {\r\n    function h() public {\r\n        this == super;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI noticed that the assertion is triggered only if we're comparing with the current contract. If we compare with something else, we get a compilation error so I think the failure is not directly caused by `super` not being `TypeType`. Or at least there's already some workaround to deal with that problem and it's buggy:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract D {}\r\ncontract C {\r\n    D d;\r\n    function h() public {\r\n        super != d;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```\r\nError: Operator != not compatible with types contract super C and contract D\r\n --> super.sol:5:9:\r\n  |\r\n5 |         super != d;\r\n  | \r\n```\r\n\r\nLooks like no one is working on this bug right now so I'm going to take it.",

    "body": "Fixed in #9748. The cause was that any contract was considered implicitly convertible to the type of its `super`. When both appeared in the comparison operator the compiler tried to do just that, saw that a conversion is possible and and then proceeded to the conversion code where we assume that `super` won't ever appear.\r\n\r\nSo yeah, changing `super` so that it's a `TypeType` would fix it too but that's a bigger change and it's breaking. My fix just deals with the ICE.",
