    "body": "My use case is that I often just go to `/tmp/` and create a file called `test.sol` when I want to try things out. I can easily compile that with `solc` but executing it with `isoltest` is more tedious:\r\n- It has to be copied over to the working copy and shows up as a stray file in git, etc. These are one-offs most of the time and I just prefer them automatically gone on reboot.\r\n- I always build out of tree so I have to add extra args to help isoltest locate my working copy in the first place (`--testpath <working copy path>/test`), which makes the command longer for no good reason.\r\n- Since test names are not full paths, I can't use Bash completion when I do something like `--test=semanticTests/my_test.sol`. I have to type out the full path unless I'm actually inside `test/libsolidity/` in the working copy.",
