  "body": "Came up in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11507#issuecomment-919550891.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nCurrently both `Error` and `Warning` are displayed in red in the terminal so errors do not stand out and warnings are not easy to discern from errors. I haven't checked, but I suspect that the info messages added in #11606 are red too.\r\n\r\nThe output would be more readable if warnings and infos had different colors. My proposal is to use yellow for warnings and white for infos. Infos will blend with the background that way but they are not meant to stand out anyway.\r\n\r\n## Current Behavior\r\nHere's a sample contract with a few bugs (`C.sol`):\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract C {\r\n    function f() public {}\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract D is C {\r\n    function f() internal\r\n    override {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is what the output of `solc C.sol --color` looks like currently:\r\n![solc-compiler-errors](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/137030/133339180-eb132c51-2557-4d87-8d1e-2593612c5708.png)\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\nFully backwards-compatible. We do not provide any backwards-compatibility guarantees for ANSI sequences used in the terminal. Any tools that depend on the format of terminal output are expected to either use the `--no-color` flag or be able to deal with arbitrary colors.",
