  "body": "In 0.4.7 and 0.4.8 version strings in metadata produced by the binaries contain platform name. This results in different bytecode on different platforms.\r\n\r\nThis is not an issue in versions <= 0.4.6 because they do not include metadata hash in the binary. In versions >= 0.4.9 version string does not contain platform name.\r\n\r\nNot producing the same bytecode on all platforms creates issues with source verification like the one reported in #10183. Unfortunately I don't think we can do anything about this case. Any change in the source would change the hash so we can't backport the fix from 0.4.9 even if we wanted to. I think we'll just have to discourage people from using them.\r\n\r\nShould we do something more to prevent them from being used by default? I don't think that removing them completely is a good idea but we could for example move them to a different directory in solc-bin so that they're still available but not included on the list of binaries that tools use?\r\n\r\n### Version strings in metadata\r\nNote: We have no Linux builds for these versions and the macOS builds I used are the ones from https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/pull/76.\r\n\r\n#### 0.4.7\r\n| Binary                                             | Version in metadata                       |\r\n|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\r\n| `solc-emscripten-asmjs-v0.4.7+commit.822622cf.js`  | `0.4.7+commit.822622cf.Emscripten.clang`  |\r\n| `solc-emscripten-wasm32-v0.4.7+commit.822622cf.js` | `0.4.7+commit.822622cf.Emscripten.clang`  |\r\n| `solc-windows-amd64-v0.4.7+commit.822622cf.zip`    | `0.4.7+commit.822622cf.Windows.msvc`      |\r\n| `solc-macosx-amd64-v0.4.7+commit.822622cf`         | `0.4.7+commit.822622cf.Darwin.appleclang` |\r\n\r\n#### 0.4.8\r\n| Binary                                             | Version in metadata                       |\r\n|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\r\n| `solc-emscripten-asmjs-v0.4.8+commit.60cc1668.js`  | `0.4.8+commit.60cc1668.Emscripten.clang`  |\r\n| `solc-emscripten-wasm32-v0.4.8+commit.60cc1668.js` | `0.4.8+commit.60cc1668.Emscripten.clang`  |\r\n| `solc-windows-amd64-v0.4.8+commit.60cc1668.zip`    | `0.4.8+commit.60cc1668.Windows.msvc`      |\r\n| `solc-macosx-amd64-v0.4.8+commit.60cc1668`         | `0.4.8+commit.60cc1668.Darwin.appleclang` |\r\n\r\n#### 0.4.9\r\nFor comparison, on 0.4.9 metadata contains `0.4.9+commit.364da425` on all platforms.",
