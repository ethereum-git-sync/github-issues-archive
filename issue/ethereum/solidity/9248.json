The convention originally comes from Scheme.\r\n\r\nWe could also require the object to be an explicit parameter: `C.append(this, x)` or `C.append(self, x)`. This is how bound library methods already work. If we ever make arguments immutable by default (#715), distinguishing between methods that modify the object and ones that don't would be a natural extension: `function append(C mutable this, uint x)`.\r\n\r\nIf we want a keyword though - what about `mutator`?\r\nI think that `mutable` kind of works too - it's used this way e.g. for c++ lambdas.

    "body": "I think `pure`, `view`, `nonpayable/mutable/mutating`, `payable` is the order we should have and not consider any of them implicitly. \r\n\r\n`nonpayable` is a bit too long, `mutating` implies an active role in making changes, while `mutable` is more passive. Additionally `mutable` suggest the function may be mutable, i.e. replaceable so probably not a good idea.\r\n\r\n*Useless blurb: Initially I was going to argue for `mutating` because a mutating function is known to be actively using opcodes which cause state changes, while in the case of `payable` it depends on inputs (whether there is a value or not). However, `mutating` functions can also be non-mutating depending on external input.*\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWe could also consider moving to a different system, for example the following: Consider everything pure by default and introduce a new field/modifier called `state` and let it have multiple flags: `read`, `write`, `payable`.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n- `function f() state(read) {}`\r\n- `function f() state(write) {}`\r\n- `function f() state(read,write) {}`\r\n- `function f() state(read,write,payable) {}`\r\n- `function f() state(payable,selfdestruct) {}`\r\n\r\nArguable as we have established some of these states imply others, such as it would be unrealistic to have a payable function which does not reads or writes -- albeit possible which does not \"writes\" if we assume balance changes not caused by the contract do not mean \"writing\".\r\n\r\n\r\n",
