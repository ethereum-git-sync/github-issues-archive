The release notes on Github used to contain the SHA2-256 hashes of the binaries, but it seems we may have omitted them for some reason lately -- not that the Github release page has any strong defences.\r\n\r\nWe actually recognised that we may not have been explaining this well enough, but the hashes of every single build (for any of the platforms) is part of the official release repository: https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin. While the repository has had the hashes for several years ([1](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/pull/15): keccak256 starting Dec 2016, and [2](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/pull/82): sha256 starting February this year), we actually starting writing a blog post last week explaining it.\r\n\r\nAnd for proper authentication, please see #628.\r\n",
