    "body": "I have played around with this idea, and it seems is not that hard to accomplish. Here is a fork where i manage to get some functionality to work for it with some considerations (https://github.com/jcaracciolo/solidity/commit/bb4a0aa93d980038ecf9161addd78eb29a92ed65).  I know it may probably break in most edge cases, but i try it out with a couple of contracts and worked out great.\r\n\r\nThere is an issue with the requirements to **\"analyze\"** the file when the **AST JSON** is generated. This is because the **AST JSON** contains much more data than just parsed information (such as scope, complex types and others) that require for more processing to be done. This will be trickier without the imports since some of the information required to **\"analyze\"** the file is present in other files, and the compiler will fail to execute if it cant find them.\r\n\r\nThere has to be some thought if all this extra information gathered after the parsing is required in the **AST JSON** when parsing only one file. If is not, then is trivial to do the change, just skip the [this loop](https://github.com/jcaracciolo/solidity/commit/86b46f7d091eb5f262b3317fce90b6db11656297#diff-78164cdc66e05ecd50b9e229f2247f09L262) and double check the **AST JSON** generation wont throw a null pointer on missing data (which is basically the commit in my fork).\r\n\r\nIf in fact it is, then there are a lot more edge cases to take into account when trying to analyze a file without its imports.\r\n",

    "body": "I think the import file callback is somewhat limited, as it only works in js, and doesn't work when using a native/docker version of solc. As we discussed in #3168 and in private, we think using a native solc would improve the development speed in most cases.\r\n\r\nThe benefits of exporting the parser aren't just extracting imports. That's why I tagged other people that deal with solc's last or build/use their own parsers. Can you please comment here if this would help you?",

    "body": "I have two main uses for accessing an AST prior to compilation:\r\n\r\n* I can more effectively determine if a contract has changed, and from that infer which source files to recompile.  It's unfortunate to have to run the compiler on an entire project because the user added an extra line in their `SafeMath` library.\r\n* I can better determine dependencies and associations.  Knowing imports is useful, but a single source file can contain multiple contracts and a user might forget to remove an import statement for a contract they no longer require.  The AST lets me build an effective dependency chain so I know exactly which contracts to recompile when I detect a change.\r\n\r\nI'm also in agreement with @alcuadrado that this is useful in the native solc..  I'm working in Python so `solcjs` isn't an option.",

I think the absolute path can still be put in the annotations. For now, we only have 'parsing' - but we could extend it at some point in the future by defining other \"checkpoints\". The main problem is to check that such an incomplete AST can be exported without crashing.",
