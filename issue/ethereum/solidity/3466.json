    "body": "The compiler does not focus on optimizing artificially short contracts. That being said, we could probably detect whether a function uses memory at all and only initialize the free memory pointer for those. This might result in longer code, though, and thus would be a trade-off between deploy time cost and run time cost.\r\n\r\nThe free memory pointer is at `0x40` to have the first 64 bytes as a \"scratch area\" which does not have to be allocated.\r\n\r\nThe stop after return is inserted as a safety measure in case the code does not end with a 'return'. We should probably replace it by an InvalidInstruction instead.",
