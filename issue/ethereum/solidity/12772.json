In that case it is reduced by the transaction's gas limit multiplied by the tx.gasprice.\r\n\r\nCode that attempts to compare balances and make decisions should be aware of this.\r\n\r\nI have proposed a tweak to the documentation for address.balance. Please review and edit as appropriate.\r\n\r\n## Pull request\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12771\r\n",
