    "body": "Interesting. It actually triggers an exception inside STL:\r\n```\r\nUncaught exception:\r\nDynamic exception type: std::logic_error\r\nstd::exception::what: basic_string::_M_construct null not valid\r\n```\r\nAnd it's unrelated to the fact that the directive is truncated. The full form causes the same crash:\r\n```solidity\r\nusing {a as ''} for uint;\r\n```\r\nTokens like `\"\"` or `hex\"\"` trigger the some problem. Interestingly, others that I would expect to cause this as well do not. `()`, `1`, `x`, `\"abc\"`, `false` are all handled properly.\r\n\r\nI found a very similar problem early in the PR's life where using an identifier like `x` was causing a crash. That was because such tokens have no string representation assigned in `Token.h` (they have `nullptr` instead). That's the case for string literals too so I wonder what's different specifically about empty string literals.",
