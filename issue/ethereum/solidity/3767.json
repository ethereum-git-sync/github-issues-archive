As a bare minimum we should document this.\r\n\r\nIf we decide to use `returndatacopy` in every case (>=byzantium) that means a `call` may succeed, but `returndatacopy` may fail if extending the memory results in OOG.\r\n\r\n(*) Skipping here means that their pointer is just skipped. If a dynamic type is the last ABI item, very likely the decoder will not reach a point of checking the actual data boundaries and therefore would accept a short input.",
