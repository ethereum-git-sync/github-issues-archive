  "body": "The ``CMakeLists.txt`` files should be updated and all ``file(GLOB ...)``'s should be replaced by lists of filenames (potentially split into ``CMakeLists.txt``'s in subdirectories).\r\n\r\nThis came up before (I haven't found an issue for it, though) and I now noticed it again, since the ``develop`` branch contains a file that the ``050`` branch does not contain and switching between them breaks the build unless ``cmake`` is re-run. Using explicit lists of source files will allow ``make`` to deal with added and removed source files without the need for running ``cmake`` again.",
