  "body": "Part of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2405:\r\n\r\nStatements of the form `switch x case \"...\" { ... } ... default { ... }` need to be transformed from 256 bit to 64 bit.\r\n\r\nOne solution would be to change it to an if - elseif - chain, but we do not have `else` (that's what we have switch for...).\r\n\r\nAnother solution would be to just transform it into nested switch statements:\r\n\r\n```\r\nswitch x_1 case \"<highest 64 bits of first case>\" {\r\n    switch x_2 case \"<second highest 64 bits of first case>\" {\r\n    ...\r\n    }\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem with that one is that we still have to do something about the default case. Probably the best way would be to use such a hierarchical switch transform (which also degrades nicely if all cases are small numbers) and add an additional variable that is set to `1` in the 'default' cases of the leaves. After all the switches, there is an additional `if <flag> { <default body> }`.\r\n\r\n",
