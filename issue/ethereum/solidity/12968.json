However, someone newer to Solidity, who hasn't read all the documentation, likely wouldn't realize this, and would likely conclude that Unicode strings simply aren't allowed at all.\r\n\r\nThe error message should be rewriten to point out the existence of `unicode` strings. Say something like, \"Unicode character in non-unicode string literal; literal must be marked as unicode\" or something like that.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version: 0.8.13\r\n- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): default\r\n- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Truffle\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nSee above.",
