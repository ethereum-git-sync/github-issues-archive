Extending that to templated namespaces makes sense, but would require some more thought.\r\n\r\n- I'm not quite sure about the ``using`` construct wrt to namespaces. E.g. what does the following mean?\r\n  ```\r\n  namespace X { struct Y { uint256 x; } }\r\n  using X for uint256;\r\n  ```\r\n  This doesn't really make sense - and if we only allow it for individual functions, that is again subject to the concern of this being a hassle compared to internal library functions (i.e. \"bulk\" ``using`` statements for several functions). Allowing ``using`` only for namespaces that *only* contain functions, maybe even only functions with the correct type as first argument, might solve this, but I'm not sure about it.\r\n- Can namespaces be re-opened/extended? If not, this might mean that ``namespace`` is not the best name, but I'm also not entirely sure about ``module``. If they can be re-opened, this would raise issues for restricting ``using`` to namespaces with only functions in them.\r\n- I'd say whatever we allow for functions we should also allow for modifiers (i.e. have both of them at file level or in a construct like ``namespace``).\r\n- A conservative approach to naming/doing this would be ``internal library {}``... not sure about it - just saying...",

    "body": "using: Currently, libraries also contain lots of other things, most notably structs, but I would be fine with restricting `using` to only namespaces with only functions. I would not disallow functions with different first parameter type because it gives you some flexibility about how to group functions, but am also not too strong on this.\r\n\r\nI would not allow namespaces to be re-opened.\r\n\r\nAbout modifiers: it is probably not very useful to have a modifier that does not have access to state variables, but we can still allow it.\r\n\r\nI think we should move away from the word library, it has been used for too many different things.",

    "body": "If we allow `using A.* for B` where `A` is an imported module without adding explicit namespaces or named modules, one tiny problem that still needs to be solved is if we want to allow `using A for B` at file level - as a replacement for it being used inside a library.\r\n\r\nI think allowing `using A for B` at file level could also simplify the language. One issue with `using` we have is that it is not clear how it behaves with inheritance. I think it is more justifiable that `import \"abc\"` does not \"import\" the effects of \"using\" - and certainly `import \"abc\" as X` does not import it.",
