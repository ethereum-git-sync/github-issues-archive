It would be more convenient to have a simple script that regenerates it automatically.\r\n\r\nWe could have a small Python script that reads versions from the existing `robots.txt` (or, alternatively, fetches tags from github API), compares with the output of `get_version.sh` and spits out a new file. The script could also be executed as a part of `scripts/docs.sh`.",
