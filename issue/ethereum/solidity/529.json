  "body": "...or, how can I trust the runtime bytecode?\n\nFor instance, a few years from now, I want to use a contract which has been written today, but first I want to make sure it will execute as expected, so I re-build the source and compare the binaries. However, if the compiler is not the same as the one which has been originally used, it is likely the output will be different. So I have to know which version has been used but there's currently no way do discover this information. \n\nI could ask the developer, but said developer can be out of reach at a critical moment, or even permanently. Or, I could collect all versions (and maybe forks) of the Solidity compiler, try them all to have a chance to get a matching binary, but that's a clumsy workaround at best. There are too many cases where I cannot trust the code, and this pretty much defeats the whole purpose of smart contracts in a \"trustless\" environment. \n\nThere should be some kind of tag in the runtime bytecode, giving the information needed to build the same bytecode from the same source. In the meantime, a workaround would be to use a dedicated variable, which would be recommended for best practices, and users would have to learn to only use contracts where this information is available... A built-in solution would solve the problem once and for all.\n",

Without some sort of indicator with the version of the compiler, or some sort of information, it is impossible for a person to verify. \n\nMany, many people were attempting to verify the recent DAO contract and even with the developers (compilers) giving all the information about how they compiled it, it still took far too long and far too many hoops to verify it. \n\nWithout some way of being able to tell the compiler version using just the outputted bytecode, you cannot advertise a contract as verifiable, only immutable. And immutable but unverifiable is not a good enough for a contract that may hold millions of ETH.\n",

I read the source code posted and think it looks great. \n3. Now, I just have to verify that the source actually compiles to the bytecode. Ideally, I could detect what compiler was used from the bytecode on the blockchain, use that compiler to compile the source, and diff it. Or, I could use a service like https://etherscan.io/verifyContract to do so. Regardless, I need to know the compiler and whether or not it is optimized and if I don't have that information for whatever reason, I'm SOL (without writing a script to brute-force every compiler version available).\n",

    "body": "Some ideas:\n1) Have a version string in an unreachable code piece in a fixed location of the bytecode.  A good candidate would be the end of the bytecode, i.e. nominate the last 32 bytes.\n\n2) Have a method call for querying the compiler version, e.g. something obscure like `__$compilerVersion()` would return it as a `string` (easier to use as a user) or `bytes32` (smaller code size).  Technically this would mean an extra case in the ABI dispatcher always added by the compiler. This option adds at least 40 bytes of extra code to every binary.\n\n3) Have a method / constant variable within Solidity which will insert the version as a string into the output. Then anyone can write a way to use, i.e. write a `getVersion()` method as mentioned in 2) with the exception that it is completely up to the developer to decide.\n\nPerhaps option 2) makes more sense if:\n- it is an agreed upon method name, so that Solidity, Serpent and others can implement it\n- it is an optional method and it can be turned on/off by developer when writing a contract\n\nNot every contract needs to be verifiable or at least not every developer might have that need.\n",
