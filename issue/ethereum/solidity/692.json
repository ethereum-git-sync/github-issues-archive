  "body": "I am running into some very strange state inconsistencies in my solidity contract..  its within a Library about 6 calls deep.\n\nThe repo is here: https://github.com/slothbag/hierarchical-dao\nThe problem area is here: https://github.com/slothbag/hierarchical-dao/blob/master/contracts/libdao_proposal.sol#L77\n\nIf I do this \n\n```\nfor (uint a = 0; a < state.members[prop.proposedBy].compulsoryApprovers.length; a++)\n```\n\nit works fine, but if I do this:\n\n```\nLibDAO_State.Member proposedByMember = state.members[prop.proposedBy];\nfor (uint a = 0; a < proposedByMember.compulsoryApprovers.length; a++)\n```\n\nThen length has some random value in it like 17893473586 and the contract consumes all gas.\n\nThat is very strange already, but I discovered if I do something like this:\n\n```\nLibDAO_State.Member proposedByMember = state.members[prop.proposedBy];\nlog0(bytes32(proposedByMember.compulsoryApprovers.length));\nfor (uint a = 0; a < proposedByMember.compulsoryApprovers.length; a++)\n```\n\nThen it works again.. now why would a log0() fix the values within the struct??\n\nIt seems to me the values in the struct are ok, but the reference to them is not correct.\n\nThere are other inconsistencies in the function too, but the example above is the one i tested the most.\n\nThis is really tricky to reproduce.. probably easiest if I set up the steps on testnet and produce the failed tx for others to check using getTransactionReceipt.  Or maybe I just run it and post the Receipt here??\n",

    "body": "I am having a similar problem as OP. I managed to reproduce the effect with a small set of contract code. If you deploy [this contract](https://gist.github.com/chejazi/ccfc84342261e61923b05340744145cd) and call the `Trigger` method, the public value `Debug` will be set to a consistently invalid value.\n\nMy interim solution was to eliminate nested calls, btw.\n\nEDIT: Eliminating nested calls didn't help, actually. Arrays of Arrays, similar to OP's situation, were demonstrating the inconsistency regardless of nesting. I switched to Mappings of Mappings, and the problem went away.\n\nEDIT2: Also worth noting that Mappings of Arrays didn't fix the problem.\n\nEDIT3: For clarity, in my example linked above we have an outer array of structs, with each struct containing an inner array (effectively, an \"Array of Arrays\"). This didn't work. What worked was a mapping to a struct containing another mapping (a \"Mapping of Mappings\"). I incur a little overhead keeping track of the mapping keys but otherwise it does the job.\n",
