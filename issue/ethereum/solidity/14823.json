  "body": "Security Vulnerability in Ethereum Smart Contract (0xb55EE890426341FE45EE6dc788D2D93d25B59063)\r\n\r\nIntroduction:\r\nThis report outlines a potential security vulnerability found in the Ethereum smart contract with the address 0xb55EE890426341FE45EE6dc788D2D93d25B59063. The vulnerability, if exploited, could allow unauthorized withdrawal of funds from the contract.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Vulnerability:\r\n\r\nContract Address: 0xb55EE890426341FE45EE6dc788D2D93d25B59063\r\nPlatform: Ethereum Mainnet\r\nIssue: The contract appears to allow transactions where an individual can specify a sender address that does not match the address initiating the transaction. This can potentially be exploited to withdraw funds from accounts other than the initiator's.\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nNavigate to the contract on Etherscan: [Etherscan Link](https://etherscan.io/writecontract/index?m=light&v=21.10.1.1&a=0xb55EE890426341FE45EE6dc788D2D93d25B59063&n=mainnet#collapse3)\r\nConnect a Web3 wallet.\r\nIn the contract's \"Write\" section, locate the relevant function (e.g., withdraw).\r\nFill in the sender field with the address from which funds will be withdrawn (the target address).\r\nFill in the recipient field with the address to receive the withdrawn funds (the attacker's address).\r\nSpecify the amount to be withdrawn.\r\nExecute the transaction and pay the required gas fees.\r\n\r\nProof on chain: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x404ad35b650a8dace100a082df9ac5bbcfad99fd2dd346cdfdef1000b3fb62d9\r\n\r\nImpact:\r\n\r\nPay the gas,\r\nIf this vulnerability is exploited, an attacker could potentially drain funds from any address that has a balance in this contract. This poses a significant risk to the funds of all users interacting with this contract.\r\n\r\nRecommendation:\r\nImmediate action is recommended to investigate and address this vulnerability. It may involve pausing the contract (if such functionality exists) and deploying a fixed version of the contract. Users should be notified of the risk and advised to refrain from further interactions with the contract until the issue is resolved.\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\nThis report is intended to responsibly disclose a potential security vulnerability. The goal is to prevent malicious exploitation and safeguard the assets and interests of the users interacting with this contract.\r\n\r\n[Video Proof of Concept](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ugYvLJ7Sdk)\r\n\r\nTwitter.com/ClumsyLulz\r\nTaylor.ChristianNewsome@OWASP.org\r\n",
