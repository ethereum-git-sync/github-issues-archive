Two options came up so far:\r\n\r\nUse additional arguments for the memory offsets of the code to-be-modified and the name of the code object in ``setimmutable``:\r\n```\r\nsetimmutable(0 /* memory offset of code to be modified */, \"<object>\", \"<immutableName>\", <var>)\r\n```\r\nOr introduce a new variant of ``codecopy`` that implicitly replaces the immutables - however I'm not sure how this would specify the immutable values - would it take a long list of arbitrary arguments? Would it specify a memory area and an order in memory?",
