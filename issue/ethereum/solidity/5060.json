  "body": "The CSE code generator is a component that is part of the old optimizer and has the following properties:\r\n\r\nIt generates code starting from a stack layout (by Expression IDs) and turning it to a target stack layout, while also being provided with a list of storage and memory change operations.\r\n\r\nIt might be possible to introduce yul variables for each stack slot, reassigning them as part of the code generation here. The difficulty is probably how to handle instructions that break CSE analysis blocks. \r\n\r\nOne way might be to turn each of these blocks into yul functions, another way would be to just keep the blocks open.",
