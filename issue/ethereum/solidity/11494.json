  "body": "When compiling Solidity via yul, it should be possible to output the IR as a text file and re-start the compilation from there to obtain exactly the same bytecode. For that, we need to serialize the compiler state for each contract into comments in the Yul code and re-parse that again.\r\n\r\nSub-tasks:\r\n - [1] store Solidity source locations in comments when generating the IR https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11450\r\n - [2] store additional metadata in IR comments at contract level (metadata, storage layout, natspec, generated sources?)\r\n - [3] when re-parsing the Yul IR, we for now do not change the way source locations are stored in the Yul AST nodes, but we do process all doxygen comments and store tag-value pairs (strings) and associate them with the Yul AST node addresses that come after them.\r\n - [4] the data generated in [2] is extracted from these strings again. Furthermore, we do a pass over the Yul AST to replace the source locations extracted from the strings.\r\n - [5] after the optimizer has run, we should be able to produce the same set of data as in [1] and [2], but from the structured data instead of just during code generation.\r\n\r\nIn terms of code, the task here is to extend `CompilerStack::generateEVMFromIR` so that it can generate the same information as `CompilerStack::compileContract` - it should be able to fill most of the fields of `CompilerStack::Contract`.\r\nAt the same time, `StandardCompiler::compileYul` should do the same thing as `CompilerStack::generateEVMFromIR`, when the input Yul source is properly annotated.",

    "body": "When the compiler is run on the IR generated in [2], it has to detect from comments whether this is hand-written yul or generated from Solidity. It would be nice to have a mostly uniform process that only generates more information when the relevant comments are present - this is mostly done in step [4]. There should be a contract-level comment that tells how to interpret the comments that follow.\r\n\r\nNote that it is also possible to start with hand-written Yul, run it through the optimizer and output it again. This output should have source location comments which do not refer to a solidity file, but are still \"origin\" source locations.\r\n\r\nStep [4] has to be able to distinguish these cases and apply the two source locations properly for all combinations.",
