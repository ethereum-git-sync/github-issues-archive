  "body": "##  Description\r\nThe compiler allows struct members to have the same name as an existing struct, enum and contract type. This can cause some inconsistent behavior.\r\n\r\nFor example, this works perfectly fine (using enum as a member type):\r\n```solidity\r\nenum E {a, b, c}\r\nstruct T {E T;}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this works too (using enum as a member name):\r\n```solidity\r\nenum E {a, b, c}\r\nstruct T {uint E;}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, you can't do this (using both at the same time):\r\n```solidity\r\nenum E {a, b, c}\r\nstruct T {E T; uint E;}\r\n```\r\n```\r\nError: Name has to refer to a struct, enum or contract.\r\n --> test.sol:2:11:\r\n  |\r\n2 | struct T {E T; uint E;}\r\n  |           ^\r\n```\r\nThe error indicates that the compiler does not see `E` as an enum in this context.\r\n\r\nI haven't found any buggy behavior related to this but having a member with the same name as a type might be confusing and might prevent you from using that type inside the struct in the future so I think it might be better not to allow it.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n- Compiler version: `develop` (>= 0.6.10)",
