These require a recent Z3. Unfortunately it did happen now that 4.8.6 solves fewer cases than 4.8.5. In any case, these are hard tests, and I wouldn't mind simply updating their expectation to the newer Z3 and always require its latest version for our tests.\r\n\r\n2) Nonlinear arithmetic cases. CVC4 manages to solve more of those than Z3, but can't solve the CHC cases.\r\n\r\nGive 1) and 2), there isn't a single solver/version we can rely on. I like the first part of your suggestion, but I wouldn't have a list of versions. Then we could \r\n- update the tests using both solvers to get the strongest results\r\n- have CI run 3 combinations (z3, cvc4, z3&cvc4), where the first two would have some warnings, and the 3rd one should have 0 warnings (like you mentioned in the last comment)\r\n- extract the SMTChecker cpp tests",
