  "body": "Currently there is no simple way to query a contract balance in the semantic tests. Due to this lack of support, numerous tests were not moved from `SolidityEndToEndTest`.\r\n\r\n(It is possible to add a helper in the contract, like `function balance() external view returns (uint) { return address(this).balance; }`, but that is a bit overkill.)\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to support a `// balance: 12 wei` or `// balance -> 12 wei` line to assert balance at that given point.\r\n\r\nCould also consider checking the balance of any account, so perhaps the better syntax is:\r\n```\r\n// balance -> 12 wei   # for the current contract #\r\n// balance 0x1234... -> 34 wei  # for address 0x1234... #\r\n```",
