  "body": "Extracted from #9258.\r\n\r\nWe want the release binaries added to `solc-bin` to be identical with those on github release page. Since the process of adding them to `solc-bin` is manual right now, we should really have an automated check for that, running on all `solc-bin` PRs.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to do so is to just download the binaries from github release page and compare. I already have a script for getting the binaries from both Github and CircleCI: https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/pull/35, https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/pull/41. It was originally meant to make it easier for the uploader to get them but we shelved that idea. It can be easily repurposed as a part of the check. I just need to do minor modification and run it inside a github action.\r\n\r\n### Relevant parts from the original issue\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9258#issuecomment-651220312\r\n> - Binaries in solc-bin must be the exact same binaries as the ones on the release page.\r\n>     - Maybe we could have the manual update script check that.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9258#issuecomment-652421874\r\n> Right now @chriseth wants release binaries to be uploaded manually so it's easy to ensure that they're the same. Just upload the same files to both places :) This would be just a sanity check to ensure you did just that.\r\n>\r\n> And if we automate publishing releases, I think it would just be a matter of having the same CI job upload both to solc-bin and to the release page",
