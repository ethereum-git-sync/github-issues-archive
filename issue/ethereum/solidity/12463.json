Thus I believe that when CHC and BMC find \"hard\" to verify a \"problem\" there is might be an issue that makes solc to be extremely slow.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time,\r\nI wish the new year finds you healthy!\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version: solc v0.8.11\r\n- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Remix\r\n- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: \r\n- Operating system: Ubuntu 16.04",
