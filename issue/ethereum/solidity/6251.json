  "body": "## Abstract\r\nI'd like for Solidity to provide an option (e.g. `--strip-reason-strings`) when compiling that resulted in a binary without these strings (as if all `require` statements had no reason, and just the condition).\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nRevert reason strings are very useful during development and testing, but the extra cost of having them may be undesired in a production environment. This is specially true when using contracts developed by third parties, which may want to make their libraries easy to use, but are forced to impose this overhead to their clients.\r\n\r\nOther languages/build systems feature Debug and Release builds, where e.g. debug symbols are stripped, optimizations enabled, binaries compressed, etc. This would be another step in that same direction.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\nSimilarly to how optimization is opt-in enabled, a simple boolean option (open to suggestions regarding naming) would suffice here.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\nN/A",
