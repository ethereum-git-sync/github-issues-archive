    "body": "I think this is a good idea. Currently, the `docStringParser` is too complicated I think. One problem I see is how `\\n` is used as a line break and also to indicate end of a tag. For example, for the following contract.\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract C {\r\n\t/// @notice this is a function that has a long notice tag so that we have to\r\n\t/// wrap the line.\r\n\t/// @param x integer\r\n\tfunction f(int x) public {\r\n\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe \"StructuredDocumentation\", \"text\" attribute is `text\": \"@notice this is a function that has a long notice tag so that we have to\\n wrap the line.\\n @param x integer\"`. We could simplify the `docStringParser` if the main parser can separate the text at the beginning.",
