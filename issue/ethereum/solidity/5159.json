If one considers it bad to execute $EDITOR in an interactive testing tool, since its value may have been compromised, by the same logic, we cannot \"blindly execute\" $DEBUG_PREFIX in scripts/soltest.sh and there's probably a lot more of these cases...\r\n\r\nThat being said we could of course just not fall back to the environment variable at all in ``isoltest`` and only rely on the ``--editor`` argument, skipping the edit suggestion, if no ``--editor`` argument was given. Also, we could go for platform specific code for actually executing it (although avoiding that was the main reason to use the dubious ``system`` call in the first place).\r\n\r\nActually we could just use ``--editor ${EDITOR}`` in ``isoltest.sh``, since it seems like doing something like that in shell scripts is fine ;-).",
