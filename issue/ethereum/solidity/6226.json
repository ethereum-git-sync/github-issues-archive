See #5652 \r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nPotentially, we could mirror the steps used to build the static solc binary for PPAs.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nI don't think test harness needs updating. We should reseed the fuzzer with statements that will be picked up by the SMT checker such as `require` and `assert`.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nNA",
