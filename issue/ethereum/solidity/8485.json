    "body": "@chriseth I need to make the `IRGenerator` generate the code of the internal library functions that get called. \r\n\r\n`IRGenerator` already does this for the contract being compiled:\r\n\r\n```\r\nstring IRGenerator::generate(ContractDefinition const& _contract)\r\n{\r\n\t...\r\n\t// TODO it would probably be better to only generate functions when internalDispatch or\r\n\t// virtualFunctionName is called - same below.\r\n\tfor (auto const* contract: _contract.annotation().linearizedBaseContracts)\r\n\t\tfor (auto const* fun: contract->definedFunctions())\r\n\t\t\tgenerateFunction(*fun);\r\n\tt(\"functions\", m_context.functionCollector().requestedFunctions());\r\n\t...\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut its job is simpler because it only needs to find function declarations/definitions.\r\n\r\n1) I could do something just as simple for the library calls (i.e. go over all libraries from the same file and add all their functions). But this leaves even more stuff that will need to be removed by the optimizer.\r\n2) I could traverse the AST and find all internal library calls. Seems heavy. I don't think it's good idea.\r\n3) I could call `generateFunction()` in `IRGeneratorForStatements` when I encounter the call. I'm not sure if `IRGenerator` is even designed to allow this or if this will cause problems. I would also have to ensure that functions do not get included multiple times.\r\n\r\nWhat would you suggest doing here?",

    "body": "Ah sorry, I thought we had some kind of function generation queue that works like point 3 in your comment.\r\n\r\nSince `m_context.functionCollector().createFunction` is used, functions will only be generated once (as long as we keep a strict scheme for naming the functions).\r\n\r\nJust generating code for all libraries in the source tree is too heavy.\r\n\r\nI think our best bet is to actually implement it like a queue (as outlined in the TODO in IRGenerator::generate(ContractDefinition):\r\n\r\nInstead of generating code for all functions right away, we maintain a queue of Solidity functions that need their code being generated. Whenever such a function is called during code generation and it is not already in the queue, it is added. We terminate when the queue is empty.\r\n\r\nCan you do this first as a refactoring on the existing code, ignoring libraries?",

    "body": "@chriseth There are tests called `semanticTests/libraries/library_enum_as_an_expression.sol` and `semanticTests/libraries/library_struct_as_an_expression.sol` in the directory with library tests. They check whether accessing an enum or a struct defined in a library works, but it's just a no-op - they just use the name of the type and don't try to actually do anything with it. I can easily make them pass on top of #8721 by removing some asserts but it seems too easy.  Is that really enough to get it working of is there some substantial functionality missing and just not covered with yul tests?\r\n\r\nEDIT: I see you did #8685 today. It's probably related.",
