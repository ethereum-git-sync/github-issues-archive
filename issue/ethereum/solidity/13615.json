  "body": "Replaces #8969 as the catch-all issue for board automation.\r\n\r\nThere have been a lot of ideas flying around related to boards so I thought I'd gather them in a single issue. Ultimately we may want to split it into smaller issues if some parts turn out to require significantly more effort but I think most of these will be fairly easy and the biggest bottleneck here is making decisions about what exactly we want and how to achieve it. For this a single list is easier to manage and update.\r\n\r\n1. **Welcome note for external contributors**\r\n    - [x] Automatically posting a short message welcoming the contributor in new external PRs.\r\n        - Should link to the [Contributing](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html) page.\r\n        - Should link to the [review checklist](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/ReviewChecklist.md).\r\n        - Should invite the contributor to ask questions on #solidity-dev.\r\n    - [ ] Needs decision: what about solc-js?\r\n2. **Handling stale issues**\r\n    - Initial implementation: #13499.\r\n    - [ ] Needs decision: specific rules what and when to warn/close.\r\n    - [ ] Needs decision: what about solc-js?\r\n    - [ ] Do dry-run and evaluate results.\r\n    - [ ] Enable.\r\n3. **Handling stale PRs**\r\n    - Initial implementation: #13522.\r\n    - [ ] Needs decision: specific rules what and when to warn/close.\r\n    - [ ] Needs decision: what about solc-js?\r\n    - [ ] Do dry-run and evaluate results.\r\n    - [ ] Enable.\r\n4. **Board automation**\r\n    - [ ] Adding new issues in the solidity repo to the `Triage` column on the board.\r\n    - [ ] Blocker: permissions for the bot (https://github.com/ethereum/devops/issues/1128).\r\n    - [ ] Moving triaged issues to the right column\r\n        - An issue is considered triaged when it has at least the effort and impact labels.\r\n        - An triaged issue without a desirability label goes to a column for issues that need a decision.\r\n        - An triaged issue with a desirability label but with `needs design` goes to design backlog.\r\n        - An triaged issue with a desirability label and without `needs design` goes to implementation backlog.\r\n    - [ ] Moving PRs with `takeover` label to the `Takeover` column on the focus board. Add removing them when the label is removed.\r\n    - [ ] Handling issues from solc-js as well in all of the above.\r\n5. **Automatic PR labeling**\r\n    - [ ] `external contribution` label for PRs submitted from people not in the [Solidity team](https://github.com/orgs/ethereum/teams/solidity).\r\n    - [ ] Adding `has-dependencies` label for PRs or issues that have \"Depends on #<PR/issue number>\".\r\n    - [ ] Labels for simple cases where PRs touch only selected files (we'll have to still apply then manually in mixed cases):\r\n        - `documentation` label for PRs touching only files inside `docs/`, `README`s and maybe a few other docs files we have.\r\n        - `testing` if the PR only touches tests.\r\n        - `optimizer` if the PR only touches optimizer source.\r\n    - [ ] Handling PRs from solc-js as well in all of the above (when it makes sense).\r\n6. **Random assignments**\r\n    - [ ] Needs decision: do we want this?\r\n    - [ ] Randomly assigning team members to issues that need triage.\r\n    - [ ] Randomly assigning team members as reviewers for external PRs.",
