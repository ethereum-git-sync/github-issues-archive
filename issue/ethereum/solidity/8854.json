  "body": "The `chainid` opcode was introduced in Istanbul and added as an opcode to inline assembly a while ago (see #7310).\r\n\r\nIt would be worth considering adding language support to it. I can imagine three options:\r\n1) `chainid()` like `gasleft()`\r\n2) `tx.chainid`\r\n3) `block.chainid`\r\n\r\nWhile I think 2) is nicer because less pollution of the global namespace, the [EIP](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1344) specifically says this property is part of the \"chain configuration\" of the client and not the transaction. It was discussed to make per-transaction, but that was decided against.\r\n\r\nOption 3) may be the best considering the above, while the chainid property not being part of the block, it can only ever change on a block basis (in case of forking a chain).\r\n\r\nMotivation: chanid is used via [ERC-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) and [ERC-1612](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/2613).\r\n\r\nMore motivation: reduce the need for using assembly for such a feature, this also helps in improved the likelyhood of SMTChecker succeeding in more contracts. (One example is [Uniswap](https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-v2-core/blob/master/contracts/UniswapV2ERC20.sol#L27))",

    "body": "This is a good point and I think it is partly due how hastily chainid was added to the system :wink:\r\n\r\n(Note: The `stateMutability` setting is not necessarily reflecting how EOAs interact with contracts (e.g. code run on client side or on chain), rather it is only reflecting whether a given function needs to read the state or needs to modify the state.)\r\n\r\nI think we need to look at this from two angles:\r\n1) Can it be calculated on client side.\r\n2) Does it need any state access.\r\n\r\nLet me answer 1) first as it is simpler: it can be calculated client side. See EIP-695 and EIP-1193 how a \"modern\" client should behave. Based on that I think nothing would stop a client from being capable to run it, without submitting it to the network.\r\n\r\nAnd 2) is a bit more tricky, because chainid is not part of the state (or block), only part of client configuration. IIRC this was a debate at the time the EIP was added and made in such a way to avoid making forking simple. In this sense using `block.chainid` isn't the best, but I don't think there's any better option if we don't want another global function.\r\n\r\nIf we look at properly pure functions, then chainid should not be allowed, because that is an external variable (but as we know Solidity pure functions can depend on memory 😕).\r\n",

    "body": "Yes, that seems to make sense. I'm not familiar however with clients that compure `pure` results without ever hitting a node (are there any?), it'd be good to check against those.\r\n\r\nMy concern about `chainid` specifically is around forks. A `pure` function that takes no arguments isn't much more than a complicated constant from the type system's point of view (barring oddities around `memory` being accessible). `chainid` however *can* change, and e.g. drastically affect an [EIP712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) signature.",
