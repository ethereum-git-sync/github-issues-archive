    "body": "@chriseth While implementing #11931 I realized that there's an additional problem here: there's currently no way for the user to obtain the metadata when doing the two-step compilation. On the CLI the `--metadata` option does not work in assembly mode (just like other output options: #3870) and in Standard JSON the `metadata` output does not produce metadata either.\r\n\r\nBefore #11931 it always matched the metadata for EVM so it was not a problem - you could get it from the first step - but now that it's different, there's no way to obtain it other than doing the single-step compilation.\r\n\r\nAnother problem is that metadata always comes from the first step. So for example if the user passes the `--libraries` option only to the assembly step, metadata will not reflect that properly.",
