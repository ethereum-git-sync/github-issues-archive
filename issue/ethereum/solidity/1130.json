    "body": "\"This is just a mistake by the dev and doesn't explain why asserts should be removed for release builds.\"\n\n^ And such mistakes by the developers are EXACTLY the problem which assertions are seeking to solve, but the runtime checks have a measurable cost in a large-scale codebase (especially if you are doing such checks in inner-loop code).   For many games, for example, I can tell you from personal experience that release builds with assertions enabled would often be 2x or so slower.\n\nAlso, the fact that they WERE only serving to catch programming errors was another reason for stripping them in release builds.   If you hit an assertion there is often nothing sensible to do except stop.    In a debug build, that can drop you into a debugger (or log to a file if you are in an automated run).   If you are in a production environment, there is usually not much sensible which can be done at that point.\n",
