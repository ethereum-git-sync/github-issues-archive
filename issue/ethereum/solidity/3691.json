  "body": "The fact that the optimizer treats MLOAD as having side-effects (which it does, it might modify MSIZE) removes any possibility for optimizing routines that concern both storage and memory.\r\n\r\nWe should revisit how MLOAD is handled by the optimizer. Previously, it was allowed to remove MLOAD operations if they are not required. Currently, MLOAD is treated as an operation that even breaks the CSE analysis, i.e. it cannot optimize across code parts that are separated by an MLOAD, which is an extremely severe restriction.\r\n\r\nIf we want to keep MSIZE being handled correctly, we can either keep track of where memory is accessed and remove mload operations if memory is also touched at higher indices.\r\n",
