  "body": "### What\r\n\r\nFollowing the template of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13378, we want to do more complex analysis on the Solidity level, resulting in annotations of the AST that can be used during code generation to produce more optimal code, resp. code that can be handled better by the optimiser.\r\n\r\nIn particular, we want to address low-hanging fruit in memory optimizations, i.e. for any memory allocation in Solidity that we can easily determine to be temporary, we do not permanently allocate memory.\r\n\r\n## Related Previous Issues\r\n- https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12351\r\n- https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13046 [by determining non-recursive static allocations in Solidity analysis and assigning those fixed offsets before codegen]\r\n### Similar Issues to be solved with a similar mechanism, but merely optionally to be done as part of this epic:\r\n- https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13288",
