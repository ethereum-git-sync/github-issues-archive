  "body": "## Abstract\r\n\r\nAs best I can tell, there's currently no way in Solidity to get the address of a linked library.  This could be useful e.g. for doing a manual `delegatecall`.  I would like there to be syntax for getting the address of a linked library.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nI propose allowing the syntax `address(LibraryName)`, where `LibraryName` is the name of the library, as a means of getting the address of the linked copy of the library `LibraryName`.\r\n\r\nAnother syntax, such as `LibraryName.address`, would be fine too, but I think the former makes more sense in this case.  It makes sense to convert a library name to an address, since internally it's identified by an address; while writing `LibraryName.address` looks misleadingly like a state variable access (yes, even though libraries can't have state variables).\r\n\r\nThen one could do something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlibrary Library {\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract Contract {\r\n  ...\r\n  function f() public {\r\n    ...\r\n    (bool result, bytes memory out) = address(Library).delegatecall(...);\r\n    ...\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nGiven an expression `E`, where `E` has type `type(library LibraryName)`, where `LibraryName` is the name of a library, I propose that it should be possible to convert `E` to type `address` by the usual means (i.e., writing `address(E)`), and that this conversion would return the address where the linked copy of `LibraryName` is kept.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nThere should be no backwards compatibility problems.",
