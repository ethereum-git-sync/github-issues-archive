    "body": "That's by design. From docs on [Variable Cleanup](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/internals/variable_cleanup.html):\r\n> Ultimately, all values in the EVM are stored in 256 bit words. Thus, in some cases, when the type of a value has less than 256 bits, it is necessary to clean the remaining bits. The Solidity compiler is designed to do such cleaning before any operations that might be adversely affected by the potential garbage in the remaining bits.\r\n\r\n> Note that access via inline assembly is not considered such an operation: If you use inline assembly to access Solidity variables shorter than 256 bits, the compiler does not guarantee that the value is properly cleaned up.\r\n\r\nIt would only be a bug if you managed to observe these dirty bits without using inline assembly. Inline assembly lets you peek behind the scenes and see the raw values of the stack slots where local variables are stored and these are 256-bit long, regardless of the types assigned to them at the Solidity level. The fact that these higher bits are still copied and remain dirty (and are not instead cleared when the value is stored) should be considered an implementation detail. E.g. it might change between compiler versions or different code generators.",

The compiler takes care to ensure that the content of the visible bits of any value returned or stored by the function does not depend on them so the referential transparency is preserved for any high-level type. Technically, it's not even guaranteed that these extra bits are even there. In storage where multiple smaller values can be packed into a single slot, there may be no unused bits even with smaller types. They're only \"wasted\" in memory or on stack because reusing them costs more than using a separate slot for each value.\r\n\r\nIf you care about these bits and want to preserve this high-level behavior, in inline assembly, you have to do the cleanup yourself.

    "body": "The language doesn't protect you here because you're using the assembly to explicitly step outside of the bounds of the language :) If you do that, the implicit assumption is that you know what you're doing and you're aware of how things work internally. It's easy to make a mistake, so having a thorough set of tests to check your assumptions, as you did, is very strongly recommended.\r\n\r\nThe compiler tries to be very hands-off once you go down to assembly level because it's hard to tell what's a genuine mistake and what is a clever use of assembly that carefully steps around compiler's mechanisms. There are cases like the memory escalator (that moves variables to memory to prevent \"stack too deep\" errors), where we have to actually know that but we can only rely on the developer telling us  - which is why the concept of [memory safe assembly](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/assembly.html#memory-safety) exists. Even then, unsafe assembly is not wrong, it just signals to the compiler that certain optimizations must not be performed.\r\n\r\nIn this particular case, I don't think a warning is warranted. You don't really *have to* truncate. Depending on what you do with the value these extra bits might not affect the relevant 40 bits of your result at all and it might be cheaper to just let them be. And it's also allowed to actually read or write them. It may lead to undefined behavior but does not have to and ensuring that it doesn't is up to the developer.",
