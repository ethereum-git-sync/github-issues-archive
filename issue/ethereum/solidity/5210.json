We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.\r\n- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:\r\n\t- [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)\r\n\t- [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)\r\n- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.\r\n- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nContract A has a state variable `owner` , which initialized well to msg.sender .\r\nBut this `owner` variable became 0x0 when invoke from another contract function which take address of contract A's instance and convert to A type.\r\n\r\n<!--Please shortly describe the bug you have found, and what you expect instead.-->\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version: 0.4.25\r\n- Framework/IDE:  Remix\r\n- EVM execution environment :  \r\n    Check 'Auto compile ' and  'Enable Optimization' on Compile tab of Remix IDE;\r\n    Choose 'Javascript vm' on Run tab of Remix IDE;\r\n  \r\n \r\n## Steps to Reproduce: step is descript among the code comment.\r\n\r\n```\r\npragma solidity 0.4.25;\r\n\r\ncontract A{ \r\n         \r\n   address public owner;\r\n \r\n   event Ret(string flag, address sender, address owner);\r\n      event ConstrutEvt(string flag,  address owner );\r\n      \r\n   function A() public{\r\n       owner = msg.sender;\r\n       emit ConstrutEvt(\"A\", msg.sender);\r\n   }\r\n  \r\n   function doSomething()  public view returns(string flag, address sender, address owner){\r\n            emit Ret(\"A::doSomething\", msg.sender, owner);\r\n            return (\"A::doSomething\", msg.sender, owner);\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract EvilDoer{\r\n// step1:  deploy contract A on remix IDE. \r\n// and the log show `owner` is a valid address value.\r\n\r\n// step2:  deploy contract EvilDoer.\r\n\r\n// step3:  on remix IDE run tab, invoke doSomething() use the contract A address as argument. \r\n// This time the log show that 'owner' is zero. Why ?\r\n\r\n    function doSomethingEvil(address instanceAddrOfA) public {\r\n         A contractA = A(instanceAddrOfA);\r\n         contractA.doSomething();  \r\n    }    \r\n}\r\n```",
