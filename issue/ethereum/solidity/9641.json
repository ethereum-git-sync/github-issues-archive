  "body": "In Solidity documentation, there is a typo error in the 'Contributing' division under the 'Running the compiler tests' section and 'Running the tests' subsection. \r\n\r\nhttps://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html\r\nThe test system automatically tries **try** to discover the location of the evmone library starting from the current directory. The required file is called libevmone.so on Linux systems, evmone.dll on Windows systems and libevmone.dylib on macOS. If it is not found, tests that use it are skipped. These tests are libsolididty/semanticTests, libsolidity/GasCosts, libsolidity/SolidityEndToEndTest, part of the soltest suite. To run all tests, download the library from GitHub and place it in the project root path or inside the deps folder.\r\n\r\nHere, there should be no 'try' after 'tries' in the first line of the paragraph.",
