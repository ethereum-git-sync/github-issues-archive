This is the same case as the one described [on this PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6075#issuecomment-472622304).\r\n\r\nWe should make sure these sort of codegen decisions are taken by the optimizer based on user settings (e..g the 'runs' parameter, or a size vs 'speed'/gas switch), and not by how a developer wrote chose to write their code.\r\n\r\n(I know much of this will become better once the Solidity -> Yul generation is complete and that work is very much underway, I just wanted to emphasize the importance of this point).",
