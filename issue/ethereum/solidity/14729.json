    "body": "I tried hard to avoid `prepare_report.py` having to parse CLI output and fish ICEs out of it. Instead it just checks whether it can find the artifacts. No artifacts == error. The filter is only necessary for Standard JSON to ignore inconsistent artifacts.\r\n\r\nBut actually, turns out that this was not the cause. The script had a bug - it was not looking at the exit code, which for CLI is another indication that something went wrong. The script originally only handled Standard JSON and there the exit code does not matter. When I was adding CLI support later, I must have forgotten to add a check for that.",
