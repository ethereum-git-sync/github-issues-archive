  "body": "When looping through an array using the array length as the max bound, it is unnecessary to pay the gas for array bounds checking.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```\r\nuint sum;\r\nfor (uint i; i < myarray.length; i++) {\r\n  sum += myarray[i]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI see there is an issue about it here #9117 but no recent update.\r\n\r\nIs it possible for the optimizer to optimize away the bounds access?  A manual way to turn it off? New range loop? What's the plan and timeline for this now?\r\n\r\nIn loops with many iterations, or many array index accesses, or nested loops this might really matter. I don't like paying gas for unneeded checking, which is most of the time I'm using arrays.\r\n",
