The download option is so hidden in the flyout menu (some need to scroll to see it), since the list of versions has grown quite long.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41991517/140305831-cb2c39b4-e65c-4fcf-b009-489df2f39abd.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nPlace the download options at a more obvious / easier visible place in the menu.\r\n\r\n## Related Discussion\r\n\r\nhttps://forum.soliditylang.org/t/please-can-i-get-the-documentation-in-downloadable-form/615/7",

In the PR it's clearly above but not on RTD and this is unlikely to be caused by JS, it's just static HTML. I initially thought that maybe https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/ just has not been updated yet but it usually updates shortly after a merge and the RTD logo is definitely missing (you can still see it on https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.10/ which is an older version).",

    "body": "I think I figured out what's happening. This thing is a real mess. So apparently the template can be found in four different places:\r\n- [`layout.html`](https://github.com/readthedocs/sphinx_rtd_theme/blob/1.0.0/docs/_templates/layout.html) in Sphinx RTD theme - used only for local rendering.\r\n- [`versions.html`](https://github.com/readthedocs/sphinx_rtd_theme/blob/1.0.0/sphinx_rtd_theme/versions.html) in Sphinx RTD theme - used on ReadTheDocs.\r\n- Our `versions.html` - overrides the RTD theme.\r\n- [`footer.html`](https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/blob/6.3.0/readthedocs/api/v2/templates/restapi/footer.html) from readthedocs.org - served from an API endpoint at ReadTheDocs, overrides our override.\r\n\r\nSo ReadTheDocs has an API endpoint that renders the list of versions using their own template. I see a request to this endpoint in dev console and the `<!-- Inserted RTD Footer -->` comment is in there.\r\n\r\nOne way to deal with that would be if readthedocs.org allows customizing or disabling the template via their online config (@chriseth would have to check that).\r\n\r\nAnother would be to customize it on the fly using JS. I don't think it's worth the hassle though and also it would require manipulating the rendered HTML. They are actually planning a redesign to allow custom rendering of the menu from JSON data (https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/pull/8052) to make this easier but it's hard to tell when that will land.\r\n\r\nI'd suggest to revert the change and look for a different way to make downloads more prominent.",

How is that possible but the other change not?\r\n\r\nGood question. I wanted to answer that they just chose not to overwrite it but I checked the requests and apparently they do! The thing is that the page has two footers :) The one that readthedocs.org overwrites is hidden at the bottom of the version menu:\r\n![rtd-injected-footer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/137030/144415827-fc898c25-20f1-4dda-95d4-c8b30ea00dd2.png)\r\nThe one we modify comes from the theme and the JS does not touch it.",

    "body": "@nishant-sachdeva\r\n> Was wondering, shouldn't this be closed now ? We did work on it and add a note about the download section.\r\n> \r\n> And we also talked about how we can't change the base template because it's loaded from some other place. \r\n> So, I suppose the issue can be closed ?\r\n\r\nWell, I think we can close this given that further improvements will likely require considerable effort that's disproportionate to potential gains.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, so far we managed to achieve this so far:\r\n- Download section was moved above versions in the flyout menu.\r\n- We added a note about the PDF on the index page.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I see that the downloads section in the flyout menu is currently broken for 0.8.9+. I.e. it's empty and showing no links. I'm not sure if this is related to this enhancement and it's also really hard to verify since it happens only with release versions (`latest` is fine for example). I'm going to report it as a separate issue.",
