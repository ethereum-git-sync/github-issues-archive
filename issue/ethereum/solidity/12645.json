    "body": "Hi @gaobo89 !\r\n\r\n> Maybe something wrong with my command?\r\n\r\nPlease note that the timeout is given in milliseconds, and the solver can't find the answer within 10ms. Maybe try giving it a bit more time :) locally for me 100ms is enough, but usually I tend to give it 1s, 10s, or more depending on the problem.\r\n\r\n> Btw, the flag of model-checker-contracts seems not work for me, it always checks all the contracts in the file, anything wrong?\r\n\r\nWhich solc version? There was a recent bug that was causing that, which was fixed 2 or 3 versions ago. If you're using the latest version and still seeing that behavior please open an issue and we can check there.",
