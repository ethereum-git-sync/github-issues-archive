  "body": "In order to have a stricter commitment to the return types (identified in #4116 as a potential improvement)  it would make sense to include that in the selector, which currently is a keccak256 hash of the function name and the types of its parameters: `name(T1,T2,...)`\r\n\r\nThe suggestion here is to extend that to include return types: `name(T1,T2,..)->(T1,T2,..)`\r\n\r\nIf there are no return types, the hash would remain identical.\r\n\r\nIn practice this would mean that contracts would check for two hashes in the dispatcher to support older contracts calling in.\r\n\r\nHowever for the case of the contract calling out, I think it would have to be a compiler option to resort to the old hash or the new one. New contracts not interacting with older ones could opt to rely on the new hash.\r\n\r\nWhile it should be possible to implement this in a backwards compatible manner (such as keeping both hashes in the ABI encoding), I think that in the long term will be detrimental as the legacy code to be compatible with will not shrink as time progresses. I feel it is better to take a break earlier than later.",
