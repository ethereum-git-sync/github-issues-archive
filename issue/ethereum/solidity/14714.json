We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.\r\n- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:\r\n    - [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)\r\n    - [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)\r\n- Ensure the issue isn't already reported (check `feature` and `language design` labels).\r\n- If you feel uncertain about your feature request, perhaps it's better to open a language design or feedback forum thread via the issue selector, or by going to the forum directly.\r\n    - [Solidity forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org/)\r\n\r\n*Delete the above section and the instructions in the sections below before submitting*\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Abstract\r\n\r\nCurrently this code will result in compilation error:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\npragma solidity ^0.8.13;\r\n\r\ntype CustomUint is uint256;\r\n\r\ninterface IMath {\r\n    function add(uint256 x, uint256 y) external pure returns (uint256);\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract Math is IMath {\r\n    function add(CustomUint x, CustomUint y) external pure override returns (CustomUint) {\r\n        return CustomUint.unwrap(x) + CustomUint.unwrap(y);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nDuring function signature generation, user-defined types are getting compiled into their underlying types, so it would make sense to allow overloading interfaces using primitive types with user-defined types with the same underlying.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nIt will not cause any breaking changes\r\n",
