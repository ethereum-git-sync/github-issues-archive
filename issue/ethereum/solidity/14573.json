I read somewhere that Eldarica works fine in Linux, not with mac OS (The user has to compile solc from source to link with Eldarica...). But I thought that maybe this difficulty was already fixed for macOS. This is the reason I opened up this theme here... Best!",

Eldarica is used via a system's binary called `eld`, so I don't see why it shouldn't work on OSX, as long as that binary itself works, of course. Can you double check whether `eld` is in the system's `$PATH`?",
