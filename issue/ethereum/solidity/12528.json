Apart from missing explicit conversions this was the only issue preventing successful compilation.\r\n\r\n## How to reproduce\r\n```solidity\r\ninterface I {\r\n    /// @return abc A value\r\n    function p() external view returns (uint abc);\r\n}\r\n\r\nstruct S {\r\n    uint xyz;\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract C is I {\r\n    S public override p;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```\r\nInternal compiler error:\r\n/solidity/libsolidity/interface/Natspec.cpp(201): Throw in function static Json::Value solidity::frontend::Natspec::extractReturnParameterDocs(const std::multimap<std::__cxx11::basic_string<char>, solidity::frontend::DocTag>&, const std::vector<std::__cxx11::basic_string<char> >&)\r\nDynamic exception type: boost::wrapexcept<solidity::langutil::InternalCompilerError>\r\nstd::exception::what: No return param name given: xyz\r\n[solidity::util::tag_comment*] = No return param name given: xyz\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version: 0.8.11",
