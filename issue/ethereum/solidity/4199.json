    "body": "Just bumped on this problem as well. For now the best workaround is given in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4199#issuecomment-393266346, with examples if you look at the ERC20 contracts.\r\n\r\nBut yeah it would be nice to have this properly solved. It would allow to to test extension1 and extension2 in Truffle without having 2 files for each of them (one \"modular\" version to be used in final contracts, one \"implementation\" version to be used in independent tests).\r\n\r\nFor the moment I decided to create a ./contracts/test/4199 directory in which I put modified versions of Extension1.sol and Extension2.sol. They have a contract name \"Extension14199.sol\" and \"Extension24199\". They both inherit from ../../ExtensionN.sol. They both have a constructor initializing Standard. In my Truffle tests, I just use artifacts.require('ExtensionN4199'). Then in final contracts I just require /.ExtensionN.sol' and have a constructor on Standard.\r\n\r\n```\r\ncontract Final is Standard, Extension1, Extension2 {\r\n    constructor(string _name) Standard(_name)\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```",
