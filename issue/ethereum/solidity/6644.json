  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nI wonder whether my usage of SMTChecker is correct or not.\r\nAccording to Solidity official docs, SMTChecker is enabled starting from \"solc v. 0.5.0\":\r\nhttps://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.6/050-breaking-changes.html?highlight=smtchecker\r\n\r\nHowever, I checked that SMTChecker works, although the solc version installed in my machine is 0.4.25 (I tested on macOS 10.14).\r\n\r\n## Question\r\nRegarding the above situation, I would like to ask particularly two things:\r\n[Q1.] Am I using SMTChecker properly? I don't understand why SMTChecker works on solc v 0.4.25 . \r\n\r\n[Q2.] If my current usage is not proper, can you recommend any good mitigations to run the latest SMTChecker on Solidity code written in older version?\r\n\r\nAlthough solc currently changes rapidly, it seems that there are lots of code that fits in older version of solc in practice.",

    "body": "Hi @SunBeomSo ,\r\nthe SMTChecker component is enabled in 0.4.x as well, that comment in the docs just highlights that the SMTChecker is the alternative to the old `--formal` option which was removed in 0.5.0.\r\nThe difference you will see in the usage of the SMTChecker in different versions of the compiler is that the older a version is, the fewer features the SMTChecker has, especially since we've recently added many features in the 0.5.x versions.",
