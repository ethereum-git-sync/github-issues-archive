  "body": "## Motivation\r\n\r\nThis feature-request follows [issue 3372](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3372), where I was advised to set `optimizer-runs` to 5000000 - a value large enough to ensure maximum optimization.\r\n\r\nI followed that advice, but I think that a better solution (user-perspective) would be to let `solc` determine this value, i.e., the minimum value which guarantees maximum optimization.\r\nMoreover, ideally, `solc` would determine this value separately (and independently) for each source file, though I guess that this possibly \"deserves\" a separate feature-request.\r\n\r\nIn any case, this feature (if implemented) would follow a similar convention used in various IDEs, where one can configure the compiler to optimize either for speed or for memory.\r\nOf course, there is only one \"category\" in our ecosystem - gas cost (which I look upon as \"equivalent\" to speed), but the principle should be the same IMO.\r\n\r\nAt present, in order to determine the minimum number of runs required for maximum optimization of my code, I conducted a binary-search between 200 and 5000000, until I found this number to be 1348.\r\nDuring this search, I needed to compare between the output bin files, while excluding the metadata part (the 64 bytes preceding the last 2 bytes), which changes on every compilation (at least that's the case when I compile via `truffle`).\r\nThis method is far from being efficient (or convenient).\r\n\r\nHere is a more specific reason for my request:\r\n[Etherscan API for contract verification](https://etherscan.io/sourcecode-demo.html) does not allow for a value larger than 1000000 (of course, this issue should technically be fixed on Etherscan, not in the Solidity compiler).\r\n\r\nThanks.",
