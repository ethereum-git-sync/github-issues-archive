  "body": "While going through to work on another issue, I noticed that the only use of local variable scoping I could find was in CallableDefinition, which means that FunctionDefinition, ModifierDefinition, and EventDefinition are the only resolution of scoping in Solidity.  Additionally, it looks like types and variable names are resolved before expressions are compiled, meaning that it's possible to use a variable before its type is declared.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure that either is necessarily wrong (though I'd probably personally like having block-level locals).  I was just curious if this merited further attention.\r\n\r\nJust as a sort of reference, this contract compiles for me:\r\n\r\n```\r\npragma solidity ^0.4.4;\r\n\r\ncontract Test {\r\n\r\nfunction Moog () {\r\n  i=1;\r\n  int i;\r\n  if (i==0) { j=0; }\r\n  else { uint j; j=1; }\r\n}\r\n\r\n}\r\n```",
