I think there is an issue with the current wording. \r\n      _\"In the following contract, if you are usurped as the richest, you will receive the funds of the person \r\n      who has gone on to become the new richest.\"_\r\nThe wording makes it seem like you receive the money of the richest person as if you are stealing their money. It should reflect that you are receiving the fee(compensation) they paid to become the richest person over you.\r\n\r\nThis could just be me, but I had to read the kingofethers page to understand what was meant. Just a suggestion 😄 ",
