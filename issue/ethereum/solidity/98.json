  "body": "When creating a struct array, the first element of the array will have the first component of the struct set to the length of the struct array.\n\n```\ncontract test\n{\n    struct leader\n    {\n        uint256 winnings;\n        address player;\n    }\n\n    leader[10] private leaderboard;\n\n    /**\n     * Get a list of leaders.\n     * \n     * @return playersList address[]   The list of player addresses\n     */\n    function getLeaders() public constant returns(uint256[])\n    {\n        uint256 leaderboardLength = leaderboard.length;\n\n        uint256[] winnings;\n        winnings.length = leaderboardLength;\n\n        for (uint8 i = 0; i < leaderboardLength; ++i) {\n            winnings[i] = leaderboard[i].winnings;\n        }\n\n        return winnings;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**The browser compiler says:** Returned: [\"10\",\"0\",\"0\",\"0\",\"0\",\"0\",\"0\",\"0\",\"0\",\"0\"]\n\n\"player\" from the struct is unaffected. Try reversing the components of the struct, then run the script. the result is: Returned: [\"0\",\"0\",\"0\",\"0\",\"0\",\"0\",\"0\",\"0\",\"0\",\"0\"]. However, \"player\" will then have 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000a as the first address. (10 in hex)\n\n**EDIT**\nI've also tested what happens when setting the first item in the struct to something other than a 10 value. When changing that first element, it causes the compiler to crash, though when it's set to the 10 value, then it will function normally. After the \"crash\" the browser compiler reports the following in the console.\n\n`Uncaught BigNumber Error: new BigNumber() not a base 16 number:`\n",

Of course, you should not use the `getLeaders` function as written in the first comment because it still contains the \"null storage pointer\" bug - which is probably also the reason you think that it \"fails to change element 0 to a 5\". If you change `leaderboard` to `public`, you will see that it is set correctly. \n",

This causes the pointer to be dereferenced, i.e. the runtime assumes that there actually is a `uint256[]` array at the beginning of storage. As for dynamic arrays, the length is stored in the actual slot itself, you write the value of `leaderboardLength` to the first storage slot. Although the actual object that is stored at this slot is `leaderboard[0].winnings`. This is why that value is overwritten.\n",
