    "body": "> I wouldn't be surprised if permission levels play a role here - such access tokens are at times used for more serious stuff than posting comments, so being able to just create a PR from a fork that can just change the script that uses the token to do whatever can be dangerous at times, can't it :-)?\r\n\r\nThat's a good point. But then I wonder which token it would use? If it's the one from PR creator then what if someone pushes extra commits to someone else's branch? Anyway, I'll check the script first because I think the problem might be much simpler than that. I really don't like how this script is organized (it requires you to source it and then runs `trap` to get executed just when the parent script exits) and on top of that I don't think it handles all errors and corner cases properly.",

    "body": "I have a fix in #10792. There were two problems:\r\n1. For some reason the script runs twice in CI. I don't know exactly why, but it's related to its weird flow. Before my changes `check_style.sh` would source it and it would set `trap EXIT` to get called when `check_style.sh` exits. Changing it to a normal style where `check_style.sh` just calls it in a normal way solved that problem. It now runs only once.\r\n2. Script was hard-coded to store the style errors in `/tmp/error.log` and was not clearing it between runs. The first line of this file contains the text `Coding style error:` and subsequent lines are the style errors. The script needs to remove that first line - otherwise it would get empty values for file path and line number. The problem was that, because of multiple simultaneous runs, there were multiple such lines and this caused the script to send invalid JSON with missing values to github. It does not run with `set -e` though so this did not prevent it from continuing and posting the actual style errors.",
