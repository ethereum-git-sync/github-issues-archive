We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.\r\n- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:\r\n    - [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)\r\n    - [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)\r\n- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.\r\n- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.\r\n\r\n*Delete the above section and the instructions in the sections below before submitting*\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nContinued from #12896  . Created the issue as requested in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13005#discussion_r877162339\r\n\r\nIn custom errors like the following : \r\n```\r\ninterface MyInterface {\r\n    error MyCustomError();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe compiler mistakenly considers `MyInterface.MyCustomError` to be of type `function() pure` instead of type `error`. The latter is what should be used.\r\n\r\nRunning `solc test.sol` for the following code \r\n```\r\ninterface MyInterface {\r\n    error MyCustomError(uint256, bool);\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract Test {\r\n    function test() public returns(bytes4) {\r\n        return (MyInterface.MyCustomError);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\ngives the following error\r\n```\r\nError: Return argument type function (uint256,bool) pure is not implicitly convertible to expected type (type of first return variable) bytes4.\r\n --> test.sol:7:16:\r\n  |\r\n7 |         return (MyInterface.MyCustomError);\r\n  |                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n```\r\n",

I'd say that changing this is just a small enhancement.\r\n\r\nSo is this the only affected message? The point here was to do a more comprehensive check to identify as many as possible and tweak them all in bulk.\r\n\r\nI mean, alternatively we can also leave it up to whoever will be implementing this to find them all.",
