Let `e1`, `e2`, ..., `en` be expressions of the said types respectively.\r\n\r\n`abi.encode(e1, e2, ..., en)`  returns their encoding as a value (let's call it `encodedBytes`) of type `bytes`\r\n\r\nNow\r\n\r\n`(T1 v1, T2 v2, ..., Tn vn) = abi.decode(encodedBytes, (T1, T2, ..., Tn));`\r\n\r\ndecodes the encoded bytes into the respective types stored in independent expressions `v1`, `v2`, ..., `vn`. Trivially, `v1 == e1`, `v2 == e2`, ..., `vn == en` must hold, otherwise there is a bug in the coding process.\r\n\r\nWe can encode these checks in the fuzzing harness like so (example)\r\n\r\n```\r\ncontract C {\r\n  uint8[] x;\r\n\r\n  function test() public returns (uint) {\r\n     x.length = 3;\r\n     x[0] = 42;\r\n     x[1] = 21;\r\n     x[2] = 33;\r\n     bytes encodedValue = abi.encode(x);\r\n     uint8[] memory y = abi.decode(encodedValue, uint8[]);\r\n     if (y.length != 3) return 1;\r\n     if (y[0] != 42) return 2;    \r\n     if (y[1] != 21) return 3;\r\n     if (y[2] != 33) return 4;\r\n     // Expected return value if no bug\r\n     return 0;    \r\n  }\r\n```    \r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nWe can extend the current abi coder fuzzing template with an additional internal function (to avoid abi coding) that accepts a tuple of types as input, invokes abi encode/decode functions and performs checks and returns a value.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nTBD\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nTBD",
