  "body": "Solidity documentation ([doc](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/contracts.html)), present the following contract and comments: \r\n```\r\npragma solidity ^0.4.0;\r\n\r\ncontract Test {\r\n    // This function is called for all messages sent to\r\n    // this contract (there is no other function).\r\n    // Sending Ether to this contract will cause an exception,\r\n    // because the fallback function does not have the \"payable\"\r\n    // modifier.\r\n    function() { x = 1; }\r\n    uint x;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter deployment on Rinkeby, as well as Ropsten, I initiated a few test transactions to the contract and to my surprise, all transactions were successful and no exception have been raised.\r\n\r\nCompiler version: 0.4.17\r\nExample of the contract on Rinkeby with an accepted transaction: [Rinkeby.Etherscan](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0xed47b8fdba2572f2d0e67fc0e0c2e4511f88ca93)\r\n\r\nA few different exception situations were tested on other variations of the contract, and once again, none were raised.\r\nIs there a trick to the testnets? Or am I missing something?\r\n\r\nByte code generated (and confirmed on etherscan):\r\n```\r\n60606040523415600e57600080fd5b604480601b6000396000f30060606040523415600e57600080fd5b60016000819055500000a165627a7a7230582040d23036c367ce2ac2ca5d45308cb53dc5827eb3a743efb98835338ead53aa620029\r\n```",
