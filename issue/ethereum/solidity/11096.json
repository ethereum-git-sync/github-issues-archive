  "body": "Motivation: Our docs claim that we are compatible with gcc 8, but since ubuntu 20.04 already ships gcc 9 this was actually untested and we broke things (see https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11095).\r\n\r\nThe main reason we kept the requirement at GCC 8, I think, was that it's what Debian stable (buster) ships.\r\n\r\nI'd say generally supporting the latest stable Debian release is a reasonable compromise between always being cutting edge and being backwards-compatible.\r\n\r\nBut if we put up such claims, we should of course have them verified in CI.\r\n\r\nSo I propose we add a testing docker image for debian buster and at least a CI build run for it, maybe also a test run (doesn't hurt).\r\n\r\nNote that while the default versions of GCC and CMake work on buster, the default boost version 1.67 is not sufficient, but there are explicit libboost*1.74*dev packages, so the docker image will have to pull in those explicitly.\r\n\r\nDebian buster only has Z3 4.4, so I'd suggest to just skip it and use a no-smt build.\r\n\r\nQuote @cameel from gitter:\r\n> Well, I could try it next week then. Unless maybe @aarlt (Alexander Arlt) wants to take it? He's been working on these images not so long ago so he'd probably make a quicker job of it.",
