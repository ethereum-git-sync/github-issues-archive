  "body": "@anujajakhade recently reported test failures in the gitter channel and it turned out they were due to the used system being BigEndian.\r\n\r\nWe should either *support* BigEndian or, if we can't, generate an error when attempting to build on a BigEndian platform.\r\n\r\nDo we have the capacity to support BigEndian? Is there a decent way to simulate BigEndian for us to work on it (I guess none of us have a BigEndian system available)? I guess qemu will work, but it might be horribly slow... It would probably mean to go through the entire code base line by line with endianness in mind... how many systems actually use BigEndian these days?",

Fixing that alone in a safe way would probably be quite some effort (unless we choose a different and endianness-safe keccak implementation from somewhere as replacement altogether).\r\n\r\nGenerally, a hard prerequisite for actually supporting BigEndian in solidity would be the ability to even run semantics tests, but currently aleth doesn't support BigEndian at all either I think. (Although we could of course run the test via a network connection to a LittleEndian aleth version, but well...)\r\n\r\nSo while support for BigEndian would of course be nice and there indeed seems to be *some* demand for it, so far I see too many blockers. @chriseth what do you think?",
