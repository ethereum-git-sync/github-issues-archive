  "body": "Edited by @chriseth: All errors and warnings should contain a unique error code. This cannot simply be done by looking at the error message, because it is more specific (contains names of types, etc). It should be done based on the position of the error check in the code, although the codes should also be consistent  across versions.\r\n\r\nOnce this is done, we can easily implement https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4383\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nI'm using the compiler via JSON - API. The compiler reports issues in the following way (from the 0.5.2 documentation):\r\n```\r\n errors: [\r\n    {\r\n      sourceLocation: {\r\n        file: \"sourceFile.sol\",\r\n        start: 0,\r\n        end: 100\r\n      ],\r\n      type: \"TypeError\",\r\n      component: \"general\",\r\n      severity: \"error\",\r\n      message: \"Invalid keyword\"\r\n      formattedMessage: \"sourceFile.sol:100: Invalid keyword\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n```\r\nCurrently, the cause of the error is only identifiable by the \"message\"  field.  I propose to add an additional field 'code' to the error output, that unambiguously identifies the cause of the issue like this:\r\n```\r\n errors: [\r\n    {\r\n      sourceLocation: {\r\n        file: \"sourceFile.sol\",\r\n        start: 0,\r\n        end: 100\r\n      ],\r\n      type: \"TypeError\",\r\n      component: \"general\",\r\n      severity: \"error\",\r\n      code: \"207001\",\r\n      message: \"Invalid keyword\"\r\n      formattedMessage: \"sourceFile.sol:100: Invalid keyword\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n```\r\nThe main reason is that while the cause of error is more or less stable the \"message\" might change more frequently.\r\n\r\nI am currently writing code to us compiler errors/warnings to automatically fix the issue that caused the error in the first place. At the moment I rely on parsing the messages, which is error-prone and sometimes ambiguous. A unique code that identifies the issue would be prefereable and future proof. \r\n\r\nA possible pattern could be like ABBCCC\r\nwhere: \r\nA: severity (0:info, 1:warning, 2:error ...) \r\nB: type (01: JSONError, 02: IOError, 03: ParseError ...)\r\nC: identifier (001: VAR_KEYWORD_DISSALLOWED, 002: THROW_KEYWORD_DISALLOWED ... )  \r\n\r\nI don't see any backwards compatibility issues here since existing behaviour is not changed.\r\n",
