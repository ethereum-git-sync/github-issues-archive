I.e. ``scripts/bytecodecompare/storebytecode.sh`` for the emscripten case is rather horrible - we could actually just run the ``solcjs`` wrapper script from the solc-js repo as ``solc`` to run it with the ``scripts/bytecodecompare/prepare_report.py`` script instead of using this horrible on-the-fly temporary javascript file produced by the script, etc...",

    "body": "So the situation looks like this:\r\n- There are 4 targets for which we run the bytecode comparison and generate a report: Linux, Windows, MacOS, emscripten.\r\n- The report includes all `*.sol` files from under `test/` (with some minor exclusions) and test cases from docs.\r\n    - This does not include `*.yul` files so the assembly input is not being tested.\r\n- The SMTChecker pragma is always stripped from the file before compilation (if present).\r\n- It runs the compilation twice for each file, once with and once without the optimizer.\r\n- All tests are executed via Standard JSON. Passing the JSON directly in case of emscripten and using `--standard-json` flag in other cases. I don't see it invoking the compiler via the normal CLI interface at all.\r\n- The only outputs requested are `evm.bytecode.object` and `metadata` so it's only testing the old code generator.",
