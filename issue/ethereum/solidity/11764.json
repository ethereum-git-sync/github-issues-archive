    "body": "> Can you point out such an example?\r\n\r\nI am actually wrong. Seems like I mixed the constructor parameters (with leading underscore) and the member without trailing underscore.\r\n\r\nHowever, the parameters themselves does have two variations without underscores, with leading underscore. Here are few examples\r\n\r\nWithout underscore\r\n```\r\n/// Create a new ballot to choose one of `proposalNames`.\r\n    constructor(bytes32[] memory proposalNames) {\r\n        chairperson = msg.sender;\r\n        voters[chairperson].weight = 1;\r\n\r\n        // For each of the provided proposal names,\r\n        // create a new proposal object and add it\r\n        // to the end of the array.\r\n        for (uint i = 0; i < proposalNames.length; i++) {\r\n            // `Proposal({...})` creates a temporary\r\n            // Proposal object and `proposals.push(...)`\r\n            // appends it to the end of `proposals`.\r\n            proposals.push(Proposal({\r\n                name: proposalNames[i],\r\n                voteCount: 0\r\n            }));\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // Give `voter` the right to vote on this ballot.\r\n    // May only be called by `chairperson`.\r\n    function giveRightToVote(address voter) public {\r\n        // If the first argument of `require` evaluates\r\n        // to `false`, execution terminates and all\r\n        // changes to the state and to Ether balances\r\n        // are reverted.\r\n        // This used to consume all gas in old EVM versions, but\r\n        // not anymore.\r\n        // It is often a good idea to use `require` to check if\r\n        // functions are called correctly.\r\n        // As a second argument, you can also provide an\r\n        // explanation about what went wrong.\r\n        require(\r\n            msg.sender == chairperson,\r\n            \"Only chairperson can give right to vote.\"\r\n        );\r\n        require(\r\n            !voters[voter].voted,\r\n            \"The voter already voted.\"\r\n        );\r\n        require(voters[voter].weight == 0);\r\n        voters[voter].weight = 1;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith leading underscore\r\n```\r\n function reveal(\r\n        uint[] memory _values,\r\n        bool[] memory _fake,\r\n        bytes32[] memory _secret\r\n    )\r\n        public\r\n        onlyAfter(biddingEnd)\r\n        onlyBefore(revealEnd)\r\n    {\r\n        uint length = bids[msg.sender].length;\r\n        require(_values.length == length);\r\n        require(_fake.length == length);\r\n        require(_secret.length == length);\r\n\r\n        uint refund;\r\n        for (uint i = 0; i < length; i++) {\r\n            Bid storage bidToCheck = bids[msg.sender][i];\r\n            (uint value, bool fake, bytes32 secret) =\r\n                    (_values[i], _fake[i], _secret[i]);\r\n            if (bidToCheck.blindedBid != keccak256(abi.encodePacked(value, fake, secret))) {\r\n                // Bid was not actually revealed.\r\n                // Do not refund deposit.\r\n                continue;\r\n            }\r\n            refund += bidToCheck.deposit;\r\n            if (!fake && bidToCheck.deposit >= value) {\r\n                if (placeBid(msg.sender, value))\r\n                    refund -= value;\r\n            }\r\n            // Make it impossible for the sender to re-claim\r\n            // the same deposit.\r\n            bidToCheck.blindedBid = bytes32(0);\r\n        }\r\n        payable(msg.sender).transfer(refund);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSimilarly for local scope variables. Sometime without underscore and sometime with trailing underscore\r\n\r\nHere is a snippet with trailing underscore \r\n```\r\nsender.voted = true;\r\n        sender.delegate = to;\r\n        Voter storage delegate_ = voters[to];\r\n        if (delegate_.voted) {\r\n            // If the delegate already voted,\r\n            // directly add to the number of votes\r\n            proposals[delegate_.vote].voteCount += sender.weight;\r\n        } else {\r\n            // If the delegate did not vote yet,\r\n            // add to her weight.\r\n            delegate_.weight += sender.weight;\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd here is a snippet where there is no trailing underscore\r\n```\r\nfunction reveal(\r\n        uint[] memory _values,\r\n        bool[] memory _fake,\r\n        bytes32[] memory _secret\r\n    )\r\n        public\r\n        onlyAfter(biddingEnd)\r\n        onlyBefore(revealEnd)\r\n    {\r\n        uint length = bids[msg.sender].length;\r\n        require(_values.length == length);\r\n        require(_fake.length == length);\r\n        require(_secret.length == length);\r\n\r\n        uint refund;\r\n        for (uint i = 0; i < length; i++) {\r\n            Bid storage bidToCheck = bids[msg.sender][i];\r\n            (uint value, bool fake, bytes32 secret) =\r\n                    (_values[i], _fake[i], _secret[i]);\r\n            if (bidToCheck.blindedBid != keccak256(abi.encodePacked(value, fake, secret))) {\r\n                // Bid was not actually revealed.\r\n                // Do not refund deposit.\r\n                continue;\r\n            }\r\n            refund += bidToCheck.deposit;\r\n            if (!fake && bidToCheck.deposit >= value) {\r\n                if (placeBid(msg.sender, value))\r\n                    refund -= value;\r\n            }\r\n            // Make it impossible for the sender to re-claim\r\n            // the same deposit.\r\n            bidToCheck.blindedBid = bytes32(0);\r\n        }\r\n        payable(msg.sender).transfer(refund);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems to just make it difficult to stay consistent with all these variations.\r\n\r\nSo I guess the important question here is: are these the actual convention (I still need to go thoroughly through the style guide to see if it answers it) or this is just inconsistency in the referenced documentation?\r\n",

    "body": "To summarize, one could say that the official style guide is https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/style-guide.html. It doesn't talk about leading underscores. (It's still worthwhile to go through it to check if I missed something.)\r\n\r\nI have seen some contracts naming internal functions starting with underscore. Perhaps to improve visibility. \r\n\r\nI think it would be useful to change `contract BlindAuction` https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/style-guide.html, removing the argument names that start with `_`. Simply to make the contract more consistent with the rest of the examples. If you would like to fix this, then https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/docs/solidity-by-example.rst is the file that needs updating (I think the github preview is broken for that rst file)\r\n",
