    "body": "Hi @z0r0z, thanks for the question. However, the `payable` modifier can also be applied to functions with `external` visibility. So, I don't see a clear advantage in not explicitly stating it in the function declaration.\r\n\r\n> I think this is what has already changed for `constructor()`?\r\n\r\nNot really, since Solidity version `0.7.0`, the function visibility is no longer required for constructors (neither `public` nor `internal`). However, note that constructors are not `payable` by default; you need to explicitly declare them as payable.",
