    "body": "> Both engines fail (my guess is due to accessing code of an non-existent address returned by the call to ecrecover).\r\n\r\nFailure is due to failed `abi.decode` operations (both left and right operand). Legacy (right-to-left) fails on the `abi.decode` containing the call to `ecrecover` (hence the extra EVMC_CALL) while IR fails on the (left) `abi.decode` operand and hence the lack of an EVMC_CALL. I would vote to close this issue now since this is essentially documented behavior unless someone thinks otherwise.",
