    "body": "The high-level task here is:\r\nWe never want to produce bytecode that uses a ``DUP[N]`` opcode for dupping up a constant literal zero, since ``PUSH0`` is cheaper than any ``DUP``.\r\n\r\nWe already have the ``LiteralRematerializer`` in the optimizer (part of ``Rematerializer.cpp``), which replaces *all* variables with their literal value and which occurs as ``T`` in the optimizer sequence.\r\n\r\nHowever, after literal rematerialization we run the Common Subexpression Eliminator again, which will reverse this, i.e. which will replace multiple uses of a variable with the same constant value by multiple references to that constant.\r\nThe CSE already has a special case for *not* doing this for return variables; see the comment\r\n```\r\n\t\t\t\t// Prevent using the default value of return variables\r\n\t\t\t\t// instead of literal zeros.\r\n```\r\nin ``CommonSubexpressionEliminator.cpp``.\r\n\r\nThe easy fix for this issue is to generalize that logic to *all* occurrences of zero, in case the EVM version supports ``PUSH0`` (which can be queried from the ``EVMVersion`` which should be accessible via the Yul dialect in the optimizer step).\r\n\r\nWe should then check if any other optimizer steps suffer due to this, i.e. if the data flow analyzer, etc., keep working as intended with this change. I'd expect everything will be fine, but if we see unexpected gas cost increases or the optimizer fails to simplify anything, we'll need to dig into that.",
