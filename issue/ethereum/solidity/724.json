    "body": "**Summary:**\n\nI duplicated this particular bug.  \n\nThe function broken() does nothing when it uses the third element of the struct (the uint other).  Here is the address of a contract that I tested broken:\n\n\"0x0dcd2f752394c41875e259e00bb44fd505297caf\"\n\nThe function broken() works as intended simply by removing the third element from the struct and not mentioning it in the function.  Here is the address of a contract that I tested working (third element removed):\n\n\"0xc8a70118e850b127ff76d4ba42e3e705f6d677fc\"\n\nThe source of the contract that exhibits the broken behavior is the same as the contract @giblfiz posted called \"micro\", but I removed the working function and just used the broken() function.\n\nThe source of the contract that works just fine differs only by removing the uint \"other\" from the struct and line that uses the uint other from the function broken(), which is:\n\nV[msg.sender].other += 19;\n\nThose lines being as straightforward as they are, I can't explain why adding them breaks the function.\n\n**Environment:**\n\nTime: Duplicated a few minutes before this bug was filed.\n\nCompiler: I'm using browser solidity from here: http://ethereum.github.io/browser-solidity/#version=soljson-latest.js\n\nI'm using http instead of https because I can connect locally more easily that way.\n\nOn my local laptop, to fund and send transactions, I'm using the following go and geth:\n\nGeth\nVersion: 1.3.6\nGit Commit: 9e323d65b20c32ab1db40e8dde7172826e0e9c45\nProtocol Versions: [63 62 61]\nNetwork Id: 1\nGo Version: go1.6.1\nOS: darwin\nGOPATH=/Users/rsb/src/gocode\nGOROOT=/usr/local/Cellar/go/1.6.1/libexec\n\nI'm on mac OSX 10.9.5\nBrowser is firefox: 47.0\n\nLet me know if I can run more tests or be of any help.

I hadn't even looked at the out-of-gas as a possibility since I could call \"working / broken / working\" again (I.E. plenty of gas in the sponsoring account) \n\nSo in short:\nto make this work I needed to call \n`bug.broken.sendTransaction({from:me, gas:100000})`\n\nThanks so much for your patience and your help!\n",
