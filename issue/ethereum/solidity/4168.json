  "body": "Event selectors are calculated as the hash of the event name and the canonical types of its arguments:\r\n>`topics[0]`: `keccak(EVENT_NAME+\"(\"+EVENT_ARGS.map(canonical_type_of).join(\",\")+\")\")` (`canonical_type_of` is a function that simply returns the canonical type of a given argument, e.g. for `uint indexed foo`, it would return `uint256`).\r\n\r\n([Source](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/e97f9b6ba85b5cf5d347f1771524d0b0973e00bb/docs/abi-spec.rst#events))\r\n\r\nThis means that the \"indexedness\" of its arguments is not reflected in the selector. Put another way, each event selector maps to many ways of decoding a log, and in general there is no way to know which is the correct one. (This is true regardless of this issue because of hash collisions, but that's a separate thing, and I believe this is more serious.)\r\n\r\nFor example, the logs corresponding to `Foo(address a, address indexed b)` would be indistinguishable from `Foo(address indexed a, address b)`. I think this incompatibility should be visible in the event selector.\r\n\r\nA related problem is that, as of Solidity 0.4.24, redefining an event of a parent contract with different indexedness will not results in errors or warnings.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we agree that this is a problem with the ABI, we may want to tackle it for 0.5.0, since the fix will probably be backwards-incompatible.",
