  "body": "We're working on figuring out how/if we can verify solidity versions and releases.  My first inclination was to see if the release tags were using signed commits.  At a glance it doesn't appear they are.\r\n\r\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/signing-commits-using-gpg/\r\n\r\nSome of us who are working on package manager functionality would like a way to verify that the commit hashes for a version of solidity are in fact authentic.  We know that we can use github as the oracle and just choose to trust any hash found in the solidity repository but that's less than ideal.  It would be nice to have a static set of public keys we could verify signed commits against.\r\n\r\nThoughts?",
