    "body": "> so what about the proposed synthax? [#3556 (comment)](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3556#issuecomment-460272880)\r\n\r\n@chriseth is off now so we won't get an answer from him until February but for me this syntax looks ambiguous.\r\n\r\nIn the code below, would `this.g(Enum)` be a function call or a reference to a specific overload of the function?\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract C {\r\n    enum Enum { A, B, C }\r\n\r\n    function g(Enum e) public {}\r\n    function g(uint i) public {}\r\n\r\n    function f() public {\r\n        uint Enum = 42;\r\n        this.g(Enum).selector; // ambiguous\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think we we need different syntax for this. Here are some ideas:\r\n\r\n1. If you want to follow `abi.decode()`, then it could be something like this, without introducing anything new:\r\n    ```solidity\r\n    abi.resolve(this.transfer, (address, uint256, bytes))(0x123, 0, \"abc\");\r\n    ```\r\n    `abi.resolve()` suggests that it would work only for external functions so we may need a better name for such a builtin.\r\n2. Or we could just add something to distinguish it from a call. Best if it's not an existing operator so it cannot be interpreted as an expression:\r\n    ```solidity\r\n    this.transfer@(address, uint256, bytes)(0x123, 0, \"abc\");\r\n    ```\r\n    or\r\n    ```solidity\r\n    this.transfer::(address, uint256, bytes)(0x123, 0, \"abc\");\r\n    ```\r\n    or\r\n    ```solidity\r\n    (this.transfer as (address, uint256, bytes))(0x123, 0, \"abc\");\r\n    ```\r\n3. We could also try to make it look like a cast. Current cast syntax won't work but with #11284 it could look like this:\r\n    ```solidity\r\n    resolve<address, uint256, bytes>(this.transfer)(0x123, 0, \"abc\");\r\n    ```\r\n    or\r\n    ```solidity\r\n    cast<function(address, uint256, bytes) external>(this.transfer)(0x123, 0, \"abc\");\r\n    ```\r\n4. Another idea would be to reuse array brackets. It's not ambiguous in terms of syntax but might be confusing to people not used to it:\r\n    ```solidity\r\n    this.transfer[address, uint256, bytes](0x123, 0, \"abc\");\r\n    ```",

    "body": "Type names are not necessarily reserved keywords. They can be just normal identifiers. Well, technically the ambiguity can be resolved but either way of doing it prevents you from doing something: in my example if you treat the type name as shadowed by a variable, it prevents you from being able to get a pointer to `g(Enum)`. If you ignore shadowing and always treat it as a type, you cannot call `g(Enum)`.\r\n\r\nAlso, it's IMO not great for humans either. With contract, struct, enum names, etc. it might not be clear at all that what you're looking at is a function pointer and not a function call. I'd rather have clearer syntax for that.",

That's e.g. how ``abi.decode(..., <tuple of types>)`` works - that's not custom magic syntax for ``abi.decode``, but the tuple of types is a valid expression everywhere. You can also validly do e.g. ``(int, uint);`` as a statement in solidity :-).\r\nThat's mostly a technical detail at this point, since \"type types\" cannot be named in solidity. But having types as expressions may (or may not) be useful for generics/templates, depending how we'll end up doing them... so it's unclear if and how this will evolve in the future and it's better to keep our options open.\r\n\r\nMy preferred solution to the issue at hand at the moment would be to treat it as a plain regular cast - as @cameel noted that doesn't work right now, because functions cannot be casted using the current conversion syntax, but it's on our agenda to rework that anyways, so hopefully this will yield a nice solution killing two birds with one stone...",
