    "body": "I initially intended to file this as a separate issue, but thought it made more sense to request it as an extension to this issue. I'm essentially advocating to include #3356 with this feature. I can open a new issue if it's preferred.\r\n\r\n**Motivation:**\r\n\r\nIt's very common in Solidity contracts to include storage variables which are never intended to be modified. An example of this is `decimals` in EIP20.  (examples: [consensys](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/DetailedERC20.sol), [Zeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/DetailedERC20.sol#L9))\r\n\r\nThe `decimals` value should never change, but no one declares it as `constant` because they want to be able to set the value in the constructor.\r\n\r\nThis is both less safe, and more expensive because the values need to be written to and read from storage.\r\n\r\n**Proposal:**\r\n\r\n* `immutable` values should be appended to the runtime bytecode. \r\n* The location of the values should be stored in bytecode at compile time\r\n* Where `constant` values are currently placed on the stack using `PUSH_`, `immutable` values can be accessed using `CODECOPY`. \r\n\r\nThis approach has additional safety beyond compiler errors, as it's not possible to modify bytecode in the ethereum protocol. \r\n\r\nThat would look something like this: \r\n\r\n```js\r\ncontract Example {\r\n\r\n    uint public constant I_AM_CONSTANT; \r\n    uint public immutable I_AM_IMMUTABLE;\r\n    \r\n    function Example(uint _b) public {\r\n        I_AM_CONSTANT = _b; // TypeError: Cannot assign to a constant variable.\r\n        I_AM_IMMUTABLE = _b; \r\n    }\r\n    \r\n}\r\n```",
