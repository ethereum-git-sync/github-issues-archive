  "body": "Due to the usage of an allocator that seem to be managed through global shared state within the `z3` library a multi-threaded usage of multiple `CompilerStack` instances is prevented (if they call  `CompilerStack::analyze()`). \r\n\r\nSo basically I do this:\r\n```\r\nthread1 {\r\n  CompilerStack compiler;\r\n  compiler.addSource(...);\r\n  compiler.parseAndAnalyze();\r\n}\r\nthread2 {\r\n  CompilerStack compiler;\r\n  compiler.addSource(...);\r\n  compiler.parseAndAnalyze();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n![screen shot 2018-03-24 at 00 13 13](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5008794/37857335-820584a4-2efa-11e8-9b9e-5377f3047993.png)\r\n\r\nAs far as I know `Solidity` is currently single-threaded, but I guess that it could make sense to somehow support multi-threading, especially if third-party applications are just using `Solidity` libraries. It may also make sense to add multi-threading support to the `Solidity` compiler in the future.\r\n\r\nHowever, the described issue can be easily solved by protecting the initialisation with a mutex (see `libsolidity/interface/CompilerStack.cpp`):\r\n```cpp\r\nbool CompilerStack::analyze()\r\n{\r\n...\r\n\tif (noErrors)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tstatic boost::mutex mutex;\r\n\t\tboost::mutex::scoped_lock lock(mutex);\r\n\r\n\t\tSMTChecker smtChecker(m_errorReporter, m_smtQuery);\r\n\t\tlock.unlock();\r\n\t\tfor (Source const* source: m_sourceOrder)\r\n\t\t\tsmtChecker.analyze(*source->ast);\r\n\t}\r\n...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOf course it is also possible to just create a `mutex` around `CompilerStack::parseAndAnalyze` or `CompilerStack::analyze` within third-party applications/libraries, but this may have a bigger impact on the performance.\r\n\r\nProbably the `z3` library api's support better ways to solve this issue - e.g. not to use that allocator.",

    "body": "Hmm.. looks like that the easiest solution could be to move the instantiation of the `SMTChecker` from `bool CompilerStack::analyze()` into the the constructor of `CompilerStack`. Within `bool CompilerStack::analyze()` we should then just call `m_smtChecker.analyze(*source->ast);`. Doing so, the `context` for `z3` was already constructed. If every thread using it's own `z3_context`, `Z3` should behave nicely within multi-threading setup's.\r\n\r\nHowever with that we basically just moving the problem to the constructor. But from my point of the \"sequential\" construction of `CompilerStack` instances within a multi-threaded setup is totally ok. It would be just nice to be able to use `parseAndAnalyze()` from different threads - because some real work is done here. \r\n\r\n@chriseth if you are aware of things that will definitely become a show stopper for the multi-threaded usage within third-party applications, I would really appreciate any hint.\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "@chriseth thank you for your feedback! i just decided to do the multi-threaded usage of Solidity libraries optional. I guess there will be no big performance benefit in the average case - but only headaches - if my code just rely on pure multi-threading usage. I will mark that feature as highly experimental :) So thanks again :)",
