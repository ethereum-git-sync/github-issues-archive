    "body": "See #9582 for full context.\r\n\r\nWe removed the script because it was basically unmaintained. The commands to install dependencies are in most cases very simple and what the script was providing was really just a bit of encapsulated knowledge on what the right commands are for each system. It was failing at this simple task because we almost never recheck that these still work - we only actively test on some of these platforms in our CI and for the others it was a coin toss whether it would work or not. We think that users are better off running these commands on their own. We're open to adding more docs about installation on specific platforms if someone wants to submit a PR to clarify that, but we don't think maintaining such a script is a good idea long-term.\r\n\r\n In case of Ubuntu what the script was doing is more or less this:\r\n```bash\r\napt-get update\r\napt-get install build-essential cmake git libboost-all-dev libz3-dev\r\n```",
