It also requires multiple arguments. `calldataload` copies to the stack, but also requires an offset that needs to be potentially computed and pushed. The latest version of Solidity (about to be released in the next days) allows you to use the `calldata` data location for structs and arrays everywhere and could be almost what you are suggesting.",
