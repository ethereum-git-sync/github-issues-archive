We may want to consider using (a) a better hash function than FNV (which - although very simple - performs poorly and has bad avalanche properties compared to modern non-cryptographic hash functions) and (b) maybe even using some kind of short string optimization (I suspect identifiers in yul are likely to be less than, say 15 characters long? These could be encoded directly into the string handle...).",
