We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.\r\n- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:\r\n    - [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)\r\n    - [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)\r\n- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.\r\n- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.\r\n\r\n*Delete the above section and the instructions in the sections below before submitting*\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nHi all,\r\nWe add Solidity for MSVC RWC testing to detect compiler regression bugs, it built failed due to error C2872: 'ranges': ambiguous symbol with option /std:c++latest (option /std:c++20 is the same result). Could you please take a look? Thanks.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version: inner latest msvc build.\r\n- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings):\r\n- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix):\r\n- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client:\r\n- Operating system: Windows server 2022\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n1. git clone https://github.com/ethereum/solidity F:\\gitP\\ethereum\\solidity\r\n2. git -C \"F:\\gitP\\ethereum\\solidity\" checkout e1a9446\r\n3. set \\_CL_= /std:c++latest (or set \\_CL_=/std:c++20)\r\n4. mkdir F:\\gitP\\ethereum\\solidity\\build_amd64 and cd F:\\gitP\\ethereum\\solidity\\build_amd64\r\n5. cmake -G \"Visual Studio 17 2022\" -A x64 -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION=10.0.22621.0 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBoost_DIR=F:\\tools\\boost_1_77_0\\x64\\lib64-msvc-14.2\\cmake\\Boost-1.77.0 -DCMAKE_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY=MultiThreaded .. \r\n6. msbuild /m /p:Platform=x64 /p:Configuration=Release solidity.sln /t:Rebuild\r\n\r\nI also tried the latest commit: 2da0a86, the same result.\r\n\r\n**Expected Result:**\r\nBuild successfully.\r\n\r\n**Actual result:**\r\nerror C2872: 'ranges': ambiguous symbol \r\n\r\n**detailed log:**\r\n[build_solidity.log](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/files/11426754/build_solidity.log)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease provide a *minimal* source code example to trigger the bug you have found.\r\nPlease also mention any command line flags that are necessary for triggering the bug.\r\nProvide as much information as necessary to reproduce the bug.\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n// Some *minimal* Solidity source code to reproduce the bug.\r\n// ...\r\n```\r\n-->\r\n",

We'll be attempting to refactor things to be able to be forward-compatible again (and then hopefully even switch to C++20) soon (maybe pending the upcoming debian release).",
