    "body": "The EVM defines division by zero to be zero, not as a revert (as you say yourself) - since our code generation targets an EVM following that specification, I'd not consider divisions by zero a bug - I don't think it's really practical for us to take any potential \"non-orthodox\" EVM implementation into account :-).\r\nThat being said, for those particular multiplication overflow checks, we may change the code generation to a division-free version in the near future - at least in some cases, but even then I couldn't guarantee that the generated bytecode will never contain a division by zero, since given the EVM spec it's perfectly valid.\r\n\r\nRegarding the second point: the reason why we need masking before the equality comparison is that the generated code is meant to be robust against dirty higher-order bits in ``value``. Consider\r\n```\r\nfunction f() public {\r\n  uint8 x;\r\n  assembly { x := 0x0100 }\r\n  x++;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nHere ``x`` is treated as having an effective value of zero, even after the inline assembly write and therefore the increment does *not* overflow. If the overflow check was implemented using ``gt(x,0xfe)``, however, it would kick in and would revert.\r\n\r\nIt is an arguable design choice to prefer robustness against dirty values - but that's how things worked traditionally and changing that would be a breaking change...\r\n",
