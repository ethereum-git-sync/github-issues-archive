  "body": "This is a different approach to the problem described in #13801.\r\n\r\n`--ir` is the output straight from the codegen without any processing applied to it, while `--ir-optimized` is that code parsed again and then passed through `YulStack`, which may or may not apply optimizations to it, but will at the very least reformat it.\r\n\r\nAfter #13972 `--ir` output is no longer the same as the unoptimized IR. The unoptimized IR has some minimal transformations applied to it to prevent \"Stack too deep\" errors. `--ir-optimized` is what the Yul->EVM actually runs on, and is the thing that should be given to the user.\r\n\r\nMy proposal here is to remove the current `--ir` output and then rename `--ir-optimized` to `--ir`. The same should be done in Standard JSON. The change is breaking.",
