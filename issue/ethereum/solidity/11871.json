  "body": "## Description\r\nI have this code with parenthesis that is giving me the wrong computation.\r\n\r\nInitially, I was getting an integer underflow when running it. The subtraction definitely doesn't underflow so it leads me to think it is some bug with evaluation parenthesis, which according to the docs should be the first thing evaluated. \r\n\r\nThis code gives an overflow error:\r\n```\r\n            uint _timeDiff = ( _atOrAfter.time - _beforeOrAt.time ) * 1e10;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis code gives the wrong value:\r\n```\r\n            uint _timeDiff;\r\n            unchecked {\r\n                _timeDiff = ( _atOrAfter.time - _beforeOrAt.time ) * 1e10;\r\n            }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd this code works correctly:\r\n```\r\n            uint _timeDiff;\r\n            _timeDiff = _atOrAfter.time - _beforeOrAt.time;\r\n            _timeDiff = _timeDiff * 1e10;\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm worried what to make about this. In the meantime will probably just play it safe and use the more verbose expression..\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version: 0.8.7\r\n- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): London\r\n- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): brownie\r\n- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: ganache\r\n- Operating system: macos\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nHopefully this reproduces the bug? I found this in my code which has a lot more before and after. \r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n// Some *minimal* Solidity source code to reproduce the bug.\r\n// ...\r\n\r\nStruct MyStruct {\r\n   uint32 time;\r\n}\r\n\r\nMyStruct _beforeOrAt = MyStruct(12000);\r\nMyStruct _atOrAfter = MyStruct(18000);\r\n\r\nuint _timeDiff = ( beforeOrAt.time - _atOrAfter.time ) * 1e10;\r\n\r\n```",

You are multiplying by a literal and literals have their own special type with unlimited precision. When a literal is multiplied by an integer type, the computation is preformed within that integer type. The conversion to `uint` is only perforemed after that and it's a pretty safe conversion (width is not decreased, signedness is not changed, type is still integer) so the compiler has nothing to complain about :)",
