  "body": "## Abstract\r\n\r\nCasting from `bytes` to a value type should unpack just the required number of bytes from the bytes array. For example, given `bytes memory b`, it should be possible to do `bytes4 b4 = bytes4(b);`\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nThe primary motivation for this is for decoding the return value of low-level calls, when there is only one return value:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n    (bool success, bytes memory returnData) = addr.call(abiEncoding);\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nGiven `returnData` as returned from a `call` as shown above, there needs to be a way to easily read a single value of a given type from the return data, without using assembly.\r\n\r\nThe assembly version would be, e.g. for `bytes4` return type,\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n    if (success) {\r\n        bytes4 val;\r\n        if (returnData.length >= 4) {\r\n            assembly {\r\n                val := mload(add(returnData, 32))\r\n            }\r\n        } else {\r\n            val = 0;\r\n        }\r\n        // do something with val here\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis sort of pattern seems to be needed for any return type other than `string`, because (as far as I can tell) you can't accomplish this by merely casting, e.g. if you expect a `bytes4` as the return value, you can't just go `bytes4(returnData)`.\r\n\r\nHowever assembly sections are always flagged in security audits as potential issues, and additionally, assembly potentially makes code unportable in future to other blockchains or other VMs, etc.\r\n\r\nCasting should work for any value type, e.g. if a function call returns a boolean, you should be able to do `bool flag = bool(returnData);`. Currently this requires the same pattern shown above, with `bytes4` replaced with `bool`, or if implementing this in pure Solidity, something like:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n    bool retVal = success && returnData.length > 0 ? returnData[0] != 0 : false;\r\n```\r\n\r\nit would be much better to be able to do something like \r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n    bool retVal = success && bool(returnData);\r\n```\r\n\r\nOf course if `returnData.length` is too short to hold the target type, then the cast should throw.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nThis would be fully backwards-compatible, as currently the type of casting suggested above raises an error.\r\n",

    "body": "Yeah, just like @hrkrshnn said, `abi.decode()` is the general solution here. In a general case you need actual ABI decoding because not all types have the layout on the stack that's identical to how they're encoded in calldata/returndata.\r\n\r\nBut also, overall this looks to me like you're trying to use a low-level `call()` but still want it to work like a high-level call that decodes returned data into Solidity types. Why are you not doing a high-level call instead? Is it because of extra checks that add gas overhead? I.e. are you actually after something like #11125?",
