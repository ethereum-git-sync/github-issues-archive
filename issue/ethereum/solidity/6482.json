For example, if one of your dependencies vendored `Ownable` and you also have `Ownable` through OpenZeppelin. This is fine with Solidity because it can tell them apart, but since they are all \"exported\" in solc's JSON output, and these tools create artifacts in the file system for all exported symbols, they will only create a single `Ownable.json` file (probably arbitrarily chosen betwen the two).\r\n\r\nI hope this was a better example of the benefits I see from making exports explicit.\r\n\r\nYou could see this as a problem with the tools, and indeed Buidler is going to fix it, but I'd say the root cause is the namespace pollution caused by the common global scope.",

    "body": "Hm, I realize now that making exports explicit would not solve the issue I described above with the JSON artifact files... I mixed things up.\r\n\r\nThe example with a vendored `Ownable` could still be useful to analyze the feature. Since exports are implicit, if the user tries to combine those two dependencies in the same file, and `Ownable` is a transitive dependency, they would get a name clash between those two `Ownable` contracts that are actually defined in different places.",
