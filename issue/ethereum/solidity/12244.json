    "body": "@GeorgePlotnikov We need something that's simple and low on maintenance. We're fine with adjusting our script to fit the new library, but we'd rather not have a big piece of boilerplate to do one simple thing. That script is already too big as it is. Basically, we need to find out what is currently the canonical way to calculate an IPFS hash of a file and do that. What we ended up with in https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/pull/108 is much, much better than what that PR started with, and the biggest issue was lack of manpower on our side to review it rather than some fundamental blocker. Still, it seems overcomplicated and I have a feeling that there must exist some wrapper in the IPFS libs that already does this boilerplate for us.\r\n\r\nIn the end, the solution from that PR was not *that* complicated so with some further simplification it might be acceptable. For example the support for different codecs/format feels like something we shouldn't really need in our use case. Without that maybe it would be simple enough.",
