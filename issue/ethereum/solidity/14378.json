  "body": "## Abstract\r\n\r\nWHITE is used for info error reporting. Many people have WHITE backgrounds on their terminals (it's pretty common in Mac land).\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/5254\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nWhile --no-color or similar option is available (I think?) it'd nice to be able to use colorization irrespective of terminal configuration, and without having to jump through hoops to remap colors that may nevertheless be important to other programs on the same terminal.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nI didn't want to annoy anyone by labeling this issue a \"bug\" (which it arguably isn't) but really any given choice of foreground color may become invisible against an arbitrary background. Some simple deterministic exclusion principle should be used to avoid such unfortunate clashes: don't use any color code at all? pick the background color +1? if it's easy, pick the background color's complement? if one exists use the terminal color code for default foreground... etc. I'm no expert in this area, but anything seems better than invisible text that you must mouse select to see (since selections change colors).\r\n\r\nAn easier alternative may be to supply a command-line option which allows setting any given output color to some other color; either globally for the color name, or semantically for the colorization type (info, etc).\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nDunno if any downstream tools actually care about colors??",
