    "body": "The last point ``remove for with empty body and post (move \"pre\" part)`` is not a valid transformation, though, is it? E.g. for an always true condition such a for should loop until the gas runs out...\r\nIn ``remove for with false condition`` on the other hand, we still have to move the ``pre`` part.\r\n\r\nAnd as an extension of the second point (in witch I guess \"remove\" is \"move body\"), I'll also remove if's with false condition.\r\n\r\n~~Also right now whenever I remove stuff I still put them in blocks - that way the module won't have any dependencies - I could skip those blocks if we make it depend on the disambiguator, though, not sure which of the two is better.~~\r\n\r\nI'll probably push a PR with a preliminary version shortly in any case.",
