This issue tracks support for adding one with the following structure:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconstructor() {\r\n  // Initialize state variables\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis does not yet test ABI coding with the constructor because the abi proto fuzzer does not yet support ABI encoding itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nAdding the constructor should be straight forward. We would need to move initializations of state variables to the `constructor` function instead of the `test` function.",
