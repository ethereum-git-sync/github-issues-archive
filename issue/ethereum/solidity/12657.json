  "body": "## Abstract\r\n\r\nThe methods `send` and `transfer` were introduced only for `address payable` with the intention to explicitly differentiate the addresses that can be sent Ether. But these two methods are now being [discouraged](https://consensys.net/diligence/blog/2019/09/stop-using-soliditys-transfer-now/) in the Solidity community, in favor of `call`.\r\n\r\nBut, currently, the `call` can be invoked successfully on both non-payable `address` and payable `address payable` types with some value set. For example, it is perfectly valid to send `someone` (`address` type) some Ether by invoking `sendSomeone()` method in the following `Dummy` contract:\r\n```solidity\r\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\r\n\r\ncontract Dummy {\r\n    address someone = 0xAb8...cb2;\r\n\r\n    function balanceOf(address addr) public view returns (uint) {\r\n        return addr.balance;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function sendToSomeone() public payable returns (bool) {\r\n        (bool sent, ) = someone.call{value: msg.value}(\"\");\r\n        return sent;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nApart from defeating the original intention of differentiating `address` and `address payable`, the current behavior of `call` might introduce potential bugs or even security flaws by mistaken invocation of `call` on an address that wasn't even supposed to be payable. Changing the behavior of `call` in different contexts will further enforce the security in the contract.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nA possible solution is the different behavior of `call` for `address` and `address payable` types.\r\n\r\nFor `address payable` it should work as it works now. No changes.\r\n\r\nBut for a plain `address` type it should not compile if it is invoked with `value` param set. So, if `call` is invoked on `someAddr` of `address` type it won't compile:\r\n```solidity\r\nsomeAddr.call{value: 10000000}(\"\");  // Error: Invalid!\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, it should be good if there is no value param:\r\n```solidity\r\nsomeAddr.call{gas: 1000000}(\"\");  // This is fine!\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nThis change will not be fully backward compatible as currently `call` is allowed with `value` set and the proposed solution asks to prohibit it. \r\n",
