    "body": "Hello @Divyn, thank you for your contribution. Before we proceed with any changes to the documentation, it's important to clearly understand the specific issue that @0xOlias pointed out. Could you please elaborate on what exactly needs to be clarified in that section?\r\n\r\nStrictly speaking, parameters refer to variables in event definitions, while arguments denote the values assigned to those variables during event instantiation. Upon re-reading the documentation, it appears that indeed these terms are used interchangeably. Personally, I don't believe this impacts readability within the given context. So, for me, it is fine to use them interchangeably there. However, as English is not my native language, I am open to suggestions on how to enhance this section for better clarity.",
