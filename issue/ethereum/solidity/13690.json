    "body": "Yeah, it needs a decision about the input format. It should be symmetric of course but we also need to place it somewhere in the Stardard JSON input structure. Basically, choose a key for it.\r\n\r\nWhen we discussed it on the channel last time, my opinion was that we should introduce a new key that you can use instead of `sources`. E.g. `import` and `inputs`, with subkeys for various things we can import (matching output names). It should contain non-stringified JSON.\r\n\r\nAST import should also only be allowed when `language` is set to `Solidity` (not `Yul`) since we don't support Yul AST import. With assembly - not sure. Maybe we should not have `language` in that case at all?",

But yeah, also haven't thought through that yet.\r\n\r\nAs for the format: let's do it like this comment suggests, i.e. ``SolidityAST`` as language, and then a ``sources`` field as in the AST export output.",
