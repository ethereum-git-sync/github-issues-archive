  "body": "My most frequent pain point with inheritance is ambiguity about _\"which of these things are actually being deployed\"_.\r\n\r\nA typical repository might have 30 `contracts`, but only 5 or 6 derived contracts which compile to bytecode that will be deployed. For example, there is no reason to ever deploy a contract which is simply `Ownable`, so why would that be declared as `contract Ownable { ... }`. \r\n\r\nI was impressed with how the 0xProject handled this with a strict naming convention using the terminology of '[Mixins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixin)'. For example, in this [directory](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-monorepo/tree/development/packages/contracts/src/2.0.0/protocol/Exchange), only `Exchange.sol` will be deployed, everything else will be inherited to that contract.\r\n\r\nI would like to propose creating a new keyword for declaring an inheritable piece of code. The chief benefit would be a clear indication that _\"this is not intended to be a final contract\"._ \r\n\r\nPerhaps: `inheritable`, `mixin` or `class`, could be used. The specific word isn't too important.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @maurelian in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3729#issuecomment-422975059_",

    "body": "Consider the keyword `abstract`.\r\n\r\nExample from https://github.com/0xcert/ethereum-utils/blob/master/contracts/ownership/Ownable.sol\r\n\r\n```\r\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\r\n\r\nabstract contract Ownable {\r\n  address public owner;\r\n\r\n  // event OwnershipTransferred...\r\n\r\n  constructor() public {\r\n    owner = msg.sender;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  modifier onlyOwner() {\r\n    require(msg.sender == owner);\r\n    _;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) onlyOwner public {\r\n    // ...\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNobody in their right mind would deploy the `Ownable` contract, even though it is presently possible. The keyword `abstract` removes the ability to compile this contract. And in the Remix IDE, abstract contracts won't even show up as compile targets.\r\n\r\nIn addition to *allowing* `abstract` keyword to compileable contracts. It is probably helpful to *require* `abstract` for non-compilable contracts. \r\n\r\n```\r\npragma solidity ^0.4.25;\r\n\r\ncontract A {\r\n    function x();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n^^^ Presently this code is legal. I propose that it should be an error \"Contracts with unimplemented methods must be explicitly marked as `abstract`.\" Or better, \"Contract A must implement function x() or be marked as abstract\".
