  "body": "## Abstract\r\n\r\nI am facing an issue related to obtaining an ABI from my contract without unnamed parameters. With the recent release of Solidity 0.8.18, named parameters in mapping types have been introduced, allowing the mapping of the provided code fragment to be mapped to a function signature in the ABI as func(address user) (uint256 value).\r\n\r\n```\r\ncontract Temp {\r\n    mapping(address  user => uint256 balance) public balanceOf;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nHowever, I have encountered a challenge when the map's value is an array, as exemplified in the following code snippet:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncontract Temp {\r\n    mapping(address  user => uint256[] balance) public balanceOf;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIn such a scenario, the function signature in the ABI becomes func(address user, uint256) (uint256 value).\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nIf solidity allows to somehow specify index parameter name, through some syntax. For e.g.:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmapping(address user => uint256[index] balance) public balanceOf;\r\n\r\n// or for matrixes\r\nmapping(address user => uint256[index][day] balance) public balanceOf;\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nIn a mapping declaration, if there is a word between the braces of an array `[<word>]`, then use that word as a name for the index of the array in the function.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nThere is no backward compatibility as existing code will function the same. And adding parameters should not change bytecode as well, since it only fills the respective name parameters in the ABI.\r\n",
