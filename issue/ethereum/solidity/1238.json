Can I still use doxygen?\n> \n>  No, not as such; doxygen needs to understand the structure of what it reads. If you don't mind\n>  spending some time on it, there are several options:\n> -    If the grammar of X is close to C or C++, then it is probably not too hard to tweak src/scanner.l a bit so the language is supported. This is done for all other languages directly supported by doxygen (i.e. Java, IDL, C#, PHP).\n> -    If the grammar of X is somewhat different than you can write an input filter that translates X into something similar enough to C/C++ for doxygen to understand (this approach is taken for VB, Object Pascal, and Javascript, see http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html#helpers).\n> -    If the grammar is completely different one could write a parser for X and write a backend that produces a similar syntax tree as is done by src/scanner.l (and also by src/tagreader.cpp while reading tag files).\n\nSo I would say it should be possible but would require some work on the upstream. I tried to run doxygen with C++ settings on a solidity project and got a lot of `warning: ignoring unknown tag` errors.\n",
