This seems unnecessary.\r\n\r\nA [`REVERT`](https://github.com/axic/EIPs/blob/75121e281a8737f979a969394b4360d4d277c115/EIPS/eip-140.md#specification) always consumes two stack items - to determine memory location and length of data to be returned. The actual return ~~value~~ data comes from memory.\r\n\r\n> The client can already see where the program crashed by checking the program counter. Simply add a mapping of <program counter => String> for assertion operations having names. (...)\r\n\r\n(Also described by @axic [a few comments back](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1686#issuecomment-348012218).)\r\n\r\nThis requires every client that wants human-readable error messages to have this mapping/database. If it's supposed to be distributed with the ABI, that allows for easy translation (to other human languages) of the error messages; but it also means the error messages can be spoofed.\r\n\r\nMore importantly, relying on the program counter like this will not work nicely in loops; and, in general, only helps to determine _where_ it failed, but not _why_.\r\n\r\nConsider, for example, a loop that goes through N addresses and performs a check on every element. `REVERT` returning a program counter will not be able to indicate which address failed the check.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nEDIT: [EIP issue 838](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/838) (no-status) might be relevant.",
