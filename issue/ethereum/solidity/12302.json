  "body": "Original title: \"unusual behavior with mapping within struct within library\".\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nWhen a library contains a struct type whose _only_ member is a `mapping`, and a contract contains a _public_ member of that struct type, then compilation fails with error `Internal or recursive type is not allowed for public state variables.`. But if you add a _further_ field in the struct (of type `uint256` for example), then compilation **does not fail**. This looks like a bug.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version: 0.8.10\r\n- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): compiler default (London)\r\n- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Remix\r\n- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client:\r\n- Operating system: MacOS\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n`Lib.sol`\r\n```solidity\r\npragma solidity 0.8.10;\r\nlibrary Lib {\r\n    struct MyStruct {\r\n        // uint256 myInt;\r\n        mapping(uint256 => uint256) myMap;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n`A.sol`\r\n```solidity\r\npragma solidity 0.8.10;\r\nimport './Lib.sol';\r\ncontract A {\r\n    Lib.MyStruct public myStruct;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```\r\nTypeError: Internal or recursive type is not allowed for public state variables.\r\n --> contracts/A.sol:6:5:\r\n  |\r\n6 |     Lib.MyStruct public myStruct;\r\n  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n```\r\nBUT IF YOU UNCOMMENT the commented line, then it compiles.",
