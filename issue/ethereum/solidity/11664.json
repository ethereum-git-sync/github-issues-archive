  "body": "\r\n## Abstract\r\n\r\nConsider to encode certain reverts as  `Error(uint256)` with defined error codes\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nBoth Solidity and Fe currently use `Panic(uint256)` to encode certain reverts with different panic codes as [defined in the documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.6/control-structures.html?#panic-via-assert-and-error-via-require).\r\n\r\nHowever, there are certain reverts around decoding of invalid abi encoded data for which Solidity reverts with zero data.\r\n[Fe](http://fe.ethereum.org/) currently encodes these reverts as `Panic(uint256)` with panic code `0x99`.\r\n\r\nBut as @ekpyron pointed out `Panic(uint256)`was meant for a different category of failures.\r\n\r\nCiting @ekpyron \r\n\r\n>short summary is: panics, which have the panic codes, were introduced to replace \"asserts\", resp. \"this should never happen\" situations, while decoding invalid abi encoded data has to be expected to happen and rather falls into the category of \"require\" errors... which is why they weren't covered in the panic codes\r\n\r\nThe Fe team wants to avoid reverting with zero information to improve the developer experience. The Fe team is quite happy to re-align to a different encoding if the Solidity teams want to start encoding these reverts differently.\r\n\r\nWe briefly discussed using the signature `Error(uint256)` for this category of errors and the purpose of this issue is to find out if that would be a favorable way forward for this category of errors.",

Of course, the same thing happens with `Panic(uint256)`, but someone defining a custom `Error(uint256)` seems more likely.\r\n\r\nI don't think this is a big deal though, just something to keep in mind.
