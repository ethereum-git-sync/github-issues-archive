That should not be the case. Custom flags need to be passed to cmake are: `-DBoost_USE_STATIC_RUNTIME=ON -DBoost_DIR=${projectDir}\\\\deps\\\\boost\\\\lib\\\\cmake\\\\Boost-1.77.0 -DCMAKE_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY=MultiThreaded`\r\n* The install-deps script could probably be made a little more fool-proof / robust, i.e. it should allow to be invoked more than once and not bail out with weird error messages.\r\n",
