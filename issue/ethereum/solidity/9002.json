  "body": "## Abstract\r\n\r\nSolidity compiler warnings and errors are output sequentially as they are emitted, making it difficult to read. This impacts is most prominent when working on contract updates between solc versions, example below is a small chunk of the output on the `argent-contracts` repo when I switched part of the contracts from 0.5.4 to 0.6.8. Can you spot the `ParserError`?\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2020-05-21 at 09 49 14](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/703848/82531685-7c162c80-9b48-11ea-8b1c-f039b7da4957.png)\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nInstead of outputting compiler messages sequentially in the order produced, it will be very useful for a developer working on them that these are grouped by the type of warning or error.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nAll warnings and errors of a certain type are grouped under a heading with the warning text, listing below the failing instances. For example all  `SPDX license identifier not provided in source file` warnings can be grouped into 1 with that heading, listing below the failing file and line number if applicable. \r\nTo demonstrate with an abbreviated example from above:\r\n```\r\n,/Users/Elena/Source/argent-contracts/contracts/modules/ApprovedTransfer.sol: Warning: SPDX license identifier not provided in source file.
