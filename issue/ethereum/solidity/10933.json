  "body": "## Abstract\r\n\r\nProposing the `abi.validate` function to provide a way for error handling before `abi.decode`.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nWhen dealing with decoding input `bytes`, `abi.decode` is often used. It is often necessary to do sanity checks on user provided inputs, for example userData in ERC-777 or user data in [Superfluid protocol](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/protocol-monorepo/). However in current solidity, it is neither possible to check validity of the format before sending to `abi.decode`, nor possible to try/catch on `abi.decode` itself, hence making the sanity check of input data almost impossible (unless writing your own format check).\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nIn order to solve this problem, I propose a simple function `abi.validate(bytes, (abi types)` that will return a boolean on the validity of the format.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nThis should be a new function, no backward compatibility issue.",
