I pull the release tarball from GitHub but it does not contain:\n- a commit_hash.txt with the commit version of the release (which stops the compilation)\n- an empty prerelease.txt file (which results in the develop-string added to the version string)\n\nIs it possible to add these to future release tarballs?\n",
