Add some command line-tests to verify that.\r\n\r\nDepends on  #11858 - this issue adds a command-line flag to disable printing Solidity snippets in EVM assembly.\r\nRelated to #11876. Until it's done, `--experimental-via-ir` flag must be added to `solc --ir` in order to get identical metadata.\r\nRelated to #11494.\r\n#11875 contains the commands you could use (though the `--asm` output needs some processing to extract just the EVM assembly).",
