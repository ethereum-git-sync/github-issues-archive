In a current docker image of ``ubuntu artful`` the https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/releases/download/solidityTester/aleth_2018-06-20_artful works for me (given that gcc and libleveldb1v5 are installed).\r\n\r\nIf you use a different distribution you will probably have to compile from sources. The ``trusty`` binary is built on ``ubuntu trusty`` and meant to work against their binaries and the ``artful`` binary is built on ``ubuntu artful`` respectively.\r\n\r\nThe sources can be found here https://github.com/ethereum/aleth/releases/tag/solidityTester and the precise commits of ``aleth`` are documented there as well.",
