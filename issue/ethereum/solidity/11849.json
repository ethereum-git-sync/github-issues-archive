  "body": "Decision: Add `abi.encodeCall(f, (arg1, arg2))`\r\nCheck that `abi.encodeCall(f, ())` also works.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIn modern solidity code, it is very common to pass encoded function to other solidity contract for multiple purposes (delayed operation, adding access-control, meta-transactions, etc)\r\n\r\nsomething similar to\r\n```solidity\r\nsomeContract.executeLater(target,\r\n    abi.encodeWithSelector(MyContract.myMethod.selector, param1, uint(param2)) ); \r\n```\r\n\r\nhowever, using encodeWithSelector is very error-prone: there is no type checking, and no tell if the method signature is modified.\r\n\r\n### Suggestion:\r\nadd a syntactic sugar encoder, so that the above can be written like this:\r\n```solidity\r\nsomeContract.executeLater(target,\r\n    MyContract.myMethod.encode(param1, uint(param2)) ); \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe output of such \"method call\" is just like of encodeWithSelector - a `bytes memory`\r\nThe only difference is clearer clearer syntax and type-checking.\r\n\r\nNote that it is a \"method call\" of a contract type, not an instance: just like encodeWithAbi, there is no contract instance involved.

    "body": "Actually, what I said only applies for adding ``encode`` to an actually externally callable function, i.e. a member of a function accessed in an instance of a contract, not the contract type. So in my previous example ``C.f.encode();`` would still be fine.\r\nHowever, that way, ``encode`` would become inaccessible in some inheritance situations, e.g.\r\n```\r\ncontract C {\r\n    function f() public {\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract D is C {\r\n    function g() public {\r\n        C.f.encode();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nSince here ``C.f`` is an internal function and there is no way to access the external function using the contract type in this situation.\r\nNot sure how big of a problem that is, though.\r\n\r\nWe could of course get around this by also adding the member to internal function types, but then it becomes strictly speaking breaking again...\r\n\r\nIn any case: my point is: we need to be a bit careful about this.",

    "body": "One argument for keeping it in `abi.` is that a function call statement is not only about encoding of data, but checking the return value and decoding the returned data. When someone just encodes one part of that and passes it around, the checks done after execution are not part of the statement anymore. Hence it is a \"risky\" task and works the same way other `abi.` methods do. Users of the language are already familiar what to do with `abi.` methods.\r\n\r\n> Although I do see the problem of putting the function and the arguments at the same level.\r\n\r\nWe already have types added in `abi.decode` to be fair, although one confusion may be that we do accept function types and `abi.encodeCall(f, ...)` kind of looks like a function type. However, there are already special encoders, like `encodeWithSelector` and `encodeWithSignature` which treat their first parameter in a special way.",
