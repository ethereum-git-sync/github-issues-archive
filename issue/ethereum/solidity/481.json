  "body": "With library support code can be organised better than solely with inheritance.\n\nWould it possible with an option to treat libraries as parent contracts and therefore include their methods in the contract body?  Similarly how static linking works.\n\nIn some cases the library is so small that it could make more sense when statically linked. Maybe a better option is to have an inline modifier for a library?\n\nIn the long term everything should be library based and that will open another problem to solve - managing dependency lists, versions of deployed contracts to attach to. All this in order to avoid multiple deployments of the same.\n",
