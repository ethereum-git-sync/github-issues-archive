  "body": "Memory can be allocated using the `new` keyword in Solidity, but in the inline assembly part is has to be done by hand.\n\nThe example code in the docs for doing this:\n\n```\nfunction getcode(address _addr) returns (bytes o_code) {\n                assembly {\n                        // retrieve the size of the code, this needs assembly\n                        let size := extcodesize(_addr)\n                        // allocate output byte array - this could also be done without assembly\n                        // by using o_code = new bytes(size)\n                        o_code := mload(0x40)\n                        // new \"memory end\" including padding\n                        mstore(0x40, add(o_code, and(add(add(size, 0x20), 0x1f), bnot(0x1f))))\n                        // store length in memory\n                        mstore(o_code, size)\n                        // actually retrieve the code, this needs assembly\n                        extcodecopy(_addr, add(o_code, 0x20), 0, size)\n                }\n}\n```\n\nI don't want to duplicate such code, so I rather resort to the following code structure (this is based on the sample code):\n\n```\nfunction getcode(address _addr) returns (bytes o_code) {\n            uint size;\n            assembly {\n                size := extcodesize(_addr)\n            }\n\n            o_code = new bytes(size);\n\n            assembly {\n                extcodecopy(_addr, add(o_code, 0x20), 0, size)\n            }\n        }\n}\n```\n\nI think it would make sense having some shortcut for this accessible from assembly. Such as:\n\n```\no_code := $allocate(size)\n```\n\nor\n\n```\no_code := __allocate(size)\n```\n\nThe prefix is to make a distinction between an opcode and the builtin helper.\n\nMaybe it would make sense having macros? :)\n",
