    "body": "> we do want the warning if the parameter is just used via natspec but not in the code\r\n\r\nWhy is this?\r\n\r\nHere's a real world example:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n/**\r\n * @param token The token to be flash loaned.\r\n */\r\nfunction _flashFeeReceiver(address token) internal view virtual returns (address) {\r\n    return address(0);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe're forced to introduce a statement like `token;` in the function body to silence the warning. Removing the variable name is not an option because then you can't provide NatSpec for it.\r\n\r\nIf the function is virtual I think the warning should be silenced, particularly if there is an `@param` for it, because the workaround is hacky and requires a comment explaining why it's there.",
