    "body": "Back-of-the-envelope-calculation: It costs at least `30+6+3+1 = 40` gas to compute the hash. Assuming the event is emitted 200 times, this would mean an additional runtime cost of 8000 gas. 8000 gas corresponds to 40 bytes of code. So it is not cheaper to compute the signature, at least in the default tradeoff setting.",
