We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.\r\n- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:\r\n    - [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)\r\n    - [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)\r\n- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.\r\n- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.\r\n\r\n*Delete the above section and the instructions in the sections below before submitting*\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\n<!--Please shortly describe the bug you have found, and what you expect instead.-->\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version: 0.8.13\r\n- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings):\r\n- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Truffle No okay, Remix Okay\r\n- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client:\r\n- Operating system: Mac OSX\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\nStack too deep error when trying to compile a function in Truffle in VS Code. \r\nBut worked okay on Remix. \r\n Some responses online were that there's a limit to the number of variables declared in a function. \r\nSo I had to declare another struct with all the variables needed within the function so that they didn't need to be initiated in the function. This was the only way to get around the error message in Truffle/ VS Code. \r\n\r\nIs this a bug, or would it be possible to increase the capacity of a Solidity function to hold more variables. \r\nOr access variables via deep mappings like struct var -> map->array. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMight also  \r\n<!--\r\nPlease provide a *minimal* source code example to trigger the bug you have found.\r\nPlease also mention any command line flags that are necessary for triggering the bug.\r\nProvide as much information as necessary to reproduce the bug.\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n// Some *minimal* Solidity source code to reproduce the bug.\r\n// ...\r\n```\r\n-->  function revealWinner(uint campaignId_,uint winningRacer_) \r\n        external    \r\n        payable\r\n        timedTransitions(campaignId_)\r\n        atStage(campaignId_,Stages.RevealWinner) \r\n        onlyBy(owner)\r\n        returns (Payment memory) {\r\n\r\n        BettingCampaign storage b_camp = _getCampaign(campaignId_);\r\n        // Payment memory payment;\r\n\r\n        b_camp.payment.totalAmount = b_camp.totalAmount; //All proceeds from the campaign to winner , beneficiary and platform\r\n        b_camp.payment.totalAmount = b_camp.totalAmount; //All proceeds from the campaign to winner , beneficiary and platform\r\n\r\n\r\n        Bidder memory nextBidder;\r\n        Bidder memory topBidder;\r\n        // if (b_camp.bidders[winningRacer_].length ==0) revert InvalidOperation();\r\n        topBidder.addr = b_camp.bidders[winningRacer_][0].addr;\r\n        topBidder.amount = b_camp.bidders[winningRacer_][0].amount;\r\n        topBidder.timeStamp = b_camp.bidders[winningRacer_][0].timeStamp;\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n        for (uint i=1; i< b_camp.bidders[winningRacer_].length; i++) {\r\n\r\n            //Track amount and timestamp for conflict resolution\r\n            nextBidder.addr = b_camp.bidders[winningRacer_][i].addr;\r\n            nextBidder.amount = b_camp.bidders[winningRacer_][i].amount;\r\n            nextBidder.timeStamp = b_camp.bidders[winningRacer_][i].timeStamp;\r\n         \r\n\r\n            if (nextBidder.amount > topBidder.amount) {\r\n                topBidder.addr = nextBidder.addr;\r\n                topBidder.amount = nextBidder.amount;\r\n                topBidder.timeStamp=  nextBidder.timeStamp;\r\n               \r\n            }\r\n            else if ( nextBidder.amount == topBidder.amount && nextBidder.timeStamp < topBidder.timeStamp){\r\n                topBidder.addr = nextBidder.addr;\r\n                topBidder.amount = nextBidder.amount;\r\n                topBidder.timeStamp= nextBidder.timeStamp;\r\n            }\r\n\r\n",
