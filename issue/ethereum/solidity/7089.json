  "body": "## Abstract\r\n\r\nSolidity currently allows unicode escapes in strings, in the form `\\uNNNN`.  However, this is only sufficient to cover the basic multilingual plane.  Anything beyond that must first be encoded as UTF-8 and then have its bytes entered manually.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nAdd unicode escapes covering the entire range of unicode code points.  One could perhaps borrow Javascript's syntax for this, which is `\\u{hex}`, where `hex` consists of any number of hex digits -- so long as the resulting number is, of course, at most 0x10FFFF and not a surrogate.  Otherwise it should be a compile error.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nSee above for one possibility.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nIf it's implemented as suggested above, there should be no backwards incompatibility, as currently `\\u{` forms an invalid escape sequence.  If it's implemented some other way, who can say?  That said, even if you don't want to handle it the way suggested above, it should be easy to handle it in a way that avoids backwards incompatibility.",

Since Unicode code points go only up to `0x10FFFF`, you'll always have at least two leading zeros if you strictly require 8 digits.
