We spent some time debugging it, and found this problem with solc or with its distribution:\r\n\r\nIf you install `solc` `0.5.17+commit.d19bba13` using Homebrew and downloading it from solc-bin.ethereum.org, you can get a different output for the same input.\r\n\r\nHere's a script that can be used to reproduce it:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nbrew tap ethereum/ethereum\r\nbrew install ethereum/ethereum/solidity@5\r\n\r\nwget --quiet https://gist.githubusercontent.com/alcuadrado/06c1ad0cf7e23758e17a32e829f26497/raw/b9f864cfda21d0cc9c5365fa1a1b435aec6285e8/input-to-get-different-outputs.json\r\n\r\nwget --quiet https://solc-bin.ethereum.org/macosx-amd64/solc-macosx-amd64-v0.5.17+commit.d19bba13\r\nchmod +x solc-macosx-amd64-v0.5.17+commit.d19bba13\r\n\r\necho '\\n\\n\\n'\r\necho Brew solc\r\nsolc --version\r\ncat input-to-get-different-outputs.json | solc --standard-json | md5sum\r\n\r\necho '\\n\\n\\n'\r\necho Native solc\r\n./solc-macosx-amd64-v0.5.17+commit.d19bba13 --version\r\ncat input-to-get-different-outputs.json | ./solc-macosx-amd64-v0.5.17+commit.d19bba13 --standard-json | md5sum\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt will output\r\n\r\n```\r\nBrew solc\r\nsolc, the solidity compiler commandline interface\r\nVersion: 0.5.17+commit.d19bba13.Darwin.appleclang\r\nb2051480575328ea24cdfa7cbdc71cf5  -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNative solc\r\nsolc, the solidity compiler commandline interface\r\nVersion: 0.5.17+commit.d19bba13.mod.Darwin.appleclang\r\na13020de9abb553ca40d7171744a8735  -\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother interesting thing is that Etherscan seems to be running the same version than the one distributed by Homebrew.

Are the solc-bin.ethereum.org binaries somehow corrupted? This is really important to us, as it can lead to people deploying contracts that aren't verifiable on Etherscan.",

Metadata includes compiler version and versions clearly differ. The build system adds the `.mod` part when the source you're building from has modifications. And in https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/pull/53, as can be seen in the script, I had to apply quite a few changes to the older versions to get them to build and pass tests. This is all in the  build configuration and tests so there should be no difference in compiler logic but the build system can't discern that.\r\n\r\nFor example I had to modify the config to stop compiler from treating warnings as errors (there are warnings below 0.6.1) and to link `jsoncpp` statically (otherwise the executable would not be really self-contained). I might be able to work around it on some versions but with significant effort and in the end not all of them.\r\n\r\nThe only sure-fire way to fix these builds I can think of would be to add another modification that would remove the `.mod` part from version string but this seems a bit too hacky...",

See for example #10082. But I think that information about compiler version used to generate the bytecode is pretty important when it comes to reproducing it.\r\n\r\n~And it isn't really all that extreme. There's a proposal to include much more stuff in the version string: #6228, though AFAIK this isn't on the roadmap right now.~ EDIT: Looking closer, it's about just printing it with `--version`, not including that stuff in the version string.\r\n\r\n> While I get the idea behind doing that, I believe it makes it unfeasible to use the metadata hash at all. There's at least 4 different official builds for each solc version, and to be able to verify a contract (including its metadata) you should have access to all of them.\r\n\r\nThis is not a problem with official release builds because we do perform extensive checks that the generated byte code is identical on all platforms. We have the [t_bytecode_compare](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/v0.7.4/.circleci/config.yml#L1107-L1125) CI job that runs for every PR and also on the final binaries that are published on the github release page. The job basically takes all the 4k+  `.sol` test cases from the repository, compiles them on all platforms and makes sure that the resulting bytecode is byte-for-byte identical.\r\n\r\nThe situation with these MacOS rebuilds is a special case because they were not originally included in releases and I built them independently in `solc-bin` which does not share the CI infrastructure. We discussed running bytecode comparison on them but it was before the recent refactor (it was much more obtrusive before then, e.g. it required a special repo) and it would add a lot of extra effort to the task. In the end we decided that it was not worth the effort and that passing all the tests should be good enough. And it would be if I did not miss this slight difference in `--version` (I think that this is the only difference).\r\n\r\nLesson learned. I'm going to do the bytecode comparison when I rebuild the binaries now.\r\n\r\n> I think sticking with the .mod and contacting Etherscan would be a better path forward. If you actually rebuild those versions, removing the .mod, and publish them in solc-bin replacing the existing builds, it would be almost impossible to reproduce some contract builds\r\n\r\nThis really depends on how widely those builds are used. They have only been added recently so I was assuming that replacing them with ones that can produce bytecode identical with other platforms would be the lesser evil here.\r\n\r\nAFAIK Etherscan is using the emscripten builds from the `bin/` directory in `solc-bin`. https://etherscan.io/solcversions includes nightlies which are only present in `bin/`. \r\n\r\nWe definitely could keep the old binaries in a separate directory in `solc-bin` in case someone does need them but I'm not sure how widespread that need really is.",

    "body": "Sorry it took so long but I'm finally done with verifying the rebuilt binaries. Running the bytecode comparison on the historical binaries required adding extra functionality to our scripts and also making them backwards compatible with the CLI interface of older versions. I'm glad I did it because it turned out that there are more problems than just the macOS binaries and that binaries for 0.3.6, 0.4.7 and 0.4.8 won't produce the same bytecode even after the rebuild.\r\n\r\nSo here's the overview of the situation:\r\n- Emscripten binaries for version 0.3.6 were not built from the exact commit which is tagged as `v0.3.6` so they have a different version string and produce different bytecode than the macOS binary: #10846.\r\n- The problem with 0.4.7 and 0.4.8: #10841. In short, these versions include platform name in version string so you have to use the same platform if you want the bytecode to be reproducible. I recommend just not using native binaries with these versions. This was fixed in 0.4.9 and up. Versions below 0.4.6 and down do not include metadata hash in the produced bytecode so it's not an issue for them.\r\n- Linux binaries for 0.4.10 (#10839) and 0.4.26 (#10840) do not produce the same bytecode as other platforms. The problem with 0.4.10 is fixable by rebuilding the binary. 0.4.26 is weirder (there was a difference but just in a single test case out of ~1840 and only with optimizer enabled) but maybe a rebuild would help there too.\r\n- I haven't checked Windows binaries.\r\n    - Except that 0.4.15 is known to report the wrong version so it likely produces different bytecode too (#9545).\r\n- All other binaries on versions >= 0.3.6 produce identical bytecode.\r\n\r\nSo now getting the binaries out is just a matter of https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/pull/76 passing review. After it's merged anyone who needs the old ones for verification will still be able to get them from the commit I tagged as\r\n[`macosx-binaries-reporting-wrong-versions`](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/releases/tag/macosx-binaries-reporting-wrong-versions).",

It's just that you won't be able to verify its output using the emscripten binary (and that only if you're using libraries; contracts are fine).\r\n\r\n@alcuadrado Do you have an opinion on that?",
