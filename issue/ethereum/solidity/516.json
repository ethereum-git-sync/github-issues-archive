  "body": "This requires us to modify the `ExecutionFramework` class in the following way:\n- we need access to return values but also require permanent changes to the state. In order to achieve that, we might first use only a `call` to get the execution result, but store the transaction. If another call is made in the same test suite, we send the previous transaction again in a `sendTransaction` manner and then issue the next call.\n- we need access to raw logs of a transaction, but the few tests that use this feature might also be changed\n- tests do not rely on finalized blocks, so mining might not be necessary. If it is, we have to get around the one second delay.\n- we have to add a jsonrpc client to soltest\n",
