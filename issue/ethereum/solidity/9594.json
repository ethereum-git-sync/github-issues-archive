  "body": "Currently our binaries depend on a bunch of msvc*dll's and I think we are currently actually even shipping the wrong ones in the release archives (32-bit instead of 64-bit dlls with 64-bit executables; not sure that'd actually work or people just happen to have the correct dlls installed globally instead). If possible, statically linking might be nicer.\r\n\r\nMight work with\r\nhttps://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.15/prop_tgt/MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY.html\r\n\r\nWe need to investigate whether there's any potential issues or disadvantages with this.\r\nEspecially, this might have unexpected interactions with whatever version of boost we're linking against.",
