  "body": "## Abstract\r\n\r\nAdd a mechanism to disable the default import callback when using the native binary.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nThe native binary defaults to the Host Filesystem Loader, meaning that JSON inputs that are not self-contained can still compile fine. This is a problem for Hardhat because we want to get an error in those cases.\r\n\r\nThere is a workaround: creating an empty temporary directory and using it with `--base-path`. But having a specific flag like `--no-import-callback` would be much better.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nAdd a `--no-import-callback` to the solc binary that disables any default import callback.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nThis is a new flag so there shouldn't be backwards compatibility issues.",

    "body": "After reading the [Import Path Resolution docs](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.21/path-resolution.html), I understand better why the Host Filesystem Loader is used by default in the solc's binary: it is a design decision for the use case where someone compiles Solidity files from the command line using the `solc` binary directly.\r\n\r\nBut I think it's fair to say that most users don't do that. Instead, they use the solc binary indirectly when they compile with Hardhat or Foundry, where I think this flag will be used for every compilation once it's available.",
