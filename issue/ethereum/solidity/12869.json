I'm creating this issue to track what I'm still going to implement:\r\n- [ ] Option to include a column with absolute values next to relative ones in the table.\r\n- [ ] Script for filtering projects/presets. This would allow for example to filter a benchmark summary into two JSONs - one for IR and one for legacy - and diff them to see how the codegens compare.\r\n- [ ] Option not to show zero values (requested in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12804#issuecomment-1078744604)\r\n    - Alternatively: hiding \"unimportant\" values (zeros and rounded to zero, missing on one side, different version, type error, etc.)\r\n- [ ] Option not to skip values when versions differ (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12804#issuecomment-1078744604)",
