We could also assume that the top 2 bits of the length byte are garbage and discard them. I could see a situation where someone discovers that these bits are unused and uses them as a hardcore optimization to avoid using a full slot for some extra boolean flag. In that case 31 would probably not be the correct length.\r\n- Misinterpreting the data might be worse than a revert. Let's say someone used this hacky optimization I mentioned above to store extra flags. Now you could run into a situation where the content is `\"1\"` and the length byte is `0xc2` (1 byte * 2 for length + the two \"unused\" bits set). If we assume that the length is 31, the value will turn into `\"10000000000000000000000000000000\"` on copy.",
