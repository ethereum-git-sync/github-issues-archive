    "body": "## Current situation\r\n\r\nThe current situation with inline assembly is the following (taken from #10835):\r\n- If any Solidity-level local variable is assigned in the assembly, it is considered as having an unknown value at the end of the assembly block.\r\n- If the block modifies storage (e.g., using sstore), all storage variables are considered as having an unknown value at the end of the assembly block.\r\n- If the block modifies memory (e.g., using mstore), all memory variables are considered as having an unknown value at the end of the assembly block.\r\n- In all other cases, the variables keep their value from just before the assembly block.\r\n\r\nThis (greatly) over-approximates the actual behaviour of the code in the assembly block, but at least it is a safe over-approximation (it prevents false negatives).\r\n\r\n## Possible improvements\r\nOne way to improve the analysis would be to track the actual values assigned to variables inside the assembly block.\r\nHowever, beside small obstacles (assembly is not type-safe, so it allows assignments with LHS and RHS being of different type), the analysis is not trivial if the assignment is inside a control-flow branch. To analysed that situation correctly, it would be necessary to have a proper control-flow analysis of the assembly. (This goes into the direction of proper CHC encoding of Yul).",
