Being able to namespace those would of course be nice - but that could be done via the import mechanism, resp. is part of the more general issue of allowing inner-file-namespacing.\r\n\r\nSo given that I think there's no need for assembly libraries as special construct and file-level assembly blocks are the simpler and more consistent option for this.\r\n\r\nI'll go ahead and close this as duplicate and maybe re-triage https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9282 - but if you disagree, feel free to reopen!",
