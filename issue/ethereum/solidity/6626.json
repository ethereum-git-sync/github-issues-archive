We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.\r\n- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:\r\n\t- [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)\r\n\t- [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)\r\n- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.\r\n- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\n<!--Please shortly describe the bug you have found, and what you expect instead.-->\r\n\r\nSupport for generating ternary opcodes (see #6296 ) was added in PR #6554 . But that PR did not contain the visitation logic to actually generate the said opcode from the proto spec.\r\n\r\n",
