Is this not a problem for tools? A tool wanting to construct JSON input from files on disk would have to scan the imports, notice that `b.sol` is relative and put it under `b.sol` (rather than `/tmp/b.sol`) based on that. For `d.sol` it would have to know that it's the opposite - `/tmp/d.sol` is the right path. And what if `d.sol` is imported in different files in different ways?",

This is imperative for being able to recompile on different systems.\r\n\r\nIf you reference paths in the CLI they reference actual files present in the current shell instance. You have a \"current working directory\", you have symlinks and all the wonders of the host filesystem. Standard-json does not have a host filesystem. It needs to be easily translatable from metadata. There is one tiny detail and that is allowing the commandline interface to auto-discover files even in standard-json mode.\r\n\r\nNote that when you use `solc --base-path /tmp/ /tmp/x/y/a.sol ...`, then the metadata will (or should) not contain a file named `/tmp/x./y/a.sol` but instead a file called `x/y/a.sol`.",
