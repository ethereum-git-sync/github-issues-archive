(https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11784)\r\n\r\n### Create the Release\r\n - [x] Create Github release page: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/new (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/untagged-bb8472b69f96d0c0f2d8)\r\n - [x] On the release page, select the ``develop`` branch as new target and set tag to the new version (e.g. `v0.8.5`) (make sure you only `SAVE DRAFT` instead of `PUBLISH RELEASE` before the actual release)\r\n - [x] Thank voluntary contributors in the Github release page (use ``git shortlog -s -n -e v0.5.3..origin/develop``).\r\n - [x] Check that all tests on the latest commit in ``develop`` are green.\r\n - [x] Click the `PUBLISH RELEASE` button on the release page, creating the tag.\r\n - [x] Wait for the CI runs on the tag itself.\r\n\r\n### Download Binaries\r\n - [x] Take the ``solc.exe`` binary from the ``b_win_release`` run of the released commit in circle-ci and add it to the release page as ``solc-windows.exe``.\r\n - [x] Take the ``solc`` binary from the ``b_osx`` run of the released commit in circle-ci and add it to the release page as ``solc-macos``.\r\n - [x] Take the ``solc`` binary from the ``b_ubu_static`` run of the released commit in circle-ci and add it to the release page as ``solc-static-linux``.\r\n - [x] Take the ``soljson.js`` binary from the ``b_ems`` run of the released commit in circle-ci and add it to the release page as ``soljson.js``.\r\n\r\n### Update [solc-bin](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/)\r\n - [x] Copy files to solc-bin:\r\n     ```bash\r\n     VERSION=0.8.4\r\n     COMMIT=\"c7e474f2\"\r\n     SOLC_BIN=\"/home/me/solc-bin\"\r\n     chmod +x solc-static-linux solc-macos\r\n     cp soljson.js $SOLC_BIN/bin/soljson-v$VERSION+commit.$COMMIT.js\r\n     cp solc-static-linux $SOLC_BIN/linux-amd64/solc-linux-amd64-v$VERSION+commit.$COMMIT\r\n     cp solc-macos $SOLC_BIN/macosx-amd64/solc-macosx-amd64-v$VERSION+commit.$COMMIT\r\n     cp solc-windows.exe $SOLC_BIN/windows-amd64/solc-windows-amd64-v$VERSION+commit.$COMMIT.exe\r\n - [x] Run ``./update --reuse-hashes`` in ``solc-bin`` and verify that the script has updated ``list.js``, ``list.txt`` and ``list.json`` files correctly and that symlinks to the new release have been added in ``solc-bin/wasm/`` and ``solc-bin/emscripten-wasm32/``.\r\n - [x] Create a pull request and merge. (https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/pull/96)\r\n\r\n### Homebrew and MacOS\r\n - [ ] Update the version and the hash (``sha256sum solidity_$VERSION.tar.gz``) in https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/solidity.rb (https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/83103)\r\n - [x] Update the version and the hash (``sha256sum solidity_$VERSION.tar.gz``) in https://github.com/ethereum/homebrew-ethereum/blob/master/solidity.rb (https://github.com/ethereum/homebrew-ethereum/pull/297)\r\n\r\n### Docker (@ekpyron)\r\n - [x] Run ``./scripts/docker_deploy_manual.sh v$VERSION``).\r\n\r\n### PPA (@ekpyron)\r\n - [x] Change ``scripts/release_ppa.sh`` to match your key's email and key id.\r\n - [x] Run ``scripts/release_ppa.sh v$VERSION`` to create the PPA release (you need the relevant openssl key).\r\n - [x] Wait for the ``~ethereum/ubuntu/ethereum-static`` PPA build to be finished and published for *all platforms*. SERIOUSLY: DO NOT PROCEED EARLIER!!! *After* the static builds are *published*, copy the static package to the ``~ethereum/ubuntu/ethereum`` PPA for the destination series ``Trusty``, ``Xenial`` and ``Bionic`` while selecting ``Copy existing binaries``.\r\n\r\n### Documentation (@franzihei)\r\n - [x] Build the new version on https://readthedocs.org/projects/solidity/ (select `latest` at the bottom of the page and click `BUILD`).\r\n - [x] In the admin panel, select `Versions` in the menu and set the default version to the released one.\r\n\r\n### Release solc-js (@hrkrshnn)\r\n - [x] Wait until solc-bin was properly deployed. You can test this via remix - a test run through remix is advisable anyway.\r\n - [x] Increment the version number, create a pull request for that, merge it after tests succeeded. (https://github.com/ethereum/solc-js/pull/539)\r\n - [x] Run ``npm publish`` in the updated ``solc-js`` repository.\r\n - [x] Create a tag using ``git tag --annotate v$VERSION`` and push it with ``git push --tags``.\r\n\r\n### Post-release\r\n - [x] Publish the blog post. (https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/08/11/solidity-0.8.7-release-announcement/)\r\n - [x] Create a commit to increase the version number on ``develop`` in ``CMakeLists.txt`` and add a new skeleton changelog entry.\r\n - [x] Announce on Twitter, including links to the release and the blog post.\r\n - [x] Share announcement on Reddit and Solidity forum.\r\n - [x] Update the release information section on [soliditylang.org](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity-portal).\r\n - [x] Lean back, wait for bug reports and repeat from step 1 :)\r\n",
