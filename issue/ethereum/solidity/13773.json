  "body": "## Abstract\r\n\r\nSometimes it is good to restrict access to some fields of structs to be only accessible within outer contract/library.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nSome popular libraries are currently adding underscore to the field names, but can't really protect these vars from being accessed.\r\nFor example, `Counter.sol` in OpenZeppelin library: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/49c0e4370d0cc50ea6090709e3835a3091e33ee2/contracts/utils/Counters.sol#L19\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nLet's allow to specify `private`,`public` (and maybe `view`, which could be read-only from other contract/libraries) keywords for struct fields:\r\n```solidity\r\nlibrary Counters {\r\n    struct Counter {\r\n        uint256 private _value;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo this field `_value` should be accessible within `library Counters` and be non-accessing from the other contracts/libraries. This would allow to build libraries which really protect their consistency from unrestricted access.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nDefault visibility modifier should be `public`.\r\n",
