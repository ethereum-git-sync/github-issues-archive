    "body": "Sure, the class is defined in [`libyul/AssemblyStack.h`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libyul/AssemblyStack.h). You just have to change its name there and update all references to it in other files. Remember to also rename variables it's assigned to and update comments that mention it. It might also be used in some file names. Overall this is just a simple refactor and should not change compiler output in any way.\r\n\r\nJust to make sure this is ready to be worked on - @axic @chriseth can we go with `YulStack` or would you prefer one of the other names now? Also, since this issue is pretty old - is there anything more that should be done here? Any other classes or other stuff that should be renamed to match?",
