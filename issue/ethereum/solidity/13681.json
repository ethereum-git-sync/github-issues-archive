Other tools are failing to parse such source. For an instance, `solidity-coverage` HardHat plugin is failing on it. Is it intended to use multiple `indexed` entries for event arguments? Also is it documented somewhere?\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\nThis is reproducible in Remix IDE.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nRun code sample from \"Description\" section in Remix IDE.\r\n\r\nRegards.",
