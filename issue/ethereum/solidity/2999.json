  "body": "#### Solidity version\r\n\r\nObserved on `4.17+commit.bdeb9e52.Emscripten.clang`. The current nightly build (`0.4.18-nightly.2017.9.29+commit.b9218468.Emscripten.clang`) is also affected.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Issue description\r\n\r\nWe came up with a minimal example demonstrating the issue and deployed it on the mainnet. The example consists of two contracts:\r\n\r\n- *Callee* at address [0x2130FdA6b4d6d2d549E54241AdA5E2c903b0EFEE](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2130fda6b4d6d2d549e54241ada5e2c903b0efee#code):\r\nThis is a super simple contract that creates a log event whenever it receives a call.\r\n\r\n```\r\ncontract Callee {\r\n    event ReceivedCall();\r\n    \r\n    function () {\r\n        ReceivedCall();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n- *Caller* at address [0x0CBe050f75bC8F8C2d6c0D249FEa125Fd6e1Acc9](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0cbe050f75bc8f8c2d6c0d249fea125fd6e1acc9#code):\r\nThis contract simply calls another contract at a user-specified address.\r\n\r\n```\r\ncontract Caller {\r\n    function callAddress(address a) {\r\n        a.call();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe issue occurs in transactions that invoke `Caller.callAddress(<address of Callee>)`:\r\nEverything works when the transaction is run with between [24402](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xef9b0d255c8c3ec1ba876771171db0170bda08520d0b378cea8162d57b5a4c17) and [48574](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x5892dc6c38b7cab3dae99740b15e21770b1e3c822a74310085379789eaf0b7f1) gas.\r\nThe internal transaction/call fails when it is run with between [48575](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xdf7f7949ea8f7c328d0a444208195a4a2546317ec018a0fe71c5f7970e65c7aa) and [49388](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x29878ea52bb8e0d7a44d2dc66ce66898170d31d9ca22bdde3da745382a979fa6) gas. When the transaction is run with at least [49389  gas](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xb15cb220a33fd43c16950415a59bc95f6083978a27b000680e21dc0e020e937f), the internal call succeeds again.\r\n\r\nThis behaviour is highly counterintuitive: If the transaction succeeds with x gas, it should also succeed with >x gas.\r\n\r\n#### Cause\r\n\r\nThe cause of this behaviour is the code that `solc` generates for `a.call()`:\r\nFor the EVM's `CALL` opcode, the top of the stack specifies the maximum amount of gas that should be available in the new callframe. The generated binary computes this amount by doing \r\n```\r\nPUSH2 0x646e\r\nGAS\r\nSUB\r\n```\r\n, i.e. as `<amount of available gas> - 25710`. \r\n\r\n[This code in ExpressionCompiler.cpp](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/204214f0700179e3d8fa97c77d4f92acd349f015/libsolidity/codegen/ExpressionCompiler.cpp#L1718) seems to be responsible for generating the above code.\r\n\r\nIn the above example, the call in the transaction with 48574 gas succeeds because the amount of available gas before the call is 25709; the subtraction hence underflows and provides an upper limit of `2**256-1` gas to the call.\r\n\r\nWhen the amount of gas for the transaction lies between 48575 and 49388, the internal call runs out of gas because the subtraction no longer underflows and the maximum amount of gas hence lies between 0 and 813, while the call requires at least 814 gas to succeed.\r\n\r\nOnce the amount of gas for the transaction is at least 49389, the internal call succeeds again because now a sufficient amount of gas is supplied for the call even after subtracting 25710.\r\n\r\n#### Suggested fixes\r\n\r\nMost importantly, the behavior of `address.call()` [is undocumented](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/types.html#members-of-addresses). We feel that users should be made aware of this behavior. \r\n\r\nIt is not clear to us what the benefit of retaining 25710 gas in the calling context is. The [comment in ExpressionCompiler.cpp](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/204214f0700179e3d8fa97c77d4f92acd349f015/libsolidity/codegen/ExpressionCompiler.cpp#L1719)\r\n> send all gas except the amount needed to execute \"SUB\" and \"CALL\"\r\n\r\nleads us to believe that `solc` wants to make sure that the maximum amount of gas supplied to the call isn't higher than the amount of gas available in the calling context. However, since the EVM will happily truncate the amount of gas down to what is actually available, this seems unnecessary.\r\n\r\nFinally, if retaining the gas for the calling context is actually desirable, then the underflow issue should be fixed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Attribution\r\n\r\nThis issue was jointly discovered by\r\n- Lorenz Breidenbach\r\n- Phil Daian\r\n- Florian Tramer\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Thanks for the detailed investigation!\r\n\r\nThat particular piece of code originates way before the Tangerine Whistle hardfork which introduced the new rules for gas calculation in messages. Before, one had to make sure that enough gas is left to cover the possible account creation and value transfer fees, after subtracting the message gas. After the fork, due to truncation rules, this is not needed anymore.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-150.md where `compustate.gas` is the actual gas left, `gas` is the argument supplied, `submsg_gas` is the final limit passed to the call and `extra_gas` is the additional required gas. \r\n\r\nThe 25710 comprises of 25000 for possible account creation, 700 for the call and 10 for the cost of PUSH, GAS, SUB.\r\n\r\nIf we consider the last Solidity version to only output Tangerine Whistle compatible code, we could reduce that code path to a single instruction of `GAS`. Otherwise we'd need to introduce a setting to chose the EVM version, such as #1117.",
