  "body": "Depends on https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11703\r\n\r\nCurrently the default settings are still heavy enough that users don't really know if the smtchecker is doing something and it might take a long time until the users see anything. We already disabled overflow/underflow checks by default because those just create too many queries and give the impression it's stuck. However, as @cameel pointed out in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11703, we could do more to make it lighter for the users.\r\n\r\n@cameel suggested an explicit \"light\" mode where no \"unsupported\" warnings would be given, and fewer things would be checked. I think we should rather make the default mode light. So here's my suggestion for the default mode:\r\n\r\n- Compressed \"unproved targets\" warning (already done, 1 warning for all unproved targets, user needs to explicitly say they want the full list)\r\n- Compressed \"unsupported Solidity feature\" warning (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11703)\r\n- Use a low timeout instead of resource limit. Currently we use resource limit as the default to make queries deterministic for the tests. This is rather user unfriendly though. I think we should still have the tests use `rlimit` for determinism, but the default settings should be a low timeout of like 1s per query.",

They could just not pass any value to the compiler when they detect the default.\r\n\r\nOn the compiler side, the way to specify the default currently is to omit the value (`null` might work as well in Standard JSON). I wouldn't be against having a way to specify that explicitly but unfortunately `default` is itself a valid sequence and we lack a good convention for that on the CLI and Standard JSON.\r\n\r\nBy the way, this is off-topic here so I'm going to mark the comments as such not to distract from main point of this issue, which is the light mode for SMTChecker :)",
