We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.\r\n- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:\r\n    - [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)\r\n    - [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)\r\n- Ensure the issue isn't already reported (check `feature` and `language design` labels).\r\n\r\n*Delete the above section and the instructions in the sections below before submitting*\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Abstract\r\n\r\n<!--Please describe by example what problem you see in the current Solidity language and reason about it.-->\r\n\r\nWhen a function doesn't exist in a contract, the contract simply reverts. It's quite frequent that devs jumble up contract addresses while interacting with the contracts (on the client-side), and they just see a `execution reverted` error which might not be helpful for someone in this situation for the first time.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\n<!--In this section you describe how you propose to address the problem you described earlier, including by giving one or more exemplary source code snippets for demonstration.-->\r\n\r\nBut if some data is included (like a 4 bytes selector), it'd help libraries like ethers to show a better error. (related discussion https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/discussions/2958). I understand this would not help with existing deployed contracts but in the long term this might be helpful.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\n<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow any developer to implement the functionality.-->\r\n\r\nSolidity may revert with something like this, instead of no revert data.\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nerror FunctionNotFound();\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nThere should be no issues.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nAll language changes that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity.\r\n\r\nPlease describe how you propose to deal with these incompatibilities.\r\n-->\r\n",
