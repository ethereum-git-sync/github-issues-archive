We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.\r\n- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:\r\n    - [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)\r\n    - [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)\r\n- Ensure the issue isn't already reported (check `feature` and `language design` labels).\r\n\r\n*Delete the above section and the instructions in the sections below before submitting*\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Abstract\r\n\r\n<!--Please describe by example what problem you see in the current Solidity language and reason about it.-->\r\n\r\nWhen a function doesn't exist in a contract, the contract simply reverts. It's quite frequent that devs jumble up contract addresses while interacting with the contracts (on the client-side), and they just see a `execution reverted` error which might not be helpful for someone in this situation for the first time.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\n<!--In this section you describe how you propose to address the problem you described earlier, including by giving one or more exemplary source code snippets for demonstration.-->\r\n\r\nBut if some data is included (like a 4 bytes selector), it'd help libraries like ethers to show a better error. (related discussion https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/discussions/2958). I understand this would not help with existing deployed contracts but in the long term this might be helpful.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\n<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow any developer to implement the functionality.-->\r\n\r\nSolidity may revert with something like this, instead of no revert data.\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nerror FunctionNotFound();\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nThere should be no issues.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nAll language changes that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity.\r\n\r\nPlease describe how you propose to deal with these incompatibilities.\r\n-->\r\n",

If you call a function that does not exist, you should get:\r\n```\r\nContract does not have fallback nor receive functions\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can see all the messages applicable to your code if you request the `--ir` output and look at the `revert_error_...()` functions.\r\n\r\nThe selector is not included, but that's a part of the input, so when you know the reason behind he revert, you should be able to easily get it from the tool, without having to embed that info in the contract. We also have `--revert-strings verboseDebug` variant, where we could include that info, but looks like it was never actually implemented. I think there just wasn't much demand for that.\r\n\r\nThis was added before custom errors were a thing so it uses free-form strings, but I'd say that we should definitely switch to custom errors with well defined codes. That's #11664, which I think should be reopened.",
