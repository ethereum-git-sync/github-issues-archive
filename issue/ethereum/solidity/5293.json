  "body": "Production applications are using upgradeable contract patterns. This includes some models where storage for one contract is shared between multiple logical implementations (`DELEGATECALL`).\r\n\r\nA critical assumption of these implementations is that the storage \"API\" for Solidity is the same between any Solidity versions as long as the variable name is the same.\r\n\r\n# Example:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract Proxy {\r\n    ... a proxy using `DELEGATECALL`\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract Version1 {\r\n    int public meaningOfLife;\r\n    function setMeaningOfLife() external;\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract Version2 {\r\n    int public meaningOfLife;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nDeployment strategy:\r\n\r\n1. Deploy `Proxy`, `Version1` and `Version2`\r\n2. Point `Proxy` to delegate to `Version1` backend implementation\r\n3. Change `Proxy` to delegate to `Version2`\r\n\r\nTest case:\r\n\r\n1. Access `meaningOfLife` on `Proxy`\r\n\r\nExpected outcome:\r\n\r\n* `Version2` implementation accesses the same storage that `Version1` did in the same way\r\n\r\nActual outcome:\r\n\r\n* Undefined by language documentation\r\n\r\n# Work plan\r\n\r\n1. Identify ways that Solidity touches storage\r\n2. Document the way that Solidity translates code which uses storage into user-facing documentation\r\n3. Consider this documentation as part of the \"API\" of Solidity. Any backwards incompatible change to that documentation would be a feature-breaking release and require a major version increase to Solidity.\r\n\r\n# Discussion\r\n\r\nA naive person might think you just sha3(variableName, [class::functionName]) to choose the storage location. If that is the case then we need to document what happen for two contracts that share the same private variable name.\r\n\r\nA naive person might think you just sha3(contractName, [functionName,] variableName). This means that contract names are significant to byte code compilation. This would be surprising.\r\n\r\nIn both cases, this is related to the contract inheritance model because we are considering how private variables will work and if names can be reused.\r\n\r\nREFERENCE: #3729 ",
