  "body": "Currently, solidity doesn't allow defining errors with the following names `Panic` and `Error` (note: name, not signature).\r\n\r\nThere are use cases where reverting with this error would be useful.\r\n\r\nOne example is in library fixed point implementation. When adding two fixed point numbers overflows, then it's useful to revert with `Panic(0x11)` to be consistent with how the compiler would revert in such cases. ([List of error codes](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libsolutil/ErrorCodes.h), or [Docs](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.7/control-structures.html#panic-via-assert-and-error-via-require))\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nPossible solutions\r\n\r\n1. @chriseth suggested allowing something like `import Panic from std.errors`.\r\n2. Allow defining errors with signature `Panic(uint)` and `Error(string)`.\r\n3. Use inline assembly to mimic the error: no need for the compiler to do anything\r\n4. Use a collision hack. Find `<name>(uint)` with the same hash as `Panic(uint)` and similarly for `Error(string)`.",
