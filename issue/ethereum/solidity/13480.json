We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.\r\n- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:\r\n    - [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)\r\n    - [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)\r\n- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.\r\n- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.\r\n\r\n*Delete the above section and the instructions in the sections below before submitting*\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nDuring the assignment in the constructor `f = bar`, \r\nSSTORE to word 0x0 with data as:\r\n0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000004700000101\r\nDuring the assignment in the swap function `f = f == bar ? foo : bar`, \r\nSSTORE to word 0x0 with data as:\r\n0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000013e - first swap\r\n0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000101 - second swap\r\n\r\nThe storage operation on constructor and in function SSTOREs different word.\r\nThe internal storage pointer is 8 bytes, while only 4 bytes is used for the actual bytecode offset.\r\nWhat are the first 4 bytes are used for? \"0x00000047\" in this case.\r\nWhy does the \"0x00000047\" is dropped during the SSTORE inside function calls?\r\n\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version: Version: 0.8.16+commit.07a7930e.Linux.g++\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease provide a *minimal* source code example to trigger the bug you have found.\r\nPlease also mention any command line flags that are necessary for triggering the bug.\r\nProvide as much information as necessary to reproduce the bug.\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n// Some *minimal* Solidity source code to reproduce the bug.\r\n// ...\r\n```\r\n-->\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED\r\npragma solidity 0.8.16;\r\n\r\ncontract Test{\r\n    function() pure returns (string memory) f = bar;\r\n\r\n    function bar() pure private returns (string memory) {\r\n        return \"bar\";\r\n    }\r\n    function foo() pure private returns (string memory) {\r\n        return \"foo\";\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function run() public returns (string memory) {\r\n        return f();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function swap() public {\r\n        f = f == bar ? foo : bar;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\n```",
