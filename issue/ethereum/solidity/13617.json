  "body": "The way `check_style.sh` reports whitespace problems is often confusing to contributors and sometimes even for us. For example in [1184923](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/26748/workflows/45c1a6ca-bb58-40fe-ad72-4cc8681d1cf3/jobs/1184923) from #13595 you can see it mentioning trailing whitespace but the whitespace itself is not visible and the unrelated error at the end (#13616) sometimes makes it hard to see at a glance what the error is about.\r\n\r\n```\r\nError: Trailing whitespace found:\r\ndocs/cheatsheet.rst:37:     - :ref:`Concatenates variable number of arguments to one string array<string-concat>`   \r\ndocs/cheatsheet.rst:39:     - Current block's base fee (`EIP-3198 <https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3198>`_ and `EIP-1559 \r\n...\r\ndocs/cheatsheet.rst:114:   * - ``type(T).min`` (``T``) \r\ndocs/cheatsheet.rst:116:   * - ``type(T).max`` (``T``) \r\nposting error message to github\r\n{\r\n  \"message\": \"Requires authentication\",\r\n  \"documentation_url\": \"https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/issues#create-an-issue-comment\"\r\n}\r\nERROR: Error message does not contain file path.\r\n```\r\nAnother variation of this is mixing tabs and spaces.\r\n\r\nI've seen people being confused by this output on multiple occasions. We should highlight the whitespace problem in some way. Maybe also add some text briefly explaining our style regarding whitespace and telling the user to configure their editor properly.\r\n\r\nFixing this would be a small step towards making external PR reviews smoother.",
