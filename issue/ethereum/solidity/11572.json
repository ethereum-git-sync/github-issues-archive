  "body": "This came up in https://github.com/juanfranblanco/vscode-solidity/issues/256#issuecomment-866259220.\r\n\r\nSome people are getting a stale version of `soljson-latest.js` from https://binaries.soliditylang.org. It's 0.8.5 rather than 0.8.6.\r\n\r\nThe file is served from an S3 bucket with a Cloudfront CDN in front of it (the config is described in https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/pull/47#issuecomment-666447083). Binaries are cached because they are supposed to never change but file lists (i.e. any file matching `*/.list.*`) are exempt from caching.\r\n\r\nWe should probably exempt `soljson-latest.js` and other files that may change content as well. The problem is that these files do get a lot of traffic. For example `bin/soljson-latest.js` got over 200k requests in the last month (98.93% out of which came from cache;  only 1350 were misses). In total 5 TB of traffic for this file alone, all but 30 GB coming from cache. This is the top downloaded file (though a few others are close). So before doing that we need to check how much it will affect the cost. I think the impact might not be that big, since serving from an S3 bucket should be relatively cheap anyway but it's better to check. If the impact turns out to be too big, we might consider invalidating cache for specific files after every update, in the Github Action responsible for mirroring solc-bin instead of disabling cache for all accesses to the file.",

If that's too long, we have to invalidate it manually or disable caching.\r\n\r\nI guess in this case it's also that people were very eager to skip 0.8.5 and get 0.8.6 immediately. Such a delay might not be such a big deal with future updates. Still, I think we might be better off invalidating cache in the sync action anyway.
