It won't really impact anyone in practice.\r\n\r\nI did a code search and I can see [zero results for `string.concat` on sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+lang:Solidity+content:\"string.concat\"&patternType=literal&case=yes).\r\nI also tried a few variants with more relaxed criteria (regex, case inensitive, etc.) to make sure it's not missing any cases and all I could find were some instances of `String.concat`, which must be just a library function attached to a struct. I also searched on github, which gives more messy results but after going through first ~20 pages I did not see any actual use of `string.concat`.",
