  "body": "I am building a contract that has many functions, and potentially could grow to hundreds. This contract is a DAO that could be deployed thousands of times.. it would be ideal to be able to deploy the functions as a library (lets say libdao) and have a very simple 1 liner contract that says 'inherit libdao'  and call it (dao).\n\nCurrently due to gas limits, I may have to break my library into two libraries, thats ok.. so libdao1 and libdao2.  So now my contract dao would say\n\n```\ncontract dao {\n   inherit libdao1\n   inherit libdao2\n}\n```\n\nNow contract dao should have hundreds of accessible functions that can be called.\n\nHowever at the moment I have to create a `passthrough` function for every call and pass it to my library.  Which means i'll probably run out of gas after about 30-40 functions (guessing).\n\nIs there a way to scale a contract?\n\nEdit: Public getters are the worst, to define each return variable and have to manually set each one creates a lot of byte code, would be great to move these into a separate library but at the moment the 'passthrough' creates the same declarations and assignments and uses the same amount of gas trying to call the library.\n\nSo in an ideal scenario, I would have multiple libraries costing maybe 10-20 million gas all up.. but deploying an instance of the dao contract only costing 50k gas.\n\nIts like a runtime import/inherit statement, rather than a compile time one.\n",

Longer numbers are expensive only at deploy time, but not at runtime. The optimizer takes this trade-off into account and lets you specify how often will run it.\n",

    "body": "its not a huge deal.. but it doesn't take much code to bring a contract up to the gas limit. So using libraries was a way to get around the size limitation, but then each library call generates another 20 more bytes and you start to run into contract size issues again.. \n\nTo get around this issue I tried to store the library address in a variable and use library.delegatecall() instead but I don't know how to calculate the function selector, see my other issue https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/688\n\nAnyway, this issue is more feedback that something that needs to be fixed.  Feel free to close the issue.\n",
