  "body": "Hi everyone, i'm glad to follow this forum, it is very helpful.\r\nI'm using truffle to develop contracts and i just found that dynamic arrays are not yet suported, for that reason i was using string arrays with a fixed lenght and i found that the element with index 0 is not showing anything and last one says undefined. do you know ay reason of that?, do i have to get elements in a different way??\r\n\r\nThis is the function in solidity:\r\n\r\n`function getStringArray() public returns (string[])  {\r\n        string[] memory resultStr = new string[](3);\r\n\r\n        resultStr[0] = \"355555555\";\r\n        resultStr[1] = \"2\";\r\n        resultStr[2] = \"8888\";\r\n\r\n       return resultStr;\r\n    }`\r\n\r\nin javascript i test getting elements one by one and i got this:\r\n\r\nlist size=3, value 0=      , 1=355555555, 2=2, 3=undefined\r\n\r\nany idea about what's happening in this case?, how do i have work well with string arrays to get all elements?\r\n\r\n",
