The problem is only in the npm package because `solc-bin` does contain the [0.8.1 binary](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/blob/gh-pages/bin/soljson-v0.8.1+commit.df193b15.js) and if you clone `solc-js` and do `npm install` manually, it downloads the latest version.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I don't have credentials to update the npm package so someone else will have to do it. @chriseth, @axic, @ekpyron?",
