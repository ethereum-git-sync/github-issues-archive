  "body": "We should overhaul our binary release process.\r\n\r\nThere should be a single website that contains all binaries, including the soljson nightly binaries.\r\nIf possible, this website should be built via jekyll on github-pages. Since github-pages has a size limit, the soljson nightly binaries (or at least the older nightly binaries) should be stored via ipfs and the jekyll website should contain http redirects to an ipfs gateway.\r\nThe website should be backwards-compatible with solc-bin.ethereum.org/ (built from https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin ).\r\nThe website should also be fully exposed via ipfs and on a subdomain of solidty.eth via ens.\r\n\r\nIt should contain all the binaries we usually put on a github release page in addition to the files in solc-bin.\r\n\r\nThe nightly binaries should be pushed directly from circleci (preferred) or travis or github actions. If possible, we should avoid storing (even an encrypted) access key on circleci or travis, so maybe github actions is the most viable solution there.\r\n\r\nMaybe we could already prepare for the macos binaries being available for both intel and arm - so maybe we could find a generic scheme like `distribution-buildType-processorArchitecture`.\r\n\r\nWe should also re-add the old nightly builds that were removed here: https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/commit/e134bbaee4d1f0e87ffbcfa27fb072792eada547\r\n\r\nFinally, we should try to add binaries for older versions (especially macos binaries).\r\n\r\ncloses https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9226",

    "body": "I researched our hosting options apart from Github and IPFS.\r\n\r\nHosting nightlies:\r\n- CircleCI could be used to host nightlies for 30 days. They're removed after that. But accessing them requires an API key. [CircleCI > Storing Build Artifacts](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/artifacts/).\r\n- Travis CI can [upload binaries to github releases](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/releases/) but does not host anything by itself.\r\n\r\nHosting binaries outside of github:\r\n- [Bintray](https://bintray.com) offers a free plan for open-source projects but storage is limited to 10 GB.\r\n- [PackageCloud](https://packagecloud.io) offers an open-source plan too but there are no details about quotas. The paid options range from 15 to 250 GB.\r\n- [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net) is still around and does not have any hard limits ([Service Quotas](https://sourceforge.net/p/forge/documentation/Disk%20Quotas/)). But they got bad reputation a few years ago from bundling malware with downloads and other shady things. They seem to have improved since then but still, this might not be the best choice from PR and user trust perspective.\r\n- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) is a whole platform with integrated CI and hosting for websites. It also has free options for open-source projects with a requirement to put their badge on the main project website. They seem targeted at serving whole websites but they provide access to Git LFS. I don't see it stated explicitly but it seems that, unlike Github, they don't put restrictions on serving LFS files over HTTP. At least users link to them from their pages without restrictive rate-limiting or the need for API keys.\r\n- We could upload files to an S3 storage bucket at any cloud provider. AWS/Google Cloud/Azure/etc. It's very possible that something like this is already used for other projects at EF and in that case maybe we could use it too. It's generally not very expensive for the amount of data we need.",

    "body": "### Requirements\r\nFor reference, the requirements [posted by @chriseth on Gitter](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity-dev?at=5ef5e5b9c223cc536a386808):\r\n\r\n> (actually the \"binary\" process)\r\n> - at best travis should not be able to push into solc-bin, everyhing should be done in a pull manner instead, that never overwrites certain files (something that just happened some hours ago actually)\r\n> - we should have a repository of release binaries as a directory than can be stored on ipfs and also delivered via http\r\n> - this repository should contain: soljson wasm and emscripten builds including nightlies. static binaries of various platforms (linux, macos, windows)\r\n> - at some later point, we migth want to create a nice human-targeted html page on top of that, but that is not required for now\r\n> - solc-bin almost does this, but we are hitting a size limit\r\n> - potential solution: When solc-bin is rendered via jekyll to github-pages, we could \"move\" some files somewhere else. For example, assume that someone constantly pins the whole directory on ipfs, then we can have redirects to an ipfs-gateway.\r\n> - pinning to ipfs could again be done in a pull fashion: For example the computer in the office could always have a check out of the repository and serve that via ipfs\r\n> - in addition, we could have an ens name like binaries.solidity.eth point to this ipfs repository\r\n> - we have a weird setup with the \"bytecode comparison\" where travis and appveyor store certain test run outputs in a certain repository. On that repository, there is a job that compares them to see if we have any platform-dependencies. This could be changed into a pipeline-based job on circleci that just runs on each commit.\r\n> - for release builds, I'm fine with manually adding a commit to solc-bin\r\n> - for nightly builds, we colud have a job running as a github job in the solc-bin repository that just somehow fetches the latest artifact from the circleci servers (and maybe performs some sanity checks)\r\n\r\n### Details\r\nThis is the summary of today's discussion with @chriseth:\r\n\r\n#### New process for getting nightlies into `solc-bin`\r\n- Nightlies can be fully automated. We only need manual control for release builds.\r\n    - We prefer a pull mechanism, possibly a Github action. Should run once a day and either fetch things or build them by itself.\r\n    - CI should only be able to add files and modify the lists. It should not be able to modify existing binaries.\r\n- Preferably there should be a github action in `solc-bin` that pulls nightlies from a known location (e.g. CircleCI) rather than let external services push to it.\r\n    - [x] TODO: How granular is their permission model? Check if we can have read access binaries from a Github action.\r\n    - [x] TODO: Check how to get URLs for artifacts from a specific job type.\r\n- If that won't work, We could have them pushed to an S3 bucket on AWS\r\n    - CircleCI builds are already hosted on AWS so that would not be much of a difference.\r\n    - They should be deleted after 30 days. We only need these files stored temporarily before they are pulled into `solc-bin`.\r\n    - The devops team at EF could get us an S3 bucket.\r\n    - In our use case even a free S3 account should be fine. It offers 5 GB of storage. We could get that without bothering the devops team.\r\n        - Problem: Who would be responsible for managing the AWS account?\r\n        - Problem: It's only free for 12 months. See [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/).\r\n- A Github repo is also an alternative. We could store files in a repository (either `solc-bin` or a fresh one).\r\n    - It's only Github Pages that has the 10 GB storage limit. The repository itself is not limited so `solc-bin` is an option too.\r\n    - But a separate repository is better to avoid having to give push access to `solc-bin`.\r\n    - Both Github and AWS are fine as long as there are no arbitrary writes to `solc-bin`. Use whatever is more convenient.\r\n\r\n#### Hosting binaries on IPFS\r\n- My original idea: having CircleCI job that depends on other jobs that build binaries. Then have it create a new IPFS directory with added content and update the IPNS name to point at it.\r\n    - IPNS can be finicky. Also an updated IPNS name can take about a minute before it can be resolved.\r\n- Node in the office can check out the temporary storage every hour and update the files on IPFS.\r\n   - edit by @chriseth: the node would just clone the solc-bin repository and pin it to ipfs\r\n- ENS name is not important right now. We can get one when we're done with everything else.\r\n\r\n#### Serving the binaries\r\n- Finding files on IPFS\r\n    - The address is based on file hash. It can be computed even without any IPFS tools.\r\n    - Redirect addresses from Github Pages will be calculated based on file hashes.\r\n    - `list.json` in `solc-bin` already contains Swarm hashes. We could add IPFS addresses there too. The `update` script should add them.\r\n- We need two `update` scripts. One will only add the latest nightly to the index. The other will recalculate the whole index (just as it happens now). (comment by @chriseth: Since the nightly script needs to re-generate list.json anyway, it is probably better to have a single script just with a switch to tell it whether it should update solc-latest.js or not)\r\n    - The full update script is meant to be run manually.\r\n        - It should pull the release binaries (possibly using CircleCI API), place them in the right directory, recreate the index from scratch.\r\n        - The new content can then be manually reviewed, committed and pushed to `solc-bin`.\r\n- A part of the task is coming up with a new directory structure in `solc-bin` that will accommodate new files.\r\n    - It must be backwards-compatible. All the old URLs must still work. Tools must not break.\r\n        - Tools usually construct URLs based on the JSON files in `solc-bin`. They contain only file names though so the domain and path parts are likely hard-coded in tools.\r\n    - We could use symlinks if we need to change directory names and still preserve the old ones.\r\n        - [x] TODO: Make sure Jekyll won't produce duplicate files that count against GH Pages size limit if we do that.\r\n    - We already have top directories based on platform (`bin/` and `wasm/`) so we could try to extend that convention in some way.\r\n    - Putting new binaries in `bin/` should not be a big problem. But huge directories are a performance problem on most filesystems so some structure would still be desirable.\r\n- Redirects from Github pages to files on IPFS via gateways\r\n    - There are IPFS gateways provided by [Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/distributed-web/ipfs-gateway) and the [IPFS project](https://ipfs.github.io/public-gateway-checker/).\r\n    - [x] TODO: We must ensure that MIME types of the files served through gateways are correct (so that they can be used directly by JS).\r\n        - Chris reports that MIME types are preserved and the files even have CORS headers. This is expected since serving webpages is one of the main use cases for IPFS.\r\n    - [x] TODO: Check if jekyll can make Github Pages redirect to an IPFS gateway from certain URLs.\r\n        - At worst, if redirects work but MIME types do not, we could serve the files ourselves, e.g. via Netlify. That's not the best solution though because then we'd have to pay for bandwidth.\r\n        - Github Pages is under a custom domain (solc-bin.ethereum.org) so in the worst case, if there's no way to make redirects work, we could serve it completely from our own server.\r\n\r\n#### Travis\r\n- All binaries in `solc-bin` are pushed there from Travis. Travis also pushes the binaries to the [release page](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases). And it pushes to the bytecode comparison repo.\r\n    - The weird repo for byte-code comparisons is [solidity-test-bytecode](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity-test-bytecode).\r\n    - Binaries in `solc-bin` must be the exact same binaries as the ones on the release page.\r\n        - Maybe we could have the manual update script check that.\r\n    - In the future, Travis should at most have permissions to the potential CI-`solc-bin` exchange repository and nothing else. Artifacts should be added manually to the github release page and also to `solc-bin` (except for the nightlies).\r\n- We should eventually get Windows builds working on CircleCI to integrate them with this system. It's not too important now though because release builds are going to be uploaded manually anyway.",

    "body": "Actually, I don't think CircleCI should have any part in the release process - all of our builds and tests are run in docker images anyways, so it doesn't matter on which platform they are run. The only advantage of CircleCI is that it's fast, but that's mainly an argument for PRs, not for Releases (which should be safe, reliable and robust, but don't need to be particularly fast).\r\n\r\nWe need to trust github anyways, there's no feasible way around that, but we can reduce whatever we have to trust on top of it.\r\n\r\nSo instead of dealing with permissions for or access to CircleCI, let alone creating AWS instances that introduce even more points of attack in the process, I'd just have github actions build releases and pre-releases, pushing them to a solc-bin-like repo (or alternatively, maybe for releases not nightlies, merely create PRs to it, having the actual release binary branch be branch-protected) and adding them as assets to the github release page as well.\r\n\r\nThe main issue about this is that it should be failure-robust, but that's no argument against having actions (etc) automate this. As long as at any failure of the actions, the failed parts of the process can just be repeated manually, automation makes this *more* robust, not less robust (due to having a dry run on the PR to ``release`` before merging and by preventing human error).\r\n\r\nIn the best case the first step of a release (after preparations on develop) would be creating a PR from develop to release, which would already run all tests and verifications once. Any failure there should be fixed back on develop. Then upon hitting merge to release, the builds and tests are run again, github actions build all binaries, create a release page draft with the required artifacts and create a PR (resp. one PR per platform) to solc-bin adding the binaries.\r\n\r\nAlso, if that's a concern: there should not be much duplication between the setup in github actions and CircleCI for building and testing due to this - we should organize the build and test runs independently of the platform they run on anyways, so we should have scripts in the repo for each step, meant just to be run inside our docker image - so we can just reuse the same scripts on github actions or CircleCI (or whereever we may want to).\r\n\r\nSo much for my opinion about getting the releases both to the github release page and to a repo like solc-bin - publishing further from there to IPFS, or something equivalent to the current gh-pages on top of that, however, is independent of this part.",

    "body": "@ekpyron I don't think we should have server-side automation for the release at all. It is just too prone to failure. My idea ould be that someone with write permission to the repo runs a script locally. This script queries the circleci api for the binaries for a certain tag and downloads them. Then we can test them locally if needed. If everything is fine, we can upload them to the release page and create a commit that adds them to solc-bin. Using automation will save us maybe 30-120 seconds per release if everything goes well, but it costs us at least 30 minutes if something goes wrong.\r\n\r\nThe main server-side automation we need is for the nightly emscripten builds. This nightly build can possibly be created by a github action inside the solc-bin repository (not the solidity repository because it would not be able to easily push to the solc-bin repository) - this is written down at the beginning of the proposal.",

But yeah, the preference is to avoid having any intermediate storage if we can get files from CircleCI easily. And I'm pretty sure we can.\r\n\r\n> Actually, I don't think CircleCI should have any part in the release process\r\n\r\nI do like the idea of automated releases but it's really orthogonal this task. The focus of this task is on `solc-bin` and I'm not really going to touch the build process for releases. I'm going to modify the update script from `solc-bin` to pull them from wherever they're stored (so CircleCI right now; with our without the intermediate repo/S3 bucket). If we ever change the release process to what you proposed, `solc-bin` will only need a small adjustment. @chriseth Maybe it would actually make sense for the `solc-bin` stuff to be performed after a release so that we can just get the release binaries from Github's releases page?\r\n\r\nI am going to move nightly builds from Travis to CircleCI but it's mostly a matter of reusing the jobs that are already there and making them run on daily schedule in addition to PR builds. So not much extra work even if we later decide to move them to Github actions. We can't leave them as is anyway - we either need to debug file truncation on Travis or just sidestep the problem by moving somewhere else.",

    "body": "\r\nI have answers for our questions. Some unfortunately aren't good.\r\n\r\n### Jekyll redirects\r\nUnfortunately github does now allow proper HTTP 3xx redirects from GH pages.\r\n\r\nFrom [Redirects on GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.13/user/articles/redirects-on-github-pages):\r\n\r\n> For the security of our users, GitHub Pages does not support customer server configuration files such as .htaccess or .conf. However, using the Jekyll Redirect From plugin, you can automatically redirect visitors to the updated URL.\r\n\r\n(this is old article about Github Enterprise but, judging by old, dead links that now redirect to [the main help article about Jekyll](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages-and-jekyll), it used to be stated on that page too).\r\n\r\nAnyway, the only supported way to redirect is `HTTP-REFRESH` meta attribute using [jekyll-redirect-from](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-redirect-from) plugin but that does not cut it for us. It's basically a HTML page with the redirect location in it and I don't think it will work for anything except web browsers.\r\n\r\nLooks like our only real option is to point the domain to a small nginx instance and configure it to do the redirects.\r\n\r\n### Symlinks in Jekyll\r\nSymlinks on GH pages do work (see for example https://github.com/s4y/gh-pages-symlink-test). But it looks like they indeed create a copy of the file. I couldn't find it explicitly in [Jekyll docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/options/) (they only say that in safe mode symlinks are ignored) but [this old PR](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/pull/4640/files#diff-7abced14753880bcb80e6dec71706cb6) clearly shows that the files get copied in production mode or in safe mode ([FileUtils.copy_entry()](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.5.1/libdoc/fileutils/rdoc/FileUtils.html#method-c-copy_entry) in Ruby preserves symlinks while `FileUtils.cp()` does not). I haven't tested it yet but I'm pretty sure it will count against the size limit.\r\n\r\n### MIME types in IPFS gateways\r\nFrom [Content Type set by HTTP Gateway #152](https://github.com/ipfs/in-web-browsers/issues/152):\r\n> HTTP Gateway does content-type sniffing based on golang.org/src/net/http/sniff.go and file extension. js-ipfs uses similar setup.\r\n\r\nThe above is a proposal to add a manifest that would allow us to set arbitrary content types. It's not even accepted yet. We cannot set the types ourselves until it gets implemented yet but we can control it to some extent by using the right file extension.\r\n\r\n@chriseth \r\n> it turns out that the ipfs gateway actually does use `text/plain` for our `.js` files :(\r\n> but I heard there might be a workaround, let me try that\r\n> This does not work: https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/Qmad6iesaR5FQ45RRtMrt2Fa1EYDuq1oGoMJJB6beMHESn\r\n\r\nLooks like this is because this object does not have a file name so the gateway falls back to detection based on content. Since the `.js` file is composed mostly of encoded binary data, it thinks it's just plain text. Command-line `file` utility says the same thing.\r\n\r\nThe `ipfs object get` command shows that there are no names in `Links`:\r\n``` bash\r\nipfs object get Qmad6iesaR5FQ45RRtMrt2Fa1EYDuq1oGoMJJB6beMHESn | jq\r\n```\r\n``` json\r\n{\r\n  \"Links\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"Name\": \"\",\r\n      \"Hash\": \"QmXTFox8jc3duxA4snM3zJokR6L1GJSCUE17v8UhAa5XFF\",\r\n      \"Size\": 262158\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"Name\": \"\",\r\n      \"Hash\": \"QmWcXmntJyRn8o6CHBYuPQkop6u6P1P4VLHpYkdLY6CAC3\",\r\n      \"Size\": 262158\r\n    },\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe just need to make sure that we create objects with file names (rather than just unnamed blocks). One possible problem is that I'm not sure if we can get an ID of such an object knowing only the name and the hash of the file.\r\n\r\n### IPFS gateway file size limit\r\nI haven't seen any official information about file size or even bandwith limits for Cloudflare and ipfs.io gateways. I have seen an issue in `go-ipfs` to implement a configuration option to allow limiting file size - so looks like such a limit may not even be implemented in the main client at this point.\r\n\r\n### Getting artifacts from CircleCI and permissions\r\nI see that when you have a link to an artifact you can freely download it without logging in.\r\n\r\nAs for getting the link, there's an [API endpoint for getting links to artifacts of the latest build](https://circleci.com/docs/api/#artifacts-of-the-latest-build). The only complication is that it requires an API token. For the script you run manually, you'd have to get your personal token from CircleCI once and then always specify it as a parameter (or we could make the script fetch it from a local config file). For nightlies we'd have to add the token as a secret in repository settings (see [Creating and storing encrypted secrets](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets)).",

    "body": "Maybe it's easier to discuss this in the call later, but for the record:\r\n\r\n>     * Create a Github action to pulls `solcjson.js` nightlies into `solc-bin` from CircleCI. Remove the nightly job from Travis.\r\n\r\nI still think there should rather be a github action in the solidity repo that builds, tests and pushes releases to `solc-bin` (I read somewhere, that that won't work, but I think that's wrong and it will work, if we use some github auth tokens - and I don't see harm or danger in storing github credentials on github, since github has access anyways...).\r\n\r\nMy reasoning for this is that we have to trust github anyways, but there's no need to additionally trust CircleCI. If github is compromised, it can just serve the wrong code to CircleCI, so nothing we can do about it - but if github is fine and CircleCI is compromised, we have a problem, if we build releases there - and that can easily be avoided.\r\nAlso I'd argue that other than regular PR test runs, it doesn't matter if release test runs are slightly slower (which would be the only argument against running them in github actions I can think of).\r\n\r\nMaybe this also relates to the other point:\r\n> Add a CI check on PRs in solc-bin to make sure that the committed binaries match the ones on the release page in solidity repo.\r\n\r\nThat depends on how the binaries on the release page are built. For emscripten builds this will be fine, but I'm not sure the other builds will be reproducible just yet, so I'm not sure they will be identical. We'd at least need to check this first - we may have reproducible binaries if built with the same script in the same docker image, but we also may not.\r\n\r\nSo in general I'm still not a fan of using CircleCI and artifacts on it for anything release-related or even for the nightlies for that matter. I'd be fine with doing it, if you all want to - I don't want to block this :-) - but I'm saying it's easily avoided and I'd argue for avoiding it :-).\r\n\r\nEDIT: But yeah - in general I'm pretty fine with *any* working solution to 2. (resp. 3.), although I'd tend to prefer to avoid cloud stuff and to have things primarily on IPFS - or at least something that can be easily migrated towards that.\r\nHowever, I'm not that satisfied with 1. yet :-).",

But since then I've noticed that github has a feature for adding encrypted secrets in repo settings so maybe that was just some old workaround that's no longer relevant...\r\n\r\nAnother issue with tokens is that they're something that could leak if not secured properly - any solution where secrets do not have to be explicitly passed around is an advantage in my book. \r\n\r\n> For emscripten builds this will be fine, but I'm not sure the other builds will be reproducible just yet, so I'm not sure they will be identical.\r\n\r\nRight now @chriseth wants release binaries to be uploaded manually so it's easy to ensure that they're the same. Just upload the same files to both places :) This would be just a sanity check to ensure you did just that.\r\n\r\nAnd if we automate publishing releases, I think it would just be a matter of having the same CI job upload both to `solc-bin` and to the release page.",

That way I'd argue this will be *more* reliable than doing things manually (the fact that we're considering a CI job to check, if we messed things up manually kind of confirms that...)",

    "body": "Here's a summary of what we discussed today. I'm not sure I got it all unfortunately. Also, if something is wrong, please correct me.\r\n\r\n**tl;dr**: In this task we'll continue with S3, manual releases and getting binaries from CircleCI. We may automate releases later, as a separate task.\r\n\r\n1. Downsides of having to store tokens\r\n    - We need to always be careful with external PRs to make sure they can't exfiltrate the tokens that would allow modifying releases.\r\n    - Tokens are usually not granular enough and give too much access.\r\n2. @ekpyron's idea: separate `release` and `nightly` branches in `solc-bin`, with `release` being protected.\r\n    - That would make things more complicated.\r\n    - We want to host things as a single directory. Having separate branches makes naming conflicts possible.\r\n3. Automated releases\r\n    - One of the things that could go wrong and break things is the wrong tag being generated. This could result in one of the older releases being overwritten.\r\n    - Even draft releases automatically produce tags.\r\n    - Manual releases worked fine so far. Automating them may be the next step for @ekpyron. In this task I'm going to assume they're still manual. (Edit by @ekpyron: well what worked fine so far was automating using auth tokens in appveyor and travis - the process hasn't been manual before :-))\r\n    - We should migrate off Travis and AppVeyor. They only reasons we still use them over CircleCI or Github actions are Windows builds and the fact that Travis already has the tokens.\r\n4. CircleCI API\r\n    - I can get binaries from CircleCI with a few lines of `curl` and `jq` commands. It's not perfect but should be good enough for us.\r\n        - The current API (v1.1) does not allow filtering by job name. All we can do is to get 100 latest jobs from a branch (max 100) and hope that the job we want is among them.\r\n        - [CircleCI API v2.0](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/api-intro/) lets us filter by job name but is still not stable and (in my limited experiments) I haven't found a way to use it without a token yet.\r\n        - API v1.1. will stop being supported at some point in the future:\r\n\r\n            > CircleCI expects to eventually End-Of-Life (EOL) API v1.1 in favor of API v2 as more API v2 endpoints are announced as stable. Further guidance on when CircleCI API v1.1 will be discontinued will be communicated at a future date.\r\n5. File lists and naming scheme\r\n    - File lists can get pretty big (ours is 0.3 MB but the one of go-ethereum is already 8 MB). We may want to have a separate one for each platform not to make them even bigger. The list that contains only releases won't be all that big.\r\n    - For releases, it might be possible to construct their URLs without a list but it would be pretty cumbersome so we prefer to have a list.\r\n6. IPFS\r\n    - Having to include the file name in query parameters to get the right content type header seems fragile. It would be better to have IPFS directories with file names in them instead.\r\n    - Maybe IPFS should be the primary source but people unfortunately aren't using it much yet other than via HTTP gateways.\r\n7. S3 vs CDN\r\n    - We'll go with S3 rather than a CDN for now.\r\n    - We want a CI job that would ping a function on AWS Lambda when new content is added to `solc-bin` so that it gets pulled in.",

    "body": "There are some things that need further discussion. Maybe we need another call (not urgent though - none of this is a blocker for me at this point). Below I gathered the main issues from my discussion with @ekpyron on Gitter, with relevant quotes, for later reference.\r\n\r\n1. We need a final decision on eventually replacing manual releases with an action that generates PRs. We agreed not to do it in this task but do we want it in the long term?\r\n\r\n    @ekpyron \r\n    > My favorite solution for that would be to have a action in the solidity repo run on commits to the release branch and create a PR to solc-bin. But as far as I remember we decided to have no automation for releases for the time being and create manual PRs to solc-bin for now. However, we should probably talk with @chriseth about it again... especially the need to have a local checkout of solc-bin and run the update script to create such a PR would annoy me, but so far @chriseth always does all of this anyways, so...\r\n\r\n2. Last time we decided to disable github pages from `solc-bin` once we switch to S3. But maybe we should freeze the `gh-pages` branch instead and keep it for some time so that tools relying on the github domain rather than `solc-bin.ethereum.org` keep working? Even `solc-js` uses it. If so, for how long?\r\n\r\n    @cameel\r\n    > How about \"freezing\" the gh-pages branch so that it keeps working indefinitely and only adding new binaries in a new branch started off it?\r\n    > I have already created a master branch just for that purpose (I mentioned it in the PR).\r\n\r\n    @ekpyron \r\n    > Hm... we should discuss those details with @chriseth and maybe actually even with remix and truffle and whoever mostly pulls the binaries from there...\r\n    > But yeah - if we move away from github pages... but we keep the github pages that exist frozen as they are now... then that satisfies all backwards compatibility we need...\r\n\r\n    @ekpyron \r\n    > Even https://github.com/ethereum/solc-js/blob/master/downloadCurrentVersion.js fetches the lists from github... which we by the way should really change...\r\n    > Yeah... we might have to keep pushing the binaries to gh-pages at least until 0.7...\r\n    > After that we could book it as part of a breaking change in solc-js...\r\n\r\n3. Do we want to keep the symlinks indefinitely or are we ok with changing the schema at some point?\r\n\r\n    @ekpyron\r\n    > Yeah - a reason for a lot of the symlinks in the repo is fear of breaking hardcoded URLs... but those will probably point to github.io anyways... so less need for backwards compatibility if we migrate to a new URL anyhow...\r\n\r\n4. Serving brotli-compressed files on IPFS could considerably speed up loading of these binaries in the browser directly from IPFS. This might encourage tool developers to use it. Is it worth our effort?\r\n\r\n    @ekpyron \r\n    > I wonder whether we should also pin a brotli-compressed version to IPFS... I'd expect that way fetching it with an in-browser ad-hoc IPFS node could reduce to just a few seconds, at least once it's spread a bit... and maybe we could actually promote that and have people try doing that - in the end it's way cooler than any other means of hosting it :-) (although undoubtedly we will need other means in the midterm anyhow).\r\n\r\n    @ekpyron\r\n    > Yeah - not sure if it's worth putting a huge amount of effort in it, because I'm not sure how many people would end up using it :-). But personally I'd like to support and promote IPFS - it's just way cooler than any other hosting options :-).\r\n\r\n5. Is it ok to slightly change the naming scheme for new nightlies? I think that leading zeros would make dates look a bit more like dates:\r\n\r\n    `v0.6.11-nightly.2020.7.3+commit.0ac039e4` vs `v0.6.11-nightly.2020.07.03+commit.0ac039e4`",

    "body": "Note from gitter discussion this morning:\r\nOnce we tackle windows builds we should:\r\n1. Decide which binaries go into the archive - soltest.exe doesn't really make sense - the upgrade tool on the other hand might...\r\n2. Figure out whether we can build without depending on Visual Studio C++ Redistributable runtimes (msvcp*.dll).\r\n    Might not be possible. Regarding @chriseth's question earlier: \"Why does that work for geth?\" - the answer is probably: go isn't C++... AFAIK it's possible, but strongly discouraged to replace those dlls with something static - we'd have to check whether the reasons for that discouragement apply to us.\r\nThe github action windows build in https://github.com/ekpyron/solidity/pull/12 just let's cmake decide what dlls to package, that's also an option.",

    "body": "@chriseth Looks like having a mirroring script on AWS CodeBuild triggered by pushes to `solc-bin` would require giving AWS admin access to webhooks in `solc-bin` and for some reason also write access to the repo. Also, to all the private repos of anyone who adds the app. So that's no go.\r\n\r\nThe other choices are AWS Lambda and GH actions:\r\n- **Pro AWS Lambda**: A lambda has [75 GB of disk storage available](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-limits.html) while [github only provides runners with 14 GB disks](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/virtual-environments-for-github-hosted-runners#supported-runners-and-hardware-resources) and according to [this post on the github community forum](https://github.community/t/bigger-github-hosted-runners-disk-space/17267/9) only 10 GB of it is guaranteed to be available. We might start running out of space at some point.\r\n- **Pro AWS Lambda**: Pulling data from AWS Lambda would not require any credentials. Pushing data to the bucket from a GH action would require adding an AWS token with write access to the S3 bucket to settings of `solc-bin` repo.\r\n- **Pro GH actions**: AWS role credentials I've been using so far expire after an hour. I'd have to find a way to get a long-lived token.\r\n- **Pro GH actions**: Probably quicker to set up for me (both should be relatively easy but I have never used AWS Lambda before while I did use GH actions).\r\n- **Pro GH actions**: A push script could be tested and debugged locally which would also make working on it easier.\r\n- **Pro GH actions**: Using git on AWS Lambda is doable but feels like a hack. That's why I wanted to use CodeBuild instead. No problem with that in GH actions.\r\n- **Pro GH actions**: We'll need a small GH action to trigger AWS Lambda anyway, so we might just as well do it all on GH actions.\r\n- **Pro GH actions**: We're already using it so there's less of an entry barrier if someone else needs to tweak it afterwards. We'd basically be using S3 as dumb storage rather than as an active element that pull stuff on its own.",
