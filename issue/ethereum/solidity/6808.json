  "body": "## Abstract\r\n\r\nCurrently, we rely on interpreter trace for comparing the \"output\" of pre and post optimized yul code, asserting that they are the same. \"Output\" concretely refers to interpreter (execution) trace.\r\n\r\n#6798 removes side-effect free statements such as `sload`, `mload`, `gas`, `keccak256` etc. from the interpreter trace to re-enable differential fuzzing post merge of #6746 \r\n\r\nPost memory optimization (see #6727 #6728 ), we can no longer rely on interpreter trace because memory instructions can be optimized out.\r\n\r\nMemory and storage side-effects must be conveyed through state dumps (see #6800 ). Once #6800 is merged, we must remove memory related information from interpreter state.\r\n\r\nThis issue traces support for removing memory related information from interpreter trace such as\r\n\r\n- `mstore`\r\n- `sstore`\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nI think these lines can be deleted at least, code refactoring may be necessary.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/a86a88f1233bd2049770a91aa917ccf031fa1406/test/tools/yulInterpreter/EVMInstructionInterpreter.cpp#L286\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/a86a88f1233bd2049770a91aa917ccf031fa1406/test/tools/yulInterpreter/EVMInstructionInterpreter.cpp#L485\r\n\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nTBD",
