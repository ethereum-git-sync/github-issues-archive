Here is the repo: https://github.com/miquelcabot/eth-bsc-bridge\r\nI tried changing the values in TOKENBSC.SOL and TOKENETH.SOL as you can see in the code but no matter whatever the values i change to they dont seem to reflect when deployed..Perhaps i am doing it wrong (as i am naive to solidity) . Hope to get a quick fix for this.\r\n\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2021-12-25 184638](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67141555/147455581-ad17b3db-c406-4caa-a510-9aa4453e4c6f.png)\r\n![2021-12-25 18 46 33 rinkeby etherscan io d8df0f2c420e](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67141555/147455586-fe9bddb0-5a0a-49a3-b1c9-71fce128472b.png)\r\n\r\n",
