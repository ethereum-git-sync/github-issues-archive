  "body": "I think it would be nice to have somehow a tool that could visualize compiler internals. If once ready, the tool could be used to teach about how the compiler actually works and it will also be useful for debugging compiler bugs.\r\n\r\nThe idea would be to have at first a simple Solidity/Yul editor with syntax highlighting, after that all current provided debugging information and compiler outputs should be somehow visualized. Additionally it would be great to also visualize things, that we are currently not really exporting, e.g. optimiser code transformations, whiskers template instantiations (being able to see from where exactly (in our C++ code) a parameter of a template was set) etc. This could be done by extending the compiler to export the needed information.\r\n\r\nI know that all this is quite a big effort, but I would say it would be very helpful in general. It will improve the code quality of the solidity compiler - because we need to see the compiler from a slightly different perspective. This tool will help us to communicate used algorithms and concepts, where it would also support us to investigate compiler bugs.\r\n\r\n**I created this issue to collect possible feedback on such tool in general. What is your opinion?**\r\n\r\nSee #13393.",
