  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nYul code code compiled by latest solc 0.8.21 cannot be deployed by reth / anvil / goerli. I first found the problem while working with halo2-lib, which uses reth under the hood to run Yul verification. When I couldn't make it work, I tried deploying using `foundry`, forking `foundry-yul` repo. Deplyoment worked neither in test environment (anvil) nor on Goerli. After switching to 0.8.15 solc using `svm`, everything worked just fine.\r\n\r\nI created a repo to reproduce this: https://github.com/akalmykov/foundry-yul\r\n\r\nNote that it uses `--ffi` to call `solc`, so take a look at the source code executing.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version: 0.8.21 and 0.8.15\r\n- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): default, no additional settings\r\n- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Foundry\r\n- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: Anvil/Reth/Goerli\r\n- Operating system: Ubuntu 22\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n- Clone https://github.com/akalmykov/foundry-yul\r\n- Switch to 0.8.21: `svm use 0.8.21`\r\n- Run `forge test`: `[FAIL. Reason: Setup failed: YulDeployer could not deploy contract] setUp() (gas: 0)`\r\n- Switch to 0.8.15: `svm use 0.8.15`\r\n- Run `forge test`: `[PASS] testExample() (gas: 6883)`\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same error can be reproduced by Goerli deployment. This works:\r\n```sh\r\nsvm use 0.8.15\r\nforge script script/Deploy.sol:Deploy --rpc-url https://ethereum-goerli.publicnode.com --broadcast --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY> --ffi\r\n\r\n✅  [Success]Hash: 0x33fed28b40525accdbb9a8e1158b93b0bd842bf8e34879432751faf05b6b2580\r\nContract Address: 0x166902beE28AD9F380dD0D1b10dC292D9a9F572e\r\nBlock: 9652762\r\nPaid: 0.00016607400055358 ETH (55358 gas * 3.00000001 gwei)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this fails:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nsvm use 0.8.21 \r\nforge script script/Deploy.sol:Deploy --rpc-url https://ethereum-goerli.publicnode.com --broadcast --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY> --ffi\r\n\r\nNo files changed, compilation skipped\r\nTraces:\r\n  [397935] → new Deploy@0x5b73C5498c1E3b4dbA84de0F1833c4a029d90519\r\n    └─ ← 1877 bytes of code\r\n\r\n  [9079256848778921037] Deploy::run() \r\n    ├─ [0] VM::ffi([bash, -c, cast abi-encode \"f(bytes)\" $(solc --yul yul/Example.yul --bin | tail -1)]) \r\n    │   └─ ← 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000146009600b5f3960095ff3fe5f35608052366080f3000000000000000000000000\r\n    ├─ [0] VM::broadcast() \r\n    │   └─ ← ()\r\n    ├─ [6] → new <Unknown>@0x1E3742019B621CF2981225aB8D9D36c9176a1778\r\n    │   └─ ← 0 bytes of code\r\n    └─ ← \"YulDeployer could not deploy contract\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nContract byte codes for two solc versions:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsvm use 0.8.15\r\nsolc --yul --bin yul/Example.yul \r\n\r\n======= yul/Example.yul (EVM) =======\r\n\r\nBinary representation:\r\n600a600d600039600a6000f3fe600035608052366080f3\r\n\r\nsvm use 0.8.21 \r\nsolc --yul --bin yul/Example.yul \r\n\r\n======= yul/Example.yul (EVM) =======\r\n\r\nBinary representation:\r\n6009600b5f3960095ff3fe5f35608052366080f3\r\n```",

    "body": "On v0.8.21 `--evm-version shanghai` is the default. On that version we emit code that makes use of the `PUSH0` opcode (`0x5f`) that was not available in earlier versions. Deployment will naturally fail if you try to do it on a chain that runs an earlier EVM version.\r\n\r\nSo the question is: does Goerli run a `shanghai` EVM? I remember that in March the Shanghai upgrade was performed there (successfully), but looking at https://github.com/eth-clients/goerli now it says that the EVM version is `london`. Has it been reset in the meantime?\r\n\r\nIn any case, this does not look like a bug in the compiler. If you deploy somewhere with an earlier EVM version, you can request compatible bytecode using the `--evm-version` option.",
