  "body": "**Short description:**\r\nWhen packed with another state variable in the same slot an enum-type variable reads 0 despite having different value.\r\n\r\n**Solidity version:** 0.8.23\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce:**\r\n\r\n1. Create empty hardhat project\r\n2. Put attached solidity files\r\n3. Run the script 'scripts/deploybug.js'\r\n4. Observe how the value of the variable is equal to 0 , this is incorrect, the value returned should be 2\r\n5. Uncomment line 8 in ContractA.sol, comment line 7 in ContractA.sol , comment the constructor (lines 13,14,15) (i.e. remove the constrtuctor with Ownable super call), compile and run\r\n6. Observe how the value of the variable is equal to 2 (the correct behavior, no bugs)\r\n\r\n**Long description:**\r\nBecause when using `Ownable` in ContractA, the variable of the owner address is inherited from the parent contract.  At the same time we have the first variable (curType) and the owner address both packed into slot0 of the storage. The EVM stores and reads the data correctly, it is at Solidity side where the problem occurs, it fails to extract the value from the slot (i.e unpack the variable of enum type).\r\n\r\n**Notes:** \r\n1. I don't know if this bug is DELEGATECALL-specific, I just had this setup in my project, so I reproduced the same use case with minimal code (maybe this bug will be present without DELEGATECALL , a test is needed )\r\n2. I added return at the end of `doSomething()` so you can easily verify the bug for presence with `debug.traceTransaction()`\r\n\r\nHere is the trace call with `hardhat-tracer` where you can observe that `doSomething()` returns 0  (first line) while the last SLOAD actually returns 02 (the rightmost byte at last line):\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n[CALL] ContractA(0x5fbdb2315678afecb367f032d93f642f64180aa3).doSomething() → (0)\r\n   [SLOAD]  0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 → 0x000000000000000000000000e7f1725e7734ce288f8367e1bb143e90bb3f0512\r\n   [DELEGATECALL] ContractB(0xe7f1725e7734ce288f8367e1bb143e90bb3f0512).executeSomething()\r\n      [SLOAD]  0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 → 0x000000000000000000000000f39fd6e51aad88f6f4ce6ab8827279cfffb92266\r\n      [SSTORE] 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 ← 0x000000000000000000000000f39fd6e51aad88f6f4ce6ab8827279cfffb92202\r\n   [SLOAD]  0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 → 0x000000000000000000000000f39fd6e51aad88f6f4ce6ab8827279cfffb92202\r\n```\r\n   \r\n   For easier reproduction I have hardhat project already prepared at this repository, just download and run:\r\n[ https://github.com/nuliknol/SolBug/tree/main]( https://github.com/nuliknol/SolBug/tree/main )\r\n\r\nFiles: \r\n\r\n**1.

    "body": "It's not a bug, The behavior you're showing is correct. I think your expectations about how delegatecall works are incorrect.\r\n\r\nWhen you delegatecall `ContractB.executeSomething()` it will write to the location of its `curType` variable, which is slot 0. In a delegate call its storage is simply mapped to `ContractA`'s storage space (i.e. instead of reading/writing `ContractB`'s slot N, you read/write `ContractB`'s slot N). `ContractB`'s bytecode is executed on that remapped storage space. Variable names do not matter.\r\n\r\nThat's because when `ContractB` is compiled, all its bytecode knows is that it's supposed to write to a variable located in slot 0. The knowledge of what the variable was called is not preserved and it is not in any way remapped to match the location of a similarly named variable in `ContractA`. It just writes to slot 0, which, in `ContractA`'s storage space, happens to be variable holding the owner address.",

    "body": "Well, I still think that the behavior is correct, but looks like I misinterpreted why you're expecting to see 2 there. You do correctly account for the behavior of delegatecall, but I think you're missing a small detail of how variables are laid out.\r\n\r\nAs stated in [Layout of State Variables in Storage](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/internals/layout_in_storage.html), the `curType` variable gets packed into a single slot with the inherited `owner` variable as you correctly observed. But the other relevant point is:\r\n\r\n> - The first item in a storage slot is stored lower-order aligned.\r\n\r\nI.e. variables in a storage slot are placed from right to left and the slot is padded on the left. Which means that in the layouts seen by `ContractA` and `ContractB` `curType` actually does end up in the same slot but at different offsets. Below is an illustration of how both contracts see the storage at the point when the value is being returned.\r\n\r\n`ContractA`'s layout:\r\n```\r\n        ----------------------TTOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\r\nslot 0  000000000000000000000000f39fd6e51aad88f6f4ce6ab8827279cfffb92202\r\n        ------------------------EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE\r\nslot 1  000000000000000000000000e7f1725e7734ce288f8367e1bb143e90bb3f0512\r\n```\r\n\r\n`ContractB`'s layout:\r\n```\r\n        ----------------------EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEETT\r\nslot 0  000000000000000000000000f39fd6e51aad88f6f4ce6ab8827279cfffb92202\r\n        ----------------------------------------------------------------\r\nslot 1  000000000000000000000000e7f1725e7734ce288f8367e1bb143e90bb3f0512\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the above the `OO` bytes belong to `owner`, `TT` to `curType` and `EE` to `executor`. `--` bytes are unallocated space.\r\n\r\nIf you compile the contracts and look at the IR output (specifically `--ir-optimized --optimize`, unoptimized is more verbose, but still equivalent), you'll see that `ContractA` is not reading the rightmost byte and somehow returning it wrong. It's reading a byte that's to the left of `owner` and really has a value of 0:\r\n```yul\r\nlet value_2 := and(shr(160, sload(0)), 0xff)\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet me know if you still think there's something wonky happening, but after looking at it, I'm still pretty confident that the generated code is behaving correctly.",
