Here's what we agreed on so far:\r\n- Currently [our CI config forces a release build with `FORCE_RELEASE: ON`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/v0.8.13/.circleci/config.yml#L782-L786). This should be changed so that release jobs create a source archive using `git archive` and build a release from that.\r\n- We want to eventually have a ninja build job (#12707). This would also be a good way to test the other mechanism for building a release - based on tags.\r\n- We should have a job for testing the PPA builds as well (from a source archive).",
