  "body": "## Abstract\r\n\r\nUsing `abi.encodeCall` for encoding errors fails with error\r\n```\r\nError (3509): Expected regular external function type, or external view on public function. Cannot use errors for abi.encodeCall.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to have a `abi.encodeError` that works similarly to `abi.encodeCall`, but for custom errors.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nBoth functions and error include a `.selector` getter that returns the `bytes4` \"signature\". In the case of a function selector, this can be used, along with `abi.encodeWithSelector` to generate the bytes corresponding to a function call. Similarly, `abi.encodeWithSelector` can be used to encode a custom error.\r\n\r\n`abi.encodeCall` is a safer alternative that verifies the type and number or arguments at compile type. While `abi.encodeCall` works well with functions, it does not currently support errors.\r\n\r\nBeing able to generate the bytes corresponding to custom errors can be particularly usefull for testing with Foundry.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nGiven a custom error\r\n```solidity\r\nerror SomeErrorName(address arg0, uint256 arg1, bytes4 arg2, bytes32 arg3);\r\n```\r\n\r\nEnable the syntax\r\n```solidity\r\nabi.encodeError(SomeErrorName, (arg0, arg1, arg2, arg3));\r\n```\r\nthat returns the same as\r\n```solidity\r\nabi.encodeWithSelector(SomeErrorName.selector, arg0, arg1, arg2, arg3);\r\n```\r\nwith the same type checking as `abi.encodeCall`\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nNone. This is introducing a new syntax that doesn't conflict with existing ones.",
