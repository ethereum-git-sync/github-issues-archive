In 0.8.5 we fixed a bunch of bugs related to unimplemented modifiers and functions (#11468, #11445). There was also #11506 which is fixed too but the fix will be a part of 0.8.7.\r\n\r\nCan you check if it still crashes for you on 0.8.6 (or, preferably on the latest nightly version if possible)?\r\n\r\nIf it still happens on 0.8.6 we could investigate further but we'd need some code to be able to replicate this.",

    "body": "@noobshow I'm trying to understand your example but I cannot reproduce the error with that on 0.8.4. I'd like to reproduce it to make sure the problem is indeed fixed.\r\n\r\nFrom what you posted I gather that your hierarchy looks something like this?\r\n```solidity\r\ninterface ISmartContract1 {\r\n    function balanceOf() external view;\r\n}\r\ninterface IMainSmartContract {\r\n    function balanceOf() external view;\r\n}\r\ncontract SmartContract1 {\r\n    function balanceOf() external view virtual {}\r\n}\r\ncontract MainSmartContract is SmartContract1, ISmartContract1, IMainSmartContract {\r\n    function balanceOf() external view override(ISmartContract1, IMainSmartContract, SmartContract1) {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs `SmartContract1` supposed to inherit from one of the interfaces? Because if it's not, you cannot use `override` on its `balanceOf()` as in your description.\r\n\r\nI think I must be getting it wrong because this does not cause a crash for me. It would if you used `super` (like in #11445) but it would produce an error at a different location in the code. It would make sense if adding a modifier would make it crash but adding one on `MainSmartContract.balanceOf()` does not make it crash either.\r\n\r\nSo could you adjust this snippet to reproduce your error?\r\n\r\n> So, i had to remove the definition from the IMainSmartContract, then make IMainSmartContract inherit it directly from ISmartContract1 to get the problem solved\r\n\r\nThat's a good workaround but I think an even simpler one would work. The problem that's causing the crash is likely just the order in which you inherit. A more sensible order would be `is ISmartContract1, IMainSmartContract, SmartContract1` because then all the interfaces would go before contracts that implement them. The way you did it, however, results in a linearized order where `super.balanceOf()` inside `SmartContract1.balanceOf()` would call `IMainSmartContract.balanceOf()`, which has no body. While weird, it's still allowed - `super` should skip over a function without a body - it's just that the compiler was not handling that corner case correctly (this was the bug in #11445).\r\n\r\nSo I'm not yet sure how he crash worked exactly in your case but I think that the problem would disappear if you used the  inheritance order that does not produce this corner case (i.e. `is ISmartContract1, IMainSmartContract, SmartContract1`).",
