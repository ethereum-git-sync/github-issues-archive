  "body": "It is currently possible to override a modifier with one that has no implementation. Doing this with functions is forbidden. An attempt to invoke such a modifier results in an ICE:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract B {\r\n    modifier m() virtual { _; }\r\n}\r\nabstract contract C is B {\r\n    modifier m() virtual override;\r\n}\r\ncontract D is C {\r\n    function f() m public {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```\r\nInternal compiler error during compilation:\r\n/solidity/libsolidity/ast/AST.h(1054): Throw in function const solidity::frontend::Block& solidity::frontend::ModifierDefinition::body() const\r\nDynamic exception type: boost::wrapexcept<solidity::langutil::InternalCompilerError>\r\nstd::exception::what:\r\n[solidity::util::tag_comment*] =\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think this should be forbidden like it is for functions. Even then, however, it will still be possible to define an unimplemented modifier by sandwiching it between two implemented ones (see #11445) and then invoke it by qualifying it with the name of the contract where it has no implementation - this should probably be forbidden too.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n- Compiler version: 0.8.4\r\n- Operating system: Arch Linux",
