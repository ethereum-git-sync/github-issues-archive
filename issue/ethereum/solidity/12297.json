  "body": "Especially  with generics ( https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/869 ) it might get more important to allow the definition of functions inline. There has also been a proposal to have `require()` take a custom error, and due to the evaluation rules, it might be an option to take a function that returns an error as the second parameter.\r\nBoth use-cases demand a shorthand notation to define inline functions like we have in python or rust.\r\nProposal:\r\n\r\nThe expression `(Param...) => Expression` evaluations to an internal function type that returns the value of the expression. The return type of the function is the type of the expression.\r\nThis can be shortened to `=> Expression` if the parameters are empty.\r\n\r\nIf we want to allow full code blocks like in `(Param...) => { ... }`, we need explicit return statements and probably also return variables to be specified explicitly.\r\n\r\nCapturing of local variables is a whole other problem.",

    "body": "I like the idea of something like `require(c, => CustomError())`. It's close enough to `require(c, CustomError())` but also has enough extra syntax not to hide the fact that the second argument is lazily evaluated.\r\n\r\nAs for blocks vs single expression - personally I think that inline functions are best used for very concise one-liners and, if we exclude capturing variables, anything else should really be just a regular function definition with a good name. For example in C++ I find code peppered with long inline functions to be less readable than one with proper functions. As a bonus, not supporting statements would let us drop the `return` and make them even more concise (this is something that really bothers me about them in C++).",
