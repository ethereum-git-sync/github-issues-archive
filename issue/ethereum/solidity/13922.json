We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.\r\n- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:\r\n    - [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)\r\n    - [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)\r\n- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.\r\n- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.\r\n\r\n*Delete the above section and the instructions in the sections below before submitting*\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\n<!--Please shortly describe the bug you have found, and what you expect instead.-->\r\n\r\nRunning `solc --yul`  on a yul file throws the following error on every instances where `iszero()` function is used:\r\n```\r\nError: Function \"iszero\" not found.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version: 0.8.18+commit.87f61d96.Linux.g++\r\n- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): paris\r\n- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): foundry\r\n- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: foundry\r\n- Operating system: ubuntu 20.04\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nobject \"Sample\" {\r\n    code {\r\n        datacopy(0, dataoffset(\"runtime\"), datasize(\"runtime\"))\r\n        return(0, datasize(\"runtime\"))\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    object \"runtime\" {\r\n         code {\r\n             requires(iszero(callvalue()))\r\n\r\n            function requires(condition) {\r\n                if iszero(condition) { revert(0, 0) }\r\n             }\r\n         }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCompilation of the above contract will throw these errors\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40036742/216346012-453764b5-ac1e-47b1-916d-1a231a3d4836.png)",
