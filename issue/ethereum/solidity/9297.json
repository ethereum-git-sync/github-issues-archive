  "body": "@frangio first reported that the loading times of soljson.js in node-js increased significantly between 0.6.8 and 0.6.9 (along with the size increase due to adding Z3). This indeed seems to be the case for node 10, which has quite high loading times in general.\r\n\r\nWe probably don't need to care too much about node 10, which is rather old by now - but node > 10 has an even weirder issue.\r\n\r\nSome benchmarks by @frangio https://gist.github.com/frangio/e70e524e3357ea143df77b7d3197c0a7\r\n\r\nApparently neither loading the file, nor compiling it, nor executing it is what actually causes the slow execution. At least I personally would be fine with the increase from 200ms to 600ms there, because it's still \"fast enough\" - but apparently *exiting* the node-js process causes a significant delay and 2.5 vs 7.3 seconds is really not nice, especially if it looks like it *could* just be ~200ms and the rest is wasted process shutdown time.\r\n",
