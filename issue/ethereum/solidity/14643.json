    "body": "Okay, but that's a bit different and broader than the original issue so I think it would still be better to open a new one specifically about that if you're interested in pursuing it. Here the title and the description go into detail about the original problem, and the comment about the warning is just a small digression.\r\n\r\nAlso, it's not really clear if we'd really do that in the end - this needs some discussion first, because there are reasons why we don't do that already. And it's far from our current priorities (which is the new type system). So a forum thread to hash out potential problems for that proposal might be more appropriate way to take the first stab at this. The main problem is that there are cases where statements with no effect are used to suppress warnings about unused variables. We'd need to find a good alternative mechanism for that.",
