For comparison, the behaviour is similar to regular functions:\r\n```\r\nfunction f() pure {}\r\nfunction g() pure {}\r\nfunction g(uint256) pure {}\r\n\r\ncontract C {\r\n  function test() public pure {\r\n    f; // valid, even though there is no effect - also missing a warning, though\r\n    g; // error due to ambiguity\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe main difference is that the types of `a.push` resp. `a.pop` are function types with a bound argument and can thereby not actually be assigned to function pointers.\r\n\r\nAn example of a statement that has no effect and correctly warns about that is ``1;``.",
