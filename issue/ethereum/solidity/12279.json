    "body": "You are performing calculations within an integer type so the intermediate results get rounded down to the nearest integer. `b / c / d` is ~0.959 so it gets rounded to 0. See the documentation about [division](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/types.html#division) in Solidity.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the same calculation done on [literals](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/types.html#rational-and-integer-literals) (i.e. `2000000000000 * 10**18 / 198602694960947175655554 / 10500000 * 94231285718967064346338 * 3`) would not truncate the intermediate results because operations on literals are performed in unlimited precision. You would not be able to assign the result to `a` without removing the fractional part first though because it's an integer variable.\r\n\r\nIf you want to perform operations on fractional numbers, please try using one of the fixed-point arithmetic libraries like [prb-math](https://github.com/hifi-finance/prb-math).\r\n\r\nI'm closing this since this is the expected behavior and not a bug.",
