  "body": "[`scripts/build.sh`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/scripts/build.sh) at a glance looks like a simple helper to build the compiler from source. However, it also attempts to install the built binary system-wide, which is completely unexpected. It may also overwrite a binary someone installed in `/usr/local/bin/` from a different source.\r\n\r\nThe script is recommended as a part of our instruction to install from source: [Command-Line Build](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/installing-solidity.html#command-line-build).\r\n\r\nI think the script is at the very least confusing, if not outright dangerous. We should either remove the install part from it or rename it to make its purpose clearer.",
