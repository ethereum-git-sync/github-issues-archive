It would be much better if a script could directly post the error message as a comment to the pull request. I think this is especially useful for newcomers who do not know what the failures mean and how to get the test logs.\r\n\r\nI'm especially thinking about the spell checker - the script could even post a review comment at the relevant line. The same could be done with compilation errors, though this might be more difficult.\r\n\r\nThere could already be tools out there that do this.\r\n\r\nThis would probably need an API access token which will be provided later on, please test with your own tokens first while developing this feature.",
