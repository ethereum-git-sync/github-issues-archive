In a large codebase this can lead to subtle bugs due to the implicit nature of the return statement.  I would like the ability to set a compiler flag that allows me to make this a warning.  Alternatively, making it always be a compiler warning is fine by me as I think it is not a good practice to have implicit return values.",

    "body": "I'm okay with `returns implicitly` or a pragma.  In a perfect world, explicit would be the default and pragma/compiler options/keyword would be available if you wanted your compiler to be more lenient.  In general my philosophy is that compilers should be ultra strict by default with options to be less strict rather than the other way around.\r\n\r\nHowever, I will take anything I can get, and if that means the default is current behavior and I have to add a pragma or do `returns explicitly (bytes32 fruitName)` I can accept that and be happy.",
