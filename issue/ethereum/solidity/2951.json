In a large codebase this can lead to subtle bugs due to the implicit nature of the return statement.  I would like the ability to set a compiler flag that allows me to make this a warning.  Alternatively, making it always be a compiler warning is fine by me as I think it is not a good practice to have implicit return values.",
