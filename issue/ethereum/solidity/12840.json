    "body": "@CHM1993 What @chriseth meant here is that in Remix the gas cost of opcodes does not correspond well to how heavy they are to execute (as it would be the case if an Eth node executed them). Normally the storage access would be the most expensive operation because it involves disk. In Remix though even memory operations can be pretty heavy computationally compared to how cheap they are in terms of gas. In effect you can easily create a contract that will take Remix a lot of time to execute before it hits the gas limit (effectively making Remix hang).\r\n\r\nI just did a simple experiment and managed to hang it with this simple code:\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract C {\r\n    uint x = 0;\r\n    function foo() public {\r\n        while (true)\r\n            ++x;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo due to this, the fact that the snippet from the description hangs Remix just means that Remix is not very efficient at executing it (perhaps it should be reported as a problem in Remix) but it does not seem to be an actual bug in the code produce by the compiler. An EVM running outside of the browser would probably not have any issues executing it.",
