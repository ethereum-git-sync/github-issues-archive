  "body": "As far as I have seen in our test suite, the only case where we check the actual hash value of our ``keccak256`` implementation is for the empty string. We do check against ``aleth``'s implementation at some occasions, but that's probably basically the same implementation as we have (I haven't checked, though).\r\n\r\nWe should add some proper test values (a handful should be enough).\r\nThis came up during the discussion with @anujajakhade about big endian support: I'm pretty sure the ``keccak256`` implementation is not endianness-safe, but we didn't get specific test failures about it.",
