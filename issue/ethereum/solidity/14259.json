    "body": "Yeah, looks like the help text needs to be adjusted. Thanks for the report!\r\n\r\nThis behavior was introduced in #3696 because some users found it confusing that `solc` would wait for input if no input files were given. It does work the way described in the help text with `--standard-json` but not in other input modes (and this discrepancy looks like a small bug).\r\n\r\nActually, we could still support the described behavior without confusing users - by reading from stdin only if it was redirected. We already do that when `solc` is invoked with no arguments at all, which allows us to display the help text in that case. But we won't be doing any bigger changes to the CLI in the near future so just adjusting the help text is the best solution for now.\r\n\r\nFeel free to submit a PR with a correction.",
