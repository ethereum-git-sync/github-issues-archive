  "body": "Hi guys, a while ago I transfered my Metis Funds (worth over 125.000$ right now) to the Metis contract address in state of my Metamask wallet address.\r\nI really hope some experienced people overhere can tell me if we can get these tokens back and will pay 15.000$ for the solution.\r\nFrom what I have heard it's impossible to get these tokens back but I am just hoping for a miracle. Just let me know if you can help me and I will cover all cost\r\nthat is needed to fix this problem. \r\nMetis contract : https://etherscan.io/address/0x9e32b13ce7f2e80a01932b42553652e053d6ed8e\r\nLost funds transfer: https://etherscan.io/tx/0xfcf63dd0fc691d02375b65f42e71a113f17d77c760a05553fad41031ff1f0253\r\nBest, Mitchell ",
