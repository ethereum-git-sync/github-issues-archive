    "body": "Looks like fixing this will be more invasive than I originally thought. The underlying issue is that most of the functions on the `Type` class that compute sizes (i.e. `calldataEncodedSize()`, `calldataHeadSize()`, `calldataEncodedTailSize()` and `memoryHeadSize()`) return `unsigned`. And that's enough for valid code but if we want to display a nice message for stuff that's too large we run into this assertion inside them.\r\n\r\nIn memory and in calldata it happens only for structs because the code that calculates the size works around the `unsigned` limitation by finding the underlying array element type (going through all the nesting levels) and multiplying by length in all dimensions inside `bigint`. It assumes that the element size always fits in `unsigned`, which was probably true before structs were introduced but now it's not.\r\n\r\nThis is why this example results in a compiler error (`Error: Type too large for memory.`):\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract C {\r\n    function f() internal {\r\n        uint[1000000000] memory x;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nbut this one compiles just fine:\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract D {\r\n    struct S { uint[1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000] v; }\r\n    function f() internal {\r\n        S[1] memory x;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe most straightforward fix would be to change the return values of these functions from `unsigned` to `bigint` or `u256` but the extra overhead seems pointless if that's only for invalid contracts.\r\n\r\nAn alternative solution would be to make the function that calculates size take structs into account but I'm afraid that we'll eventually just end up with two parallel systems for computing sizes and the one without the size limit will keep breaking because we won't remember to update it when adding new types just like it happened there.",
