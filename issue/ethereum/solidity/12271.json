    "body": "tldr: assertion is not as simple as it looks, the underlying SMT and Horn solvers were not able to prove the required nonlinear invariant.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this assertion is logically not as simple as it looks, even though it's a really good property!\r\n\r\nThe counterexample you see comes from the BMC engine which has lots of false positives. If you use the CHC engine alone (which is what I usually do and recommend) you'll probably see that it says it couldn't prove either way, so an assertion violation `might happen`.\r\n\r\nUsually people prove functional correctness of the `transfer` function +- this way:\r\n```\r\n\tfunction transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) public {\r\n\t\trequire(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= amount);\r\n\t\tuint sumPrev = balanceOf[msg.sender] + balanceOf[recipient];\r\n\t\tbalanceOf[msg.sender] -= amount;\r\n\t\tbalanceOf[recipient] += amount;\r\n\t\tuint sumPost = balanceOf[msg.sender] + balanceOf[recipient];\r\n\t\tassert(sumPrev == sumPost);\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\nThis version is also proved correct by the CHC engine in the SMTChecker. Notice that this is a local property, that must hold over a single transaction.\r\n\r\nYour property is however much much more meaningful because it holds over *infinitely many* transactions, and is much more difficult to prove. In order for the solver to prove this, it would have to find a nonlinear invariant, which is really hard. I tried your code with two different Horn solvers as backend for the SMTChecker, the default one and a different one. Neither could solve it.\r\nWhen you change it to two variables instead of a mapping the problem indeed becomes much simpler and easier to solve.",

    "body": "> And I want to note that from my perspective(just a smart contract developer), SMTChecker is unfortunately useless right now because mappings are used extensively in smart contracts. I wanted to replace a bunch of unit tests in future projects with formal verification and now I see that it is currently impossible. :(\r\n\r\nThanks for the feedback!\r\nThat's not always the case though. Mappings are not always that problematic, note that the main problem here is the nonlinear math (variable * variable) over multiple transactions, and not the mapping itself. Tools like the SMTChecker cannot handle this type of math very well, and this includes hevm and other symbolic execution tools. For example, even a simplified AMM code like https://github.com/d-xo/symtest-examples/blob/main/src/AMM.sol , that doesn't use mappings at all, won't be supported. We also noticed recently that the solver that the SMTChecker uses by default doesn't solve many problems that another solver we recently discovered does, because of the way that the SMTChecker encodes the contracts. Unfortunately it's still some work to be able to use the second solver.\r\nJust as an example, we recently managed to verify the Open Zeppelin's ERC777 implementation without changes, and those contracts use a lot of mappings, even nested mappings, and other complicated features, but this required us to use this new solver which is not fully integrated and shipped with the compiler.\r\n\r\nI think you're on the right path with the properties it looks like you're writing, hopefully the tool will be able to cope with some of them.\r\nI'd suggest that you also use the `modelChecker.contracts` option to choose exactly which contract you're verifying, this helps the solver a lot, and also increase the `modelChecker.timeout`.",
