That will autotrigger the build and push of a new versioned docker image without affecting other PRs and CI runs. Once the automatically built docker image is (automatically) pushed, the tests in the PR can be retriggered and the whole thing merged, once the tests pass.\r\n\r\nWithout any local builds, version issues or the requirement of distributing dockerhub push permissions.\r\n\r\nThere are several slight variations of this we can consider (e.g. using docker's autotesting to validate that the docker images can run the build and tests before pushing), but generally I would say such a fully automated setup is feasible and *very* much worth setting up.\r\n\r\nAnd *with* such an automation setup I'd actually very much agree that the docker solution is in fact superior to CI caching.
