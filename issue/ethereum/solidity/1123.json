  "body": "Copy and pasted from gitter as requested by @bobsummerwill / also affects the cpp-ethereum repository where I'm going to crosspost this, also as suggested by bob.\n\n> Hi, could we talk about git tags for the cpp-ethereum and solidity repositories? cpp-ethereum is tagged with `untagged-1d50...` and solidity shows `untagged-0ce6...` aswell as `1.0.704`. Another issue is the _pre_-pending of the develop string regarding the sorting of tags. cpp-ethereum has for example `develop-v1.3.0.401`. Since I'm providing builds not only for stable but also intermediate releases, this is causing me some trouble. I would like to suggest the following and I'm open for discussion / feedback:\n> - avoid `untagged` tags.\n> - append a version string rather than prepending it, e.g. `v1.3.0.401-dev` rather than `develop-v1.3.0.401`\n> - don't switch between version strings with `v` and without\n> - if you use a dedicated `release` branch to tag stable releases, please merge the tags back into `develop`\n> \n> Thanks for your time.\n",
