    "body": "We discussed this issue (at least how we interpret it) during the weekly call and came to the following conclusions:\r\n\r\n - if a contract type has a `transfer` function, it will supersede the transfer function on the address type, so the ERC20 tokens should not be affected. Furthermore, the signature of the ERC20 transfer function is different.\r\n - adding the address members to contract types does not make much sense, so we will probably deprecate them in the future (add a warning) and eventually remove them. The only real use for these members would be `this.balance`, which might stay.\r\n\r\n@nmushegian it would be great to have some more input about what exactly you find reckless about this change. If you can come up with a better name for such a function, we are all ears.",
