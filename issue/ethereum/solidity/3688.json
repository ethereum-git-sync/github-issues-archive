    "body": "Hey Guys, glad you enjoyed my script. I actually did not anticipate that it contained anything that was actually an issue, and had assumed the unusual behaviors I poked fun at were being done because they were part of intentionally re-used op routines.\r\n\r\nTo answer your question about the optimizer, no, I don't believe so. But I recall running it with and without optimizer and that the operations were not substantially different in the routine for composing and storing a struct. \r\n\r\nA few of the amusing parts around managing array length were removed/obscured by the optimizer, which is why I went for the non-optimizer version for my skit.",
