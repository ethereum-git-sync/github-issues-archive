As a fellow programming language person I love the work you're doing and I know naming is hard, but please do consider choosing something with greater phonetic distance.\r\n\r\nI'm sure there's a ton of great names out there. Looks like a couple of them were proposed in #2131. I'd also be happy to help brainstorm further on naming, but that's probably not my place. I hope you'll consider this request, so both communities can avoid adding \"no, not that julia that's a totally different thing\" every time they talk about how cool their technology is.",

    "body": "\"Assembly\" refers to a class of languages, generally one per architecture. I'm sure people would have been very confused had you used the name \"AT&T x86 assembly\", despite x86 assembly not being a blockchain. Julia obviously also has an intermediate representation, which is generally called \"Julia IR\", as well as all the other standard compiler concepts \"Julia AST\", etc. Several people in #2131 did in fact express confusion. As @StefanKarpinski mentioned, it is entirely possible to use julia as an evm frontend language, though not many people really want to do that right now, because that's not really it's focus. Julia can also compile to wasm, which people are more interested in. I recognize you like the name. I understand. It's a very nice name, but let's please avoid this headache.",
