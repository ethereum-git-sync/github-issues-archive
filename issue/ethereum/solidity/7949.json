Nothing will really change with removing LLL from Solidity. LLL will remain just as unmaintained, as it was the past 3 years.\r\n\r\nI'm afraid there are many test cases which don't actually test what they supposed to, because they were created with a broken LLL compiler and were never regenerated.\r\n\r\nTo fix the situation, I think one of these would need to happen:\r\na) Write a new, more simple, but properly working LLL compiler. Regenerate each test. Manually confirm each test case is well written.\r\nb) Rewrite test cases in a new language.\r\n\r\nBoth of these are large tasks, but there just isn't any way around it.",

Even though Vyper has its own LLL codegen module, it is not sophisticated. `lllc` could be used in that case to generate better binary code. Would removing LLL from Solidity compiler result in us loosing that kind of opportunity? \r\n\r\n",
