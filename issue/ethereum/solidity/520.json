Probably related to https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/517.\n\nIIRC `call` returns the execution status on the stack, that could be checked.  Perhaps the best option is to clear the return memory area and return 0 only.\n\nPossible future improvement could be a new keyword, such as `safe`, which throws if call failed, i.e.:\n\n```\noraclize.getPrice.safe(\"URL\");\n```\n\nwould throw if the call failed.\n\nAdditionally, safe-mode could also do an `extcodesize` check to verify the existence of the code upfront. Safe-mode is more expensive, but safe üîí \n",
