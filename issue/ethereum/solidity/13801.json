  "body": "The `--ir-optimized` option on the command-line sounds as if it would give you the optimized IR but that's only true when `--optimize` is also specified. Without it, you get the output that optimizer would get but without any optimizations actually applied. This is very confusing to users.\r\n\r\nWe should report an error on the CLI when `--ir-optimized` is specified but `--optimize` is not.\r\n\r\nWe have a similar situation with the `ir` and `irOptimized` outputs in Standard JSON, though I think there it's less of a problem because tooling has this figured out and individual users are not likely to use this directly. The current documentation is not very clear about this behavior though so we should improve it:\r\n```javascript\r\n//   ir - Yul intermediate representation of the code before optimization\r\n//   irOptimized - Intermediate representation after optimization\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\nThis is technically not backwards-compatible, though the combination is pretty useless so I don't think it would affect practical use cases. It would be much more problematic if we decided to do this in Standard JSON too though.",
