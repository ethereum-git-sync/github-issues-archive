Even when calling `new SomeContract()`, `create` is used to deploy the bytecode to an address, which is definitely an external call. IMO the usage of the `new` keyword constitutes an internal call, but contract creation doesn’t. \n\nI would push back a bit on the remediation though, but I think that your suggestion of using the `abstract` keyword rather than marking the constructor as `internal` would significantly clarify the behavior.\n\nThanks for commenting on this! I remember learning about the difference between `constructor` and `function` visibility a while back, and `public` really felt like a misnomer.\n",
