  "body": "Split out a first batch of technical infrastructure of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14510 into a PR targetting develop.\r\n\r\nParts that should go into the new PR:\r\n- The new scanner kind ``ScannerKind::ExperimentalSolidity`` and the surrounding scanner changes (including the small change to ``libyul/AsmParser``). Only the tokens ``NonExperimentalEnd`` and ``ExperimentalEnd`` need to be extracted.\r\n- A stub version of `experimental/analysis/Analysis` without any annotation logic and with only a ``check`` function that always reports an error \"experimental analysis not yet implemented\" and returns ``false``.\r\n- The changes to ``CompilerStack``, i.e. a special path for experimental solidity, invoking `experimental/analysis/Analysis``\r\n   - Including the assertion in ``CompilerStack::compile`` and a similar assertion in ``CompilerStack::generateIR`` (instead of invoking `experimental::IRGenerator` just put in a failing assertion as well)\r\n\r\nWhat does **not** have to be moved right away:\r\n- Additional tokens\r\n- Changes to the parser\r\n- Changes to the NameAndTypeResolver and ReferenceResolver\r\n- Generally, none of the changes to the currnet analysis steps (like in ``SyntaxChecker``)\r\n- The additional AST nodes and their annotations and visitor logic\r\n- The actual logic of ``experimental/analysis/Analysis.*`` - we can start from a stub that just always fails, see above\r\n- The actual analysis steps in ``experimental/analysis/*``\r\n- Code generation or AST `experimental/ast`, `experimental/codegen`\r\n\r\nThis will cause the existing experimental solidity import tests to fail, but that's fine to accept on develop for now.",
