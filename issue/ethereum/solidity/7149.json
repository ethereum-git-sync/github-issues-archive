    "body": "I'd ask the contrary: *should* this mapping type be supported? I think the original thought was, that it's not really useful, since ``address payable`` is implicitly convertible to ``address``, so you can always use an ``address payable`` as key in ``mapping (address => T)``, i.e. whenever you'd use ``mapping(address payable => T)`` you can just use ``mapping(address => T)`` instead. You'll never be able to call ``send`` or ``transfer`` on the keys in a mapping anyways.\r\n\r\nThinking about it, one might argue that it could be useful to explicitly restrict keys to only payable addresses, but is that really useful? So is it likely that one wants to have a mapping, such that ``m[a] = v`` is valid only if ``a`` is ``address payable``, but not if ``a`` is ``address``?\r\n",
