    "body": "I personally quite like virtual modifiers. The separation in thinking as a developer treats functions differently from modifiers.\r\n\r\nIf you want to encourage the usage you suggested by using virtual functions inside modifiers, I would suggest just allowing functions to be able to decorate other functions and removing modifiers altogether:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract MyContract {\r\n    address owner;\r\n\r\n    function onlyOwner() internal view {\r\n        require(msg.sender == owner);\r\n        _;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function performSensitiveOperation() external onlyOwner {\r\n    ...\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis reduces the so-called \"complicated modifiers\" as a concept entirely and simply allows other functions to become pre-cursor conditions to the \"main\" function body.\r\n\r\nIf the idea of decorating a function with a modifier is the complication, then the simplest alternative is to stop allowing modifiers other than built-in visibility modifiers and force people to use functional conditions at the beginning of functions instead of modifiers.",
