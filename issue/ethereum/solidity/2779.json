  "body": "With a project of medium size, compilation times start to become fairly significant.  Unfortunately, in a large project there is often a lot of `import '...'` when you have contracts that depend on each other, which means that a naive caching system will invalidate the cache when any dependency of a contract is touched, requiring recompilation of many contracts even if there were no ABI changes.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if Solidity supported compilation caching and was smart about detecting changes in files separately from changes in ABIs so that it could only recompile the minimal set of files necessary.",
