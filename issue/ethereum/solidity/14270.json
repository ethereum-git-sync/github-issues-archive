This leads to weird APIs, for example:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract Four {\r\n    uint8 public constant FOUR_CONSTANT = 2 + 2;\r\n    uint8 public immutable fourImmutable = 2 + 2;\r\n    function fourFunction() public pure returns (uint8) {\r\n        return 2 + 2;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor the consumers of the API, it's all the same, they see 3 pure functions returning `uint8`s, but while `fourImmutable()` and `fourFunction()` are consistent, `FOUR_CONSTANT()` is completely different, even though it behaves exactly as the rest.\r\n\r\nFor the devs writing contracts deriving from `Four`, `fourImmutable` and `FOUR_CONSTANT` are in most contexts equivalent, the only exception are assigning to other constants and static array sizes.\r\n\r\nFor the devs of `Four`, a cosmetic change of `fourImmutable` or `fourFunction` into a constant is an API-breaking change even though it can't affect any consumers. A change of `FOUR_CONSTANT` into an immutable or a function won't affect the API consumers either, it will only affect the constant evaluation in the deriving contracts.\r\n\r\nBecause the naming convention is defined in the Solidity language's own documentation, it's considered the (soft) law. All the code linters and analyzers, and also all the devs require using the SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for constants, to do otherwise one needs to overcome both the tools and the people.\r\n\r\n### The solution\r\n\r\nThe solution is to allow both SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE and mixedCase names in constants, but recommend mixedCase. It won't make the existing code and interfaces break the style, after all they can't be changed anymore. Over time the tools will start accepting mixedCase, and the devs will learn to use them. The future APIs will stick to mixedCase everywhere and won't expose their inner implementation details via the naming convention anymore.\r\n\r\n## Pull request\r\n\r\nNone yet, let's discuss it first.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
