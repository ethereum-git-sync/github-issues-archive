I wanted to summarize now at least some thoughts  we came up with in the call:\r\n\r\n* underlines don't even have to be mimmicked via `^^^^` lines as VT does have native support for (even: *curly* underlines that can get a different color as the text they're being printed under, say yellow for warning and red for error. besides curly there is also support for single/double/dotted underline (exotic left out).\r\n* we should document preciely what VT sequences we do produce: LF for newline, SGR reset (`CSI m`), 16-indexed color setting for foreground and (apprently?) also background as well as RGB color setting (at least `CSI 48 ; r ; g ; b m`). It would be simple to also add underline-mode and underline-color to it, because (surprise :-D) it's the exact same VT sequence, just with different numbers between `CSI` and `m`). `CSI` is the shorthand for `\"\\033[\"`.\r\n* it should be mentioned that we currently indent via spaces, and that would require a monospaced font when displaying the messages (that one could probably be mitigated by using native underline sequences instead of manually writing `^^^`'s under a source fragment.\r\n* it at least came up as an idea: one could even syntax-highlight the printed AST fragment :)\r\n* the original error message can remain the same but the additional source reference would require an additional JSON field in the reply (that may or may not be colored, based on what the client requested).",

    "body": "I think I've seen this one (or something similar). I was just arguing that GUI tools might prefer a different markup but you are right that they can use other fields to construct the message. So I think ANSI sequences are fine if console tools would use them.\r\n\r\nAnd I think they would. For example Truffle just prints all messages without any coloring and some people are annoyed enough to write custom scripts to colorize the output: [Colorizing truffle compile output](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/colorizing-truffle-compile-output/14637). This seems like a waste since compiler already has this info. I guess Truffle could construct colored message from components but for whatever reason it does not (seems like there was no feature request for that though so maybe it's just that nobody thought to ask? :)). I guess if we provided these colored messages in Standard JSON, Truffle would start using them right away because it would require very little effort.",

    "body": "I like when things work in a \"core functionality that can be used by anyone\" + \"the tool builds upon that functionality as anyone else\". I'll clarify what I mean.\r\n\r\nThe ideal thing, in my mind, would be for the standard json to work as a \"source of truth\", that is then used by the compiler CLI to generate its output in some opinionated way. That is, as much as possible, the compiler _only_ relies on the JSON (or the equivalent internal data structure). One example would be:\r\n\r\n- The JSON has a message, and a \"level\". The CLI decides that messages of level \"warning\" are printed as yellow and messages of level \"error\" are printed as red. This is the place where ANSI escape chars are inserted (to me, it doesn't make sense to have them as part of the JSON output).\r\n- Anyone can consume the JSON and use it in a different way. For example, Remix can use this and render it in HTML in whatever way they want.\r\n\r\nI understand that this is not possible right now, since the `formattedMessage` entry already has color characters. But IMO this is the right direction to move towards. So my personal preference would be to avoid adding the `noColor` option, to eventually deprecate the `formattedMessage` entry, and to provide any metadata necessary so that anyone can format the message however they want.\r\n\r\nI know this is a very disruptive proposal, and I should have participated before.

    "body": "@fvictorio\r\n> I understand that this is not possible right now, since the `formattedMessage` entry already has color characters.\r\n\r\nI don't think it does. It's formatted in a way suitable for the console (assumes fixed-width font and is just a single string with newlines) but currently it does not have any color info. Adding ANSI sequences to it what this issue proposes.\r\n\r\n>  But IMO this is the right direction to move towards. So my personal preference would be to avoid adding the `noColor` option, to eventually deprecate the `formattedMessage` entry, and to provide any metadata necessary so that anyone can format the message however they want.\r\n\r\nThe metadata is already there. Here's an example what you get from Standard JSON now (not all fields are always present);\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"errors\":\r\n    [\r\n        ...\r\n        {\r\n            \"component\": \"general\",\r\n            \"errorCode\": \"4334\",\r\n            \"formattedMessage\": \"TypeError: Trying to override non-virtual function. Did you forget to add \\\"virtual\\\"?\\n --> C.sol:2:5:\\n  |\\n2 |     function f() public {}\\n  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nNote: Overriding function is here:\\n --> C.sol:6:5:\\n  |\\n6 |     function f() internal\\n  |     ^ (Relevant source part starts here and spans across multiple lines).\\n\\n\",\r\n            \"message\": \"Trying to override non-virtual function. Did you forget to add \\\"virtual\\\"?\",\r\n            \"secondarySourceLocations\":\r\n            [\r\n                {\r\n                    \"end\": 102,\r\n                    \"file\": \"C.sol\",\r\n                    \"message\": \"Overriding function is here:\",\r\n                    \"start\": 65\r\n                }\r\n            ],\r\n            \"severity\": \"error\",\r\n            \"sourceLocation\":\r\n            {\r\n                \"end\": 39,\r\n                \"file\": \"C.sol\",\r\n                \"start\": 17\r\n            },\r\n            \"type\": \"TypeError\"\r\n        },\r\n        ...\r\n    ],\r\n    \"sources\": {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\nSo what you're proposing is already possible. Everything needed to reconstruct the message is already there. The code snippets are not included but they can be easily extracted from source present in Standard JSON input based on the provided locations.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this issue, however, is to give tools an alternative to this. Currently most of them ignore these components and just use `formattedMessage` instead. Giving them an option to get ANSI colors in there would be a pragmatic move to let them display colored error messages with little effort. Deprecating `formattedMessage` would probably fix the situation too by forcing them to start formatting messages on their own but it might be taken as much more hostile :)",

    "body": "@alcuadrado mentioned that having a new `ansiColoredMessage` (or however it's called) has a couple of advantages.\r\n\r\nFirst, this would avoid the need of having a new flag in the input, which is problematic for verification because it affects the metadata (it would suck if your verification fails because you had a different colors config when the contract was deployed). Second, having a different field means that it's easier to support all versions of solc; otherwise, we should know that after some version the `formattedMessage` field has different assumptions.\r\n\r\nIf we have this field, then the part of the code that handles showing the messages can have a simple logic that works for all versions:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nif (error.ansiColoredMessage) {\r\n  console.log(error.ansiColoredMessage)\r\n} else { \r\n   console.log(colorize(error.formattedMessage)\r\n}\r\n```",

    "body": "> This is a hard question. If I'm understanding correctly, there are three options here:\r\n>\r\n> 1. Add ANSI colors to the formattedMessage entry, and add a noColor option to the JSON input.\r\n> 2. Add ANSI colors but without an option in the input. That is, assume that formattedMessage will always be shown in a terminal.\r\n> 3. Don't do anything. If someone wants colors, they'll have to either use the same color for the full formatted message (we are doing that in Hardhat) or build a custom message with the other parts of the error object.\r\n\r\nThe main options [according to this](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11507#issuecomment-919556059):\r\n1. Add ANSI colours to `formattedMessage` iff the `settings.anisColors` is `true`. Otherwise (the default) stay as today.\r\n2. Do nothing.\r\n3. Introduce more complex version of `formattedMessage` which has spans.",

    "body": "In dapp we currently just dump the output from `formattedMessage` and don't apply any colorization (although I did just open a pr to differentiate between warning and error messages based on the script you linked above @cameel :pray:).\r\n\r\nI would be happy to see full colorized output included in the output json, and would definitely make use of it in dapp, especially if it included e.g. syntax highlighting for the solidity snippets in the output.\r\n\r\nI don't have a strong preference regarding interface, either a switch in the input settings, or a new field in the output are fine by me, but as @fvictorio mentions a new field will probably make for a pretty clean impementation.",
