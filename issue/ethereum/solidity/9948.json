    "body": "Sure, I marked it as `cosmetic` simply to indicate that the code is not valid and would result in a compiler error even without the ICE. Just one of the labels we created recently to sort bugs into categories. Doesn't mean it it's not important :) Your report is a great help because it's a bug that slipped through code review of a PR we just merged. Thanks to your report we'll be able to fix it even before it gets into an actual release.\r\n\r\n> Also, fixing it will help fuzzing; it's so easy to trigger, AFL is spending a lot of time dumping out crash duplicates of this... :)\r\n\r\nYeah, stuff like this affects @bshastry's fuzzing too so I get what you mean. We even have a label to mark these bugs as high priority: `fuzz-blocker`. I think it would be fine for you to use it for stuff that affects your fuzzer too.",
