  "body": "This is a project management issue.\r\n\r\nNot a milestone issue to track a bunch of features that are needed for version 1.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nLet's release version 1 today.\r\n\r\nThe same exact code as the latest release. Just renamed as version 1.0.0. Or take the next release that would have been 0.x.y and call that 1.0.0.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIt's time.\r\n\r\nWe are not breaking things every release.\r\n\r\nThere are many contracts deployed already, responsible for hundreds of billions of USD worth of things.\r\n\r\nCore developers here are responsible and deliver quality releases reliably. The community is engaged. They are accessible and available at public events. When they *aren't* at public events, people ask how they are doing. Thank you.\r\n\r\nThis is what a >= 1.0.0 project feels like.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThere is no risk.\r\n\r\nCurrently when experimental or breaking features are introduced they are kept behind experimental flags or they are documented.\r\n\r\nWhen new versions of Solidity are released, all support for old versions is dropped. [As a general rule, only the latest release gets security updates.](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/security/policy#supported-versions)\r\n\r\nReleasing version 1.0.0 does not change any of this.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThere is a huge benefit.\r\n\r\nWhen people release a library or some other code, they want to say \"this works on Solidity x.y.z and anything later that is compatible\". This is much easier after you release 1.0.0 because you can use Semantic Versioning to compare compatible versions. (This fails for < 1.0.0.)\r\n\r\nTwo specific problems are: people are hardcoding 0.8.0 version. People should not be required to hardcode Solidity versions to guarantee stability. Another example is Hardhat, it looks great but it doesn't support the latest version of Solidity and produces a warning. Hardhat developers should not need to do anything when a new compatible version of Solidity is released. We definitely don't want tools telling contract developers *not* to use the latest version of Solidity.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSo again, thank you to everyone here. We did it! This software is amazing. We love you and your work. Let us allow official guarantees of feature stability by releasing 1.0.0 today.",

    "body": "To give two concrete reasons:\r\n1) the IR,\r\n2) standard library.\r\n\r\n**The IR**\r\nThe IR (aka new codegen via Yul) is something we started to work on around 2017. The work is progressing much better this year and hopefully it can be released before 2022. We have already found a number of issues how the old codegen worked, and the IR works in these cases differently. This is basically a breaking change.\r\n\r\nIt would be foolish releasing 1.0.0 before the IR is released, is stable, and is the default.\r\n\r\n**Standard Library**\r\nThe other major feature we work towards is the standard library, i.e. moving some of the features from the compiler into the language itself.  This requires a number of improvements. Two name two: more capability of introspection; and more importantly, templates.\r\n\r\nAgain, it seems to be foolish releasing 1.0.0 before we have the standard library released.\r\n\r\n**Others**\r\nBesides these I could also name a number of features we think are important, but this is evolving.  Lastly, there are major changes planned/coming to Mainnet.  Think about \"The Merge\", data shards, the rollup roadmap or executable shards, etc.  All these *may* require major changes to Solidity.",

The interface on Ethereum is the ABI, and not Solidity. Choosing to describe standards using Solidity may not be the best practice, as it excludes those using other languages, or even the possibility for such languages to emerge.\r\n\r\nLastly I'd appreciate if you could list pros/cons for both the current scheme vs. the 1.0.0 today.",

Just like all the 0.7.x releases are backwards compatible with 0.7.0 and so on. Would they support that version if it was called 1.6.0 instad of 0.8.6? I thought it had more to do with them being cautious and wanting a new version to be thoroughly tested before they officially bless it as a supported one. \r\n\r\nAlso, the particular case of 0.8.4 might have something to do with the \"unreachable code\" warning in 0.8.5 (#11522) and people wanting to skip that particular version (it's already fixed in 0.8.6 though).",

    "body": "> Any project that understands Solidity to be following SerVer is wise to NOT support the latest version until manual review.\r\n\r\nYou have a point here. If we're not following SemVer then I think we should clearly document what our backwards-compatibility guarantees are (regardless of whether SemVer convention changed or it was just misinterpretation on our part). The various places where it's described ([Intro](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.6/index.html#solidity), [Version Pragma](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.6/layout-of-source-files.html#version-pragma), [Version String](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.6/installing-solidity.html#the-version-string-in-detail)) only refer to SemVer instead of stating that outright.\r\n\r\n> - It is possible for Solidity to make a \"feature release\" where some beneficial backwards-compatible change is introduced distinctly from a \"patch release\" that only fixes things.\r\n\r\nBut do patch releases even make sense before the project is mature enough to have proper major releases that are supported long-term? The change in versioning would enable us to make patch releases for older compiler versions but we're still at 0.x.y precisely because we do not yet think it's a good moment to start maintaining older releases long term. I think that releasing 1.0.0 might introduce an expectation that at least some fixes will be backported.\r\n\r\nAlso, with the current release frequency each release is always a mix of new features and bugfixes. Even 0.8.6 which was basically a bugfix release for 0.8.5 included a small feature. More frequent releases are not necessarily a good thing. Neither for us nor for users. We do not make them lightly so each one takes some time and effort on our part. It would also dramatically increase the number of compiler binaries we have to keep around. We have to keep providing all officially released binaries indefinitely to enable contract source verification.",

It doesn't. Really. Other projects like Inscape [we waited 17 years to make our first 1.x release](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inkscape) and nothing was gained. It never achieved the magic \"100% compliance of SVG standard\" which was our goal there. They also do not support old versions. And the world kept spinning.\r\n\r\nOther than the public awareness of Solidity reaching 1.x will cause, and I can guarantee this will be the front page of world newspapers for no more than 7 days straight, there will be little public expectations on the project.\r\n\r\nI can guarantee there will not be this much discussion about moving from version 1.x.y to 2.0.0.\r\n\r\nBut SemVer tells us \"Version 1.0.0 defines the public API. The way in which the version number is incremented after this release is dependent on this public API and how it changes\". I hope we can agree that Solidity ALREADY has a public API. People depend on it ALREADY. Its deployments control assets worth more than all but 10 of the companies on the S&P 500 list.\r\n\r\nThe time when you have defined a public API (i.e. any possibility that a future release may continue to support any feature you have already made available), that is the time to release version 1.0.0.",

    "body": "By definition, all prerelease versions, whether `0.y.z` or `-pre`, are potentially breaking and this has always been the case with SemVer. Consumers must assume breaking and behave accordingly. Therefore, a publisher that perpetually publishes prereleases, cannot _push_ a critical bug fix, because consumer automation will not take them without human intervention.\r\n\r\nIf you are good at predicting when you have a non-breaking change to publish, then by all means, please use the full X.y.z, where X > 0, non-prerelease version format. Then you can experiment with follow-on prereleases, but reserve the ability to release critical patches.\r\n\r\nDo not hide behind prerelease publications, simply to avoid regularly increasing major version numbers. That attitude is expected from the marketing department, not engineering. But, if you are not certain you can attain the full intended target feature set without major breakage, and you don't want your customers taking dependencies on your product prior to feature completeness, then by all means, continue on your prerelease track.\r\n\r\nJust keep in mind, that most products; really aren't ever feature complete, until some time after they are nearly obsolete. If you have a large user base that is committed to using your product, you're probably better off in the long haul, if you start cutting releases on a regular basis, even if they are frequently breaking changes.  Even if you have no intention of ever going back and releasing a non-breaking fix for an earlier version, you will have at least reserved that capability, should you ever change your mind.\r\n\r\nReleasing X.y.z, where X > 0, does not imply anything at all wrt quality or commitment. It just lays the baseline for future versions to employ the full semantics that SemVer specifies, should you decide that you need them.",
