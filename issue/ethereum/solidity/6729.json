We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.\r\n- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:\r\n\t- [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)\r\n\t- [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)\r\n- Ensure the issue isn't already reported (check `feature` and `language design` labels).\r\n\r\n*Delete the above section and the instructions in the sections below before submitting*\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Abstract\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease describe by example what problem you see in the current Solidity language\r\nand reason about it.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWe currently have a hard-coded for loop template that looks like so\r\n\r\n```\r\nfor { let i := 0 } lt(i,0x60) {i := add(i,0x20)}\r\n{ <for-body>}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis issue tracks support for something more generic like so\r\n```\r\nfor { <for-init-statements>} <for-cond> {<for-post-statements>}\r\n{ <for-body>}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThe technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The\r\nspecification should be detailed enough to allow any developer to implement the functionality.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFor loop init/post statements cannot include `break` and `continue`. Moreover, we exclude variable declarations from for-loop-init block to side step scope extension tracking logic in the proto fuzzer. This can be added later on.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, the implementation logic is quite straightforward.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nAll language changes that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing\r\nthese incompatibilities and their severity.\r\n\r\nPlease describe how you propose to deal with these incompatibilities.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNA.",
