Since ``code`` variables behave differently depending on creation vs runtime context, this will require some refactoring of the type checking logic (may overlap with https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13365).\r\n\r\nThis should be accompanied by extensive syntax tests that demonstrate the type checking behaviour.\r\n\r\nFinally, in code generation, any attempt to generate code for a ``code`` variable should result in an ``solUnimplementedAssert`` to be eliminated in subsequent steps.",
