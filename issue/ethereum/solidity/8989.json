  "body": "Flattening entire source trees into a single file is very common practice as it's an easy way of verifying contract source code. This causes a few issues with the new SPDX comments.\r\n\r\n1. Multiple SPDX comments cause a compiler error, so the existing flattening tools will stop working unless they combine the comments into one in some smart way.\r\n2. Different parts of the combined file may be licensed in different ways. I took a look at the SPDX documentation but couldn't understand if this situation is supported by the standard. I understand that there are license expressions that can combine multiple licenses but I'm not sure if it's okay to use that when each license applies to a different section of a file. Can you provide some guidance on this topic?\r\n\r\nIs it possible at least to remove the compiler error if multiple equal SPDX comments are found?",

    "body": "Some potential answers:\r\n1. While we do not encourage the use of these flattening tools, they can just remove all the license statements.\r\n\r\n2. Do not take this as legal advice! But many licenses have different regulations to source and bytecode, and are usually peculiar what applies to bytecode. If different licenses allow combining sources into a single bytecode, then usually the least permissive license takes precedence (aka applies to the resulting bytecode). It is also possible that licenses are incompatible and such projects should not have been deployed in the first place.\r\n\r\nBasically what this means is that projects should have already been aware what is the license of the final product if they use sources with different licenses. Now they have to choose an appropriate SPDX setting based on this knowledge.",

    "body": "> All the languages like go, js and Solidity have a proper module system that defines namespaces.

But it is undeniable that using flatten is still more easier for reading code or verifying source code\r\n\r\nMy thinking is that you should not restrict non-technical thing. E.g:\r\n- When a file does not have a license -> a warning is good\r\n- When a file has multiple licenses -> an error is bad, why not a warning\r\n- Flattening may good or bad, but you should not break compatibility between versions. These guys above are asking a way out for every parties. Why not?",
