That makes reproducible builds much more painful (since the build directories must have identical absolute paths).\r\n\r\nThis is probably due to error reporting, boost exceptions and ``__FILE__``.\r\nWe should investigate how much effort it is to have relative paths instead.\r\n\r\n(In another project I once had CMake store the character length of ``CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR`` in a preprocessor macro and replaced ``__FILE__`` with ``__FILE__ + SOURCE_PATH_LENGTH``, but that might be difficult to do with boost and there might be a better way in general).",
