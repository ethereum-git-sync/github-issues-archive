  "body": "In [Inheritance > Constructors](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contracts.html#constructors) the documentation states:\r\n\r\n> Before the constructor code is executed, state variables are initialised to their specified value if you initialise them inline, or zero if you do not.\r\n\r\nIsn't that true only if the type of said variable is `uint` or `int`? For a `bool` for example, the value will be `false` (even though its byte-representation is all zeros).\r\n\r\nMaybe that sentence could be changed to: \"Before the constructor code is executed, state variables are initialised to their specified value if you initialise them inline, or their [default value](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/control-structures.html#default-value) if you do not.\"\r\n\r\nI am happy to open a PR as well.",
