  "body": "Currently delete will just zero out the elements of an array.\n\nWould it make sense to reduce the array size if the last element is being deleted? At least in terms of the ABI response the size field could be different to the storage size. **Update**: I assume it is not being done because that would mean an extra SSTORE call, which increases the cost.\n\nAlternatively would a specific method make sense which upon deleting an item, will move the rest of the array back? e.g. after deleting item 3 in [1, 2, 3, 4] would result in [1, 2, 4]\n\nI assume that would cost more gas, but would eliminate gas usage in other parts of the code when checking for empty items or transforming arrays for the same reason.\n",
