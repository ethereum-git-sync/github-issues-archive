  "body": "We provide nightly builds in solc-bin but these are emscripten-only. The static build artifacts on `develop` in the main repo can also be used as nightlies but this is not apparent to users and explaining how to get them is not very straightforward. There are a few things we could do to improve this situation:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add `b_ubu_static`, `b_win` and `b_osx` runs to the `nightly` workflow. This will make it easier for users to locate nightlies when they look into our CI.\r\n- Expand the [solc-bin `README`](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/blob/gh-pages/README.md)\r\n    - [ ] Document how to get nightlies from CircleCI. Point out that `b_ubu_static`, `b_win`, `b_osx` and `b_ems` jobs produce static binaries and upload them as artifacts. Explain how to find the right workflow in CircleCI.\r\n    - [ ] Add more info about the structure of solc-bin. What is in each dir and that there are lists with meta information. Use the info that's already available in [docs on Static Binaries](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/installing-solidity.html#static-binaries).\r\n    - [ ] Add links to latest binaries and nightlies. [`bin/soljson-nightly.js`](https://binaries.soliditylang.org/bin/soljson-nightly.js), [`bin/soljson-latest.js`](https://binaries.soliditylang.org/bin/soljson-latest.js), etc. Their locations do not change so it's possible to have a direct link in the README.\r\n- Make static builds available at https://binaries.soliditylang.org\r\n    - [ ] Add a job to the nightly workflow to upload the static binaries to our S3 bucket.\r\n        - Use the `aws s3` utility (like we do in [`s3-mirror`](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/blob/gh-pages/.github/workflows/s3-mirror.yml) workflow and [`sync-s3.sh`](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/blob/gh-pages/sync-s3.sh) script).\r\n        - The simplest option is to upload to the `solc-bin` bucket under some path that's not currently in use (e.g. `nightly/`). You'll just need to [exclude it in the S3 sync script](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/blob/gh-pages/sync-s3.sh#L58-L62) to ensure the script does not delete the files when syncing. There should also be a check that this path does not exist in `solc-bin`.\r\n        - Using a separate bucket is also an option but then the content will not be served from under the `binaries.soliditylang.org` domain. This might still be acceptable given that we'll have links in the `README` though.\r\n        - We only need the latest nightly - no need to version them. They should be available at a predefined path that does not change. Each new upload can overwrite the existing nightlies. The old binaries are still available in CI for some time.\r\n    - [ ] Add static links to these new nightlies in the `README`.",

This was fixed for recent builds by #13581/https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/pull/123.

    "body": "> Sorry, I lack the context, what are the reported versions?\r\n\r\nBy \"reported versions\" i mean the stuff printed by `solc --version` or the `version()` method. That ideally should match the file name, but historically it unfortunately did not.\r\n\r\n> What do you mean by wild version strings? I checked them in [list.txt](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/blob/gh-pages/bin/list.txt) and they seem to be pretty consistent. This should fix it right?\r\n\r\n`list.txt` has file names, not reported versions. Take a look at releases below 0.4.0 in https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/pull/64#issuecomment-711221554 if you want to see what I mean. I checked what all the binaries reported back when I was doing macOS rebuilds and below 0.4.0 you may get stuff like `0.2.0-4dc2445e/.-Emscripten/clang/int linked to libethereum-1.1.0-34716679/.-Emscripten/clang/int`.\r\n\r\nVersions reported by nightlies actually look more reasonable there but that's only because we temporarily removed pre-0.4 binaries from the repo when we were running out of space on GH pages (they're back now). You can see that on 0.4.1 the version string was wild enough that solc-js was choking on it (I think we either fixed that since then or at least https://github.com/ethereum/solc-js/pull/563 will fix it).\r\n\r\n> But I think we should handle nightlies and this simple fix should do it: \r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/sourcify/commit/cee9d7258715a2ba796664c295f754874e668a3c . \r\n\r\nWell, should be good enough for now but these strings historically were much more complicated and this reminds me that we actually have a mechanism in solc-js for cleaning them - [`versionToSemver()`](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-js/blob/bf497208bed235c2cd0b9bc8c2db16a302168ccc/translate.ts#L3-L26). We should make it handle the `ci` variant and then you'll be able to simply use that function and not care how dirty the version string is.",

It won't translate `ci` to `nightly`, but I'm not sure we actually want that - `ci` is valid for builds that actually come from our main CI and it's hard to distinguish them from solc-bin nightlies.
