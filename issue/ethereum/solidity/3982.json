I think @elopio is owner of the solc pakge in snap store, so only he can do it.\r\n\r\n> I think it is selected for auto-build. Perhaps it does not build on all branches?\r\n > this has to do with the version-script not working as expected.\r\n\r\nbuild.snapcraft.io will only trigger build for commit to default branch (in our case \"develop\"), but as all releases are tagged from \"release\" branch, no stable package will be build. To fix that we need config [source-branch](https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/auto-build-on-build-snapcraft-io-questions/5278/2) to \"release\". \r\n\r\nAlso it is not possible to use build.snapcraft.io to build multiple branches and push to multiple channels.\r\n\r\nI created https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4065 to address these problems. We should get tagged releases auto build and push to snap store after merging it.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: I'm not a snap expert and I don't know how to test my changes properly. ",
