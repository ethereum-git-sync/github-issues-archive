Thus, it is very important to make it complete and clear. Currently the Solidity README includes many links to other documents without a clear sequence or intended audience. In particular, this document does not explain the proper way to responsibly disclose security vulnerabilities found in the code.\r\nConsider following the recommendations of [Standard Readme](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme) about sections, content and formatting.",
