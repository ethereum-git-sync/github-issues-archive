  "body": "Continuing the discussion from #10672.\r\n\r\nOpenZeppelin uses Buidler as its build system while our `test/externalTests/zeppelin.sh` attempts to use Truffle to build it. It appears to work but only because the whole thing does not fail too easily and has multiple failsafes where default things get used/downloaded when not available:\r\n- We launch Truffle via `npx truffle compile`. `npx` just installs it if it's not available instead of failing.\r\n- `prepare` command in OpenZeppelin's `package.json` compiles the contracts using Buidler anyway.\r\n- The Truffle config that `test/externalTests/common.sh` creates is completely ignored. Tests run on Buidler instead (which is good) but they're just using the compiler binary it downloads (rather the one built in the CI).\r\n\r\n`test/externalTests/zeppelin.sh` / `test/externalTests/common.sh` need to be fixed to stop trying to use Truffle for this test and to make Buidler use the right binary.",
