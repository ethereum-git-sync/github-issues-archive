    "body": "Notes from the call today:\r\n- Bytecode comparisons are not a part of the release process so they do not introduce a delay there, unlike the binary builds (#9932).\r\n- The biggest issue with having it in Travis is that we can only do the check after the merge to `develop`.\r\n- Apart from just moving it, we also want to change the way it works:\r\n    - The generated bytecode should be an artifact in CircleCI.\r\n    - There should be a job that depends on all the jobs that produce bytecode for specific platforms and compares it. This way we can get rid of the [solidity-test-bytecode](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity-test-bytecode) repo.",
