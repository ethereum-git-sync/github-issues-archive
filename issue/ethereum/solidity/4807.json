    "body": "Hey @chriseth, I've been maintaining [a fork](https://github.com/solidity-parser/antlr) of the solidity ANTLR grammar for some months, and many projects are already depending on it. Of course, it would make much more sense for this grammar to live under `ethereum/solidity`. Do you think we could unify efforts here?\r\n\r\nI think something like this would allow some testing strategies to make sure the grammar is up to date. For example, the test suite could generate the ANTLR parser and run it with the solidity files used for testing the compiler.",

    "body": "Yeah, that has to do with how ANTLR works. If you don't do that, then there are some ambiguities when the code is parsed. For example, if you have a function `function receive` it can't tell if it's an `Identifier` or a literal `receive` keyword. So that's the way to fix it. (Maybe there's a better way, but I couldn't find one).",
