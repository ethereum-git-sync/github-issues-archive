  "body": "Currently it's not possible to bind an external library function to a type. This restriction does not make much sense because it's still possible to bind public functions and bound public library functions are always called externally. So it does not prevent external calls, it just makes doing them harder in some cases.\r\n\r\nWe should allow binding external functions as well.\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nlibrary L {\r\n    function publicFunction(uint) public {}\r\n    function externalFunction(uint) external {}\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract C {\r\n    using {L.publicFunction} for uint;\r\n    //using {L.externalFunction} for uint; // Error: Identifier not found or not unique.\r\n\r\n    function test() public {\r\n        uint x;\r\n        x.publicFunction();      // Allowed, makes an external call\r\n        //x.externalFunction();  // Disallowed\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm marking this as a bug because after discussing this, it seems to me that this was not an intentional restriction. Especially given that the `using L for T` form does not have this restriction:\r\n```solidity\r\nlibrary L {\r\n    function publicFunction(uint) public {}\r\n    function externalFunction(uint) external {}\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract D {\r\n    using L for uint;\r\n\r\n    function test() public {\r\n        uint x;\r\n        x.publicFunction();   // Allowed, makes an external call\r\n        x.externalFunction(); // Allowed, makes an external call\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```",
