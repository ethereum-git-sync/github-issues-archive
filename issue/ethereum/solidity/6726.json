  "body": "Code that is common in all branches of the same control flow should be moved prior to the branch point. This might be especially interesting for loop invariant code motion, but could also be useful for if and switch statements.\r\n\r\nExample, taken from the SolYul code gen:\r\n```\r\nlet selector := shift_right_224_unsigned(calldataload(0))\r\nswitch selector\r\ncase 0x26121ff0\r\n{\r\n    if callvalue() { revert(0, 0) }\r\n    fun_f_4()\r\n    return(0, 0)\r\n}\r\ncase 0xe2179b8e\r\n{\r\n    if callvalue() { revert(0, 0) }\r\n    fun_g_5()\r\n    return(0, 0)\r\n}\r\ndefault { revert(0, 0) }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `callvalue` check can obviously be done before the switch: The `default` case does not have a callvalue check, but it does revert. This might be a tricky decision depending on the cost of the common code (it might even contain a revert itself!). In contracts in general, there will be payable and non-payable functions and those can be grouped: The switch can be split into one case that does not have the common code and the other case that has the common code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nswitch x\r\ncase 1: ...\r\ncase 2: ...\r\ncase 3: ...\r\ndefault {\r\n  <common code>\r\n  switch x\r\n    case 4: ...\r\n    case 5: ...\r\n    case 6: ...\r\n    default: ...\r\n }\r\n```",
