This will create the tarball in a directory called ``upload``.\r\n - [x] Take the tarball from the upload directory (its name should be ``solidity_x.x.x.tar.gz``, otherwise ``prerelease.txt`` was missing in the step before) and upload the source tarball to the release page.\r\n - [x] Take the ``github-binaries.tar`` tarball from ``c_release_binaries`` run of the tagged commit in circle-ci and add all binaries from it to the release page.\r\n       Make sure it contains four binaries: ``solc-windows.exe``, ``solc-macos``, ``solc-static-linux`` and ``soljson.js``.\r\n - [x] Take the ``solc-bin-binaries.tar`` tarball from ``c_release_binaries`` run of the tagged commit in circle-ci and add all binaries from it to solc-bin.\r\n - [x] Run ``npm run update -- --reuse-hashes`` in ``solc-bin`` and verify that the script has updated ``list.js``, ``list.txt`` and ``list.json`` files correctly and that symlinks to the new release have been added in ``solc-bin/wasm/`` and ``solc-bin/emscripten-wasm32/``.\r\n - [x] Create a pull request in solc-bin and merge.\r\n\r\n### Homebrew and MacOS\r\n - [x] Update the version and the hash (``sha256sum solidity_$VERSION.tar.gz``) in the [``solidity`` formula in Homebrew core repository](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/solidity.rb).\r\n   - [x] https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/137008\r\n - [x] Update the version and the hash (``sha256sum solidity_$VERSION.tar.gz``) in [our custom ``solidity`` Homebrew formula](https://github.com/ethereum/homebrew-ethereum/blob/master/solidity.rb).\r\n   - [x] https://github.com/ethereum/homebrew-ethereum/pull/325 \r\n\r\n### Docker\r\n - [x] Run ``./scripts/docker_deploy_manual.sh v$VERSION``.\r\n     - [`0.8.21`](https://hub.docker.com/layers/ethereum/solc/0.8.21/images/sha256-b202f06c06631c1139e36465d80709cfdc8ec1bf9e405bb73ec512ffe90ccf80)\r\n     - [`0.8.21-alpine`](https://hub.docker.com/layers/ethereum/solc/0.8.21-alpine/images/sha256-4ca6e60fd07f6e622755335131c94a36a41728e27942e38bfc5abb78ddb1fa8b)\r\n\r\n### PPA\r\n - [x] Create ``.release_ppa_auth`` at the root of your local Solidity checkout and set ``LAUNCHPAD_EMAIL`` and ``LAUNCHPAD_KEYID`` to your key's email and key id.\r\n - [x] Double-check that the ``DISTRIBUTIONS`` list in ``scripts/release_ppa.sh`` and ``scripts/deps-ppa/static_z3.sh`` contains the most recent versions of Ubuntu.\r\n - [x] Make sure the [``~ethereum/cpp-build-deps`` PPA repository](https://launchpad.net/~ethereum/+archive/ubuntu/cpp-build-deps) contains ``libz3-static-dev builds`` for all current versions of Ubuntu.\r\n       Note that it may be included in the ``z3-static`` multipackage (follow the ``View package details`` link to check).\r\n       If not present, run ``scripts/deps-ppa/static_z3.sh`` and wait for the builds to succeed before continuing.\r\n - [x] Run ``scripts/release_ppa.sh v$VERSION`` to create the PPA release.\r\n       This will create a single package containing static binary for older Ubuntu versions in the [``~ethereum/ethereum-static`` PPA](https://launchpad.net/~ethereum/+archive/ubuntu/ethereum-static)\r\n       and separate packages with dynamically-linked binaries for recent versions (those listed in ``DISTRIBUTIONS``) in the [``~ethereum/ethereum`` PPA](https://launchpad.net/~ethereum/+archive/ubuntu/ethereum).\r\n - [x] Wait for the build to be finished and published for *all architectures* (currently we only build for ``amd64``, but we may add ``arm`` in the future).\r\n       **SERIOUSLY: DO NOT PROCEED EARLIER!!!**\r\n    - [x] [static binary](https://launchpad.net/~ethereum/+archive/ubuntu/ethereum-static/+sourcepub/15028715/+listing-archive-extra)\r\n    - [x] focal\r\n    - [x] jammy\r\n    - [x] kinetic\r\n    - [x] lunar\r\n - [x] *After* the package with the static build is *published*, use it to create packages for older Ubuntu versions.\r\n       Copy the static package to the [``~ethereum/ethereum`` PPA](https://launchpad.net/~ethereum/+archive/ubuntu/ethereum)\r\n       for the destination series ``Trusty``, ``Xenial`` and ``Bionic`` while selecting ``Copy existing binaries``.\r\n\r\n### Release solc-js\r\n - [x] Wait until solc-bin was properly deployed. You can test this via remix - a test run through remix is advisable anyway.\r\n - [x] Increment the version number, create a pull request for that, merge it after tests succeeded.\r\n - [x] Run ``npm run build:tarball`` in the updated ``solc-js`` repository to create ``solc-<version>.tgz``. Inspect the tarball to ensure that it contains an up to date compiler binary.\r\n - [x] Run ``npm run publish:tarball`` to publish the newly created tarball.\r\n - [x] Create a tag using ``git tag --annotate v$VERSION`` and push it with ``git push --tags``.\r\n\r\n### Post-release\r\n - [x] Make sure the documentation for the new release has been published successfully.\r\n       Go to the [documentation status page at ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/solidity/) and verify that the new version is listed, works and is marked as default.\r\n - [x] Remove \"still in progress\" warning from the [release notes](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases).\r\n - [x] Merge the [blog posts](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity-blog/pulls) related to the release.\r\n - [x] Create a commit to increase the version number on ``develop`` in ``CMakeLists.txt`` and add a new skeleton changelog entry.\r\n   - [x] https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14423\r\n - [x] Update the release information section [in the source of soliditylang.org](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity-portal/blob/master/index.html).\r\n - [x] Announce on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/solidity_lang), including links to the release and the blog post.\r\n - [x] Announce on [Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org/@solidity/), including links to the release and the blog post.\r\n - [x] Share the announcement on Reddit in [``/r/ethdev``](https://reddit.com/r/ethdev/), cross-posted to [``/r/ethereum``](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/).\r\n - [x] Share the announcement on the [Solidity forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) in the ``Announcements`` category.\r\n - [x] Share the announcement on [Project Updates](https://discord.com/channels/420394352083337236/798974456704925696)\r\n - [x] Share the announcement on [`#solidity` channel on Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#ethereum_solidity:gitter.im)\r\n - [x] Share the announcement on [`#solc-tooling`](https://matrix.to/#/#solc-tooling:matrix.org)\r\n - [x] Lean back, wait for bug reports and repeat from step 1 :).",
