  "body": "## Abstract\r\n\r\nThis is a feature request for the optimizer to inline functions in a specific case.\r\n\r\nIf a function only use variables passed as argument, inlining the function does not increase the variables on the stack and therefore cannot cause a \"Stack too deep\" error.  It should be reasonably straightforward to inline such functions.  If such a function is private or internal and is only used once, it would always be more efficient to inline this function.\r\n\r\nThis feature request was suggested in a comment in #12782\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nThe issue describes a specific case in which inlining functions is always more efficient.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nWhenever a private or internal function is only used once and this function uses only variables that are passed as argument, the function should be inlined.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nThis feature request does not change the language and does not impact backward compatibility.",
