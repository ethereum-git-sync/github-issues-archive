  "body": "I'm working on program analysis for EVM bytecode and it would be very useful to be able to map errors on in the bytecode back to errors in the source code (e.g., written in Solidity).\r\n\r\nOne way to achieve this would be to record some additional information during compilation. For instance, in .Net .pdb-files are used for this purpose. I was thinking it might be nice to support something similar for Solidity by, for instance, producing a JSON output like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    Instructions: [ { Offset: K, SourceLine: N, SourceColumn: M, SourceFile: \"foo.sol\", SourceExpression: \"a + b\" } ... ],\r\n    Compiler: \"solc\",\r\n    Version: \"X.Y\",\r\n    Code: [ { Filename: \"foo.sol\", Code: \"...\" } ... ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe instruction mapping is crucial, but the other meta data might also be useful to produce optionally.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to hear if others would also find this useful and if there are other or easier ways to achieve this.",
