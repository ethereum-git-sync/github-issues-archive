    "body": "@ekpyron Not exactly. That part talks about the mechanism of `payable` and `non-payable`.\r\nMy question isn't about the convertibility of `payable` to `non-payable`. That definitely makes sense. I understand it.\r\nMy problem however is in this paragraph:\r\n\r\n> A function type `A` is implicitly convertible to a function type `B` if and only if [...] the state mutability of `A` is _more restrictive_ than the state mutability of `B`. In particular: [...] `payable` functions can be converted to `non-payable` functions.\r\n\r\nThis is completely contradictory from my point of view. That's why I did the comparison of `A = payable` and `B = non-payable`.\r\nThe first part says `A` can be converted to `B` if `A` is _more restrictive_. But `A`, which is `payable` is supposed to be _less restrictive_ than `non-payable`.\r\n\r\nAm I getting it wrong?",
