    "body": "I believe this issue has its roots in a discussion @acoglio and I had with @leonardoalt .\r\n\r\nIn order to verify the correctness of specific applications of Yul optimizers, you need the before and after Yul code.\r\n\r\nRight now, the \"standard JSON\" form can contain \"ir\" and \"irOptimized\", but those are source code, not ASTs.  Yul surface syntax is unambiguous so that's not too bad.  It does require that we trust the prettyprinter and that we have a formal grammar and parser.  (We have those now.  E.g., the [ABNF grammar](https://github.com/acl2/acl2/blob/master/books/kestrel/yul/language/abnf-grammar-new.txt) could be useful to others.)\r\n\r\nHowever, it would be higher assurance if, in addition to the before and after Yul code, the before and after internal ASTs (that are input and output to the optimizers) could be serialized to the JSON output structure, as @Marenz suggests.\r\n",

Not sure if it makes any difference to your grammar definition (it might not be 1:1 with yours) but I see you do have `yul-path` there.",
