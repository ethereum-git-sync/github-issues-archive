Yul surface syntax is unambiguous so that's not too bad.  It does require that we trust the prettyprinter and that we have a formal grammar and parser.  (We have those now.  E.g., the [ABNF grammar](https://github.com/acl2/acl2/blob/master/books/kestrel/yul/language/abnf-grammar-new.txt) could be useful to others.)\r\n\r\nHowever, it would be higher assurance if, in addition to the before and after Yul code, the before and after internal ASTs (that are input and output to the optimizers) could be serialized to the JSON output structure, as @Marenz suggests.\r\n",
