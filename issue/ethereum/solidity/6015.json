  "body": "With Constantinople we have SHL/SHR opcodes and the codegen already utilises that if shift operators are being used. There is also an optimisation rule to replace shifts of constants with a constant.\r\n\r\nHowever due to a missing feature (passing EVM version) to simplification rules we do not have any to transform div/mul.\r\n\r\nThe rule should be as follows:\r\n- `div(x, y)` where y is a power of 2 can be transformed to `shr(x, log2(y))` where `log2(y)` should be precomputed of course\r\n- same with `mul(x, y)` -> `shl(x, log2(y))`\r\n\r\nThis should help to optimise code where shifts are used in inline assembly. One good example is ENS' [solsha1](https://github.com/ensdomains/solsha1).\r\n\r\n@ekpyron @chriseth any ideas how to introduce EVM version dependent rules into the simplificationrules?",
