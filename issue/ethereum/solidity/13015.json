  "body": "## Abstract\r\n\r\nAdd pre-release/nightly builds inside the list of solidity static binaries.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nFollowing the official documentation (https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/installing-solidity.html#static-binaries), suggested static binaries can be listed from https://binaries.soliditylang.org/emscripten-wasm32/list.json, with https://binaries.soliditylang.org/emscripten-asmjs/list.json as a fallback.\r\n\r\nThose lists don't include nightly builds, as the old and deprecated URLs do (i.e., https://ethereum.github.io/solc-bin/bin/list.json)\r\n\r\nExternal tools require listing nightly and release builds (i.e., Truffle: https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/pull/5008), so currently, the only way to do it is to link old and deprecated URLs.\r\n\r\nWe want to have pre-release/nightly builds inside the list of solidity static binaries.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nFollowing a discussion with @cameel (https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/pull/5008), we can keep the current folder and list.json, and we can create a subfolder with all builds (release and nightly) and another list.json listing all versions.\r\n\r\nThe final result would be something like this:\r\n\r\n- https://binaries.soliditylang.org/emscripten-wasm32/list.json\r\n- https://binaries.soliditylang.org/emscripten-wasm32/full-list/list.json\r\n- https://binaries.soliditylang.org/emscripten-asmjs/list.json (fallback)\r\n- https://binaries.soliditylang.org/emscripten-asmjs/full-list/list.json (fallback)\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nBecause we are adding a new subfolder, no one will be affected by this update. Developers can update their tools progressively to point to the new subfolder/list at their own pace and needs.\r\n",

    "body": "I talked briefly about it with @ekpyron and we do not see any big reasons not to do it other than the fact that having huge dirs in a git repo makes them hard to browse. I think that most users do not go the directly though and creating a subdirectory would alleviate that problem.\r\n\r\nI'd rather just create a subdir specifically for nightlies though. I think that having things duplicated too many times in the structure can be really confusing. We already have a lot of symlinks going back and forth. I think structure should be this:\r\n- `emscripten-wasm32/`\r\n    - `list.json`\r\n    - *release binaries*\r\n    - `nightly/`\r\n        - `list.json`\r\n        - *nightly binaries*\r\n- Similarly for `emscripten-asmjs/`\r\n\r\n@chriseth What do you think about this?",

    "body": "Another idea: we could put nightlies in a subdir but keep a single `list.json`.\r\n\r\nThe only problem is that on the list you'd now have paths rather than just file names. Clients assuming filenames would have problems. But I think that we're still at the point where tools are transitioning to `emscripten-wasm32/` and `emscripten-asmjs/` and most still use `bin/` and `wasm/` so we can be flexible with the new dirs.",
