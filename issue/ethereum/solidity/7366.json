  "body": "## Abstract\r\nCurrently, the [install_deps.sh](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/scripts/install_deps.sh) script does not support macOS Catalina. Although Catalina is still in beta, I made the mistake of installing my mac a few days ago. Thus, I cannot utilize the `install_deps.sh` script in projects like py-solc-x.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nReverting back to Mojave is a pain and lots of people will soon be upgrading to Catalina when it comes out of beta.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nIt seems to be just a matter of adding a line to support Catalina here:\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/7dcc47ed57f5a6ea3761e54da5a4d7bbe055b5a7/scripts/install_deps.sh#L73-L98\r\n\r\nI'd appreciate any feedback if you think there are other locations where this update needs to be applied.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nI don't think this will impact any previous versions.",
