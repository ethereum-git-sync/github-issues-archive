  "body": "## Page\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.21/security-considerations.html\r\n\r\n## Abstract\r\nIncluding a specific security contact in a smart contract simplifies vulnerability reporting. This helps prevent miscommunication and lets code owners control the disclosure channel. Moreover, if contracts utilize third-party libraries such as Openzeppelin, and issues appear within these libraries, the developers of these libraries can easily contact code owners to mitigate the issues.\r\n\r\nI propose to formalize a concept that has been previously proposed in [ethereum-lists/contracts](https://github.com/ethereum-lists/contracts#tracking-new-deployments) and implemented within the Openzeppelin Wizard. This involves the utilization of the NatSpec tag `custom` and use the name \"security-contact\".\r\n\r\n#### Example:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n/**\r\n * @title Example contract\r\n * @custom:security-contact security@example.com\r\n */\r\ncontract Example {\r\n ... \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe idea is to include a new section right after the [Ask for Peer Review](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.21/security-considerations.html#ask-for-peer-review), which advocates for the adoption of this security contact convention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
