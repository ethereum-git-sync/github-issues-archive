This could arguably be a trivial info to have, but still would be helpful to an official note about this.\r\n\r\nWould be helpful if the case is discussed wrt different ways of ether transfer (`send()`, `transfer()`, `call()`)\r\n\r\nPS: Apologies if I missed the explanation from elsewhere\r\n\r\n## Pull request\r\nNil\r\n<!--Please link to your pull request which resolves this issue.-->\r\n",
