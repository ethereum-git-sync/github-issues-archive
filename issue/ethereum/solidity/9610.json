We can talk about it at the [design call next Wednesday](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html#team-calls). Also, a reminder that the design calls are open in case anyone would like to join. The decision here looks straightforward to me though (I think we should not report an error here) so I don't really expect much discussion to be necessary.\r\n\r\nSo basically #11889 is a duplicate of this.
