    "body": "@yozaam Besides `SourceReferenceFormatter`, the class `SourceReferenceFormatterHuman` probably needs to be touched as well. The latter one is used to generate human-readable error output, which is not necessarily given for `SourceReferenceFormatter`.\r\n\r\n> https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/be0775da499415911b6be891e7ab60cc09e676c2/liblangutil/SourceReferenceFormatter.cpp#L87\r\n> \r\n> This is the function, that sends the ref to the `printSourceLocation();`\r\n> \r\n> And in printSourceLocation();\r\n> \r\n> https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/be0775da499415911b6be891e7ab60cc09e676c2/liblangutil/SourceReferenceFormatter.cpp#L37-L43\r\n> \r\n> Here we should put one more `else if(all lines of the program) { don't do anything }`\r\n> \r\n\r\nI think applying the change you've sketched could be a good starting point.\r\n\r\n> Also, can we see the .message contents and if it is from a pragma error, not call printSourceLocation here?\r\n> \r\n> https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/be0775da499415911b6be891e7ab60cc09e676c2/liblangutil/SourceReferenceFormatter.cpp#L91\r\n\r\nI don't think that this is needed. The error itself should be still printed even with your change. `printSourceLocation()` only handles (as the name says) source locations :wink:\r\n\r\nYou need to test your changes by adding a new folder to `/test/cmdlineTests/` and adding three files to it. An `input.sol` file, containing the source you want to test, an `err` file, containing the compiler output you expect (here without the source location), and an `exit` file, containing `1` as the expected return code. Please make sure to also check `/test/cmdlineTests/` for further details on how to write command line tests.\r\n\r\nThe above is needed to test the changes in `SourceReferenceFormatterHuman`, you can do all steps above for `SourceReferenceFormatter` by adding `--old-reporter` to the commandline arguments of the second test case in order to engage it instead of the new `SourceReferenceFormatterHuman`.\r\n\r\nTests can be run by invoking `./test/cmdlineTests.sh`. Please make sure all tests are passing.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> Wow, I hope I am not giving you too much trouble sweat_smile\r\n\r\nNo worries, could you please open a pull request with your changes and the tests mentioned above? Thanks!\r\n",
