  "body": "## Description\r\nIf you try to assemble a file using a different name than the one included in the `@use-src` annotation, the compiler crashes. \r\n\r\nThere must be some additional factors involved because it only happens in specific circumstances. For example in the example below the problem goes away if I remove any of the annotation or if I do not use `calldataload(0)`.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n- `input.yul`\r\n    ```yul\r\n    /// @use-src 0:\"input.sol\"\r\n    object \"C\" {\r\n        code {\r\n            /// @src 0:0:0\r\n            calldataload(0)\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n```bash\r\nsolc --strict-assembly input.yul\r\n```\r\n```\r\nWarning: Yul is still experimental. Please use the output with care.\r\nterminate called after throwing an instance of 'boost::wrapexcept<solidity::yul::YulAssertion>'\r\n  what():\r\nAborted (core dumped)\r\n```\r\nNote that we don't have a handler for `InternalCompilerError`s in assembly mode. #11732 should fix that.\r\n\r\nThe assertion failure happens at https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/e28d00a76daa0747f00ffe47cea17862bca55771/libyul/AssemblyStack.cpp#L94\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n- Compiler version: Happens both on 0.8.7 and on the latest code from `develop`.",
