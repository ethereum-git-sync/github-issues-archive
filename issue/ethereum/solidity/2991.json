    "body": "Just wanted to note that if we do decide to go forward with it, a good way to resolve the ambiguity would be to allow leaving the type in the tuple declaration when the component is not used. I.e. being able to do `(T1 a, T2, T3 c)` instead of the current `(T1 a,, T3 c)`. Doing it that way would also be non-breaking because this is currently a syntax error - we could allow trailing commas only in that form.",

    "body": "As far as I'm concerned, we should never have gone for the weird non-uniform ``(T1 a, T2 b, T3 c) = ...`` syntax anyways and rather have made it ``(T1, T2, T3) (a,b,c) = ...``. I was outvoted back then and I do see the readability difference, but the latter is that much more uniform that it'd have paid of a lot in the long run... once we tackle having proper namable tuple types we'll probably have to get back to this.\r\n\r\nBut for the time being, I seriously think we shouldn't mess with the commas here - it'll have even further implications for type uniformity. We can revisit this once our type system is fully future-proofed - only then all potential issues with this will become apparent.",
