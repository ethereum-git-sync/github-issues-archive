    "body": "@axic You asked me to go through the Instruction list:\r\n\r\n``RETURN`` and ``STOP`` might be something to think about... maybe ``RETURNTX`` or ``TXRETURN`` would be nicer - but I don't like either of them visually...\r\nBut then we'd also need ``TXABORT`` or ``TXINVALID`` and ``TXREVERT``... which starts getting silly...\r\n\r\nSo probably better no explicit `TX` for those, but then referring to the transaction becomes (somewhat of) a *default*, which means:\r\n- I *don't* think we need the TX ones proposed in the magician thread, i.e. ``ORIGIN->TXORIGIN`` and ``GASPRICE->TXGASPRICE``.\r\n- This strengthens the need for ``GASLIMIT -> BLOCKGASLIMIT``.\r\n\r\n``LOG2`` looks like a bit like a base-2-logarithm... but it's fine I think...\r\n\r\n``JUMPI`` also isn't *that* nice... I see that there's also ``JUMPIF`` for some subroutine EIP... the latter ``JUMPIF`` should probably be ``JUMPSUBI`` or ``JUMPSUBIF`` and ``JUMPI`` could be ``JUMPIF``... or ``CONDJUMP``... but yeah, all of this is a bit weird, so maybe none of it is better than doing nothing...\r\n\r\nSo in summary:\r\n- I'd definitely agree with the need for ``GASLIMIT -> BLOCKGASLIMIT``\r\n- Prepending ``TX`` to some of them would be kind of inconsistent, if not done for *everything* relating to the transaction - and that would look silly...\r\n- The rest of the instructions not mentioned in the magician thread nor the EIP seem fine to me.\r\n- Bitwise operations may still be worth a thought.\r\n\r\nRegarding the others mentioned in the EIP and/or the thread:\r\n- ``NUMBER -> BLOCKNUMBER`` would be nice for making the ``BLOCK`` prefix consistent.\r\n- ``BALANCE -> EXTBALANCE`` is also a good one\r\n- Arguably prepending ``SELF`` to any of the others is only due to ``BALANCE`` not already having been renamed to ``EXTBALANCE``... unfortunately renaming both ``BALANCE -> EXTBALANCE`` and ``SELFBALANCE -> BALANCE`` at the same time is too dangerous and not an option... so prepending ``SELF`` does make sense - but it's a bit propagating a hack...\r\n- Pro prepending ``SELF`` would be that I said earlier that ``TX`` seems to be the \"default\" - but that's not a good argument, because this distinction should be clear from the respective names, so since ``SELF`` and ``TX`` have no overlap, they could both be implicit defaults at the same time.\r\n\r\nSo yeah, I definitely agree with axic on ``GASLIMIT -> BLOCKGASLIMIT`` being important. Renaming ``INVALID -> ABORT`` makes sense. ``BALANCE -> EXTBALANCE`` and ``NUMBER -> BLOCKNUMBER`` might be good further candidates. Anything else would probably be more controversial.",

    "body": "I think @ekpyron's feedback on `EXT` vs `SELF` is spot on, not sure how to resolve that. What seems to be better is to keep the `EXT` prefix and remove the `SELF` prefix, because that was the only out-of-order late addition. Perhaps it could be done over the course of some longer period.\r\n\r\nThe reasoning about `TX` is also an interesting one. I think the prefix-less opcodes deal with account state *and* transaction state at the same time. It would be nice separating those two, but arguably adding `TX` would mean adding it to a lot of things (like `RETURN`, etc.) so perhaps the better direction is adding the `ACCOUNT` or `SELF` prefixes for the account state?",

    "body": "Generally speaking I am absolutely for renaming opcode mnemonics for better intuitivity/readability.\r\n\r\nIn this case, it reads like you are also namespacing with some prefix/suffix to resolve ambiguity, such as NUMBER to BLOCKNUMBER or GASPRICE to TXGASPRICE, which I think is good, too.\r\n\r\nOne would have to see how much redundancy would be created when applying the above idea to *all* opcode mnemonics to see if that change is justified.\r\n\r\nOther changes (GAS -> GASLEFT, INVALID -> ABORT, NOT -> BNOT) I think are more intuitive to read, too.\r\n\r\np.s.: I think if we first provide an stdlib, then there might be fewer need of actively writing inline assembly by others /libs, hence, the renames would be feel less intrusive to those, IMHO.",
