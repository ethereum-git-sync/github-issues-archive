    "body": "Both ganache and Remix use ethereumjs-vm and this seems to be a problem with ganache using an old version. `redPow` is used internally to do exponentiation, and on pre-constantinople EVM, shifts are done using a combination of multiplication/division and exponentiation.\r\n\r\nWhile both of these tools are good to get some initial idea if something might be broken, I would not at all rely on their accuracy of implementing the EVM specification.\r\n\r\nThe best is to use a consensus passing client with Remix or Truffle or just manually examine the generated EVM bytecode by Solidity.\r\n\r\nAlternatively one could add a test case to `tests/libsolidity/SolidityEndToEnd.cpp` which will be run through aleth, another consensus passing client.",

    "body": "Thank you very much for the information, Alex.  I can confirm that ethereumjs-testrpc-sc appears to use an outdated ethereumjs-vm fork (already found another case - \"Error: Already a number in reduction context\" - , which cannot be reproduced in Remix either). I'll take it to the truffle / ganache-cli developers. \r\n\r\nI've tried your suggestion of getting started with aleth, but this hasn't worked for me so far. I asked in various gitter chats, but haven't received much of a response apart from: it's an unusual combination which may be unlikely to work.\r\n\r\nI got aleth and truffle to exchange a few RPC messages, but then truffle fails with: \"Error: Don't set config.from directly. Instead, set config.networks and then config.networks[<network name>].from\"\r\n\r\nGuess I may have to debug and fix it myself or give up on optimization tests for now.\r\n\r\nAny word from you on truffle's decision to disable optimization by default due to previous issues: https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle-compile/pull/5 ?\r\n\r\nIs this negative stance on optimization blown out of proportion / outdated?",
