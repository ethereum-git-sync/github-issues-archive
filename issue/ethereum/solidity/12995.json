  "body": "## Abstract\r\n\r\nA variadic function `print(...)` that would emit a `log*` with `abi` encoded data of its arguments.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nIt's typical for testing frameworks / debugging setups to have some way to print the value of variables.\r\n\r\nFor Hardhat, this is [`console.log`](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/blob/master/packages/hardhat-core/console.sol). For dapptools and foundry, this is [`log_uint` etc](https://github.com/dapphub/ds-test/blob/master/src/test.sol#L22-L36).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nThe (dapptools / foundry) implementation is fairly simple. `print(a, b, c)` is equivalent to emitting the following `bytes`: `abi.encode(a, b, c)`. However, testing tools would want to know how to decode this. Therefore, the first (or perhaps the second?) topic should be a marker for the types. This can probably be emitted in the JSON output for ABI. The tool can then lookup the hash to understand the types and do a `abi.decode` to get back the data.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor hardhat implementation, it seems to do a `staticcall` to a magic address. This is an alternative to consider for implementation.\r\n\r\nWe should also consider introducing a `--debug` flag. Where compiler would warn about `print` if `--debug` flag is not set.\r\n\r\n",
