For particular contract, byte code length is the same on all platforms, as well as first (length-34) bytes and last two bytes.  So the different part is always located between (length-34) and (length-2).  The length of different part is always 32 bytes.  Content of the different part seems to depend on the code of smart contract.  I tried to disassemble the different part and it looks like garbage.",

Probably metadata should be somehow normalized before hashing.",
