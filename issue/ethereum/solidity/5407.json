  "body": "Currently, unused stack slots are only assigned to be re-used if the variable that occupied it was declared in the current scope. The reason behind was that the stack layout has to be he same at control flow joins. This can be improved in the following two ways:\r\n\r\n - allow reuse of stack slots if there is no issue with control flow (for example simple nested blocks)\r\n - allow reuse of stack slots of function parameters\r\n\r\nIt might also be worthwhile rewriting the EVMCodeTransform for the special case of strict assembly.",
