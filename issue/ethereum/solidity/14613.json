We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.\n- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:\n    - [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)\n    - [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)\n- Ensure the issue isn't already reported (check `feature` and `language design` labels).\n- If you feel uncertain about your feature request, perhaps it's better to open a language design or feedback forum thread via the issue selector, or by going to the forum directly.\n    - [Solidity forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org/)\n\n*Delete the above section and the instructions in the sections below before submitting*\n-->\n\n## Abstract\n\n<!--Please describe by example what problem you see in the current Solidity language and reason about it.-->\n\n## Motivation\n\n<!--In this section you describe how you propose to address the problem you described earlier, including by giving one or more exemplary source code snippets for demonstration.-->\n\n## Specification\n\n<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow any developer to implement the functionality.-->\n\n## Backwards Compatibility\n\n<!--\nAll language changes that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity.\n\nPlease describe how you propose to deal with these incompatibilities.\n-->\n",
