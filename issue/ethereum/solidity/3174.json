  "body": "This is both a bug and a feature request.  I can split it into two if that helps:\r\n\r\n### Bug\r\n\r\nhttps://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/using-the-compiler.html#input-description says that `outputSelection` is a setting that can be passed to the input JSON but #2256 suggests that this is not actually the case.  The documentation should be updated and that section removed.\r\n\r\n### Feature\r\n\r\nImplement compiler output filtering.  My project currently produces a 12.5MB JSON file that is _really_ hard/expensive to work with due to its size.  I have been playing around with various JS object filters and JSON parsers but due to the size of the JSON file all of them choke really hard and do not allow me to actually filter the output.  I can do `JSON.parse(compilerOutputJson)` and that gets me an in-memory JS object but its so big that I can't actually filter it.  This is complicated by the fact that the keys aren't well defined (they are the names of files and contracts) which means any filtering needs to walk the entire structure.",
