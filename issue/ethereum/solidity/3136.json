  "body": "There should be a warning when calls to other contracts is made inside a constructor.\r\n\r\n#### Motivation\r\n\r\nCalling another contract (B) in the constructor of a contract (A) will give B access to the partially initialized account of A (through `msg.sender`, or in asm, `caller`). Account creation is a special circumstance where the account that is being initialized actually has code in it, but any calls to that account during initialization (i.e calls from contracts that are themselves called in the constructor) will be done to a version of the account with no code in it. Generally speaking - code inside a constructor does not always behave as \"regular\" code, and can also cause other code not to behave as expected, and this is one of those cases.\r\n\r\n### Suggestion\r\n\r\nAdding a warning to the analyzer when someone tries to call another account from inside a constructor. \r\n\r\nThis would of course not be water proof, as it could still call (internal) functions that in turn calls other contracts etc. Perhaps it should warn when calling *any* function from inside a constructor (or at least those that are not pure/view), though that would become very complicated. Feels like this is the type of issue that would likely become more complicated as work progresses.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the use of `codesize` and `extcodesize(address)` should probably be flagged too, and potentially other things that expects a fully initialized object.\r\n\r\nIf accepted, I would not mind trying to work this in myself, and make a PR!\r\n\r\n### More info\r\n\r\nIf someone is interested in initialization issues in general, i wrote a short blog post about it here (https://github.com/androlo/solidity-workshop/blob/master/blogs/2017-07-26-constructors-classes-and-contracts.md). It brings up similar issues from other (mainly object oriented) languages, and talks a bit about the dangers of partially initialized objects. Not all of it applies to Solidity though.",

Do you have a suggestion about how to silence such a warning? Note that every external function call in Solidity is prefixed with an `extcodesize(address) != 0`-check, so the worst thing that can happen is that the constructor call fails or that ether that is sent does not go through the fallback function.",

The best thing would be to have that in a stand alone AST util for JS, which would have that functionality as well as some other things, allow walking, etc. I'm not sure that exists. A very clean way of doing it is by using TS, and include proper types for all the nodes. That way the static analyzer (as well as anyone else that uses it) could use it to make sure the objects it is working on is a proper solidity AST, and then use those types when working with them. If the calling code is not TS, then they can just use the js version as usual.",
