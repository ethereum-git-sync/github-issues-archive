  "body": "## Abstract\r\n\r\nSolidity 5 introduces a new sanity-check on the msg.data of a function if the msg.data length differs from the defined by the signature the transaction fails. Some mainstream contract implementations perform custom calls without taking into consideration this rule, those implementations are not able to interact with newly compiled Solidity 5 contracts.\r\n\r\nEj: The reference implementation for introspection of an ERC165 compliant contract sends the wrong msg.data size https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/1640\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nAdding an *unchecked* function modifier would disable the check on the msg.data bounds, allowing broken contract callers (as ERC165) to interact with these new contracts.\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\ninterface ERC165 {\r\n    function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceID) unchecked external view returns (bool);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nAny function containing the *unchecked* should ignore any validation on the msg.data size, functions without *unchecked* should behave as described on the Solidity 5 changelog\r\n\r\n> Code Generator: Revert at runtime if calldata is too short or points out of bounds. This is done inside the ABI decoder and therefore also applies to abi.decode().",
