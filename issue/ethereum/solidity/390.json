  "body": "The idea is being able to simply do this in a contract function:\n\n`returnWithEvent (1, 2, 3);`\n\nInstead of having to define an event in the contract, like `event fooEvent(uint x, uint y, uint z)` and then invoking it separately:\n\n```\nfooEvent(1,2,3);\nreturn (1, 2, 3);\n```\n\nSo single line of code `returnWithEvent (1, 2, 3);` would automatically fire `fooEvent(1,2,3);`.  Solidity could come up with a convention for what the default generated event name is.  In this example, the convention is function name concatenated with \"Event\".\n",

This is because this is the only way to transport the returned value to UI. \nIf the external UI do not need a return value of the function, it should use an extra function without return value.
