  "body": "Came up in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11221.\r\n\r\nABI decoding from calldata allows decoding \"non-canonical\" encodings, i.e. encodings that were not produced by `abi.encode`, resp. generally the Solidity ABI encoder. This includes encodings with multiple tail pointers pointing to overlapping regions or negative tail pointers.\r\n\r\nFor example negative tail pointers are only valid, when decoding from calldata, though, while they are considered invalid when decoding from memory, i.e. it is possible to copy a valid calldata encoding to memory, after which it is no longer possible to decode it.\r\n\r\nSince decoding non-canonical encodings from calldata has always been possible (or at least for a long time), to me it seems changing the calldata side would have to be considered a breaking change to the ABI encoding.\r\nOn the other hand changing the memory side would probably entail validating that each tail pointer is in range of the original source array instead of cutting off large offsets. Which would mean passing the start offset down the abi decoding functions, which might increase stack pressure.",
