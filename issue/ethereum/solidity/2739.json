    "body": "> This was partly intentional. Libraries are seen as implicit base contracts. Since external functions are not visible in derived contracts, external functions cannot be called like that.\r\n\r\nI think we should just clean the inheritance rules, for libraries too. I'd consider actually prefer going back to the original proposals you didn't like when libraries were introduced: separating the visibility and the inlining aspect of `internal`. The visibility shows what are internal to the library implementation and what aren't, while inlining just shows inlining. In that sense *only* `external` ones would be visible by contracts using libraries.",
