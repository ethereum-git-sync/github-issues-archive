    "body": "The Solidity compiler implements deduplication. It is quite easy: So you basically go through all the pairs of jumpdests and compare the code starting from there. If you find two pairs that compare equal, you exchange all references to labels for one of the jumpdest by the other jumpdest. Then you repeat.\r\n\r\nYou can of course also keep track of jumpdests that are supposed to be equal while you do the comparison and you can also compare the code in a less strict way.\r\n\r\nIf you want to know more, please come to our chat room at https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity-dev - github issues are not very well suited for discussions.",
