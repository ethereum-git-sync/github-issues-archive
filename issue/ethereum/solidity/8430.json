  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\n## Abstract\r\n\r\nI have heard that you are looking to improve or change the natspec format, would it be possible to add a contract's tag to inform that the contract is meant to be a `delegatecall` target?\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nMany contracts are meant to only be a delegatecall target (either through a proxy factory, or for upgradeability). These contracts have specific properties, such as:\r\n-  The state variables need to be initialized outside of the constructor (through an init function)\r\n- Some state variables might never been initialized, are they are initialized in the proxy (ex: `implementation`)\r\n\r\nKnowing which contracts are delegatecall targets will help third parties code analyzer (such as [`slither-check-upgradeability`](https://github.com/crytic/slither/wiki/Upgradeability-Checks)) to automatically detect and adjust their checks. Right now we use heuristics in Slither, but they are not robust enough.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this information might be useful for blockchain explorer, like etherscan.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nI am not entirely sure what would be the best way to specify it, maybe a `delegatecall_target` tag:\r\n```solidity\r\n/// @delegatecall_target\r\ncontract MyContract {\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr a `type` tag, that could be `standard/proxy/upgradeable` or something like that:\r\n```solidity\r\n/// @type proxy\r\ncontract MyContract {\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nAs this will only affect the natspec, I dont see immediate backward compatibility issue\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks",
