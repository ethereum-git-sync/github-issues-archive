    "body": "I checked these projects in a bit more detail and here's what I'd pick based mostly on ease of integration and how important or interesting they are:\r\n- **Bleeps**: a fancy NFT that generates sound, so a bit different from typical projects. Lots of assembly. Can be built with Hardhat and is all 0.8.9.\r\n- **Uniswap v3**: it's still on 0.7.x but I expect it to be easy to port and I think it's important to have it. Uses Hardhat so not much extra work.\r\n- **ElementFi**: Uses Hardhat. Is mostly on 0.8.x but unfortunately also has some 0.7.x code and requires patching.\r\n- **Gnosis Zodiac**: Small project but uses Hardhat and is mostly on 0.8.x (just one 0.6.x file).\r\n- **Gnosis Protocol v2** (used by cowswap): Uses Hardhat and is all on 0.7.x.\r\n- **Yield Protocol Liquidator**: Hardhat, all 0.8.x. Looks easy to integrate.\r\n- **Yield Protocol Vault V2**: Hardhat, all 0.8.x. Looks easy to integrate.\r\n- **PoolTogether V4**: Hardhat, all 0.8.x. Looks easy to integrate.\r\n- **Perpetual Pools**: Hardhat, all 0.8.x. Looks easy to integrate.\r\n- **PRBMath**: Hardhat, all 0.8.x. Looks easy to integrate and is a popular project. Not as big as the other ones though.\r\n\r\nOther important/interesting projects, which look like they'll require more work. I think it would be good to integrate them eventually:\r\n- **solmate**: A general purpose library, I think it's important to have it. Uses 0.8.10. Has lots of assembly. Requires dapptools which we do not support yet in the ext tests and I think we'll need to build a docker image for nix to use it on CircleCI.\r\n- **DSA connectors**: Mostly on 0.7.6 with some 0.6.x contracts sprinkled in. Has lots of contracts, targetting not only Ethereum mainnet but also Polygon, Avalanche and Arbitrum. The contracts themselves seem to be fairly thin though and consist mostly of external calls and ABI encoding. Uses Hardhat.\r\n- **Tornado Cash**: Not much code but on the other hand has some ZK math in it. Still on 0.7.x. Uses Truffle.\r\n- **Raiden**: Relatively small (though has one ~70k contract). All 0.8.10. Uses an exotic framework.\r\n- **Rarible**: Truffle, still on 0.7.6. It's a popular NFT marketplace so it would be good to have for variety. It has an unusual structure - many directories, each containing separate config.\r\n\r\nOthers that require extra work and do not seem as important/interesting:\r\n- **OlympusDAO** (OHM): Mixes 0.5.x, 0.7.x and 0.8.x code (mostly 0.7.x), Uses Hardhat.\r\n- **yearn lens**: Mostly 0.8.x code. Uses Brownie so requires extra work to integrate and benchmark.\r\n- **Overlay**: All 0.8.7 and uses Brownie.\r\n- **Unlock**: Mostly 0.8.x but also has some 0.5.x-only code. Uses Hardhat.\r\n\r\nToo old or not interesting:\r\n- **Liquity**: still on 0.6.x and even has some 0.4.x code. Can use Hardhat.\r\n- **spartanswap**: seems to be targetting BSC, apparently [made by Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/0b77bd42b6e14aa6affb9225a1a15069).\r\n- **Gnosis CoW Token**: Uses Hardhat and is all 0.8.10. Unfortunately it's just a token.",
