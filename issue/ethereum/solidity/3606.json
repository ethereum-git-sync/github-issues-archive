    "body": "The `year` suffix is unrelated to what we humans experience as a year on Earth. The [documentation](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/units-and-global-variables.html#time-units) states that `1 years == 356 days`, `1 days == 24 hours` and so on and also warns that this is far from the truth. The only number we can rely on is seconds, although this is already questionable, since this value is under the control of the miners and can be manipulated.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, all these values are inexact, but the definition of `1 year` is perhaps the most dangerous, so I'm fine with deprecating it.\r\n\r\n@axic, what do you think?",
