    "body": "Btw, in regard to @axic and @VoR0220 comments from Feb, I sincerely hope that \"waiting for the EIP\" is not the reason this has been held up here.  SHA3 is flat out inaccurate, and it confuses the hell out of every programmer I introduce to solidity.  There is _no_ disadvantage to simply adding an alias as soon as possible so that at least new code can be changed to appear way less confusing outside of the very narrow circle of Etherum people who understand how this happened historically.  It will be way less work for everyone coming in if the first thing I can tell them is \"Ethereum uses a hash function very similar to SHA3 called Keccak256\" and just have them use that in their code from scratch.  I highly support the EIP, but a Solidity alias is **definitely** the lowest hanging fruit to get the ball rolling. /rant\n",
