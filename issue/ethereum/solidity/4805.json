  "body": "Came up in #4799.\r\n\r\nFor constantinople the blockhash opcode seems to always return zero.\r\nThis is probably due to us setting the constantinople fork block to zero and resetting the chain to block zero before each test, which seems to break the blockchain contract in aleth (introduced in EIP96). Either our test setup has to be adjusted or aleth should support blockhash in the configuration used for our tests.\r\n\r\nCorresponding issue in aleth: https://github.com/ethereum/aleth/issues/5184",
