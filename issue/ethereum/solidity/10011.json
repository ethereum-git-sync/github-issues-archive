    "body": "@cameel with AFL, few bugs are blockers per se, though anything it finds frequently is going to hurt fuzzing throughput, I suspect.  Unfortunately, github doesn't let me put on labels.  I'd say this one is not really a blocker at all, it takes forever to find, though the fuzzer instance that found it is probably going to eventually lose some time in producing it again.  This is less of a problem for my fuzzing, really -- there are a few really easy to hit bugs, but the mutation-based improvement to AFL I'm using has a nice side effect of reducing bug duplication.",
