    "body": "@Zachinquarantine Great! This might not be the easiest task to finish because it's a bit open-ended. We need to agree on what we want to do here. It should not be technically hard though which is why I marked it as `good first issue` anyway.\r\n\r\nSo, the first question is if we want to keep the script at all. We're getting PRs from people using it from time to time so I guess it must useful to someone. So my vote would be for keeping it but making it more maintainable. Reducing its scope would be a good step in that direction and #11808 looks good in these terms.\r\n\r\nI think that one uncontroversial part is that we'd accept PRs that improve the script on specific systems where the submitter can run it locally and verify his changes.\r\n\r\nA big open question is how to test it as a whole. I don't think we can realistically maintain CI checks for the whole range of systems it's meant to support but we could be testing it at least on the ones we do have. So adding CI jobs for it would be another thing to do here if we agree on that.\r\n\r\nThe rest mostly depends on whether this script is even worth more effort. Maybe we could crowd-source it and find some people running various OSes who would be willing to at least periodically check that it works for them and report back? Or maybe periodically create issues asking a larger group of people to verify it on their systems. First though we should somehow gauge interest in that. I suspect that the vast majority of users get the compiler either through tools/frameworks or directly from solc-bin and the script is not relevant to them at all.",

    "body": "> And expecting users to just run a huge intransparent script with root privileges is rather insane anyways :-).\r\n\r\nYeah, I share the sentiment :) We should recommend piping it directly from `curl` to `bash` to make it extra ~scary~ convenient :P\r\n\r\n> if we just specifically list the dependencies there trusting that people are able to install them on their respective platform, then people won't use it anymore\r\n\r\nOh. Actually I never really reviewed the whole script, just seen parts of it, but skimming over it now it looks like it indeed just installs a bunch of packages or prints a message in most cases. Only for CentOS it seems to be doing more but that could be extracted into a separate, much smaller script. So I agree, it would be better to just list deps in the docs and get rid of the script. This way there's no expectation that it \"just works\". As a bonus, people seem much more eager to submit PRs fixing the docs than ones fixing the scripts.",
