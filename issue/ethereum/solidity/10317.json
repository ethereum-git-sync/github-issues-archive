    "body": "Thank you for opening this issue! We are having trouble prioritizing features, so this in very valuable to us! Most of the requests are non-breaking and thus not relevant for the actual 0.8 release.\r\n\r\nMost of the issues are high on our backlog, so I won't comment on them.\r\n\r\n2.: try/catch is designed for external calls, but I can see the problem with `abi.decode`. Instead of try/catch we should maybe rather have `abi.tryDecode`? The problem here is how to return the data in the two cases. Can you maybe create a new issue for that, so we can discuss it in detail?\r\n\r\n3.: Same thing - which other functions would you consider? (Please answer in the new issue)\r\n\r\n5.: This is relevant for 0.8 because we actually want to restrict explicit conversions even more. I currently don't see a better way. Do you do this conversion often? \r\n\r\n6.: Yes, this is an EVM restriction. Solidity library functions actually do not have a check for msg.value for exactly this purpose. Maybe we could find another way to specify \"this is a delegatecall target function\"? Or maybe we should modify libraries so that they can be more easily used like that? Can you give an example (maybe in a new issue)?",
