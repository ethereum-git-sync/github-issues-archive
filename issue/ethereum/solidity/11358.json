    "body": "I just checked the binary and looks like you're right. It does not support custom tags and is also missing other changes like the `.address` fix from #11009. `--version` still reports `Version: 0.8.2+commit.92b52cbf.Windows.msvc` though.\r\n\r\nThis is really weird because I remember @chriseth asking me to check it before he added it to solc-bin, and specifically to make sure it supports custom tags. I checked the [binary from the v0.8.2 release page](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/download/v0.8.2/solc-windows.exe) and it was fine. I even rechecked it now and it's still fine - turns out that it's not the same binary that ended up in solc-bin. Looking at solc-bin now, the commit that added the binaries (https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/commit/b316019b1e494c0a6257d0cfc1c3db261cfeb697) is weird - it adds release binaries but has the message copied from the nightly that was built at the same time. So something must have gone wrong there. That release was pretty stressful because there were problems with CircleCI and some binaries actually ended up being built wrong. They were caught by the bytecode check in solc-bin and rebuilt but we do not have that check for Windows binaries so this might be why the broken binary managed to slip through.\r\n\r\nAnyway, please try the binary from the release page. It seems fine to me so the solution would be simply to use it to replace the one in solc-bin. We will also have to make sure other binaries from that release match solc-bin.",
