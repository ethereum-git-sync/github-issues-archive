This would allow stepping through the ABI encoder in the yul source code.\r\n\r\nThe current best idea is to add another output field in the json-io called something like ```\r\n```\r\n\"internalRoutines\": [ {\"id\": <sourceID>, \"content\": <yul code as string> }]\r\n```\r\n\r\nDo you have any comments on that? The source id would be just another id referenced from the source references (for most of the source references that reference id \"`-1`\"), but a different than those used for regular solidity sources.",

    "body": "I guess my real concern here is that Truffle Debugger often runs off of Truffle artifacts rather than compiler output directly, and it's not obvious to me whether this is something that can be incorporated into Truffle artifacts (probably it can be, we can always add things, but the format does have some real limitations :-/ ).  So for that reason it'd be nice if we could still continue to distinguish user code from internal code even should we not have access to this information (robustness! :) ), just like currently we do this by checking for `-1`.\r\n\r\nWorst case we could instead check, do we have user source for this id; that's not the same, obviously (given that source could be missing), but it should probably be good enough.  The cases where this really matters are pretty narrow tbh so we can probably figure out *something* workable regardless.\r\n\r\nThe actual case where this most matters is for keeping track of mapping keys when the expression used for the key is a calldata array access or calldata struct member access.  As in, `calldata uint[] arr`, `mapping(uint => uint) map`, `map[arr[0]] = 1`, we need to determine `arr[0]` and associate it to `map`.  Distinguishing user source from internal source comes up here when attempting to locate the value of `arr[0]` on the stack, since we use the distinction to look ahead to the correct trace step by skipping over internal source.  Pretty niche, I know!  And probably not hard to preserve, given that nothing *too* funny is going to happen while computing a calldata array access, so there are probably multiple ways to achieve that.  But that's actually the reason I care, FWIW!",

    "body": "Oh, disregard my comment, that's exactly what you were discussing before.\r\n\r\nI think being able to tell apart between normal and \"internal\" ids would be useful, but not strictly necessary because you can infer it from the output (assuming they are indeed unique). In case they will be differentiated, my thoughts are:\r\n\r\n- I don't think negative ids are a good idea. As Chris mentioned, you can have other categories in the future. Plus, it's just stretching the representation too much.\r\n- Adding a single letter as a prefix (`i1`, `i2`, etc) seems like a good compromise. This will break everything that assumes ids are numbers (like buidler), but it shouldn't be that hard to adapt.\r\n\r\nI think the question in my previous comment still holds, though. If, for example, ids like `i1`, `i2` are used, how should they be scoped? Different bytecode entries can have different sources with id `i1`? My gut feeling is that they should be globally unique, for simplicity and maybe for hoisting common internal sources (I don't know if this makes sense though).",

    "body": "To chime in here to support @haltman-at's point, I'm strongly against clobbering the non-negative numbers namespace with internal sources. It seems like the argument of \"we must reserve the negatives for future internal use!\" doesn't hold weight if you're comparing it to the alternative of clobbering an existing, user-facing namespace.\r\n\r\nOut of UX concerns, there's definitely good reason to make it easy to identify what's user-defined and what isn't... Truffle does this in several places, and even though (to @fvictorio's point) it's not \"strictly necessary because you can infer it\", I'd really prefer to avoid the need to do this kind of inference ourselves.\r\n\r\nUsing a single letter prefix is fine for Truffle's cases as well: we can handle that with minimal disruption in a subsequent release. I'd support that solution if that's the path forward.\r\n\r\nJust my Ξ0.002!",

    "body": "So maybe to reiterate: The source IDs are mainly important for the source references. If you process source references, you see a source ID. You do a lookup of that source ID to see what source file it refers to. If the source is compiler-generated, then its ID will just not appear in the list of source files known to you. So I don't think it is a big deal to distinguish these. Note that we actually also had these source references to internal routines in previous versions of Solidity - they were `-1` and everyone should have been able to process this \"ID not in list\" case already.",
