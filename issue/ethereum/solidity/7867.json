  "body": "To fix a bug, we set all functions containing loops and recursive function calls to non-movable. The property is a bit more restricted, though:\r\n\r\nCalls to such functions cannot be removed or introduced into a control-flow path, but they can be moved around along a non-splitting and non-joining control-flow path and the function itself is \"pure\" (meaning its result only depends on the arguments), assuming the statements inside the function are all movable.\r\n\r\nHow shall we cal this property? \"alwaysReturns\" (for the converse property)?\r\n\r\nThe `return`, `revert`, ... builtin functions would also fall into this category.\r\n\r\nIn another issue, we considered the property of \"never returning\", i.e. not having a continuing control-flow for statements, so these could be combined (-> TerminationFinder).",
