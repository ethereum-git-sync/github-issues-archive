    "body": "Well, the reason for removing ``constant``/``isDeclaredConstant`` and ``payable`` was to remove redundancy and strictly speaking a fallback field would be redundant as well, so that might be an argument against it... Are there any other redundant fields in the AST? We probably don't have to avoid redundancy at all cost, though.\r\n\r\nAn argument *for* having the field would be that ``name`` is also empty for constructors, so checking for a fallback function would be ``name === \"\" && !constructor``, which is rather involved.\r\n\r\nAnother argument *against* it would be that ``\\\"fallback:\\\" false`` would probably be added to all functions, increasing the size of the AST - however, the same is true for ``constructor`` as well, so...\r\n\r\nSo in summary now I tend to agree with you and would add a ``fallback`` field.",
