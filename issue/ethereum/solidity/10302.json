Maybe this really is a bug.\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nstruct Foo {uint a;}\r\ncontract C {\r\n\tFoo test;\r\n\tfunction f(Foo memory foo) internal {\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tfunction f(Foo storage foo) internal {\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tfunction g() public {\r\n                // Error: No unique declaration found after argument-dependent lookup.\r\n\t\tf(test);\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n\r\n```",
