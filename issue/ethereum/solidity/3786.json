  "body": "Conversions between bytes and integer types always confuse people. It is rather straightforward to convert between bytes and uint types of the same size (nothing happens on the high-level side, alignment change on the low-level side). Size-changes inside the same type are also not too difficult (bytesXX is left-aligned, i.e. padding or cutting on the right, uintXX is right-aligned, i.e. padding or cutting on the left).\r\n\r\nIf both happens at the same time, users basically have to guess what happens first. If we just disallow such conversions, users have to explicitly state the order:\r\n\r\n```\r\nuint16 x = 0xffff;\r\nbytes32(uint256(x)); // pad on the left\r\nbytes32(bytes2(x)); // pad on the right\r\n```\r\n\r\nInspiration: https://twitter.com/LefterisJP/status/977515366900555776",
