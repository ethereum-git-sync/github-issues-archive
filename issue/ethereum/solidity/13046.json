    "body": "Thinking about it a bit more: this could be *similar* to what the stack limit evader does, but it's not entirely the same:\r\nSince the statically allocated memory chunks could be stored somewhere during loops, we'd basically need to treat loops similar to how the stack-to-memory process treats recursion. I.e. not do this for allocations in loops. Or ensure that the memory is only used locally within the loop.\r\n\r\nAnd also on function calls the logic would have to differ, since multiple calls to the same function in general may need to get distinct memory chunks. So yeah, this would need to rely on arguing that the allocated memory is only used function-locally...\r\n\r\nBut it might still be worthwhile, even if we have to restrict the cases in which this is allowed significantly at first.",
