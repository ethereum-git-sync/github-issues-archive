  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nThe Solidity docs state that when a variable specified with `memory` as data location is assigned as a value another variable specified with `memory` as data location, that **this creates only references**.\r\n\r\nFrom my understanding and what one might expect, these are basically \"2 pointers to the same place in `memory`\". So changing the value to one of the variable changes the value at the specific location in memory the variable points to. This should in turn propagate to the other `memory` variable, that points to the same memory location.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"714\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31145285/231256315-74673314-94ca-4511-9ca2-9e90d936f28e.png\">\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.19/types.html#data-location-and-assignment-behaviour\r\n\r\nI have found one code snippet where this is the case and it creates a reference and editing the value at a specific index of a `bytes memory` piece of data propagate to the other reference.\r\n\r\nHowever, when editing the whole piece of data (assigning a whole new `bytes` value like `hex\"f00df00d\"`), it does not actually creates a reference, but instead it allocate the second `bytes memory data` to a new location in memory and copy the value of `bytes memory greetings` to it.\r\n\r\nMaybe I am missing something or not understanding the docs or the behaviour of Solidity + the intricacies of `memory` to `memory` references. It might be good to clarify it, or investigate in the case this is a bug in assignment behaviour.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0\r\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\r\n\r\nimport \"hardhat/console.sol\";\r\n\r\ncontract Playground {\r\n\r\n    function test() public view returns (bytes memory, bytes memory) {\r\n        bytes memory data;\r\n        bytes memory greetings = hex\"cafecafe\";\r\n\r\n        data = greetings;\r\n        data[0] = 0x00;\r\n        data[1] = 0x00;\r\n\r\n        console.logBytes(data); // 0x0000cafe\r\n        console.logBytes(greetings); // 0x0000cafe\r\n        \r\n        return (data, greetings);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function anotherTest() public view returns (bytes memory, bytes memory) {\r\n        bytes memory data;\r\n        bytes memory greetings = hex\"cafecafe\";\r\n\r\n        data = greetings;\r\n        data = hex\"f00df00d\";\r\n\r\n        console.logBytes(data); // 0xf00df00d\r\n        console.logBytes(greetings); // 0xcafecafe\r\n        \r\n        return (data, greetings);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n<img width=\"254\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31145285/231258401-bb0ab401-7643-4906-ba0f-c83ba8db401c.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version: 0.8.19\r\n- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Remix\r\n",

    "body": "So @ekpyron to make sure I understand:\r\n- assigning a new value to `data` allocates new memory and completely changes the reference?\r\n\r\n- but editing something **within** `data` keeps the reference?\r\n\r\nIs this not misleading? I am aware there might be the `copyof` keyword introduced. Maybe there could be the distinction between these two statements in the future to allow to be more explicit with `memory` to `memory` references.\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nbytes memory data;\r\nbytes memory greetings = hex\"cafecafe\";\r\n\r\n// this create a reference that points to the same place in memory\r\ndata = greetings;\r\n\r\n// this allocate a new place in memory and copy the whole content of `greetings` into the newly allocated memory\r\ndata = copyof greetings;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWouldn't that make it more explicit?",
