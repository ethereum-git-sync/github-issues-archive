    "body": "@chriseth I've been looking into it today, and I see the problem: `scanHexString` is responsible to converting the Hex token to a normal `StringLiteral`. This makes a lot of sense, since right now the compiler no longer has to take the Hex token into account (it is just a string after scan, after all).\r\n\r\nI can tell that there is not much error reporting going on at the Scanner, other than returning the `Illegal`-token. This also makes sense, since up to this point, there was no need for more validation (tokens were small enough to make Parser.cpp report the errors).\r\n\r\nThe problem now is that since `Hex` is now just a `StringLiteral`, there's no way of knowing at the Parser-side if the hex is invalid (for whatever reason) or not.\r\n\r\nI came up with a few different approaches to add better error reporting (the ones I like the most are on top), and would like you to look at it and tell me if I'm at the right track.\r\n\r\n- Allow error reporting in scanner\r\n  - Aside from returning a `Illegal`-token we also trigger validation errors on the Scanner. This allows us to further validate bigger/converted tokens like Hex.\r\n\r\n- Move the Hex-conversion to Parser\r\n  - Scanner will return `Hex`-tokens without converting them, but we will convert them to a `StringLiteral` at the Parser side, so we can show an error when nessecary.\r\n\r\n- Create multiple `Illegal`-tokens like `IllegalHex`\r\n  - We can then report the error on the Parser side.\r\n  - I dislike this the most, as this can get messy very quickly, especially if we get this problem again (we could end up with dozens of `Illegal*` tokens.\r\n",

    "body": "Pretty sure I figured out a good way to go about this. Let's expand the Token macro with all sorts of more detailed types of errors and return them as the token type when scanning tokens. There is already a lot of control flow determining what type of token to return. Just return the right type and handle the new types you introduce where needed. Good simple code. Could abstract this stuff further I have an inkling, but it sounds like a good amount of work. The enum creating macro is epic and makes extending it this way easy.",
