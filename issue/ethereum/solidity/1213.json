  "body": "```\nThe using A for B; directive is active for the current scope, which is limited to a contract for now but will be lifted to the global scope later, so that by including a module, its data types including library functions are available without having to add further code.\n```\n- How big is \"the current scope\"?  It can be understood from the document that not all `{ ... }` pairs delimit the scopes.  Also, it can be understood that a function forms a scope.  I guess a contract forms a scope as well.  In this case for `using A for B` directive, it is unclear to me if \"the current scope\" can be a function scope.\n- \"will be lifted to the global scope later\", does this happen after a planned feature of Solidity is implemented, or just later in this document?\n",
