The only option right now is to live with the warning & don't include the pragma in the interface file, or copy the interface file to a new file in the app repo and specify a different pragma. Neither are good options in my opinion.\r\n\r\n#1687 would work, however it seems like a statically typed file would better serve as an interface then the abi string",
