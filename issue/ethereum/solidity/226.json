Why would their syntax be so different (e.g. @ prefix for a start)\n\nThe similarities include being file-scoped, modal etc. Typical pragmas hastily backported into languages include \"use strict\" which then often balloon out into all kinds of strict-about-this and strict-about-that variations. \n\nAlso, why limit these to compiler directives? Why not enable the same syntax to work for runtime pragma? Comment-based syntax would not be expected to impact generated code. I suggest not making a pragma syntax incompatible with the future possibility of runtime impacts. Note that these need not even be supported by all EVMs\n\nI'm not saying any of this magic must be implemented, only that the syntax should:\n- be harmonious with import, so its full realisation could be more like `require {this, that} >= 10.0.1` not look unique with @ or function-call-like parentheses\n- not require a redesign in order to enable runtime metadata in some future\n",

I also respect avoiding overloading `require` and `pragma` is a wonderfully exact replacement.\n\nMy burning question is why reuse parentheses such that it resembles a function call when you have syntax that causes modal, file-scoped changes to the meaning of the following code which use a syntax that has keyword with braces etc? (namely the syntax for import)\n\nWould you consider it a design goal to make this change fit in more with the import syntax? I guess this would imply something closer to\n\n```\npragma solidity ^0.4.0;\n```\n\nor\n\n```\npragma { solidity ^0.4.0 };\n```\n\nor were you hoping that the function-call syntax would make older versions forward compatible by importing a pragma function etc.?\n",
