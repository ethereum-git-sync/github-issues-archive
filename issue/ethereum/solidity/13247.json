I open this issue to initiate a discussion on adding potential new levels to the current version of Yul. The idea started with my Twitter thread [here](https://twitter.com/pcaversaccio/status/1541529156504231938) and feedback by @leonardoalt. The current idea is to add new levels of Yul: **Yul+** being a higher-level version and **Yul-** being a lower-level version with more compilation stack layers. Building something similar to LLVM IR would be really nice.",

    "body": "Thanks, I'm aware of yulp which is however not maintained by the Solidity team if I understand correctly and there is also no active development going on (the repo is even archived). So in terms of design, I must admit I actually like yulp and could be a good starting point for Yul+.\r\n\r\nRegarding the low-level version I have the following points to mention:\r\n- Usually, an assembly language provides access to stack and control flow instructions, Yul does currently not.\r\n- IMO to make Solidity/Yul more competitive with Vyper. One reason why Vyper can outperform seemingly well-optimized Yul is that Yul is still a high-level language and the Yul compiler still has to do stack scheduling, control flow analysis etc. Allowing for direct control flow via JUMPs and access to stack via e.g. SWAP or DUP could help to write even more efficient contracts.",

    "body": "I think Yul++ makes the most sense name wise for this extension as Yul+ already exists although archived Yul++ would differentiate it from that (For example I have a Yul+ <-> Foundry repo which would populate when people are searching for this Yul extension). I do favor adding this though, especially as features like #9889  and many from Yul+ like `mstructs` would help make it easier to write Yul in a way that is easy to type and efficient to run while lower level controls help occupy the niche languages like Huff are moving into fill. I don't think lower levels should be differentiated with a name or different compiler like Yul-, rather adding `unsafe` blocks in a Yul extension, so that high level abstractions can be used where they make sense (so something like an mstruct), while compute intensive areas the guard-rails can be taken off to go faster (or the entire program can be in an unsafe block if wanted)",

    "body": "I think it's about interoperability on the opcode level here. The same would apply to Fe probably. The question we need to ask ourselves is whether we consider this an isolated Solidity/Yul issue or we think about transpilation/interoperability. IMHO when Huff becomes more mature you will work only with Huff and not consider it porting it to Solidity/Yul. So maybe such a feature request is a lifecycle problem. Also, as pointed out by @leonardoalt above, it's already possible to create bytecode sequences that will not be modified by the optimizer.",
