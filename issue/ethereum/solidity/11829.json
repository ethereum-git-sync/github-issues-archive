  "body": "## Abstract\r\nCurrently, randomness, be it on-chain or off-chain, is only uniform. Gaussian randomness is made available by simply counting 1's in the binary representation of a hashed value calculated by the `keccak256` hashing algorithm. It is simple, costs little gas, and can open up many possibilities in gaming and DeFi.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nDApps may desire to generate some numbers more frequently than the others, but currently, the randomness produced by `keccak256` hashing algorithm is uniform in the domain `[0, 2**256-1]`. That is limiting what is possible with Solidity and blockchains. This on-chain Gaussian RNG can satisfy such needs.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\nThe algorithm relies on the count of 1's in the binary representation of a hashed value produced by the `keccak256` hashing algorithm. By Lyapunov Central Limit Theorem, this count after proper transformations, has a Gaussian distribution. The theoretical basis, condition and proofs as well as Solidity implementation and practical issues can be found [here](https://github.com/simontianx/OnChainRNG/tree/main/GaussianRNG).\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\nThis is a brand new algorithm and there is no backwards compatibility issue. Actually, it is already with Solidity. It was just never brought to light.",
