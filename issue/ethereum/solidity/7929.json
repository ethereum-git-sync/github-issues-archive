We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.\r\n- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:\r\n\t- [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)\r\n\t- [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)\r\n- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.\r\n- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nI have a `modifier hasQuorum(bytes[] memory signatures, bytes memory data)` that I apply to my external contract functions, eg. `function addOwner(bytes[] calldata signatures, address owner) external hasQuorum(signatures, abi.encodePacked(owner))` with a check on the length of the signatures array. However the array seems to be length zero always in the modifier.\r\n\r\nI tried making a small test case to figure out why, but this causes an internal compiler error.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version: 0.5.12 (but also tested with 0.5.14-nightly.2019.12.9)\r\n- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): Compiler default\r\n- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Both\r\n- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: N/A\r\n- Operating system: macOS and Remix\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nThe following contract fails with \"InternalCompileError\":\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\npragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;\r\n\r\ncontract ModifierCalldata {\r\n    event Counter(uint count);\r\n\r\n    modifier countMod (bytes[] memory data) {\r\n        emit Counter(data.length);\r\n        _;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function count (bytes[] calldata data)\r\n        external\r\n        countMod(data)\r\n        returns(uint)\r\n    {\r\n        return data.length;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n",
