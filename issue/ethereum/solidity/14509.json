There is no compile-time constant evaluation happening for ``abi.encodePacked``, but the expression is allowed as ``constant`` and inlined - we can look into doing the same for ``bytes.concat`` for consistency, even though ideally this would be covered by proper compile-time constant expression evaluation a la https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3157",
