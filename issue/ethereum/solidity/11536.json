  "body": "While the order of evaluation for expression is undefined and for that reason this is \"fine\" in principle, I'm wondering:\r\n\r\nIn legacy codegen, for binary expressions, we evaluate right-hand-side first, then left-hand-side (unless one is a literal).\r\nIn Yul codegen we do the opposite and evaluate left-hand-side first, then right-hand-side.\r\n\r\nIs there any good reason for doing it like that in Yul codegen?\r\n\r\nIf there is not there are two reasons for switching to the same behaviour as legacy code generation:\r\n- If there is no good reason for using diverging behaviour, the divergence is basically intentionally screwing people without reason (even though it'd only happen for \"bad\" code relying on undefined behaviour, but still).\r\n- Evaluating the right-hand-side first allows for more-optimal stack layouts (since the right-hand-side will end up as right-most argument to a builtin call and has to be deeper in stack than the left-hand-side - while some of the operations are commutative, not all of them are, and even for commutative ones, it's additional stress for the code generation to exploit that).\r\n\r\nUnless there is a reason for keeping the current behaviour, I vote for changing the order to match legacy code generation.",

    "body": "So since it seems unlikely that we'd actually want to change the order at this point, we should probably investigate how best to get around the gas cost that's inflicted by doing things left-to-right. However, as @hrkrshnn pointed out, for that it might first be helpful to check if there actually *are* gas costs remaining due to this, if we run the libevmasm optimizer after IR codegen. Respectively, it might be worth keeping this in mind for the new evm code transform.",
