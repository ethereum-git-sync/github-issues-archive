If you use a single hash of all the keys for a multi-d mapping access you can easily get collisions.\r\n\r\nWith a different scheme the field identifier would be enough to prevent collisions. For example,\r\n`sha3(uint256(field_id) . uint256(key1) . uint256(key2) . ...  . uint256(keyN))`. You wouldn't be able to tightly pack the keys but that's fine since `MSTORE` writes 32 bytes. A further benefit is that you could reuse this memory no matter what changed in the query. If you went from looking up an account balanceOf to looking up their allowance you wouldn't have to rewrite the account key. Since `SHA3` is billed by word size you don't get much benefit from packing unless the keys are `bytes4` etc but that's quickly trumped by the additional `SHA3`s.",
