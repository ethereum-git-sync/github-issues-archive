    "body": "I wouldn't expect working with the network (testnet or mainnet) to be part of the Solidity documentation.  This is a process that entails a few different tools and frameworks and is best described in various introductory posts as noted by the people above. For example the client you use could be different, e.g. ganache-cli, parity, geth or go via Infura, you could also deploy via a UI like MEW or even Remix. Contract validation then happens on a block explorer like Etherscan using the compiled output from truffle or directly with`solc`. Basically it all depends on your setup and there's not one \"recommended\" way of doing it. The purpose of the Solidity documentation is to teach us purely about the Solidity language and compiler specifics, writing smart contracts and non functional aspects like security. Anything outside of that, I believe, is out of scope of the language documentation. Therefore if people agree, we can close this issue.",
