Same with stderr and the `err` file. In case of `exit` file, it not being present is equivalent with expecting a return code of `0`.\r\n\r\nIf the compiler output does not match the expectations, the script can update the content of these files but then it always creates them even if they are empty. It would be better if instead it did not and if it deleted them if they already exist.\r\n\r\nCommand-line tests can be found in [test/cmdlineTests/](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/tree/develop/test/cmdlineTests).",
