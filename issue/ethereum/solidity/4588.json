  "body": "Hey :)\r\n\r\nwe just upgraded the solidity version for all our contracts to `v0.4.24` and were pretty excited to start adding error reasons to all our `require()`s and `revert()`s.\r\n\r\nHowever, we were pretty shocked to find that in our case this led to an average increase of 10% towards the gas limit.\r\n\r\n**Is that expected that error reason strings are that expensive?**\r\n\r\nCouldn't find anything in the docs that would have hinted at this tradeoff. Curious to hear some opinions.\r\n\r\n### Gas Limit Usage Before Reason Strings\r\n<img width=\"1130\" alt=\"gas limit usage before reason strings\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/117495/43265853-3bc63e1e-90ea-11e8-8af4-ed8146f99669.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### Gas Limit Usage After Reason Strings\r\n<img width=\"1125\" alt=\"gas limit usage after reason strings\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/117495/43265871-47395006-90ea-11e8-9d60-3dd8e150d843.png\">\r\n",

    "body": "Yes, that's what I meant. I think I'm getting a better understanding of this now.\r\n\r\nCan you confirm whether the following assumption is correct: Adding the error string `Not Authorized. This function can only be called by the custodian or owner of this contract` to a `require()` would add 60,000 gas towards the block gas limit. String has 95 bytes, so will need three 32-byte slots from storage => 3 * 20,000 => 60,000?\r\n\r\nIf that's the case then I think I better understand the WHY now, however, was still a bit surprised as it actually incentivises slightly against using this feature at all. At least in larger contracts that are getting closer to the gas limit.",
