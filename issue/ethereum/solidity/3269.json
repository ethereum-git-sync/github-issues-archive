Weirdly, with the experimental decoder, you *should* (I haven't tried this yet, but based on the release notes, I believe my interpretation is correct) be able to return a dynamic array or string that's inside of a struct by returning the struct itself, but not the dynamic array itself, or an array of the structs for that matter.
