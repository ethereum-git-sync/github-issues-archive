Especially its modifier and function definition in contract.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\n- Help the code more clean and realizable \r\n- Separate builtin modifiers: `public`, `external`, `private`, `internal`, `virtual`, `pure`, `view` and self-defined modifiers\r\n- Remove `function` keyword \r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nMethod in contract could be define following this syntax:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<visible> [mutable] [override] <methodName>([params]) returns([results])\r\n```\r\n\r\n- visible: `public`, `private`, `internal`, `external`\r\n- mutable: `view`, `pure`\r\n- override: `virtual`\r\n\r\nE.g:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncontract TestContract {\r\n    internal view virtual getAddress(uint256 index) returns(address newAddresss) {}\r\n    external pure calcuateRate() onlyWhitelisted returns(uint256) {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSolidity wasn't allowed functional programming , so keyword `function` won't be defined outside of `contract {}`, `interface {}`. That make no sense to keep `function` keyword meanwhile visible is the most important thing and builtin modifiers should to be separated from self-defined modifiers.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nNo backward compatible",
