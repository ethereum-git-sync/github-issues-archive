  "body": "The blockchain does not allow us to execute transactions beyond the bound of the block gas limit. This leads to various hacks and methods that mitigate the problem but require much work.\r\nCan we split a heavy computation across many transactions to get truly unbounded execution? That way the programmer does not need to specify various locks and methods to overcome this challenge.\r\n\r\nPotential issues: \r\n- What about interleaving transactions (i.e. transactions that happen in between continuations)? do we lock the contract until the mega-transaction complete? if so we risk a DOS attack on the contract, where a participant can never finish the mega-transaction and the contract will remain locked. if not we run into race condition issues and we lay a heavy burden on the programmer to make sure it doesn't interfere with the contract's logic.\r\n- Can multiple people jointly perform one mega-transaction by each contributing one step? if so we may violate the semantics of solidity because `msg.sender` (and other globals) may change during execution.\r\n\r\nImplementation:\r\nThe naive way is that the compiled code would stop it's own execution when it reaches close to the gas limit and save it's program counter, stack and transaction so that it may resume again from exactly the same point.\r\n\r\nProblems with the naive approach:\r\n- Saving the stack is potentially very expensive.\r\n- How do we decide when we don't have enough gas and need to save the state?\r\n- The gas required to save the state is variable and hard to predict when is the right time to do it.\r\n\r\n(Possibly) better approach:\r\nWe only save a hash of the current state (stack and PC) and leave the user to provide the complete state along with the transaction next, to decide when to save the state we split the code into control-flow blocks (we also need to split blocks that are larger than the gas limit into multiple smaller blocks) and insert a simple check at the start of each block that checks if we have enough gas for the execution of the next block. If so, we save the state.\r\n\r\nWe invent a new convention for the transaction data of continuation transactions as opposed to regular transactions, and check for this format at the beginning of each function, if we find it, we need to verify the integrity of the state and possibly other things.",
