  "body": "I've run across a couple of times where I've wanted to monkey around with the internals of a contract or intercept things as they are running in a VM.  One issue I keep running into is that there is not an easy way to know which key a solidity storage var is stored at.  This would be a fantastic thing to have in the ABI or in some other output of the compiler.  I would assume there is already some function that does this analysis and assigns storage locations and indexes based on the vars that are declared.\r\n\r\nI know mappings are a bit strange as you have to keccak the position plus the mapping key(or something like that), but you still need the piece that identifies the storage location of the mapping.",

I'm not so much interested in the current state as sometimes I'm trying to build the state manually using a state manager so I need to know what key to use.\r\n\r\nFor example: I'm sideloading a contract into ethereurmjs-vm and I've put the contract code using putContractCode and now I need to set the owner in storage so I call putContractStorage(address, key, value).  How do I know what key is?  Well if I wrote the contract and owner was the first var I declared it goes in 0x0.  What if I have a mapping(address=>int).  I know there is some crazy math, but it would be nice to have this in the ABI.  I also know that short uints can be compacted into one slot.  It would be great to know what slot and index each var is at.",

I suppose that the ABI could support a length pointer...not sure why that shouldn't be doable (outside of the cheapness factor...which tbf is a big factor). Length and from there you just add the index with each transaction separately....Either way. Take a look at how Remix does this. They currently already have a working implementation of this. ",
