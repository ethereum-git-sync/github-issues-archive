(see #10738)\r\n- [x] replace `boost::noncopyable` with deleted constructor/assignments (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7259#issuecomment-561157399)\r\n\r\n### Please Note:\r\n\r\nEach of those changes should be done in its *own* PR.",

    "body": "@Neyromancer I'm not sure this is a really such a good first issue at this point, mostly because most of these have been tried and stopped on some blocker (dependency management, not working on macOS, not a good replacement, etc.) but you could pick something and try.\r\n\r\nI think that `boost::noncopyable` would be the most straightforward. Also introducing more C++17 features to the code base would be nice if you find anything we're not using yet. Maybe ranges v3 would be good too if there are no objections to introducing them now (instead of waiting for C++20). With any of the others, prepare for a bit of discussion regarding the proposed solution because there's no consensus yet. In the end we still want all of these things so if you're persistent enough, any of them is up for grabs.\r\n\r\nIn case you'd prefer something else after all, please see https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7495#issuecomment-731481159. I labeled more issues as `good first issue` and added some recommendations for you.",
