Two or more base classes define function with same name and parameter types.`\r\n\r\nWhy I think this is not the right behaviour\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf I add implementation of the `receive` methods in contract A and B, and if I had AB inherit from A and from B then I would have to select with implementation to use. However, unlike contracts, interfaces should not care about the actual implementation of the methods they define. \r\nThe fact that this method is part of both interface just means its part of the concatenation. The implementation of the interface has to disambiguate, but not the interface itself.\r\n\r\nI believe the code above should be valid, and interface AB should contain the receive method (and only that)",
