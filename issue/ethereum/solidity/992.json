  "body": "I think the following makes more sense compared to what we have now.\n\nNow:\n- `constant` function should not modify the state (not fully enforced yet)\n- `constant` _state variable_ (ie. the one in the class and not in a method) is evaluated every time it is called\n\nAfter the change:\n- 1) the keyword `view` is introduced for functions (it replaces `constant`). Calling a `view` cannot alter the behaviour of future interactions with any contract. This means such functions cannot use `SSTORE`, cannot send or receive ether and can only call other `view` or `pure` functions.\n- 2) the keyword `pure` is introduced for functions, they are `view` functions with the additional restriction that their value only depends on the function arguments. This means they cannot use `SSTORE`, `SLOAD`, cannot send or receive ether, cannot use `msg` or `block` and can only call other `pure` functions.\n- 3) the keyword `constant` is invalid on functions\n- 4) the keyword `constant` on any variable means it cannot be modified (and could be placed into memory or bytecode by the optimiser)\n- ~~5) the keyword `volatile` is introduced for variables, which read their referenced value every time (this is what `constant` does today to variables)~~ [**agreed to remove this functionality**]\n\nAny example of the `volatile` keyword:\n\n```\ncontract A {\n    uint volatile number = block.number;\n    function a() returns (uint) {\n        return number; // this returns the *current* block.number every time it is called\n    }\n}\n```\n\nI'm not sure the `volatile` option is useful and thus we might decide to remove it.\n",

If a new name must be used, perhaps something like `immutable` or `pure` (in the sense that a pure function is side-effect-free, which is what we're really describing)?\n",

    "body": "hmmm...so I like that idea in regards to `pure` it enables solidity to become \"functional\" (and pleases all the zealots), but in regards to `view`...I think it might be better to just bite the bullet and call it `immutable` (because that's what it is). As for `volatile`, there are uses for it, but not many...probably just call it `mutable`. \n",

    "body": "I think that `volatile` is just a buggy behaviour of `constant`. We can introduce something like `alias` in the future, it is certainly planned for types (`using x = y`) and could also be introduced for general expressions.\n\nI updated the description to specify the behaviour in more detail.\n\nQuestion: Can a pure function return `address(this)`? I.e. is it required to be pure just from its source code or is it fine to be pure \"after deployment\"? Can a pure function return a storage value that it set in the constructor (i.e. from the block hash) and never modified in the contract?\n\nFrom the keywords: The problem with `readonly` is similar to the one with `immutable` - it applies to the function while it should apply to the state. On the other hand, `view` is not an adjective.\n",

I would argue that it is more useful to allow `this` and any constants set during the constructor (if that becomes possible).\n\nStorage should not be accessed by `pure` functions unless we introduce `writeonce` storage slots set during the constructor, but what is the reason to use them? They are more expensive than storing it in bytecode.\n",
