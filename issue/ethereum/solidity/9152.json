There are further restrictions:\r\n>  * ...\r\n> * They cannot declare state variables.\r\n\r\nIt appears this is no longer the case as I am able to now declare state variables in my project, however it is unclear to me when this restriction was lifted.\r\n\r\n**I suggest removing that bullet point from the documentation if it is true that this restriction was lifted.**",
