    "body": "@k06a we already have tests for that and we know that the gas consumption is far from ideal.\r\n\r\nI just re-checked the version where we store in struct members directly, i.e.\r\n```\r\ncontract BitPacking {\r\n    struct Data {\r\n        uint48 a;\r\n        uint80 b;\r\n        uint128 c;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    Data data;\r\n\r\n    function func(uint48 _1, uint80 _2, uint128 _3) external {\r\n        data.a = _1;\r\n        data.b = _2;\r\n        data.c = _3;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the code generated via ir does perform multiple stores, but it does not read from the storage slot for the final store (the multiple stores will be fixed by #11352  ).\r\nThe code via the old codegen does read from slot 0, but not if the first two members are combined. So I think this might just be a limitation of the old optimizer regarding code complexity.",
