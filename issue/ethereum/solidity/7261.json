Currently it shows that you can use it to solve the problem with the diamond pattern but it may not be clear that it's not something appropriate in all situations. In your example the explicit `A.f(); B.f();` is actually what **should** be used. One could shoehorn `super` into it with something like `A.f(); super.f();` but that's awkward and unnecessary.",
