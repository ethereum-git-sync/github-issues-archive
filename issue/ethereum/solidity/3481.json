  "body": "I am working with remix on the following example (compiler version 0.4.19+commit.c4cbbb05.Emscripten.clang)\r\n```\r\ncontract testStruct {\r\n    \r\n    struct stru{\r\n        string[] s;\r\n        //uint256 u;        // if I remove this line the `myStru` cannot be public\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    stru[] public myStru;   // compiler error \"TypeError: Internal or recursive type is not allowed for public state variables.\r\n                            // there are two ways of fixing this:\r\n                            // 1) adding another type into the struct (like uint256)\r\n                            // 2) making this property not public\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI get a compiler error in the code as pasted above because the struct only contains a nested string array. Once I add another type (e.g. `uint256`) then all is fine and if I make the member not `public` it is also ok. This seems somewhat inconsistent. Additionally, when adding another type to my struct Remix will not show the struct output when calling the getter - this is expected but it would be good to at least be informed that something is missing.",

    "body": "This is be design: Getter functions were introduced before we had structs in the ABI. The idea behind a getter function is that it is always of the form `return a[b][c][d];` This works if there is a unambiguous member in the struct we want to follow. It also works if the struct only contains non-indexable members. If you have at least one indexable member, there cannot be another one in the struct.",
