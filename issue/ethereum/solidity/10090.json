  "body": "Prompted by https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8854#issuecomment-629436203.\r\n\r\nThe `chainid` opcode in inline assembly blocks is considered as `pure`. A longer response from the issue:\r\n> (Note: The `stateMutability` setting is not necessarily reflecting how EOAs interact with contracts (e.g. code run on client side or on chain), rather it is only reflecting whether a given function needs to read the state or needs to modify the state.)\r\n> \r\n> I think we need to look at this from two angles:\r\n> 1) Can it be calculated on client side.\r\n> 2) Does it need any state access.\r\n> \r\n> Let me answer 1) first as it is simpler: it can be calculated client side. See EIP-695 and EIP-1193 how a \"modern\" client should behave. Based on that I think nothing would stop a client from being capable to run it, without submitting it to the network.\r\n> \r\n> And 2) is a bit more tricky, because chainid is not part of the state (or block), only part of client configuration. IIRC this was a debate at the time the EIP was added and made in such a way to avoid making forking simple. In this sense using `block.chainid` isn't the best, but I don't think there's any better option if we don't want another global function.\r\n> \r\n> If we look at properly pure functions, then chainid should not be allowed, because that is an external variable (but as we know Solidity pure functions can depend on memory ðŸ˜•).\r\n\r\nThe proposal is to change it to `view`.",
