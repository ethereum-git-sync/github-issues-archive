    "body": "Thanks for reporting! I think that it would be best to remove the reference and reword the paragraph to just state in a general way that one could use a service of that type. Replacing it with a different project might be convenient for users, but I think that nowadays there are multiple services like that and the docs should be impartial here. This actually applies to the Alarm Clock but I suspect that in the early days when it was added the situation was different.\r\n\r\nWould you like to submit a PR with a correction?",
