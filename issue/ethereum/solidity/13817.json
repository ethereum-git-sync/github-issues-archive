  "body": "This issue is based on a Twitter discussion with @leonardoalt. IMHO it would be very valuable to document what sequence is run if `optimizerSteps = ''` is set. Based on my analysis [here](https://twitter.com/pcaversaccio/status/1604192588352798723), the default Yul cleanup sequence is (which is only documented in the source code currently):\r\n- BlockFlattener (`f`)\r\n- DeadCodeEliminator (`D`)\r\n- ControlFlowSimplifier (`n`)\r\n- LiteralRematerialiser (`T`)\r\n- ForLoopConditionOutOfBody (`O`)\r\n- CommonSubexpressionEliminator (`c`)\r\n\r\nBut further things are actually run (see [here](https://twitter.com/leonardoalt/status/1604214614853668865)). There is further information as pointed out by @leonardoalt [here](https://twitter.com/leonardoalt/status/1604258182360186880), but still not clear what exactly is run in the case `optimizerSteps = ''`. Having a small section on this topic that clarifies everything would be highly valuable since the optimiser itself & its optimiser steps are already extremely complex.",
