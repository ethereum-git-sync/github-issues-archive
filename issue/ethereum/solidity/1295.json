Something like Solidity's `--version` output would probably make sense:\n\n```\nsolc, the solidity compiler commandline interface\nVersion: 0.4.4-develop.2016.10.26+commit.41027535.Linux.g++\n```\n\nA `pragma` keyword should also be considered now that LLL development is no longer stagnant and new features and keywords are being added. e.g.:\n\n```\n(pragma \"^0.1.0\")\n```\n",
