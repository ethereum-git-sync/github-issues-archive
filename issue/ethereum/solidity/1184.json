As for other languages not supporting it...Golang supports it...JS supports it...C++ supports it...Python supports it...I'm not aware of any languages that don't also have this functionality...the stakes are merely higher in a blockchain context and comes under much more scrutiny when faced with situations like the recent \"attack\". But I do agree...some warning or static analyser step should be added. ",
