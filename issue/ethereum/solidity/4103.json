  "body": "Using a different compiler version than the one specified with the `pragma` keyword can result in unintended behavior as the `pragma` keyword is ambiguous. As such, it would be best to show a **warning** for those who want to heed it and ensure backward compatibility. An example scenario can be found below:\r\n- Which version of Solidity are you using?\r\nThe compiler is running Solidity version 0.4.23.\r\n- What was the source code?\r\n```\r\npragma solidity ^0.4.1;\r\n\r\ncontract StringTest {\r\n    event A();\r\n    \r\n    constructor() public {\r\n        emit A();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n- Which platform are you running on?\r\nIrrelevant.\r\n- How to reproduce the issue?\r\nAttempt to compile the above contract with Solidity 0.4.1.\r\nProceed to compile the above contract with Solidity 0.4.23.\r\n- What was the result of the issue?\r\nThe compiler failed to compile the code with Solidity 0.4.1 but succeeded with version 0.4.23.\r\n- What is the expected behavior?\r\nThe compiler, when writing code using version 0.4.23, should show a **warning** suggesting that you alter your pragma version to match your compiler version.\r\n\r\nThis can be done simply by checking if the `^` keyword exists in `pragma` and if it does check whether the version is lower than the compiler. Showing an ***error*** instead of a ***warning*** would require that the compiler has knowledge of previous versions and available features which would unnecessarily increase its complexity.",

    "body": "@alex-ppg I think we still have a misunderstanding. `pragma solidity ^0.4.21;` is a statement from the author of the code that this code is supposed to be compiled with the solidity compiler in a version between 0.4.21 and 0.5.0 (exclusive). This probably means that the author uses a feature that was added to the compiler in version 0.4.21. If you use `^`, then you should be pretty safe from your contract changing semantics with newer solidity versions unless we screw up. Because of that, `^` is the recommended way of using the pragma. You can also use `pragma solidity 0.4.21;` if you want to force an exact version.\r\n\r\nAdding a warning whenever we do not have an exact match would remove this flexibility from the code author.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the problem in the initial code example you showed is that the author did not use the correct compiler version when he or she initially wrote the code, but the compiler cannot distinguish between the situations where it was initially run by the author or at a later time by someone else.",

    "body": "> The warning you refer to states \"You are using an old compiler\". What the warning proposed on this issue will trigger when you are using a newer compiler.\r\n\r\nWhat I state is that due to the having a parser exception earlier in the process, the compiler is not able to output a proper message explaining an old compiler is used. Please also consider trying out different examples and cases to see what the compile actually does when creating a feature proposal 😉 \r\n\r\n> This is the full-fledged solution which would solve this issue completely. This feature could also be implemented in the Solidity compiler directly as well.\r\n\r\nIt actually cannot be implemented in the compiler, because it doesn't offer an option to disable such suggestions and given users consider warnings as errors in many cases, it would be detrimental forcing them to tackle these suggestions. The Remix static analyzer is filling this exact gap.",
