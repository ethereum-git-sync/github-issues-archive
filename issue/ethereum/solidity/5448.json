    "body": "@arisAlexis The example given above allows to reassign a different value in functions. Please consider the following contract:\r\n```\r\ncontract C {\r\n    uint public test = 1000000;\r\n    constructor() public {}   \r\n    function f() public { test = 2000;}\r\n}\r\n```\r\nCalling ``test()`` (the auto-generated getter for ``test``) after ``f()`` was called returns ``2000``. You could change the declaration to ``uint constant public test = 1000000;`` which would result in an error when reassigning to it in ``f()``.",
