  "body": "I wrote a bytecode verifier and when doing comparison between the on-chain bytecode and the bytecode generated by myself, there are always different 384 charactors at the end of the bytecode for a swapFactory contract. These different 384 charactors begin from \"4d494e544544\", and at the middle of the 384 charactors, there are 2*64 charactors are always exactly same.\r\n\r\nWhat does \"4d494e544544\" mean? MINTED? I've searched the EVM bytecode standard, found the bytecode contains \"bytecode\",\"constructor params\",\"auxdata\". But I didn't find any pattern like \"4d494e544544\". Once I removed these 384 charactors, the left parts of the bytecode are same.\r\n\r\nSo how to understand \"4d494e544544\"? Can I remove these 384 charactors when comparing?\r\n\r\nthe on-chain bytecode:\r\n**4d494e544544**a265627a7a72315820a9491d76ec56377fec9dc0e32a15078a0f\r\n78064987c1e979085f566eba40e14064736f6c63430005100032454950373132\r\n**446f6d61696e28737472696e67206e616d652c737472696e672076657273696f**\r\n**6e2c75696e7432353620636861696e49642c6164647265737320766572696679**\r\n696e67436f6e747261637429a265627a7a72315820938b3c3c6830e6026fdad6\r\ne34e2e24cf1cbf0933dc66221bb2918327429cf8ba64736f6c63430005100032\r\n\r\nwhat I compiled:\r\n**4d494e544544**a265627a7a7231582001df7b333f5e97fcf5b071b42706264458\r\n7b251219796a6c9dd57ec4cc89d06d64736f6c63430005100032454950373132\r\n**446f6d61696e28737472696e67206e616d652c737472696e672076657273696f**\r\n**6e2c75696e7432353620636861696e49642c6164647265737320766572696679**\r\n696e67436f6e747261637429a265627a7a72315820b3b41184cb60b5a17357e3\r\n3fe6a35fc9d85d1bb8c84f56e9e86de9632fb5eaa064736f6c63430005100032",

    "body": "Anyway, the metadata hashes are clearly different so your local setup must be different from how the contract was originally built. For example paths could be different, the deployed contract could have been flattened, files might have extra comments, different newlines, etc. Metadata contains hashes of all source files so if the files are not identical byte for byte, you will not get the exact same bytecode.\r\n\r\nIt would be best to compare the output of `solc --metadata` for  both versions.",
