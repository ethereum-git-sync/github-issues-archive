  "body": "-If a contract wants to hold ether you create a payable function that receives the msg.value.\r\n-To withdraw ether you would specify a function with the intended address destination and amount.\r\n\r\nHowever when I test, the second statement only seems to be true if I use a mapping. On the example below not concerned about security, so this code would not apply to real life.\r\n\r\npragma solidity >=0.5.0 <0.6.0;\r\n\r\ncontract CheckBehavior {\r\n\r\nmapping(address => uint256) _deposits;\r\n\r\n function depo() public payable{\r\n\r\n    _deposits[msg.sender]= msg.value;\r\n}\r\n\r\n//not working\r\nfunction withdrawA(uint256 _amt) public {\r\n\r\n    msg.sender.transfer(_amt);\r\n}\r\n\r\n//not working , I would expect this to work fine as withdrawWithGas()\r\n\r\nfunction withdrawB(address payable payee, uint256 _amt)  public {\r\n     \r\n    payee.transfer(_amt);\r\n}\r\n\r\n//Works. My understanding is that the mapping is a security pattern to avoid re-entrancy, as\r\nthis keeps track\r\nfunction withdrawWithGas(address payable payee) public {\r\n    uint256 payment = _deposits[payee];\r\n\r\n    _deposits[payee] = 0;\r\n\r\n    payee.transfer(payment);\r\n\r\n   \r\n}\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\nSo Iâ€™m trying to undestand is that how does solidity know when it is refering about the contract ether itself.",
