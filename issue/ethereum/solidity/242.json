  "body": "We're in the process of designing a build/deploy cycle for working with ever-growing contract systems. The concept of a `library` plus contract constructor arguments in solidity together are _almost_ enough to enable future-proof \"packages\" or \"modules\", but not quite.\n\nWe've been able to reduce source-level hacks to make our package system work like we want to a single macro that looks like this:\n\n`var namereg = NameReg( LINK(\"my-environments-namereg\"))`\n\nIf you use a statement that uses this macro anywhere in a contract definition, then the contract is annotated what are essentially \"deploy-time-only\" constructor arguments which come from your environment definition.\n\nSeems there is something in between a `contract` and a `library` which would let us achieve the same goal natively.\n",
