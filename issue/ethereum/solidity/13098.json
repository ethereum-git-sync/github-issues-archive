    "body": "> The `type tuple()` should state it is a function.\r\n\r\nI think the message is correct. The function does not return anything so technically it returns an empty tuple. You'd get the message you expect if you gave it a value of a function type:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\na ? a : f;\r\n```\r\n```\r\nError: True expression's type bool does not match false expression's type function (bool).\r\n --> test.sol:3:6:\r\n  |\r\n3 |      a ? a : f;\r\n  |      ^^^^^^^^^\r\n```\r\n\r\nI originally wanted to suggest that maybe we could make this error more comprehensible by just stating that you cannot put a function that does not return anything there. But turns out that you can. This is valid: `a ? f(false) : f(true)`.\r\n\r\n> Interestingly if the return type mismatches it claims that it can't be resolved (also happens on `a ? a : g()` if it is a separate function):\r\n\r\nThat's because it's an external function. If you do a simple `f(true);`, the compiler will no find it either.",
