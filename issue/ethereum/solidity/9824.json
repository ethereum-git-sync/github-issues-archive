  "body": "Since checked arithmetic might be used for input validation, the need to move away from the invalid opcode (which consumes all gas) is stronger once we make checked arithmetic the default.\r\n\r\nThe middle ground between just using `revert()` for all internal errors and using the invalid opcode is introducing different error types (#7877) for `revert()` and internal errors.\r\n\r\nThe following situations currently or potentially in the future generate internal errors which we regard as \"should never happen\":\r\n\r\n - overflow/underflow\r\n - division / mod by zero\r\n - array out of bounds access\r\n - enum type conversion error\r\n - calling an uninitialized internal function pointer\r\n - assert with false condition\r\n\r\nThe following error situations are considered as \"validating input\" and thus might be OK to happen:\r\n\r\n - abi decoding error\r\n - calls returning \"error\"\r\n - require with false condition\r\n - calling a contract that contains no code\r\n - a non-payable function receiving ether\r\n\r\nThe bottom ones either use empty returndata or the signature of `Error(string)` if a reason was provided.\r\n\r\nWe could create individual errors for the \"should never happen\" errors (and also for the others), but I would guess that people will not ant to react differently to each of them anyway (user-defined errors are a different matter).\r\n\r\nSo maybe we should just create a single error type that is used in that case? Should it contain a message?\r\n\r\nSuggestions for the name:\r\n - `Panic()`\r\n - `Failure()`\r\n - `Fault()`\r\n - `Critical()`\r\n - `CriticalError()`",

Even if you catch an error, it still means that the call reverted, you cannot \"un-revert\" it. it might also be that the error originated in a call further down the line. Just because there was an arithmetic error does not mean it was the one arithmetic error you thought about.",

It's just my general opinion that silencing stuff in a broad way is a bad practice and this approach might encourage it in some situations without giving the user an alternative.

What if we use Panic(uint) to allow for potential error codes, but always use 0 as \"unknown panic\" for now and potentially introduce such a hierarchy in the future?\r\n>\r\n\r\nThis sounds good to me. As someone else mentioned on the email thread: it would be more convenient to also have a string description of what the error code means. Like you said 0 means \"unknown panic\". However, I'm assuming these codes will be clearly documented on https://solidity.readthedocs.io/ so if one doesn't know the code, they can quickly look it up.",

The answer to a) is that some prefer to do this via #9282 and also considering the \"standard library\".\r\n\r\nPlease note one can manually encode the panics in inline assembly:\r\n```\r\n// Assuming `code` is <=255\r\nfunction panic(code) {\r\n  // This is using the scratch space, but could use anything given we revert.\r\n  mstore(0, shl(0x4e487b71, 248))\r\n  mstore(32, 0)\r\n  mstore8(36, code)\r\n  revert(0, 36)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso see a similar discussion about `assert`/`require` in #7317.",
