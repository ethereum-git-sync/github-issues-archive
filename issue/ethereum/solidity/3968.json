    "body": "I'm aware that Solidity `import` statement accepts only forward slashes. \r\nThat being said when you run solc from command line the command must obey the OS path rules. And Windows defines backslash as a primary path separator character (though supporting `/` as well)\r\nSo I believe that my example is valid and moreover the most correct way to call solc in the mentioned example.\r\n\r\nJust to clarify this: I'm quite sure if I tried call solc manually I would use a forward slash. But I found this bug when called solc programmatically from java. \r\nAnd it generated a path with backslashes since java tries to conform to the specs as much as possible.\r\nSo I had to workaround this issue by converting `\\` to `/` explicitely",
