  "body": "(Originally an [OpenZeppelin proposal](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/issues/533))\r\n\r\nSmart contracts have to deal with dates for a multiplicity of reasons. Nowadays this is not only done by placing a [magic constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)#Unnamed_numerical_constants) but also by representing them as seconds since unix epoch, which is not human-readable and error prone.\r\n\r\nSmart contract programming is no different discipline from \"regular\" software programming as we tend to refactor existing code or change our minds on a given functionality. When this happens, arbitrary numbers representing old dates are difficult to catch.\r\n\r\nTo address this issue I suggest a Date function for defining dates in a human-readable manner following [javascript's Date interface](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) as it's something we're used to.\r\n\r\nThus if we wanted to state that a given crowdsale starts on October 31st at 16:30 UTC, we would write it like this:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nuint256 crowdsaleStartsAt = Date(2017, 9, 31, 16, 30) // months are 0-based so October is the 9th\r\n```\r\n\r\nOpening up the topic for discussion.",
