But, there are few instances of such in Solidity scripts file for Vcs-Git. Hence, may lead to bunch of unauthenticated git protocol errors.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Solution\r\n\r\nUse https protocol in place of unencrypted git protocol\r\n\r\n`git://github.com/ethereum/solidity.git` should be changed to\r\n`https://github.com/ethereum/solidity.git`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reference\r\n\r\nhttps://github.blog/2021-09-01-improving-git-protocol-security-github/",
