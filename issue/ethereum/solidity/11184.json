    "body": "> @alcuadrado are you saying it is not clear which string is hashed when computing the selector of a solidity function that takes a struct as argument?\r\n\r\nYes, I meant that it's not clear which string to hash. A solidity function that takes a struct is an example, but I meant this as a general ABI question.\r\n\r\n> So as a summary: For the non-obvious Solidity types, we should mention how they map to the ABI types. Note that this is Solidity specific, so it might be outside of the linked page.\r\n\r\nYep, agreed. How those map into abi types is Solidity specific and should be kept independent from the abi spec imo.",
