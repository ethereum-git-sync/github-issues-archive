Having separate IPNS names would be acceptable too though not as good.\r\n\r\nWe're considering also hosting a Brotli-compressed version of every binary (with `.bs` extension) on IPFS only (i.e. not committed to `solc-bin`). To make these compressed bnaries discoverable we'd create corresponding lists (e.g. `list.bs.json`). We should have IPNS names for those too.",
