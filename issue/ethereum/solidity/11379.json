I am an advocate for ethereum but some of my projects with Solidity are abandoned because I can't do basic operations with decimals.\r\nI need it to move forward and I would love to be able to launch my projects on the Ethereum network and not on others that allow programming smart contracts that handle decimals.\r\n\r\nWhen do you plan to implement it?\r\n\r\nThank you for the support and the great job.\r\n",
