  "body": "This came up in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11861#discussion_r699457642.\r\n\r\n## Abstract\r\nIf you search the repo for `Disabled because of Spacer nondeterminism`, you'll see that we have quite a few SMTChecker tests where assertions had to be disabled due to results not being deterministic between platforms. The workaround is to comment-out these assertions, which disables them on all platforms and weakens our test suite.\r\n\r\nIn most cases the results are different just on macOS and I think that it would be better to have a mechanism for skipping the whole test on the specific platforms where we're aware of the non-determinism.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\nAdd a soltest directive called `skipPlatforms` that accepts a list of values. Values can be: `macos`, `windows`, `linux`, `emscripten` (I don't think we need more granularity than that). When a test is executed, it should be skipped if the directive contains the name of the current platform.\r\n\r\nExample usage:\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract C {}\r\n// ====\r\n// SMTEngine: all\r\n// skipPlatforms: macos, windows, linux\r\n// ----\r\n// Warning 6328: (1-5): CHC: Assertion violation might happen here.\r\n// Warning 4661: (1-5): BMC: Assertion violation happens here.\r\n```",
