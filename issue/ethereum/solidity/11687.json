My guess is that `type` is considered a keyword and thus `type(uint)` does not parse properly.\r\n\r\nNo, it's actually the `||` operator. Lexer used for highlighting in docs appears to be buggy and has trouble parsing things like  `&&`, `||`, `? :`, `1e18` or even `pragma solidity >x.y.z;` (`>=` is fine). And it's not just this single example. There are actually tons of warnings about code snippets when I build the docs locally but these warnings do not show up in CI because we're using very old Sphinx/Pygments there. I actually have a PR that updates these packages and fixes the warnings (mostly by slightly changing examples or just using `:force:`): #11662. I think we'll have to fix the lexer ourselves eventually though.\r\n\r\n> This could also be the reason for the crash in remix.\r\n\r\nI just tried it and it does not crash for me. And `solc` compiles it just fine too. How can I reproduce the crash?\r\n\r\nBTW, @lie16 what kind of crash is this? Is there an error message or something?",
