  "body": "## Description\r\nPrivate library functions are normally not accessible outside of the library. `L.f` is actually an invalid expression, both inside and outside of the library, when `f` is private. It appears, however, that it's possible to bypass this restriction by binding a private function to a type at file-level.\r\n\r\nThis is a bug. Private library functions should not be usable in `using for` outside of the library where they are defined.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n```solidity\r\nlibrary L {\r\n    function privateFunction(uint) private {}\r\n}\r\n\r\nusing {L.privateFunction} for uint;\r\n\r\ncontract C {\r\n    function test() public {\r\n        uint x;\r\n        x.privateFunction();    // No errors\r\n        //L.privateFunction(x); // Error: Member \"privateFunction\" not found or not visible after argument-dependent lookup in type(library L).\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version: 0.8.17 (`develop`)",
