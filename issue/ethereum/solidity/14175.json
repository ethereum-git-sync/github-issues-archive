Line 3 compiles, but line 5 fails to compile with message \"Built-in binary operator < cannot be applied to types rational_const 5 / 2 and fixed128x18. Fractional literals not supported.\"\r\n\r\nI expect Solidity to treat both lines equally.",

    "body": "This is indeed a minor bug. However, note that fixed point types are not supported in general and you won't actually get any bytecode from any sources that involve operations on fixed point types. So the first variant also only compiles \"in vacuum\", i.e. without actually using it, while attempting to use it will produce an error later during compilation.\r\n\r\nBut indeed the error reporting on this should be more consistent and also catch the first case earlier.",
