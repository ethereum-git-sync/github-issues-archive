  "body": "## Abstract\r\n\r\nSolidity always requires `try { … }` to be followed by `catch { … }`. Make `catch { … }` optional.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nMost of the time I do `try { … } catch {}` to make a non-reverting call, and do something if only there is no failure. In those cases, I have no use for `catch`, so I leave it empty within `{}`. But it just looks ugly. I want to be able to write `try { … }` without any trailing `catch {}`.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nMake `try { … }` equivalent to `try { … } catch {}`.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nThis change seems to be entirely backwards compatible.\r\n",
