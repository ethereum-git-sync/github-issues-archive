  "body": "Placeholders in the format of library name pre/postfixed with underscores (i.e. `__LibraryName...__`) are used to indicate where the 20 byte library address must be put in.\n\nThis means, in many cases library names are truncated.\n\nThe documentation isn't explaining it well.  It suggests there are 6 trailing underscores.\n\nOn http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contracts.html#libraries:\n`If the addresses are not given as arguments to the compiler, the compiled hex code will contain placeholders of the form __Set______ (where Set is the name of the library). The address can be filled manually by replacing all those 40 symbols by the hex encoding of the address of the library contract.`\n\nOn http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/miscellaneous.html:\n`If your contracts use libraries, you will notice that the bytecode contains substrings of the form __LibraryName______.`\n\n`If solc is called with the option --link, all input files are interpreted to be unlinked binaries (hex-encoded) in the __LibraryName____-format given above and are linked in-place (if the input is read from stdin, it is written to stdout).`\n\nDoes it make sense having this information in multiple places?\n\ncc @Denton-L @chriseth \n",
