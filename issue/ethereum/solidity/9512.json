    "body": "Well, let me leave my 5 cents.\r\n\r\nSince https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9552 patch and https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.7.1 release, **legacy** AST lacks an info regarding node positions in following sample:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract Test {\r\n    function some() public {\r\n        uint a;\r\n        for (a = 0; a < 3; a++) {}\r\n        for (a = 0; ; a++) break;\r\n        for (a = 0; a < 3; ) break;\r\n        for ( ; a < 3; a++) break;\r\n        for ( ; a < 3;) break;\r\n        for ( ; ; a++) break;\r\n        for ( ; ; ) break;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAs `null` values was removed in the patch, for listed `for` statements in legacy AST I do not see a way to be certian if `a = 0`, `a < 3`, `a++` are belong to a specific loop header section or to it's body. \r\n\r\nSame could be said about following:\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract Test {\r\n    function some() public {\r\n        uint a;\r\n\r\n        msg.data[a:10];\r\n        msg.data[a:];\r\n        msg.data[:10];\r\n        msg.data[:];\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI can be certain only for the first and last entries `msg.data[a:10];` and `msg.data[:];`. For other entries, there is no certainty: distincting node position (if `a`/`10` is start/end of slice) for `msg.data[a:];` and `msg.data[:10];` now would be guessing.\r\n\r\nSo in some sense, legacy AST is already broken (at least in SolcJS).\r\n\r\nHowever, I could be missing something. Would be cool if somebody would clarify the approach for provided samples. Note that compact/modern/newer AST is not affected by the issue.",
