The docs on the source maps don't describe that possibility. I looked into the code and found [this line](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libsolidity/interface/CompilerStack.cpp#L880)\r\nI've printed the location to find out why fas my file name not in the mapping and the file name is: `--CODEGEN--`.
