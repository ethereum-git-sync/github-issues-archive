The message makes me think of an error you would get if you put `solidity` into the `language` field in [Standard JSON input](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/using-the-compiler.html#compiler-input-and-output-json-description). If you're manually constructing that input, please note that the word `Solidity` must be capitalized.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I think it's coming from another tool and is not really a problem in the compiler so I'm going to close it.
