We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.\r\n- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:\r\n\t- [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)\r\n\t- [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)\r\n- Ensure the issue isn't already reported (check `feature` and `language design` labels).\r\n\r\n*Delete the above section and the instructions in the sections below before submitting*\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn this section you describe how you propose to address the problem you described earlier,\r\nincluding by giving one or more exemplary source code snippets for demonstration.\r\n-->\r\nI am using Fedora Linux, and while searching the Github page, I did not find a package that was closely compiled for RPM based systems. It would be nice to create an rpm package for the solidity compiler. \r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThe technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The\r\nspecification should be detailed enough to allow any developer to implement the functionality.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIt would be possible to publish the rpm package to copr (an equivalent of ubuntu ppa). \r\n\r\n## Links\r\n\r\nhttps://copr.fedoraincloud.org\r\nhttps://getfedora.org\r\nhttps://rpm.org\r\n",

    "body": "Unfortunately we do not have the manpower to maintain packages for multiple distros. We only provide a PPA for Ubuntu and that's partly because we need to build packages for some of the dependencies for use in CI.\r\n\r\nWe also provide static Linux binaries of the compiler in [solc-bin](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/). These should generally work on any distro. There's nothing special needed for RPM-based systems - it's just a single file. It does not really need packaging other than to make it easy to install via your package manager.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to create and maintain a Fedora package, we're fine with it but we can't really maintain such a package ourselves.",
