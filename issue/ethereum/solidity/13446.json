  "body": "## Abstract\r\n\r\nFailed `abi.decode` calls produce a revert without a reason. Instead, it would be better to produce a new panic code that indicates a failure during decoding. It could be just a generic `ABI_DECODE_ERROR` thing, and it could be split into more specific codes in the future if possible/necessary.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nDevelopment nodes like Hardhat try to give as much information as possible about failed transactions. We have a bunch of heuristics for different scenarios, and (maybe) we could add a new one for failed `abi.decode` calls, but it would be easier if this would be just a new panic code.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nA new panic code that is returned when an `abi.decode` call reverts. I guess it could be `0x23`, since this seems to be closer to `EnumConversionError` and `StorageEncodingError` than to the other panic codes.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nI guess this is backwards compatible, unless the change in the amount of revert data for failed decodings is considered a breaking change.",
