  "body": "## Abstract\r\n\r\nRemoving `n` elements from the end of a storage array requires calling `pop()` on it `n` times. This `delete`s the last element and decrements the length of the array. So I have to pay gas to update the storage slot containing length `n` times.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nIf `pop()` can take an argument, `pop(n)` will just decrement array length by `n`. It can skip deleting the corresponding elements which is the same behavior when `delete` is called on the storage array. This can save gas cost when popping a storage array more than once.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nFor storage arrays, extend `pop()` to take an argument `n` (an unsigned integer). If `x` is a storage array, `x.pop(n)` decreases `x`'s length by `n` if `x.length >= n`; otherwise it reverts.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nThis should be backward compatible as `pop(n)` on storage arrays does not exist yet.",

    "body": "The reason we don't do this is that the compiler keeps storage slots that are unused clean, as in ``pop`` explicitly writes zeroes to the slots - hence the operation is more expensive than simply overwriting the length field, and we don't provide convenience syntax for this in order not to hide the fact that this will inherently be an expensive loop.\r\n\r\nWe *can't* get around zeroing the slots, since the compiler assumes that the slots are zero on ``push``es, etc.\r\nSo to be clear: just writing a new length to the array in assembly leads to non-sane undefined behaviour that can lead to hard-to-detect bugs.",
