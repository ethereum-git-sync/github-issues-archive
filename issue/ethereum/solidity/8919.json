  "body": "I'm not sure if we actually urgently need this as a language feature, but I found it rather annoying in writing tests that I can't do:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction f() public returns (uint256 a, uint256 b) { ... }\r\nfunction g() public { assert(f() == (1, 2)); }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I think allowing equality comparisons, i.e. ``==`` and ``!=``, for tuple expressions would be a nice convenience feature. For other operators like ``<`` there's no clear unique definition, so if we want this at all, we should stick to ``==`` and ``!=`` only.",
