There is probably an issue already at that level as I would think that the 2 calls should be equivalent.\r\n\r\nThe issue in my code is that I did not pass all the fields of the struct.\r\nTo fix my code, the solution is:\r\n`regMap[_id] = RegEntry({addr: _addr});`\r\n\r\nIssuing a warning could help stop issues.",

    "body": "Thanks for the issue, @chevdor !\r\nI don't fully understand, is this related to the new SMT checker, or is it about (traditional) static analysis?\r\nAlso, I don't really see the issue here. Is `regMap[_id] = RegEntry(_addr);` not storing the struct properly? Since the `meta` member is a mapping, there is no way to supply it for a memory struct, i.e. you did actually supply all fields of the struct.\r\n\r\nIs the issue in `getEntry` or in `register`? If `getEntry(x)` is not identical to `regMap(x)`, this sounds like a bug in the code generator.",
