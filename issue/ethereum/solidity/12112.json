We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.\r\n- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:\r\n\t- [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)\r\n\t- [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)\r\n- Ensure the issue isn't already reported (check `feature` and `language design` labels).\r\n\r\n*Delete the above section and the instructions in the sections below before submitting*\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Abstract\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease describe by example what problem you see in the current Solidity language\r\nand reason about it.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis is not so much a problem but a way to enable more folks to potentially contribute to Solidity. The proposal is to give contributors the option to work on the Solidity codebase in a cloud-based IDE. Gitpod is cloud-based IDE development environment that would enable this.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nPotentially enable more folks to be able to contribute to the codebase.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nGitpod would be configured to install the necessary dependencies for Solidity and build it. I've already configured Gitpod as I was looking to contribute to the codebase through Gitpod. See https://github.com/nickytonline/solidity/tree/nicktyonline/add-gitpod-to-solidity.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/833231/136592763-dfd1a6d4-6d57-4ae5-b002-8ab47acaf297.png)\r\n\r\nIf the maintainers think this is a good idea, I'd love to put up a pull request from my branch.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nN/A",

    "body": "It depends how much maintenance it requires. If it's just just a small static config file that does not need to change between releases then why not. But anything that would require listing source files or compiler options will quickly go out of date. Also anything that would need to be regularly updated.\r\n\r\nIt's just that no one on the team is using GitPod so we will not really notice if this config breaks - we'd be relying on the community reporting breakage and testing updates. I'm not sure if GitPod is popular enough for this to work out in practice - see for example the recent issue with snap package (#11940) which has been broken since 0.5.16 without anyone reporting a problem.\r\n\r\nMaybe a better alternative would be to document steps required for GitPod somewhere in [Installing the Solidity Compiler](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/installing-solidity.html) in the docs?\r\n\r\nA few remarks about the config in your fork:\r\n```yaml\r\n  - name: Install deps and build Solidity\r\n    init: |\r\n      ./scripts/install_deps.sh\r\n      brew install z3\r\n      ./scripts/build.sh \r\n```\r\n- `install_deps.sh` is no longer actively maintained and we have recently decided that we're going to remove it. Please just copy the part relevant to your environment to your script.\r\n- `brew install z3` - note that this is mac-specific. Does GitPod actually run the build on macOS?\r\n- `scripts/build.sh` is probably not what you want when you're setting up a dev environment.\r\n    - It selects `Release` build by default. You probably want `Debug` or `RelWithDebInfo`.\r\n    - It runs make with `-j 2` which may or may not be appropriate for this machine. How many cores are available? Choosing a value that is too low will unnecessarily slow down the build.\r\n    - It installs the binaries in system dirs.",

Worst case, if there were lots of changes at some point to the project, I or another community member that uses Gitpod would most likely be the ones to update it if no one on the core team had.\r\n\r\nAgain, happy to do whichever you think is best for the project, i.e. docs vs. Gitpod config in the project.",

    "body": "> To be honest, I'm a bit worried about this. Are we going to add and maintain configuration files for any old commercial and paid cloud service that happens to ask?\r\n\r\nThis wouldn't affect the project itself. It would only affect anyone that decides to use gitpod as their development environment. And if this configuration for some reason got out of date, most likely people using gitpod, would update it,.  Having said that, I can appreciate the reservation to maintain another configuration. I haven't dug into the project too much, but if there is an existing Docker configuration for development, we could use that as gitpod does support custom Docker images.",

    "body": "Doesn't gitpod provide a separate mechanism for adding configuration files *for* repositories instead of requiring them *in* the repository? To me that would seem to be a more reasonable approach.\r\n\r\nIf the file is in our repository, we will need to maintain it one way or another (if only by reviewing updates by users).\r\nWhile this may be ok for *one* such file for *one* external IDE, once we start adding such support, we could hardly argue against also doing it for any other IDEs that might like to have such support.\r\n\r\nAs for docker images: we do in fact use docker images for our CI setup - they could very well be suitable for this, but we generally do not promote them or provide support for them. You can try if it works for your purpose - the Dockerfiles are in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/tree/develop/scripts/docker/buildpack-deps - the current version of the ``ubuntu2004`` variant is on dockerhub as ``solbuildpackpusher/solidity-buildpack-deps@sha256:9c3cdfc1d573d1ca3edacd892590a9a83487a1f746a6ca2093d7e009818c5179`` (https://hub.docker.com/layers/solbuildpackpusher/solidity-buildpack-deps/ubuntu2004-8/images/sha256-9c3cdfc1d573d1ca3edacd892590a9a83487a1f746a6ca2093d7e009818c5179)\r\n\r\nWe refer to them via sha256 hash only ourselves, but in case they work for you and you want to make use of them for this, we could start pushing a ``latest`` tag in the future to make this easier.",
