  "body": "## Abstract\r\n\r\nI would like to propose removing `uint` as an alias for `uint256` for the upcoming breaking `>=0.9.0` versions. The reason is that global aliases in the area of user-defined types and operators decrease readability.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nConsider the following example:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: WTFPL\r\npragma solidity 0.8.19;\r\n\r\ntype Uint is uint8; /// @dev Use `Uint` for `uint8` type. \r\nusing {safeAddUint256 as +} for Uint global;\r\n\r\n/// @dev The function name is chosen on purpose like that to increase the confusion.\r\nfunction unsafeAddUint256(Uint a, Uint b) pure returns (Uint) {\r\n    unchecked {\r\n        return Uint.wrap(Uint.unwrap(a) + Uint.unwrap(b));\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract evil {\r\n    function add(Uint a, Uint b) external pure returns (Uint) {\r\n        return a + b;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe example is on purpose like that to indicate that `uint` and `Uint` can mean completely different things and I feel that for the reason of auditability and readability, we should discourage the use of `uint` as an alias for `uint256`. Explicitness of the type range is a good language feature to have.\r\n\r\n[EDIT]: This example was on purpose rather provocative and please take a look at the examples of @Amxx [here](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14026#issuecomment-1454691844) for more spot-on examples.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nI would like to propose the following specification:\r\n- For the remaining `>=0.8.20` versions, the compiler issues a deprecation warning for the alias `uint`.\r\n- Starting with version `0.9.0` disallow the usage of the `uint` alias.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nThis change is not backward-compatible with `<0.9.0` versions.",

I can't recall all the times users came to me with difficulty to get a signature recognized because they did\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nstruct MyStruct {\r\n    address a;\r\n    uint b;\r\n}\r\nbytes32 constant MYSTRUCT_TYPE_HASH = keccak256(\"MyStruct(address a,uint b)\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I told them to do `keccak256(\"MyStruct(address a,uint256 b)\")` instead, they often insisted that I was stupid for not seeing that their struct uses a `uint` and not `uint256`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI've also seen developers say that their code did not have overflow issues because they replaced `uint256` with `uint`, and that as a consequence the 256 bits limit no longer applies.",

    "body": "> I even had people assuming that uint is an alias for uint64\r\n\r\nThat tipically sounds like some C/C++ héritage. Int and uint are usually 32 bits, and long often 64 bits (even though that is not guaranteed, some people prefer long long to be sure, even though that is not garanteed to be 64  bits either). When I wrote c++ (10 years ago) I used to rely on uint32_t and uint64_t, but I was in a minority of devs that use these types. ",
