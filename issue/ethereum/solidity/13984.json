  "body": "## Abstract\r\nWe can create a `std::Map` or `dict` (as in python), by `mapping` in solidity. But there is a huge issue with it, I can't directly access the keys of this mapping. *I think it should be resolved*\r\n\r\n<!--Please describe by example what problem you see in the current Solidity language and reason about it.-->\r\n\r\n## Motivation & Solution\r\n\r\nI faced this issue, and resolved it with something like this:\r\n```\r\nmapping(address => address) public usersMapping;\r\naddress[] public users;\r\n...\r\nusers.push(add1);\r\nuserMapping[add1] = add2;\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!--In this section you describe how you propose to address the problem you described earlier, including by giving one or more exemplary source code snippets for demonstration.-->\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n?!?\r\n<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow any developer to implement the functionality.-->\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n!?!\r\n<!--\r\nAll language changes that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity.\r\n\r\nPlease describe how you propose to deal with these incompatibilities.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\nMaybe we can resolve this by exposing a new function which will return all the keys.\r\n\r\n## Additional note\r\nI am pretty sure, I can help implementing this feature.",

    "body": "Sorry, but this is not fixable. Mapping keys are not stored anywhere, it's impossible for the compiler to enumerate them. If you need them, using an auxiliary array like you did is pretty much what you need to do. You can also look at iterable/enumerable mapping implementations provided by various libraries, e.g. OpenZeppelin.",
