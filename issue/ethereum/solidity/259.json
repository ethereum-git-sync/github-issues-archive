    "body": "This is on purpose. For overload resolution, only the parameter types are taken into account, as is customary in many other languages. The reason is that you can easily omit the return values (or their types), but not the parameters. In both of the following examples, resolution is ambiguous.\n\n```\nstuff();\nvar x = stuff();\n```\n\nThe main problem, though, is that resolution does not need to terminate after one step and can create ambiguities even if you use the return values:\n\n```\nfunction stuff() returns (uint) {}\nfunction stuff() returns (bool) {}\nfunction g(uint) returns (bool) {}\nfunction g(bool) returns (bool) {}\nfunction h() {\nbool x = g(stuff());\n}\n```\n",
