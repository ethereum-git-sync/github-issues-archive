  "body": "## Abstract\r\n\r\nSolidity wraps the `call` opcode in a higher-level concept, that of _external function calls_. An external function call does more than a simple `call`, including:\r\n * checking that the destination address has code\r\n * reverting on `call` failure\r\n * decoding return data\r\n\r\nThis is a proposal to break down these steps so that reverting is optional, while keeping all other current semantics and behaviour.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nThere are multiple scenarios in which it is necessary to not revert the whole transaction if one of the inner transactions failed, including batch transfers of tokens and most meta-tx solutions. In these cases, the calling contract should handle the failed call and continue its own execution.\r\n\r\nThe only way to do this currently is by using `call` directly, and performing a test on the `success` boolean value returned by it. However, keeping this consistent with other external function calls requires a deep understanding of how these are performed, and is not trivial to get right.\r\n\r\n`try/catch` is a well-known pattern that should immediately convey the intent behind the construct to a developer familiar with other languages that support it (including JavaScript, Python, Java, C++, C#). \r\n\r\nSince we're not attempting to create a full-fledged exception handling mechanism, a syntax that clearly indicates a single external call will be covered by the `try` block is desirable.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\n@chriseth and I discussed a couple alternatives on the solidity-dev gitter channel. The final proposal is as follows:\r\n\r\n* `ext_call` is an external call expression (i.e. a call to an `external` function on a contract type), that (optionally) returns a value of type `T`\r\n\r\n```\r\ntry (ext_call)\r\nthen (T ret_value) {\r\n   // block to be executed if ext_call succeeds, i.e. regular Solidity behaviour\r\n} \r\ncatch (bytes error_value) {\r\n   // block to be executed if ext_call fails, as opposed to reverting the current transaction\r\n} \r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected behaviour is equivalent to a Solidity function call, except that all conditions that may cause a revert (including no destination code, failed transaction, failure at decoding the return value) cause the execution flow to jump to the `catch` block. A missing `then` or `catch` block simply means said block will not be executed.\r\n\r\nA couple notes about the proposed syntax:\r\n * both `ret_value` and `error_value` are scoped to the blocks where they are valid and initialized\r\n * I'm not completely sold on the keyword `then`, but it does have the benefit of not being a common variable or function name, and is highly related to execution flow \r\n * if no error-handling is done, and the external function returns no value, both `then` and `catch` can be removed, leaving simply `try (ext_call)`, an expression with no trailing semicolon. We may want to make `catch` mandatory\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nBoth `try` and `catch` are reserved keywords [as of v0.5.9](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.9/miscellaneous.html#reserved-keywords). `then` is not, nor could I identify any other reserved keyword (e.g. `success`) that we could use in its place. \r\n\r\nSince dropping the `then` keyword would lead to very weird syntax, we should add a new one in the next breaking change release (see https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6040).",

    "body": "@maxsam4 thanks for your comment! Yes, this is a striking argument against catching decoding errors for success return data: If control-flow ends up in any of the catch clauses, then you assume that the external call reverted and especially that any state-changes it did reverted. So it looks like we have no choice there.\r\n\r\nThe only question left for debate thus seems to be how to handle decoding errors in the failure data. Should we continue in the catch-all-catch-clause or should we just revert?",

    "body": "> The only question left for debate thus seems to be how to handle decoding errors in the failure data. Should we continue in the catch-all-catch-clause or should we just revert?\r\n\r\n\r\nHey @chriseth @nventuro \r\nI have missed on the conversation but recently attempted to use try/catch in the GSN RelayHub and found it not useful because of the decision made here about decoding errors.\r\n\r\nIn our case, target contracts are a user input, and also it is critical for the code to be confident this external call can not revert. \r\n\r\nIs there a way to receive a return value from the target and have a confidence this \"line\" will not revert? I would say, something like 'try to decode'? \r\nOtherwise, this behaviour really breaks expectations. Especially taking into account calls to random addresses do not revert, but neither do they return any value? \r\n\r\nCode that would do the job for us currently would look somewhat like this:\r\n```\r\n(bool success, bytes memory ret) = relayRequest.request.to.staticcall(\r\n    abi.encodeWithSelector(\r\n        IRelayRecipient.isTrustedForwarder.selector, relayRequest.relayData.forwarder\r\n    )\r\n);\r\nrequire(success, \"isTrustedForwarder reverted\");\r\nrequire(ret.length == 32, \"isTrustedForwarder returned invalid response\");\r\nrequire(abi.decode(ret, (bool)), \"invalid forwarder for recipient\");\r\n```\r\n",
