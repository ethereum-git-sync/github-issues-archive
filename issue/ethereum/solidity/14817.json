  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nThe warning associated with transient storage is hostile towards engineers attempting to use the opcodes given the following context:\r\n\r\nTransient storage warning:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWarning 2394: (77-83): Transient storage as defined by EIP-1153 can break the composability of smart contracts: Since transient storage is cleared only at the end of the transaction and not at the end of the outermost call frame to the contract within a transaction, your contract may unintentionally misbehave when invoked multiple times in a complex transaction. To avoid this, be sure to clear all transient storage at the end of any call to your contract. The use of transient storage for reentrancy guards that are cleared at the end of the call is safe.\r\n```\r\n\r\nSolidity's [documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/security-considerations.html#take-warnings-seriously) related to compiler warnings:\r\n\r\n```md\r\n## Take Warnings Seriously\r\n\r\nIf the compiler warns you about something, you should change it. [ .. ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nTransient storage is an opcode that was accepted into EVM Cancun, it is neither deprecated nor inherently harmful. The debate of its implementation details belong in the forums, not in compiler warnings engineered to push users into using other opcodes.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version: 0.8.24\r\n- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): Cancun\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract C {\r\n    function f() external pure {\r\n        assembly {\r\n            tstore(0, 0)\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n",
