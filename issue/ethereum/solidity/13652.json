I think it should actually be a type error since `int[0]` is not a valid type (i.e. you cannot have a variable of this type). So given that, impact would be indeed low - this code would not work even if it wasn't causing an ICE. \r\n\r\nBut there's another case that's a bit more worrying:\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract C {\r\n    function f() public {\r\n        abi.encode(abi.decode(\"\", (int[0])));\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis compiles just fine and it shouldn't. You probably cannot assign the result of that decoding to anything (because it's of type that does not exist) but as you can see above you can e.g. encode it again. This has a higher impact but it's still pretty unlikely to happen in practice other than by mistake so still not high enough for `medium`.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand I'd say that the effort is low so it's worth fixing. I think it only needs an extra check at the analysis stage. Cases that do the wrong thing without reporting an error are dangerous. Technically, it could classify as a codegen error.",

    "body": "@Krish-bhardwaj Take this example:\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract C {\r\n    int[0] x;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIt currently produces an error:\r\n```\r\nError: Array with zero length specified.\r\n --> test.sol:2:9:\r\n  |\r\n2 |     int[0] x;\r\n  |         ^\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe example from this issue should be reporting the same error.\r\n\r\nThe error is reported by [`DeclarationTypeChecker::endVisit(ArrayTypeName)`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/v0.8.17/libsolidity/analysis/DeclarationTypeChecker.cpp#L280-L327). Probably one of the conditions in that function makes it skip checking `abi.decode()`. Pass the test case from the issue though `solc` and using a debugger find out why exactly the check is skipped. Then modify the code so that it's no longer skipped. Note that this will likely make other things break so you'll need to find a solution that keeps them working while also solving the problem.\r\n\r\nAlso, try to explore similar cases. When you fix it, try using zero-length arrays in various ways and make sure none of them is broken the same way `abi.decode()` is now. Try various places where it's possible to use a type (`using for`, `type()`, UDVT declarations, parameter lists, error/event declarations, function pointer arguments, type tuples, struct fields and anything else you can think of). Also try wrapping the zero-length part in various ways - e.g. like in this issue it's a part of a dynamic array, which is probably part of the reason why it's not detected. Add the cases you try as new test cases, even if they don't crash the compiler (unless we already have them). They're still useful as regression tests and overall for better coverage of features.",

In addition, if this is your first time contributing to the Solidity project, try to find another issue that is more appropriate. Of course, feel leave a message on the issue you'd like to work on to ask whether it's a good fit, since this will make things a lot easier for everyone involved in the long run.",
