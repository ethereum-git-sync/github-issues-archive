I think it should actually be a type error since `int[0]` is not a valid type (i.e. you cannot have a variable of this type). So given that, impact would be indeed low - this code would not work even if it wasn't causing an ICE. \r\n\r\nBut there's another case that's a bit more worrying:\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract C {\r\n    function f() public {\r\n        abi.encode(abi.decode(\"\", (int[0])));\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis compiles just fine and it shouldn't. You probably cannot assign the result of that decoding to anything (because it's of type that does not exist) but as you can see above you can e.g. encode it again. This has a higher impact but it's still pretty unlikely to happen in practice other than by mistake so still not high enough for `medium`.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand I'd say that the effort is low so it's worth fixing. I think it only needs an extra check at the analysis stage. Cases that do the wrong thing without reporting an error are dangerous. Technically, it could classify as a codegen error.",
