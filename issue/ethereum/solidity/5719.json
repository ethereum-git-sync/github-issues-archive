  "body": "<!--## Prerequisites\r\n\r\n- First, many thanks for taking part in the community. We really appreciate that.\r\n- We realize there is a lot of information requested here. We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.\r\n- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:\r\n\t- [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)\r\n\t- [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)\r\n- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.\r\n- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\n<!--Please shortly describe the bug you have found, and what you expect instead.-->\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version: ### 0.5.3 (unreleased). At least that's what the changelog says\r\n- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings):\r\n- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): cmake\r\n- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: backend\r\n- Operating system: Windows 10 (17763)\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nI was following these steps on how to build Solidity on Windows - [https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing-solidity.html#building-from-source](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing-solidity.html#building-from-source)\r\n- I cloned solidity repo: `git clone --recursive https://github.com/ethereum/solidity.git`\r\n- Tried running scripts\\install_deps.bat from the scripts folder in PowerShell. It errored out saying \"CMake Error: Error processing file: scripts\\install_deps.bat\". I got around the problem by running `cmake -P .\\install_deps.cmake` which is the only script inside install_deps.bat file. It did some things and finished ( I think) successfully.\r\n- Next, I tried running `cmake --build . --config Release` which is where I hit the dead end because the error is as ambiguous as it can be and I am not getting any relevant hits when searching the web. Error message: \"Error: could not load cache\". Some of the forums mentioned missing a mysterious cache file. But it is not in the repo and I am not sure where I should be getting it.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if I can provide you with any extra information.\r\n\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\nI have just tried to do the same thing using GUI cmake and it looks like it has generated some files, including the cache file :). The build command in the terminal is still not working though as it is complaining about missing project file. \"MSBUILD : error MSB1009: Project file does not exist. Switch: ALL_BUILD.vcxproj\"\r\n<img width=\"598\" alt=\"capture\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12704474/50327414-dddded00-04a3-11e9-946a-2643672c2293.PNG\">\r\n\r\nAt this\r\n<!--\r\nPlease provide a *minimal* source code example to trigger the bug you have found.\r\nPlease also mention any command line flags that are necessary for triggering the bug.\r\nProvide as much information as necessary to reproduce the bug.\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Some *minimal* Solidity source code to reproduce the bug.\r\n// ...\r\n```\r\n-->",
