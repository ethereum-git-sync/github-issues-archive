    "body": "Hi @SevenSwen thanks for the issue, but I suspect this is because Hardhat currently does not fully support via-ir. See: https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/reference/solidity-support#support-for-ir-based-codegen\r\n\r\nFor reference:\r\n```\r\nAt the moment, this option only works well when the optimizer is enabled.\r\nSince Hardhat works much better when the optimizer is disabled, we don't completely support the viaIR option yet.\r\nYou can still enable it to compile your contracts and run your tests, but things like stack traces might not work correctly.\r\n\r\nIf you use the viaIR option, we recommend you set the optimization step sequence to \"u\", to make Hardhat work as well as possible\r\n```\r\n\r\nCould you please try using the following compiler setting:\r\n```\r\nsettings: {\r\n    viaIR: true,\r\n    optimizer: {\r\n      enabled: true,\r\n      details: {\r\n        yulDetails: {\r\n          optimizerSteps: \"u\",\r\n        },\r\n      },\r\n    },\r\n}\r\n```",
