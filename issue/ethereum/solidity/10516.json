    "body": "The crash happens because `TypeChecker::visit(FunctionDefinition)` does not stop when it detects `TypeError 4103: Internal type is not allowed for public or external functions.`. It continues to visit function parameters and in case of an array, it ends up calling `isDynamicallySized()` on the base type - which is not allowed when the type is an internal one.\r\n\r\nIf we change the type to a struct (rather than an array of structs) it does not crash. Apparently `isDynamicallySized()` does not get called in that case. It also does not crash if I change the example so that there's a single struct that contains an array of function pointers.\r\n\r\nSo the question is: does `isDynamicallySized()` really need to use an external type? I see that `interfaceType()` is used by it only in case of structs. For example we just use the base type directly in case of arrays. I looked at what `interfaceType()` does an it looks like it either returns an unchanged type, creates a copy of the type as a `memory` type or returns an error (if there's no external type). In my opinion none of these things can affect whether the type is dynamically sized or not.\r\n\r\nSo my first attempt at fixing this would be to simply use the base type directly. I'm going to submit a PR that does this.\r\n\r\nIf this is not a good solution then another one would be to just make it a fatal error and stop the analysis before we analyze the parameters.",
