I'd find it rather weird to now suddenly disallow them again in 0.7 or even 0.8.\r\n\r\nWe could just warn about them instead in 0.7 - and if we *really* think they are a problem, make them an error again in 0.8, but I think the concern of them being actually confusing for auditors is rather artificial, so I would personally just do nothing about this.",

The same argument basically holds for ``function Jump(x) {}`` or ``function jumpTo(x) {}`` or ``function JUMP(x) {}`` as well. ``jump`` actually jumping is ancient history in 0.4, so I don't see much difference.
