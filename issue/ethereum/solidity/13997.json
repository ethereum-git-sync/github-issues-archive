It keeps eating more and more memory, but much more slowly than the original repro.\r\n\r\nIt looks like some pathological case in Yul optimizer.\r\n\r\nIt is only reproducible on 0.8.18+. Below that it finishes fast. The only thing in the changelog that looks related is this:\r\n> - Optimizer: Added optimization rule `and(shl(X, Y), shl(X, Z)) => shl(X, and(Y, Z))`.",
