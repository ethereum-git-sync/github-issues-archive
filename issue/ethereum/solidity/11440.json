  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nThis is an issue with source mapping.  Suppose you have a block inside of a function, and this block declares some local variables.  After the block is finished, these variables need to be popped off the stack.  But the way the resulting `POP` instructions get mapped is a little messed-up.\r\n\r\nIf the block is an `if`, `while`, or `do` block, then these `POP`s get mapped to `if`, `while` or `do` statement that the block is a part of.  This isn't a problem.  However, if the block is simply a bare block, not part of a larger control structure, these `POP`s will be mapped to the function definition node.  This is confusing.\r\n\r\nI would suggest that as an alternative, these `POP`s could be mapped to the block node itself.\r\n\r\n(Context: I noticed this behavior while investigating [this Truffle issue](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/issues/4055) that resulted from it.  I've fixed the problem with Truffle Debugger, so this should no longer cause problems there, but sourcemapping things this way still seems like a bug so I thought I'd file an issue for it.)\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version: 0.8.4 (but exists as far back as at least 0.5.0...)\r\n- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): default\r\n- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Truffle\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nI'll use code of the sort that was used in reporting the original Truffle issue:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n//SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\r\npragma solidity ^0.8.4;\r\ncontract Example {\r\n  event Something(uint);\r\n  function run(uint x) public {\r\n    {\r\n      uint something = 3;\r\n      emit Something(something);\r\n    }\r\n    emit Something(x);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```",
