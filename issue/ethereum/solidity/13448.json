So constant arrays/data can use this access layout by default:\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract Foo {\r\n    bytes constant data = hex\"aabb..ccdd\";\r\n\r\n    function f(bytes codedata d, uint256 index) internal view returns(bytes1) {\r\n        return d[index];\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe also need to have `.offset` and `.length` in Solidity Assembly (Yul).\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nNot needed.\r\n\r\nRelated to #12821, #1772, #12587",
