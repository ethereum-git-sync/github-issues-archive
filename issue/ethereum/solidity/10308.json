Also `solc-js` has this messy code duplicated.\r\n\r\n> I would prefer a clear way of adding a `LinkerObject::parse(bytes)` feature and unit testing, and using `LinkerObject::parse(bin).link(addresses)` in the cli.\r\n\r\n> You can take inspiration from https://github.com/ethereum/solc-js/blob/master/linker.js (see `findLinkReferences`).",

    "body": "Great! Not sure how familiar you are with linking and library addresses in Solidity. If it's a new topic for you, I'd suggest to start by reading the [Library Linking](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/using-the-compiler.html#library-linking) section and the chapter on [Libraries](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contracts.html#libraries) in the docs.\r\n\r\nHere's a general rundown of everything you need for this particular task:\r\n- First, to get an idea what this is all about, try to compile a contract that uses a library and see the resulting bytecode.

It's a placeholder for a library address. Linking in Solidity simply means inserting an actual library address in that spot. It takes up exactly 40 characters in the hex encoding that represent 20 bytes in the decoded bytecode.\r\n    - To make this more apparent the compiler lists all the placeholders below the bytecode, which tells you the exact name of the library and the file.\r\n- Try telling the compiler where that library has been deployed on the blockchain:\r\n    ```bash\r\n    solc test/libsolidity/semanticTests/libraries/stub.sol --bin --libraries test/libsolidity/semanticTests/libraries/stub.sol:L=0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890\r\n    ```\r\n    - This way you told the compiler to build and immediately link the contract (all in one operation).\r\n    - Note that that the placeholder has disappeared from the produced bytecode. It has been replaced with the address you gave.\r\n- You can also perform linking on an already compiled binary using the `--link` option:\r\n    ```bash\r\n    solc test/libsolidity/semanticTests/libraries/stub.sol --bin > bytecode.bin\r\n    solc bytecode.bin --link --libraries test/libsolidity/semanticTests/libraries/stub.sol:L=0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890\r\n    ```\r\n    - Note that in the `--link` mode the compiler modifies the bytecode in place. To see the result you need to open `bytecode.bin`.\r\n- The issue here is that these two methods are implemented separately.\r\n    - The first one uses `LinkerObject::link()`. See [LinkerObject.h](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libevmasm/LinkerObject.h)/[LinkerObject.cpp](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libevmasm/LinkerObject.cpp).\r\n    - The second uses `CommandLineInterface::link()`. See [CommandLineInterface.cpp](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/solc/CommandLineInterface.cpp).\r\n- The goal is to rewrite `CommandLineInterface::link()` to use `LinkerObject::link()` internally.\r\n- Note an important detail: `LinkerObject` operates on binary bytecode (that's what `LinkerObject::bytecode` stores) while the binary `CommandLineInterface::link()` gets as input is hex-encoded - except for the placeholders. So you need to detect the placeholders and decode everything except them. Only then you can create a `LinkerObject` and use its `link()` method.\r\n\r\nIf you run into problems with the the implementation, please drop by on the [solidity-dev](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity-dev) channel. During the week you can find me and other developers there (though note that this Monday is a holiday so probably best to try on Tuesday :)).",

You need to find them and fill the `linkReferences` map but after that you can just replace them with anything that will not cause an error during hex decoding.\r\n\r\nOne thing to keep in mind though is that after linking there might still remain some unlinked references if they were not given in `--libraries`. When that's the case, you will need to restore them to what they originally were.",

I need to create a LinkerObject for each file by iterating through the code and saving the offsets (difference between current pointer and the begin of the current file) into the linkReferences map. Then, I convert the content of the file from string to hex integer to bytes. This will be the bytecode of the LinkerObject. Then, I call LinkerObject::link() with the libraries as parameter.  Then, I call the LinkerObject::toHex() that swaps the code at the offsets in linkReferences back to placeholders. I replace the source code by the return value of the method toHex. \r\n\r\nIf it doesn't work out, I will gladly try  #12011.",

    "body": "Actually, a small clarification: there can be more than one `LinkerObject` per file. The solution must involve detecting bytecode in the input file. I'd suggest the following heuristic:\r\n- Bytecode takes the whole line, no stray chars or whitespace allowed at the beginning or end.\r\n- It can contain only the following chars: `0-9`, `a-f`, `_`, `$`.\r\n- Two pieces of bytecode must be separated by at least one line that does not contain bytecode.\r\n\r\nSo you should find all chunks satisfying these conditions in the file, convert each one into `LinkerObject`, try to link it and then replace the original text with the result of linking.\r\n\r\nThis should be easy to do with a regex.",

    "body": "Yeah, we still want it. The reason we do this change is to avoid having linking implemented independently in two different places. Until very recently for example the `LinkerObject` supported unqualified library names while `--link` option did not. It was ultimately [removed](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12073/commits/816d8021e4f57b1b32eb3ce1fbfa421a585a0f0f#diff-4c2eb24107a9f3181c181c24abaad7b6c9a71c99a895bcc4a1146567d87e1b5c) and the code in `LinkerObject` is simpler now. We also had bugs that affected one but not the other. The point is that we want the logic from `LinkerObject` to be used in all places that do linking, even if it means that the code is a bit more verbose.\r\n\r\nYou can also place the parts of the code that are generic enough in `LinkerObject`. For example I think that the part that gets bytecode with placeholders and constructs the map with location could be added as a function there. This will preserve some readability and will make the code easier to reuse.",
