  "body": "The optimizer should know about memory and storage in a similar way that the DataFlowAnalyzer does:\r\n\r\nMemory is zero-initialized, but storage is unknown.\r\n\r\nOperations like `mstore(x, y)` note that the value of variable `y` is stored at point `x` (symbolically). Whenever the value of `x` or `y` changes (or one of their referenced variables), the knowledge is erased. Also, `mstore` erases knowledge of all other memory locations `t`, where `sub(x, t)` is not known to be less than -31 or at least 32. For storage, they only have to be different.\r\n\r\nAt joining control flows, knowledge is combined.\r\n\r\nIf an `sload(x)` or `mload(x)` is encountered, where the value at point `x` in storage / memory is known, it is replaced by that value. This is similar to the CommonSubexpressionEliminator, but for storage / memory.",

    "body": "Actually we do not need to erase the knowledge if a variable referenced by `x` changes, only if the variable `x` itself changes.
