  "body": "Originally reported in #14172.\r\n\r\n> While working on #14149 I discovered that we're running Yul optimizer twice for the IR codegen: first in `IRGenerator` and then again in `CompilerStack` on that already optimized output.\r\n\r\n> ### Details\r\n> The second run looks superfluous to me and I expected it to have no effect, but this is not the case. It seems to have some minimal effects. E.g. it can eliminate some variables with constant values (see diff below). What's surprising is that this is apparently enough to make several external tests start failing with \"Stack too deep\" when that second run is removed. See [CI run 29491](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/29491/workflows/af1ffc5e-58e0-4785-95db-b5d6108b210a) on the [`do-not-optimize-twice-via-ir`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/tree/do-not-optimize-twice-via-ir) branch, where I removed it. It makes `bleeps` and `trident` fail.\r\n\r\n> The cost of the second run of the whole optimizer seems quite significant. When I remove it, the `chains.sol` benchmark improves by 30% (from 36 s to 24 s). The compilation time of OpenZeppelin external test drops from 6.5 min to 5.5 min (though, oddly, the test suite as a whole got slower so it's not visible by just looking at CI times - you have to check the compilation timing in the CLI output).\r\n\r\n@ekpyron:\r\n> I'd suggest to do the following:\r\n> - [ ] We drop the optimizer run in IRGenerator. The requested output for ``--ir-optimized`` can be generated using separate logic in the compiler stack (we'll probably change the mechanisms for that and ``--ir`` anyways eventually, so it doesn't need to be pretty)\r\n> - [ ] We change the two-step compilation tests to generating unoptimized IR first and then assembling from there - that should still work, if we drop the additional optimization.\r\n> - [ ] We can, in a second step, add some means to assembling with optimized assembler, but without re-optimizing the Yul code (we can separately decide upon option names, etc.), such that taking optimized IR and assembling with that option enabled still yields the same result as one-step compilation.\r\n>\r\n> And we should definitely try to get all of this into the next release.",
