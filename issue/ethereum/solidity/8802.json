    "body": "I did a little research to see what other projects are doing. Here's what I've found:\r\n\r\n#### MIME types\r\n`x-` is also used for custom MIME types:\r\n\r\n[RFC 2045 > 6.3. New Content-Transfer-Encodings](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2045#section-6.3)\r\n> Implementors may, if necessary, define private Content-Transfer-\r\n> Encoding values, but must use an x-token, which is a name prefixed by\r\n> \"X-\", to indicate its non-standard status, e.g., \"Content-Transfer-\r\n> Encoding: x-my-new-encoding\".  Additional standardized Content-\r\n> Transfer-Encoding values must be specified by a standards-track RFC.\r\n> The requirements such specifications must meet are given in RFC 2048.\r\n> As such, all content-transfer-encoding namespace except that\r\n> beginning with \"X-\" is explicitly reserved to the IETF for future\r\n> use.\r\n\r\n#### CSS prefixes\r\nAnother example are vendor prefixes on CSS properties like `-webkit-` and `-moz-`. The use case is a little different though - they're for experimental properties implemented independently by multiple vendors, possibly in incompatible ways, with the intention of being deprecated when the feature is standardized. And they're a mess: [Vendor Prefixes - about to go south](https://remysharp.com/2012/02/09/vendor-prefixes-about-to-go-south).\r\n\r\n#### JSON Schema\r\nOn the other hand JSON Schema does not require prefixes:\r\n\r\n[6.5. Extending JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/draft/2019-09/json-schema-core.html#rfc.section.6.5)\r\n> Additional schema keywords and schema vocabularies MAY be defined by any entity. Save for explicit agreement, schema authors SHALL NOT expect these additional keywords and vocabularies to be supported by implementations that do not explicitly document such support. Implementations SHOULD ignore keywords they do not support. \r\n\r\n#### Javadoc\r\nJavadoc does not require prefixes but suggests using names like `com.mycompany.since` - so a bit like CSS prefixes.\r\n\r\n[Javadoc Guide > Javadoc Doclet Options](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/javadoc/javadoc-command.htm#JSJAV-GUID-3051737B-FFF9-45F9-85D1-5F07D6703592)\r\n> **Avoiding Conflicts**\r\n>\r\n> If you want to create your own namespace, then you can use a dot-separated naming convention similar to that used for packages: `com.mycompany.todo`. Oracle continues to create standard tags whose names don't contain dots. Any tag that you create overrides the behavior of a tag by the same name defined by Oracle. If you create a `@todo` tag or taglet, then it always has the same behavior that you define, even when Oracle later creates a standard tag of the same name.\r\n\r\n#### Doxygen\r\n[Doxygen Manual > Custom Commands](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/custcmd.html) shows how to create new tags (aliases) but does not list any limitations. There's also no recommended convention. From what I have seen in my search results, people don't seem to bother using prefixes.\r\n\r\n#### Python\r\nThe `_` prefix is used in Python for private class members (just a convention though, not enforced).\r\n\r\n#### Summary\r\nSo the common options are:\r\n- no prefix\r\n- `@x-since`\r\n- `@_since`\r\n- `@-docgen-since`\r\n- `@docgen.since`\r\n\r\nI'll add two more from myself:\r\n- `@SINCE`\r\n- `@custom:since`\r\n\r\nI like the javadoc convention with dots but it might be a bit verbose. Using uppercase letters seems like a succint alternative, though not as obvious. `x-` might be clearer to people who are familiar with this convention from other standards, even if those standards no longer recommend it.",

    "body": "If there is a strict part of natspec that is parsed with restrictions (e.g., only one `@notice` and such) I think adding extensions like @ekpyron mentioned makes a lot of sense. For such extensions, since they are to be interpreted by the user, there would be no restrictions and they could be attached to any code element (statements, loops, declarations, ...).\r\n\r\nWe rely on natspec to be able to write annotations in code, so it would be nice to have lots of flexibility in annotation. At the moment, e.g., we have to fiddle with the parser code to be able to annotate loops which is far from ideal (see, e.g., 7391c4e53ba07188ad0f2b377b371757a445ea25).",
