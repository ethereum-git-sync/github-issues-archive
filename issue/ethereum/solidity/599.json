    "body": "Hello @RomeshKTripathi. This is a very old issue and I'm not sure we even want to implement it as proposed. Since it was proposed we moved in the other direction, e.g. requiring explicit encoding when hashing. This change would go against it. I think we should close it.\r\n\r\nPlease take a look at the list of [\"good first issues\"](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) instead.",
