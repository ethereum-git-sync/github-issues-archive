  "body": "Currently, there is no easy way to initialize an array:\r\n```js\r\nuint256[] memory b = [1,2,3];\r\n```\r\nyields:\r\n`Type uint8[3] memory is not implicitly convertible to expected type uint256[] memory`\r\n\r\nThe only alternative is:\r\n```js\r\nuint256[] memory a = new uint256[](3);\r\na[0] = 1;\r\na[1] = 2; \r\na[2] = 3;\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Solution:\r\n\r\nActually, there are 2 separate issues here:\r\n1. allow \"automatic upsizing\" of array types. That is, allow initializing `uint256[3]` with `[1,2,3]`, instead of requiring the developer to do `[uint(1),2,3]`\r\n2. generate the code to initialize a dynamic array (that is, initialize `uint256[]` from `uint256[3]`), effectively by performing the one-by-one initialization described above",
