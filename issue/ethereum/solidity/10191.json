It would be much more convenient if you could do it in one run.\r\n\r\nIt might also let us parallelize soltest better. Currently we manually split it into runs with various options in `soltest_all.sh`. The split is not even and we also cannot easily be more granular than one full run. There was an idea to be able to tell it to split tests into N batches and tell it to run i-th batch (#12388). The split would be more uniform if we could have just one call with all option combinations and let it freely distribute the cases among batches.",
