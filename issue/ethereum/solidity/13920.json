  "body": "### Description\r\n`pragma solidity` allows version ranges (e.g. `0.8.17-0.8.20`) and using comparison operators before a single version (e.g. `<0.8.17` or `=0.8.20`). Unfortunately it looks like a combination of the two is also allowed, which makes no sense: `<0.8.17 - =0.8.20`.\r\n\r\nIn version ranges the operator is simply ignored and replaced with `>=` for the first component and `<=` for the second one: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/ddbef8f65092cd09422366881d0fc1dad5d4b64e/liblangutil/SemVerHandler.cpp#L209-L215\r\n\r\n### How to reproduce\r\nThis pragma will match `0.8.17`, `0.8.18`, `0.8.19` and `0.8.20`:\r\n```solidity\r\npragma solidity <0.8.17 - >0.8.20;\r\n```",
