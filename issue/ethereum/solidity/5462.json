The reason behind is that the conversion, even if possible, might require actual code for the conversion or different storage layout. For example, even though `unit8` is convertible to `uint16`, a storage array of `uint8[]` is not convertible to `uint16[]`. So if we want to allow the example in the issue, we have to make a more detailed distinction.",
