However, when the base object is to be destroyed, the compiler encounters a protected destructor (in this case for `boost::static_visitor`) and hence the compilation error.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version: latest develop\r\n- Operating system: Compiler used is clang-9 in c++17 mode\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nCompile solidity using clang-9. clang-8 might also demonstrate the error going by OP here https://stackoverflow.com/a/56745475",
