So if you want to try, go ahead.\r\n\r\nI'd start by looking at [these exception handlers in `StandardCompiler.cpp`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/v0.8.14/libsolidity/interface/StandardCompiler.cpp#L1121-L1223), especially the one for `InternalCompilerError`. Then [`formatError()` and related helpers](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/v0.8.14/libsolidity/interface/StandardCompiler.cpp#L56-L151). I suspect that the problem is somewhere in there. Try to modify the code locally so that the error handler always executes and see why it gets truncated. If it's not the right handler, look for others that might catch `InternalCompilerError`.",

    "body": "Re-reading @alcuadrado's original suggestion, I think the issue isn't about potentially having truncated `message`s, but that `formattedMessage` should also include the line number. Based on the code snippets in [StandardCompiler](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libsolidity/interface/StandardCompiler.cpp#L1161) this applies to every single exception based error:\r\n```cpp\r\n\t\terrors.append(formatErrorWithException(\r\n\t\t\tcompilerStack,\r\n\t\t\t_exception,\r\n\t\t\tError::Severity::Error,\r\n\t\t\t\"InternalCompilerError\",\r\n\t\t\t\"general\",\r\n\t\t\t\"Internal compiler error (\" + _exception.lineInfo() + \")\"\r\n\t\t));\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem is that for `formattedMessage` we take in \"error type\" and a message, however the exceptions also have a relevant line number. Probably can modify the special cases [here](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libsolidity/interface/StandardCompiler.cpp#L126) and [here](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libsolidity/interface/StandardCompiler.cpp#L132).",
