    "body": "@chriseth That sounds reasonable to me. One way to do that (in my mind) is that all `*_ossfuzz.cpp` files only contain a call to the test harness function that is defined in some utility source file.\r\n\r\n```\r\nint LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput()\r\n{\r\n  testHarness();\r\n  return 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand \r\n\r\n```\r\n// should compile without dependencies\r\nFuzzerUtil::testHarness()\r\n{\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then we split the ossfuzz build targets into those that depend on external deps and those that don't. Those that don't can then be added to the \"default\" solidity build. Those that depend on external deps are delegated to the ossfuzz build CI that we currently have.\r\n\r\n@chriseth what do you think?",
