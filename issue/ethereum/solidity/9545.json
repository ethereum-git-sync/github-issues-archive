We should also update [solc-windows-amd64-v0.4.15+commit.8b45bddb.zip](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/blob/gh-pages/windows-amd64/solc-windows-amd64-v0.4.15+commit.8b45bddb.zip) in solc-bin to match.\r\n\r\nBTW, we had one report about 0.4.15 failing to build on Windows: #8815. If it builds fine for us, I think we should close that issue unless/until some more concrete feedback is provided.\r\n\r\nTagging @christianparpart, since he is the one working on Windows builds right now.",
