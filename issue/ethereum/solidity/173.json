Why does it get confused about the type?\n\n(I have to exclude the `this` to get a clearer error message, otherwise it tells me `assertFalse` is an just undeclared identifier)\n",

If possible, please check by in [gitter](http://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity) because it is much easier to find the cause of this problem there.\n\nMy first guesses without seeing the source code would be:\n1. `assertFalse` is not publicly visible, and because of that, `this.assertFalse` cannot be found.\n2. `assertFalse` is an overloaded function (declared multiple times with different argument types) and none of the argument types you give match one of the functions.\n",
