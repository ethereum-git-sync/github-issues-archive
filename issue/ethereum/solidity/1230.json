  "body": "Currently LLL is in a limbo. It is part of the Solidity repo and there are a lot of uncertain aspects:\n- Is it part of the Solidity release?\n- If not, where and when is it released?\n- If yes, are breaking changes aligned with the Solidity release cycle?\n- Are LLL changes part of the Solidity changelog?\n- Where to put LLL documentation?\n- Where to put LLL tests? (Parser, semantics and end-to-end tests.)\n- Shouldn't there be an Emscripten interface to lllc? (Similarly to Solidity.)\n\nCurrently LLL depends on libdevcore and libevmasm. Splitting it out would be most easily achieved by inserting Solidity as a submodule in LLL.\n\nIt would be nice answering these questions.\n",

When I asked back on [July 1st of this year](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity?at=5776dfd035bfead37956ef9c), a couple of people came up with `0x02` as the location to which Solidity jumped on `throw`.\n\nIt looks like we'll have a proper implementation soon, so it's no big deal.\n",
