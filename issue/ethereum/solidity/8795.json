    "body": "I'd argue that neither cleanup in *every* type conversion, nor assuming dirty inputs for operations is actually nice... Since I think this issue can *only* occur using inline assembly, two more options to consider:\r\n- Clean up everything that was written to in inline assembly after the inline assembly block.\r\n- Translate assignments to external references to ``IRVariable`` assignments instead of plain assignments, i.e. do conversions on them. I like this option. It would be weird if ``uint8 x; bool y; assembly { x := 0x2a2a y := eq(x, 0x2a) }`` set ``y`` to ``true``, but it could just revert on ``x := 0x2a2a``...",
