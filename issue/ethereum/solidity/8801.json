  "body": "In the [CircleCI config file](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/.circleci/config.yml), shellcheck is used as follows:\r\n```\r\nchk_coding_style:\r\n    docker:\r\n      - image: buildpack-deps:focal\r\n    steps:\r\n      - checkout\r\n      - run:\r\n          name: Install shellcheck\r\n          command: apt -q update && apt install -y shellcheck\r\n      - run:\r\n          name: checking shell scripts\r\n          command: ./scripts/chk_shellscripts/chk_shellscripts.sh\r\n```\r\nIt would maybe be interesting to use the [official CircleCI shellcheck orb](https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/circleci/shellcheck), especially since the command to install shellcheck is [failing atm](https://circleci.com/gh/ethereum/solidity/310227?utm_campaign=vcs-integration-link&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github-build-link) for some reason.\r\n\r\nIt would also be perhaps more easily maintainable to use the orb's interface instead of the `chk_shellscripts.sh`.",

    "body": "Sorry for the late response. I've been looking into this, and the official orb looks nice, but the interface between is very limited. That is, it allows us to *only* specify one path prefix that will be ignored during checking. Sadly the current `shellcheck` however has a long list of scripts that are actively ignored during testing.\r\n\r\nIn the longer run all those currently ignored scripts should be fixed instead of ignored. In the meantime, we can either close this ticket, or leave it open and mark it as `good first issue` to leave some oportunity for an external contribution - What do you think, @chriseth ?",
