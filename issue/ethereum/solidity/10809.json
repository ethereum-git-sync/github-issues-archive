Maybe we can even compute simple linear relations between the inputs and the outputs and use that to \"summarize\" the function.\r\n\r\nThese relations might have to include memory and storage, and this is where it could get difficult. For example\r\n`allocate(s) -> p` can be summarize to `p <= mload(0x40) + s + 0x20` (where `mload` queries the pre-state).",
