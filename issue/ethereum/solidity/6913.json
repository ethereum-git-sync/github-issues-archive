  "body": "@salamani reported build problems in the gitter channel (thank you very much for your patience!) that led to the realization that apparently boost 1.70 silently breaks cmake support by starting to install a config mode cmake target configuration that is incompatible with the traditional cmake FindBoost modules.\r\n\r\nWe need to:\r\n - Support config-mode-only boost setups that *only* define cmake targets, but *don't* define ``BOOST_INCLUDE_DIRS`` and ``BOOST_LIBRARIES``.\r\n - Continue to support boost find modules that *don't* define cmake targets, but *only* define ``BOOST_INCLUDE_DIRS`` and ``BOOST_LIBRARIES``.\r\n - Add a warning in the documentation explaining how to work around this problem for older releases, if one tries to build them against boost 1.70+.",
