  "body": "## Abstract\r\nCurrently, when running [command-line tests](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/tree/develop/test/cmdlineTests), the working directory is set to `test/cmdlineTests/` and not the directory of the specific test case. This means that we need to repeat the name of the test case (which is often long) to refer to a file inside it.\r\n\r\nThis is not a big problem as long as we rely on the test runner inserting the file path automatically. There are, however, cases where we do have to spell out the path. For example:\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/f802eafc679541cc1d3ba0ca5bc7c12b4bdaf939/test/cmdlineTests/standard_debug_info_in_yul_and_evm_asm_print_all/input.json#L3-L5\r\n\r\nWe should be able to do `\"C\": {\"urls\": [\"in.sol\"]}` instead.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\nAdjust [`cmdlineTests.sh`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/test/cmdlineTests.sh) so that it enters test case dir before running it and exits it afterwards. Then remove any hard-coded test case names from test inputs and regenerate expectations.",
