    "body": "The disadvantage of my suggestion above is that ``address`` as a function argument or as type in a variable declaration cannot be required to be an address that's payable.\r\n\r\nHowever, the suggestion can be extended with an optional ``payable`` specifier for argument and variable declarations of ``address`` type, as follows (similarly to storage specifiers):\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction f1(address a){\r\n  // a.transfer(...); would be an error\r\n}\r\nfunction f2(address payable a){\r\n  a.transfer(...); // this is valid\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe default \"payability\" would be \"nonpayable\", so ``f1`` can be called with any ``address``, but ``transfer`` cannot be called on ``a``.  ``f2`` cannot be called with ``nonpayable`` addresses, but ``transfer`` can be called on its argument ``a``.\r\n\r\nAn address converted from an integer is ``payable``, an address converted from a contract gets its payability from the payability of its fallback function.\r\n\r\nThe modifier would only be used for variable and argument declaration, not for conversions. ``address(c)`` implicitly is of type ``address payable`` if ``c`` has a payable fallback and of type ``address`` otherwise. ``address(0x0...0)`` would implicitly be of ``address payable`` type.\r\n\r\nThis would be breaking, since it would require users to add ``payable`` to all ``address`` arguments and variables, on which ``transfer`` is called. However, I think it's better than turning it around and use an ``nonpayable`` specfier instead.\r\n\r\nEdit: ``address payable`` would be implicitly convertible to ``address``. I don't think ``address`` has to be convertible to ``address payable`` at all, not even explicitly.\r\nThis extended suggestion is close to the introduction of a new named type like ``contract`` or ``account``, but I'd prefer it, since it reuses language concepts that are already present and I think it is more user-friendly.",

We don't have ``string storage(...)`` and ``string bytes(...)``, but only ``string(...)`` and the data location is \"inherited\" from ``...``. I'd do the same for ``address(...)`` and state-mutability/payability.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```\r\ncontract C {\r\n    function f(bytes memory b) public pure {\r\n        string memory s = string(b); s; // works\r\n    }\r\n    function g(bytes memory b) internal pure {\r\n        string storage s = string(b); s; // fails\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```",
