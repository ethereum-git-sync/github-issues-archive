I read up a little more on automatic semicolon insertion, and I am more convinced that we do not want to go down that road :)\r\nThe thing is, already in javascript there are certain confusing cases and it probably takes a while to find all of them. I believe that in Solidity there are even more such cases and people already try to find ways to make Solidity code confusing.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying that this is an impossibility, but such a proposal certainly needs to be way more grounded on what actually has to change, how, where ambiguities are hidden and it also needs more support from the community.
