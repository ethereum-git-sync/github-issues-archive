I came to the point when I get Stack too deep exception.\r\nIn my search for the reason I came to a thing I can not get my head around.\r\nThe contract is way bigger but I copied the relevant part. The thing is how is it even possible that a defined public property effects the stack? And what would be possible solutions?\r\nI already tried compile with and without viaIR.\r\n```\r\ncontract PositionRouter\r\n{\r\n    using Address for address;\r\n    using SafeERC20 for IERC20;\r\n\r\n    struct DecreasePositionRequest {\r\n        address account;\r\n        address[] path;\r\n        address indexToken;\r\n        uint256 collateralDelta;\r\n        uint256 sizeDelta;\r\n        bool isLong;\r\n        address receiver;\r\n        uint256 acceptablePrice;\r\n        uint256 minOut;\r\n        uint256 executionFee;\r\n        uint256 blockNumber;\r\n        uint256 blockTime;\r\n        bool withdrawETH;\r\n        address callbackTarget;\r\n    }\r\n// Enabling this leads to Stack too deep\r\n// mapping (bytes32 => DecreasePositionRequest) public decreasePositionRequests;\r\n...\r\n}\r\n   ",
