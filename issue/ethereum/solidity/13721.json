We should be able to improve the performance of the stack layout generation if we are able to determine the minimum stack layout prefix before shuffling, reducing the number of permutations, or even replacing the current shuffling step completely. \r\n   - [x] Create a Dominator tree from the CFG.\r\n   - [ ] Generate the stack layout prefix based on the dominator tree and perform the shuffling for the remaining slots if any.\r\n   - [ ] Evaluate performance of the approach in term of compilation time and gas usage.\r\n   - [ ] Improve stack to memory (we need to minimize stack to memory moves).\r\n   - [ ] Ensure all codegen tests pass :)\r\n- [ ] Lift down stack-to-memory from code-transform-Yul-optimizer interplay to being handled in the code transform directly.\r\n\r\n### Out of scope\r\n\r\n- Avoiding stack too deep errors:\r\n  -  under all circumstances: Like in recursive functions.\r\n  - in the presence of memory unsafe assembly \r\n",
