  "body": "Since soljson.js now includes Z3, any source with the smt pragma will actually run the Z3 queries. That will slow things down and there's no way to prevent it without actually removing the pragma, which changes the source code hash in the metadata the compiler produces.\r\nFor example source-verification won't benefit from the SMT warnings - but it will need perfectly matching source code.\r\n\r\nSo it should be possible to disable the builtin solver via standard-json. Maybe in a similar way in which we have \"enabled solvers\" in our test runs - or in some other way.\r\n\r\nHaving this be configurable also makes sense for the ``solc`` - not sure we need a command-line argument as well, but having it there via standard-json as well is at least not a problem.",
