    "body": "Hi @ShubhamWadne, thanks for reporting the problem.\r\n\r\nI gave it a quick look, and it seems that the problem is indeed in our layout. The `remix-link-container` is set as a [paragraph tag](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/c980e96b64f9f810f909d291791a1c421ffbf08d/docs/ext/remix_code_links.py#L40) positioned in the far right corner of a code block (see: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/docs/_static/css/custom.css#L53), outside the total display area.\r\n\r\nI think that if we want to display the open-in-remix arrow button on the side of the example code block, we should decrement the total size of the code block until it fits the link, inlining the `remix-link-container`, and maybe also making it a `div` instead of a `p`. Or we can convert the arrow button to a simple, but nicer, button and display it on top of the respective code block. Either options would be fine I guess.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to give it a try, please let's us know :)",
