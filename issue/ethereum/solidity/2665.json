However, the imports quickly get confused trying to import each other.  It would be nice if it supported graphs like this as it is a fairly common pattern.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that this problem does _not_ occur if both contracts are placed in the same file.  This suggests to me that the compiler can handle this scenario, it just gets confused by the cyclic imports.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I'm open to ideas for workarounds.  I considered extracting out interfaces for each but in that case the interfaces would have the same problem because fundamentally I am using this cycle to deal with cross-contract access control like `require(_providedChild == parent.child())`.",

So in this case, I'm bringing in `/app/src/reporting/Parent.sol` which is saved as \"already loaded\", and then that brings in `ROOT/reporting/Child.sol` (marking it as loaded) which then brings in `ROOT/reporting/Parent.sol` which is seen as a new file because so far the compiler has only seen `ROOT/reporting/Child.sol` and `/app/src/reporting/Parent.sol`.\r\n\r\nAssuming that the `sources` block of the standard JSON supports remapping, I'll try replacing `/app/src/` with `ROOT/` to see if that resolves the issue.\r\n\r\nAssuming that works, should I open a separate issue to apply remappings and absolute file pathing _before_ noting the file as loaded, so all loaded files use the absolute file path as the lookup key, rather than mixing relative, absolute, and remapped files?",

    "body": "I dug in a bit more and the proposed change of using the absolute file path for the `sources` key worked for my test environment.  However, I am also using a Solidity extension in VS code and the same fix didn't resolve the issue.  The setup of the plugin is a bit different as it uses solcjs and calls `solc.compileStandardWrapper` with two arguments, the first being the standard JSON and the second being a function to process import statements.  In this case, the plugin is doing `fs.readFileSync(importPath, 'utf-8')`.  I'm not terribly clear how solc-js works so this may be a problem for them instead, but the error I get back is similar to this one which suggests to me that the root cause may be the same.\r\n\r\nWhat is of note is that I only have problems when viewing (compiling) files that include themselves transitively.  If I open (compile) a file that transitively includes a file that then transitively includes itself there is no problem.  This aligns with what you two were saying and suggests that the file being passed to the compiler for compilation isn't being keyed the same as a file that is later imported.",

In the end, my issue was a path separator inconsistency on Windows, where some places were using `/` and other places were using `\\`.  I think solc should normalize the path to an absolute path (not relative) _and_ normalize the path separator before using the filename as a lookup key to determine whether or not a match is found.\r\n\r\nSorry about the thrash, let me know if you would like me to open a new issue (feature request?) for the above.",
