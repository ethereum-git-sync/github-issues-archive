  "body": "# The problem:\r\n\r\ntry/catch construct was added to allow easily handle reverts when calling functions.\r\nHowever, it gives false sense of security, since there are cases where reverts are \"leaked\" through\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nThe following code looks safe, since the call is covered by catch-all try/catch.\r\nBut in fact, it reverts\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\ninterface Istr {\r\n    function retstr() external view returns(string memory);\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract Test {\r\n    \r\n    function asd() external {\r\n        try Istr(address(this)).retstr() returns(string memory ret) {\r\n            emit Debug(ret);\r\n        } catch {\r\n            emit Debug('reverted');\r\n            \r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function retstr() external  returns (uint) {\r\n        return 1;\r\n    }\r\n    event Debug(string mesg);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Root cause\r\nwhile try/catch does catch all reverts by the external call, it doesn't handle any local handling of the **response**.\r\nThe above example receives a \"uint\" return value, but tries to parse it as dynamic content (string), and the decoder reverts.\r\n\r\nThere are other cases where the user might use checked arithmetics between the try/catch, which assumes it get caught by \"catch\"\r\n\r\n## Suggested fix\r\n\r\n- At a minimum, the return value decoding should not revert  in a try/catch block. otherwise, try/catch can't be trusted when calling unknown contracts, and developers must resort to low-level `address.call(abi.encodeWithSelector(...))` (and manually validate the returned structure before decoding)\r\n\r\nIn addition, the try/catch model should be updated:\r\n- in case a user specifies a `catch {}` block, it is his expectation that no revert will leak from the \"try\" block.\r\n- The entire code after the \"try\" until the \"catch\" should be \"no-revert\" - must not generate revert by the compiler itself.\r\n- Instead of reverting, this code should jump to the `catch {}` block \r\n- Implementing a full \"stack unwinding\" for revert handling seems unlikely for solidity, so instead I suggest:\r\n   - when compiling methods, mark each method as \"may-revert\" or \"no-revert\"\r\n   - Is case the try/catch block calls \"may-revert\" method,  a compilation error should be generated: `cannot call method X from a try/catch block: the method might revert`\r\n  - the user should then alter his code and call that method outside the try/catch block, or add \"unchecked\" markers to that method\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "I think we might be better off closing this and reformulating the problem to be more focused. As is it is now, it touches upon multiple things:\r\n- Local reverts coming from decoding and other extra checks on the external call cannot be handled. This is now covered by #13869 (and we have a syntax proposal there).\r\n- Reverts in the `try` block are not being caught. I agree that it's counter-intuitive and maybe worth adjusting the syntax so that users do not expect that much from it. It would be breaking though so definitely not before 0.9.0. One idea to deal with this might be to eliminate that block and replace it with an [`else {}` block like in Python](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#handling-exceptions).\r\n- Actually catching reverts from the `try` block with either full unwinding or a \"may-revert\" hack. Unfortunately I don't think we'd be implementing this in the near future. I won't say never, but in the short term we'd like to patch the `try`/`catch` to be good enough in the current form and focus on other things on the roadmap. In the meantime we can of course discuss ideas for the future of `try`/`catch` but that would be better done on the forum.",
