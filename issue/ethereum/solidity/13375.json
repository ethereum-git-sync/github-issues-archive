  "body": "Hi, I stumbled across this while optimizing my contracts.\r\nI do not know if this is maybe and hardhat-gas-reporter bug because in my opinion both options should lead to the same byte code.\r\nUQ144x112 is just a library for unsigned fixed decimal it does not matter what kind of library is used.\r\n```\r\ncontract Test\r\n{\r\n   using UQ144x112 for uint256;\r\n\r\n   function test1() returns (uint256)\r\n   {\r\n      uint112 res1 = 1000;\r\n      uint112 res2 = 2000;\r\n      unchecked\r\n      {\r\n          return UQ144x112.encode(res1).uqdiv(res2);\r\n      }\r\n   }\r\n\r\n    function test2() returns (uint256)\r\n   {\r\n      uint112 res1 = 1000;\r\n      uint112 res2 = 2000;\r\n      unchecked\r\n      {\r\n          return UQ144x112.uqdiv(UQ144x112.encode(res1),res2);\r\n      }\r\n   }\r\n```\r\nI hope there is now error but I just put it together instead of copying the whole contract.\r\nIf I run the tests with gas report enabled `test1()` uses 5 gwei more gas than `test2()` which I do find odd.",
