  "body": "Not sure the appropriated repo to post this so I'm posting to both web3 and here. Upgrading solc from `0.1.1` to `0.1.2` makes the web3 compiler stop working with the message `solc: no build results found`. The solc command line options changed a lot from `0.1.1` to `0.1.2` and that's probably the reason. Downgrading solc to `0.1.1` solved the issue. I'm using Ubuntu 15.04.\n",
