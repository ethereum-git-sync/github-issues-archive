    "body": "@chriseth - I didn't see a TODO in the code, but the issue seems to be that in TypeChecker.cpp the `TypeChecker::visit(FunctionCall const& _functionCall)` method does a few checks to skip adding the argument types to the function call (based on isPositionalCall), and when that eventually gets passed to `TypeChecker::visit(Identifier const& _identifier)` it first checks whether the argument types are annotated, and if not, it assumes it should look up a variable declared at a higher scope, which of course, is the wrong thing to do.\r\n\r\nAny idea why types are only annotated when using positional parameters?\r\n\r\nI had edited this comment since I broke my test while changing parameter names, but I fixed it. To test whether skipping annotation for positional parameters mattered, I commented out the if conditions that cause type annotation to be skipped when using named parameters. this resulted in type annotations being added even when calling a function with positional parameters. With this change, all existing non-ipc tests succeeded (I can't run ipc tests yet).\r\n\r\nI also wrote my own test, which also passes:\r\n\r\n```\r\nBOOST_AUTO_TEST_CASE(overload_function_call_with_names_in_named_args)\r\n{\r\n    char const* sourceCode = R\"(\r\n    contract test {\r\n        function fun(uint a, uint b) returns (uint r) {\r\n            r = a + b;\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        function fun(uint c) returns (uint d) {\r\n            d = c;\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        function funfinal() returns (uint e) {\r\n            e = fun({c: 1});\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    )\";\r\n    CHECK_SUCCESS(sourceCode);\r\n}\r\n```",
