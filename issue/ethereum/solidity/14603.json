    "body": "Hi @FredCoen, do you have a code which we can reproduce the problem? Note, that external functions which have memory arguments can be overridden with calldata arguments and vice-versa, since they can only be called externally and thereby always get their arguments in calldata. Maybe that's the confusion here.\r\n\r\nFor instance, see the example below:\r\n```solidity\r\npragma solidity >=0.8.2 <0.9.0;\r\n\r\nabstract contract A {\r\n    function f(string memory s) external virtual;\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract B is A {\r\n    string public a;\r\n\r\n    function f(string calldata s) public virtual override {\r\n        a = s;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is completely fine. But, if you change the visibility of function `f` in the contract `A` to anything other than `external` you should get a compiler error like this: `Data locations of parameters have to be the same when overriding non-external functions, but they differ`\r\n\r\nYou can see here when this was fixed in Solidity `0.8.14` https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12850 and read more about the bug at that time in our blog: https://soliditylang.org/blog/2022/05/17/data-location-inheritance-bug/\r\n\r\nHowever, if you can still reproduce this bug in any solidity version greater than `0.8.14`, please share your code with us :) \r\n",
