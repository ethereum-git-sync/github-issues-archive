    "body": "I'm not sure I understand the question. I need both web3.js AND solc compiler for the EthDeployer tool, not one or the other.\r\n\r\nSince you guys removed solc from the node. I was FORCED to rewrite this tool to use browser-solc. My tutorial is the ONLY working tutorial on the web now, because every single other tutorial used solc from a node connection. Even the ethereum sponsored tutorials and docs have all been broken by that change. However, it's better to use browser-solc, because then you never need anyone to install solc on a server or locally on a client machine. It's actually by far the most elegant solution.\r\n\r\nI fixed the issue, although it's still not ideal, now EthDeployer just basically completely ignores warnings, because solc throws erroneous warnings sometimes. It's a degredation in the tool because before you could actually use it to sniff out warnings and it wouldn't deploy if you had any, now it just has to ignore warnings and deprecated contracts could be deployed, possibly. It would take me hours of work to test and update the tool to conditionally allow you to bypass warnings, and it would break the simpified one-button-one-click interface. \r\n\r\nI would implore you guys to no longer accept PR's that can cause erroneous warnings to get returned to the console. That basically breaks the functionality of some tools, such as EthDeployer, because it is supposed to be a simplified debugging platform with only one button.\r\n\r\nSee: https://github.com/Tectract/EthDeployer/commit/d58af664d79f9459b88669f505f4bd27df33a6a1\r\n\r\nand also: https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/3793#issuecomment-314700769\r\n\r\nand also: https://blockgeeks.com/guides/how-to-learn-solidity/",
