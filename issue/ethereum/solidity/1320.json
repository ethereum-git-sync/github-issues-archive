  "body": "Currently, Solidity does not have a real intermediate language in the sense that this language could be stored in a file and re-compiled. If we had such an intermediate language, it would be easier to verify the correctness of compilation and compilation result, especially in connection with macros ( #1319 ), because the correctness of macros could be established one by one.\r\n\r\nThe \"Solidity inline assembly\" language already provides a step in that direction (and was also planned for that purpose). The core of the refactoring would happen between the compiler context and the Assembly object. The compiler context would not directly generate AssemblyItems but rather assembly text (or a lightly parsed representation of it) and this assembly text would then be transformed into AssemblyItems at the assembly stage. There are some missing items in transitioning from the C++ Assembly object into using the assembly language as intermediate language, which have to be added as syntactical elements or just keywords to assembly:\r\n\r\n- [x] sub-assemblies (especially for distinguishing between runtime and creation time context)\r\n- [ ] linkable libraries\r\n- [x] the error tag\r\n- [ ] program size\r\n- [ ] source location ",

    "body": "I think we should spend some minutes talking about style before merging https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1327/files and we should probably define all the items mentioned above.\n\nGenerally about the style: Opcodes are lowercase and do not use camelcase. Should we follow that? What about prefixing system-level objects/routines/opcode-like symbols with e.g. a dollar sign? \n- sub-assemblies:\n  `subtag: assembly [\"VM\"] { ... }`, at the end of the code, compiles the given assembly (in its own context), and appends it to the data section of the code\n\n`dataSize(subtag)`: pushes the size of the sub-assembly of the given name\n\n`dataOffset(subtag)`: pushes the offset of the sub-assembly of the given name\n- linkable libraries:\n  `linkerSymbol(\"SymbolName\")` pushes a not yet specified linker symbol - note that currently, only 20 byte symbols are supported, we could change it to `linkerSymbol(\"SymbolName\", size)` or `linkerSymbol[size](\"SymbolName\")` in the future\n- error tag:\n  Since opcodes are lowercase, I'm a bit worried about making it uppercase. Decision: `invalidJumpLabel`\n- program size:\n  `bytecodeSize`\n- source location:\n  In a comment after the opcode. We should find a condensed format similar to the ones used in the source mappings (only re-mention changes). I am not sure whether we should also replace the source name by the source index, as we can omit the source name most of the time, I would say it is fine.\n  As far as the syntax is concerned:\n  `/* \"sourceName\":start:length */`\n  _before_ the inline assembly object it applies to, or `// \"sourceName\":start:length` _after_ the object it applies to.\n",

    "body": "In many cases, it is also beneficial to declare real syntactic macros (as opposed to functions). This is helpful for example when we are considering different backends: WASM has direct support for loops and functions, so these should be retained in the intermediate language by e.g. using syntactic macros. The actual definition of the macro can be different depending on the backend.\r\n\r\nWe might go as far as rust's macros, or just use `{` and `}`-based arguments:\r\n\r\nExample macro usage:\r\n```\r\nlet x := 2\r\n$for { let i := 1 } { lt(i, 10) } { i := add(i, 1) } {\r\n  x := mul(x, i)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nArguments for macros are pseudo-blocks delimited by a balanced pair of `{` / `}`, although these braces do not create scope levels (because of that, `i` is visible inside the body.\r\n\r\nDefinitions of macros might look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmacro_def $for(init, cond, post, body) {\r\n  {\r\n    init\r\n    $for_continue:\r\n    jumpi($for_break, iszero(cond))\r\n    body\r\n    post\r\n    jump($for_continue)\r\n    $for_break:\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the macro even supports `break` and `continue` be suitable other macros that jump to the respective labels. The only thing that has to be solved for that is stack height management.",
