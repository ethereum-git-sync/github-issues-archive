  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nI cannot seem to find any official documentation on the correct behavior of a require() statement in a public view/pure-type function, but I think the current behavior is definitely not right.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version: 0.4.24\r\n- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Remix\r\n- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: Geth\r\n- Operating system: Windows/Linux\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nThere's a sample contract I have deployed on the mainnet\r\n\r\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0xd0b4e64c323186340ed2d8168ddae8f18677560e#code\r\n\r\n```\r\npragma solidity ^0.4.24;\r\n\r\ncontract test {\r\n    \r\n    function sub1(uint256 _a, uint256 _b) public pure returns (uint256 result) {\r\n        require(_a >= _b);\r\n        return _a - _b;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    function sub2(uint256 _a, uint256 _b) public pure returns (uint256 result) {\r\n        require(_a >= _b, \"_a cannot be less than _b\");\r\n        return _a - _b;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n}\r\n```\r\nSo calling the sub1 and sub2 methods with Remix or web3 will produce strange results.\r\n\r\nIf I call sub1(3, 5) from Remix, it will return a result of 0, which is not exactly correct.\r\n\r\nIf I call sub1 from web3 with\r\n\r\n`test.methods.sub1(3,5).call().then(console.log).catch((err) => {console.log(\"Error: \" + err);})`\r\n\r\nit will return\r\n\r\n> Error: Error: Couldn't decode uint256 from ABI: 0x\r\n\r\nwhich is better than returning a result of 0, but still not sure it should be the correct error message.\r\n\r\nNow the really problem is when I call sub2 with either Remix or web3 like\r\n\r\n`test.methods.sub2(3,5).call().then(console.log).catch((err) => {console.log(\"Error: \" + err);})`\r\n\r\nIt will in both cases (Remix and web3) return a non-error result of \r\n\r\n> 3963877391197344453575983046348115674221700746820753546331534351508065746944\r\n\r\nwhich is definitely NOT what I should get when doing a subtraction of 3 minus 5.\r\n\r\nIMHO a require(false) in a public view/pure function should either generate an appropriate error message, or they should not be allowed in a public view/pure function.",

    "body": "@kyriediculous I think you are confusing about different scenarios. According to the official docs here\r\nhttps://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.24/control-structures.html#error-handling-assert-require-revert-and-exceptions\r\n\r\n> The assert function should only be used to test for internal errors, and to check invariants. The require function should be used to ensure valid conditions, such as inputs, or contract state variables are met, or to validate return values from calls to external contracts. If used properly, analysis tools can evaluate your contract to identify the conditions and function calls which will reach a failing assert. Properly functioning code should never reach a failing assert statement; if this happens there is a bug in your contract which you should fix.\r\n\r\nThe example SafeMath library you referenced using asserts because it is an **internal** library, that means the calling party should be some other smart contract code which has already checked for the uint overflow conditions before calling the internal SafeMath library, and if the SafeMath library assert fails it means you need to fix your callling code in your contract.\r\n\r\nMy example here is a public function that can be called directly by Dapp front end outside the blockchain, thus require should be used to enforce valid conditions in the off-chain inputs. \r\n\r\nAnd I have deployed a contract in the mainnet at the address **0xd0B4e64c323186340ed2D8168DdaE8f18677560E** to demostrate the issue, like I have posted in the topic \r\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0xd0b4e64c323186340ed2d8168ddae8f18677560e#code\r\nyou may call the sub1 and sub2 methods with web3 or remix with MetaMask or infura.io to see how they receive a result of \r\n\r\n> 3963877391197344453575983046348115674221700746820753546331534351508065746944\r\n\r\n when calling things like  sub2(1, 2), sub2(3, 5), etc.",
