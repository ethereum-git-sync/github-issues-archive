  "body": "## Abstract\r\nEvents, in natspec documentation, are not inherited like the methods are.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nI'm building a Typescript output for solidity. A little bit like Typechain. When inheriting ERC20 from openzeppelin for example I can generate TsDoc from solc's devdoc output for the methods, but not for the events.\r\n\r\nExample of output I would like to achieved using the devdoc output of the ERC20: \r\n```typescript\r\n  events: {\r\n    /**\r\n     * Emitted when the allowance of a `spender` for an `owner` is set by a call to {approve}. `value` is the new allowance.\r\n     */\r\n    Approval: (owner: string, spender: string, value: BigNumber) => void;\r\n    /**\r\n     * Emitted when when an amount of token is sent from one address to another\r\n     * @param from the address the tokens are taken from\r\n     * @param to the address the tokens are moved to\r\n     * @param value the amount of tokens transfered\r\n     */\r\n    Transfer: (from: string, to: string, value: BigNumber) => void;\r\n  };\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\nBest would be for the events to work like methods : https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.13/natspec-format.html#inheritance-notes \r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\nBackwards  Compatible\r\n\r\n## Related issues\r\nIn #8911, @Marenz mentioned why events are not inherited from the parent class. Though I think this would greatly help for tools that want to generate dev-related documentation from the contract.",
