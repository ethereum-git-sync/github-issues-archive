Additionally, it would be nice if the docs would reflect the overall Solidity brand identity.\r\n\r\n# To Do\r\n\r\n- [x] Add custom CSS file called \"Solidity light mode\" with the color changes described blow ([docs](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/adding-custom-css.html))\r\n- [x] In the dark mode CSS file, adjust the search highlight color to be soft red: #F0978B (yellow is currently not readable)\r\n- [x] [optional] Add Solidity logo in the menu bar and delete logo from the index page\r\n- [ ] [optional] Adjust font to Work Sans to be consistent with the font across blog, portal and docs\r\n\r\n**Proposed color changes:**\r\n- Make code block background Solidity light grey: #E5E5E5\r\n- Make titles / highlights Solidity light blue: #65AFFF\r\n- Make hyperlinks Solidity electric blue: #002fa7\r\n- Make highlights for searched words warmer yellow: #EAC545\r\n\r\n**Rough sketch of how it would look with the proposed colors:**\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41991517/132236639-27d544d6-9602-433e-a0bd-3e78b527fe94.png)\r\n",

    "body": "I'm not sure why the sudden changes of color occured re. the background of code blocks, but here were my reasonings for grey:\r\n- The current green/yellow-ish is a really \"not nice for the eyes\" toxic color, which does not fit our Solidity brand colors\r\n- To make it look more consistent with the blog, I thought grey would look nice and clean. There's enough color happening in the syntax highlights, so no need for more color in the background.\r\n- I chose a darker grey since I thought a bit of contrast would benefit (contrast between the actual background and the background of the code boxes)\r\n\r\nThat being said, if we want it to come even closer to how code examples are presented on the blog, we should consider a lighter grey (#FAFAFA) with a darker grey outline.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41991517/134383392-7e1082da-ae44-45f3-9034-2e97e4fb4548.png)\r\n",
