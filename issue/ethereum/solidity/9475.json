  "body": "As preparation for the upcoming Solidity Portal we decided to use the documentation as the \"main source of truth\". Right now, there is no part in the docs which summarizes easily how to \"get started\" as a newbie. This is mainly due to the fact that is isn't quite so easy to get started and we don't want to necessarily promote one tool over the other (or take other decisions for the user). To overcome this issue we could just implement a little checklist with links at the very beginning of the [basics section](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.6.11/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html), which could cover stuff like (just rough idea, will obviously think more about the exact wording and content):\r\n\r\n1. Get familiar with blockchain and the Ethereum / the EVM\r\n2. Know what Smart Contracts are\r\n3. Get the compiler\r\n4. Choose an IDE (or tool)\r\n5. \"Try something easy\"\r\n6. [...]\r\n7. [...]\r\n\r\n#9175 for context on portal.",
