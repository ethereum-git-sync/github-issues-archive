  "body": "## Abstract\r\nCurrently the contract ABI lists only events defined in the contract and inherited from other contracts. It does not list events defined in libraries that the contract emits and (after #12921) also events defined in other contracts.\r\n\r\nJust like we do with errors, the ABI should list both defined and emitted events.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nA contract can emit events defined in a variety of places:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nlibrary   L { /** A library event */             event EL(uint8); }\r\ninterface I { /** An interface event */          event EI(uint16); }\r\ncontract  C { /** A foreign contract event */    event EC(uint24); }\r\ncontract  D { /** An inherited contract event */ event ED(uint32); }\r\n\r\ncontract E is D {\r\n    /// Own event\r\n    event EE(uint40);\r\n\r\n    function foo() public {\r\n        emit L.EL(1);\r\n        emit I.EI(2);\r\n        emit C.EC(3);\r\n        emit ED(4);\r\n        emit EE(5);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nNot all of them get listed in the ABI:\r\n```json\r\n[\r\n    {\r\n        \"anonymous\": false,\r\n        \"inputs\":\r\n        [{\"indexed\": false, \"internalType\": \"uint32\", \"name\": \"\", \"type\": \"uint32\"}],\r\n        \"name\": \"ED\",\r\n        \"type\": \"event\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        \"anonymous\": false,\r\n        \"inputs\":\r\n        [{\"indexed\": false, \"internalType\": \"uint40\", \"name\": \"\", \"type\": \"uint40\"}],\r\n        \"name\": \"EE\",\r\n        \"type\": \"event\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        \"inputs\": [],\r\n        \"name\": \"foo\",\r\n        \"outputs\": [],\r\n        \"stateMutability\": \"nonpayable\",\r\n        \"type\": \"function\"\r\n    }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis poses a problem for tools like Truffle, which use the ABI to determine which events the contract might emit.\r\n\r\nThe `solc --userdoc` output compiled from the Natspec docstrings also only lists this subset of events:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"events\":\r\n    {\r\n        \"ED(uint32)\": {\"notice\": \"An inherited contract event \"},\r\n        \"EE(uint40)\": {\"notice\": \"Own event\"}\r\n    },\r\n    \"kind\": \"user\",\r\n    \"methods\": {},\r\n    \"version\": 1\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\nThe only real problem here is the userdoc. The current structure only allows one set of docs for each signature. We are planning to change the structure in Natspec v2 (#11114) bit this will be a breaking change.\r\n\r\nSince not including these events in the ABI is so problematic for tools, we have decided to simply ignore the Natspec problem - for now in case of conflicting signatures we'll include the Natspec docstring only if there is one in the current contract (defined directly in it or inherited). Otherwise we'll ignore the docstring. This is not the correct way to handle this but we expect the impact of this problem to be very low and the problem will disappear once we release Natspec v2 anyway.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\nUnlike #11114, this is fully backwards compatible in terms of ABI and userdoc structure. It does change the meaning of event list included there but not in a way that should pose problems to tools.",
