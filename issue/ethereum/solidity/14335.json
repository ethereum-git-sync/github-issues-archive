    "body": "Found it. There was a library used in the BasePositionManager. Since this is a update attempt there was also an old version of that library with the same name present. Looks like hardhat or solc mixed that up. Since the library uses external functions I think the use as external library is intended. I just did not see (and still do not see) this in the old deploy scripts used for that contract.",
