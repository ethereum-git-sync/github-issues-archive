If we want to point to the sources, then here in fact an ``std::string_view`` would be best.\n\nThe comment makes sense, though, and would go towards using a repository a bit like the ``YulStringRepository``, but with less emphasis on optimizing comparisons, but mostly for lifetime management... ``shared_ptr`` works, but it's rather ugly and evil for this, explicit lifetime is always better and should be possible.\n\nIf all of them really always only point to some source range, ``string_view`` would be really nice, but we'd need to check.\n\nBut actually nothing here needs ``range-v3`` ;-).",
