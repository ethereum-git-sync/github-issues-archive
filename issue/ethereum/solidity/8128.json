Unfortunately, since contracts and interfaces do not implicitly cast to `address`, this means every time I use the interface I must cast to address first.  This leads to a lot of unnecessary code, and can sometimes leads to bug as explicit casts are error prone.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\nIf a contract or interface is used as a `mapping` key, it should be functionally equivalent as an `address` being used as the mapping key with the exception of type checking when the mapping is indexed.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\nNone.",
