See for example [recent `b_osx` run on `develop`](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/23649/workflows/01a8fe85-debd-4892-874c-2745e02c10cc/jobs/1038415). There are lots of errors about symlinks being skipped, which might have something to do with it:\r\n```\r\n...\r\nSkipping writing \"usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Homebrew/vendor/portable-ruby/2.6.8/lib/ruby/2.6.0/bundler/env.rb\" - open /usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Homebrew/vendor/portable-ruby/2.6.8/lib/ruby/2.6.0/bundler/env.rb: permission denied\r\nSkipping writing \"usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Homebrew/vendor/portable-ruby/2.6.8/lib/ruby/2.6.0/bundler/environment_preserver.rb\" - open /usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Homebrew/vendor/portable-ruby/2.6.8/lib/ruby/2.6.0/bundler/environment_preserver.rb: permission denied\r\nSkipping writing \"usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Homebrew/vendor/portable-ruby/2.6.8/lib/ruby/2.6.0/bundler\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor now we have disabled the cache because just installing the dependencies is quicker than that (4 min). Still, the cache used to save us some time so we need to investigate and fix the problem. Might be a good idea to report it to CircleCI.",

    "body": "For the record, @r0qs tried re-enabling the cache and it still does not work the way we used to do. I think we need a different approach, and that would be, broadly speaking, caching the things we download, not the things that get installed. I think that the download is the slow part and the installation is pretty quick. That should also be more robust against breakage like this, because we would not have to make any assumptions about the contents of the installation dirs (especially that we can just replace it wholesale).\r\n\r\nAlso, there are two distinct parts to this - caching Homebrew packages and caching the other libs we install in `osx_install_dependencies.sh` (i.e. evmone and z3). Each could be done independently and the libs are much less complicated to handle than Homebrew.\r\n\r\nSee [the comment thread in the PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14485#issuecomment-1689819247) for detailed discussion of this approach and the problems we encountered so far.",
