There are lots of errors about symlinks being skipped, which might have something to do with it:\r\n```\r\n...\r\nSkipping writing \"usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Homebrew/vendor/portable-ruby/2.6.8/lib/ruby/2.6.0/bundler/env.rb\" - open /usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Homebrew/vendor/portable-ruby/2.6.8/lib/ruby/2.6.0/bundler/env.rb: permission denied\r\nSkipping writing \"usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Homebrew/vendor/portable-ruby/2.6.8/lib/ruby/2.6.0/bundler/environment_preserver.rb\" - open /usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Homebrew/vendor/portable-ruby/2.6.8/lib/ruby/2.6.0/bundler/environment_preserver.rb: permission denied\r\nSkipping writing \"usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Homebrew/vendor/portable-ruby/2.6.8/lib/ruby/2.6.0/bundler\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor now we have disabled the cache because just installing the dependencies is quicker than that (4 min). Still, the cache used to save us some time so we need to investigate and fix the problem. Might be a good idea to report it to CircleCI.",
