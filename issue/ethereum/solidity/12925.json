    "body": "For the record, @r0qs tried re-enabling the cache and it still does not work the way we used to do. I think we need a different approach, and that would be, broadly speaking, caching the things we download, not the things that get installed. I think that the download is the slow part and the installation is pretty quick. That should also be more robust against breakage like this, because we would not have to make any assumptions about the contents of the installation dirs (especially that we can just replace it wholesale).\r\n\r\nAlso, there are two distinct parts to this - caching Homebrew packages and caching the other libs we install in `osx_install_dependencies.sh` (i.e. evmone and z3). Each could be done independently and the libs are much less complicated to handle than Homebrew.\r\n\r\nSee [the comment thread in the PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14485#issuecomment-1689819247) for detailed discussion of this approach and the problems we encountered so far.",
