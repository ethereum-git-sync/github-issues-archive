  "body": "Although #5377 seems to fix the immediate non-determinism issue we had, I think we should revisit and improve this at some point.\r\n\r\nI think it would be cleaner to have the ``YulStringRepository`` be a member to some kind of context class (that doesn't exist at the time of writing) or a local variable somewhere or to give it an explicit lifetime in some other way. There could still be a static pointer (or ``std::weak_ptr``?) to this global object in ``YulStringRepository`` that can be initialized upon creation and uninitialized/set to zero upon destruction of the ``YulStringRepository``. ``YulStringRepository::instance()`` should assert that a ``YulStringRepository`` is currently available and return it, but throw if there is no global ``YulStringRepository`` instead of just creating one.",
