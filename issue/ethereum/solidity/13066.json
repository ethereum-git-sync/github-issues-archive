  "body": "[`soltest.sh`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/.circleci/soltest.sh) passes `--logger=JUNIT` option to soltest, which makes it produce an XML report that CircleCI can then analyze to list failed test cases on the TESTS tab (see [CircleCI docs > Collecting test data](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/collect-test-data/)). Currently using this option means that errors are no longer printed to stderr, which makes analyzing the output harder. Especially combined with bugs like #12862, which break processing of the XML report (and we actually still haven't fixed that completlely, it happens in some cases).\r\n\r\nThe task here is to make it print both to stderr and to the XML file, possibly with an extra option (though I think it would be fine as the default behavior too).\r\n\r\nsoltest is based on [Boost Test](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_79_0/libs/test/doc/html/index.html) which, I think, does not have options for printing to both out of the box. Please check that first though - if it does, solving this could be as simple as specifying an extra option in `soltest.sh`. Otherwise it will have to be implemented manually in C++.",
