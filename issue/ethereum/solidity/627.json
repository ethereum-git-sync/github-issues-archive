    "body": "@o0ragman0o In C++, you would have to implement a separate getter in the derived class, so that makes a bit of sense to me. I guess the point you're making is due to the automatic nature of setters/getters? It seems to me that, without the data in the abstract class, there wouldn't be an automatic generation of setters/getters. But in any case, to get back to the issue, this behaviour should be documented as well.\r\n\r\nA summary of above issues so far:\r\n\r\n**benefits**\r\n\r\n- self-documentation\r\n- easier upgradability\r\n- template method\r\n- lessening code duplication\r\n- removal of cyclic dependancies\r\n\r\n**questions**\r\n\r\n- does it support forcing implementations?\r\n- how are conflicts resolved (already documented)\r\n\r\n**watch outs**\r\n\r\n- getters/setters in abstract class not inherited.\r\n",
