    "body": "Any news on this?\r\n\r\nThis would be very useful for the following rationale:\r\n- accessing storage data is very expensive, while accessing contract code is very cheap;\r\n- this gives a great gas advantage for the use of constants, because they live in the contract's code;\r\n- value-type constants are not good for storing larger amounts of data;\r\n- `bytes32[20] constant` is considered a `constant of non-value type`;\r\n- pointers to data defined through `bytes constant table = hex\"398ba...\" are not accessible in assembly (`TypeError: Only direct number constants and references to such constants are supported by inline assembly.`);\r\n- the solution of copying every byte through a loop reduces the gas gains obtained by avoiding storage.\r\n\r\nHere are possible solutions:\r\n- allow the code to get a range of bytes into fixed-size types, like this issue suggests;\r\n- make `bytes32[20] constant`s possible, like `bytes constant`s currently are;\r\n- make a pointer to a `bytes constant` accessible in assembly;\r\n\r\nIs there a chance of any of this solutions be made available in the near future?\r\n\r\nIs there another solution that I am not seeing?",
