So it seems like they're not really building solc executable as I thought but just a crate with bindings. I suppose they can't just use our release binaries for that.\r\n\r\nAnd as for failing on these warnings - our CI does not cover 100% of all possible configurations. We don't build with all boost versions, we don't build on 32-bit, we don't build on FreeBSD, etc. And these are just things for which we've had recent reports about breakage due to warnings treated as errors.",
