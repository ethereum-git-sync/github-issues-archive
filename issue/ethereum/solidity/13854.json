I tried to look up the XCode version based on your clang version and [this table from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xcode#Xcode_11.0_-_14.x_(since_SwiftUI_framework)_2) and it matches XCode 11.3.1, not 14.0.1.\r\n\r\nI mean, I mostly just wanted to know if it's something that was added in newer XCode (and we should update) or something that used to be an error and was relaxed in later versions. Currently [we're at XCode 13.2.0](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/v0.8.18/.circleci/config.yml#L385).\r\n\r\nI guess, since you're using a beta version of macOS it must actually be newer XCode despite what it says about clang. In that case we'll probably get this error eventually too. For now we can just accept the tweak that helps you as long as it works on the XCode we're using too.\r\n",
