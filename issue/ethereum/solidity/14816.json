  "body": "During 0.8.24 release we discovered that [`docker_deploy_manual.sh`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/scripts/docker_deploy_manual.sh) fails to build due to a missing include. A trivial problem that should have been discovered in CI, but apparently none of our other jobs build in an environment where it is detected as an error.\r\n\r\nThis is very problematic if it happens during release, because after the code is tagged, we can no longer build it in that environment and still claim it was built from the same source. In the end we had to fix it by hacking the normal static linux build into the image.\r\n\r\nFirst, we need to fix the problem so that the image can be built. I'd also suggest to add a flag in `docker_deploy_manual.sh` that allows building locally without necessarily immediately deploying the image to dockerhub.\r\n\r\nSecond, we should really have a CI run that builds this image. We don't need it on every PR, but we should at least include in the nightly run.",
