    "body": "I've got a naive implementation of this, I think.  Played around with it on some test code and it seems to be able to detect unused locals, unused parameters, and unused named return variables.  I see you want warnings about unnamed return variables, which could be added, since I currently suppress them by refusing to track an unnamed variable.  All of the above features were pretty easy because the language currently treats all parameters and return variables as just more local variables.\r\n\r\nAs for warning if you never assign to a named return variable, I don't think that'd be too hard to track now that I've got a feel for things.  It seems like a logically different concern from unused variable tracking, so do we want that put in the same commit or a different one?",
