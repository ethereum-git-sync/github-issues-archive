    "body": "Hi @cameel , thank you so much for your reply, I don't think it's a compiler issue. I copied the code from Safe Moon token (https://www.bscscan.com/address/0x8076c74c5e3f5852037f31ff0093eeb8c8add8d3#code) and I just changed the token name as you can see here ( https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/0x1a2650AA65d96EbC7dd5854f0B9032615629F442#code ), the code is working fine with the actual token Safe Moon and I was able to deploy the token using Remix, but it doesn't distribute tokens in my token, I think I'm missing something in how I should make this work! maybe it's related to the Pancake swap router or I should create a pool in a certain way! I don't know and thus, I posted these questions here to ask experts (like yourself) if you have experience in reflection tokens to let me know if I'm doing anything wrong!  ",
