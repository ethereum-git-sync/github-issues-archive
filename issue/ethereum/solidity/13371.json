    "body": "I think we should clearly indicate the differences.  The function`<address>.transfer` is quite convenient and I wouldn't entirely remove it from the docs or deprecate it. The notion of `callstipend` is well-defined in the Yellowpaper and the EVM. It provides enough gas to receive the ETH and emit an event, and cannot modify state. Even when storage / opcodes gets repriced, some care is made to ensure that most contracts will continue working (see how EIP-2929 introduced access lists).\r\n\r\nThe replacement`.call{value: ...}(\"\")` adds a re-entrancy risk and solving it will cost ~3000 gas assuming full refunds. The applications that `.call{value: ...}(\"\")` allow, i.e., complex smart contract wallets, forwarding patterns etc haven't really caught up. As a comparison, standards such as ERC-777, ERC-1155 and ERC-721's hooks are largely ignored by most protocols as they increase security risks. \r\n\r\nAlso, do you have an example of a smart contract wallet that breaks on `.transfer`? (Assuming access lists can be used.)",
