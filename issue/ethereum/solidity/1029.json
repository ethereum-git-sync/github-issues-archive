  "body": "The file `SyntaxChecker.cpp` is usually used for such checks. It is a simple AST walker that scans for errors. The way to implement this would be to record in a member when a non-payable public (or external) function is visited and then again when `msg.value` is encountered (or more specifically, an identifier that references the respective magic global).\n\nUsing `msg.value` inside non-payable library functions is fine, though.\n\nThe question is whether this check should also include an analysis of the call graph, but I think that can be left for a later issue.\n",
