From UI perspective it would be less confusing to allow setting `optimizerSteps: \":\"` regardless of whether the optimizer is enabled or not.\r\n\r\n### Specification\r\n- On the CLI `--yul-optimizations:\":\"` should not trigger an error when used with `--no-optimize-yul` (or without `--optimize`, which implies `--no-optimize-yul`).\r\n- In Standard JSON `yulDetails: {optimizerSteps: \":\"}` should not trigger an error when used with `yul: false`.\r\n    - Changing other options inside `yulDetails` should not be allowed when Yul optimizer is disabled.\r\n- In both cases, a completely empty sequence (i.e. `:`) should be the only accepted value with Yul optimizer disabled. Allowing adding steps would make things even more confusing.\r\n    - We might also allow the default sequence, i.e. (`u:`).\r\n- Behavior should be identical to the case where the Yul optimizer is enabled, but metadata should reflect the options that were actually used (e.g. it should not say that `--optimize-yul` was used if it was not).",
