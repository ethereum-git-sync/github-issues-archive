  "body": "Original comment: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14149#discussion_r1174026509.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nOne weird consequence of #14149 is that now, counter-intuitively, this in Standard JSON optimizer settings:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nyul: false,\r\n```\r\n\r\nexecutes more optimizer steps than this:\r\n```javascript\r\nyul: true,\r\nyulDetails: {optimizerSteps: \":\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is not obvious to users as can be seen in #14619 or #14470. From UI perspective it would be less confusing to allow setting `optimizerSteps: \":\"` regardless of whether the optimizer is enabled or not.\r\n\r\n### Specification\r\n- On the CLI `--yul-optimizations:\":\"` should not trigger an error when used with `--no-optimize-yul` (or without `--optimize`, which implies `--no-optimize-yul`).\r\n- In Standard JSON `yulDetails: {optimizerSteps: \":\"}` should not trigger an error when used with `yul: false`.\r\n    - Changing other options inside `yulDetails` should not be allowed when Yul optimizer is disabled.\r\n- In both cases, a completely empty sequence (i.e. `:`) should be the only accepted value with Yul optimizer disabled. Allowing adding steps would make things even more confusing.\r\n    - We might also allow the default sequence, i.e. (`u:`).\r\n- Behavior should be identical to the case where the Yul optimizer is enabled, but metadata should reflect the options that were actually used (e.g. it should not say that `--optimize-yul` was used if it was not).",

    "body": "In principle, the nicer way to do this in the longer term would be something like:\r\nDeprecate the current yul-related settings altogether (we won't allow disabling stack optimizations in the long-run making the optimizer steps the only remaining setting specific to the yul optimizer) and just have a single setting\r\n``yul: \"...sequenceOfSteps...\"``.... maybe with a string alias for the default sequence...\r\nThen \"enabling\" the yul optimizer would be having a non-empty yul optimizer sequence and \"disabling\" the yul optimizer would be setting the empty sequence...\r\n\r\nBut that'd be a breaking change and we won't *yet* remove the stack optimization setting, so for the time being the plan suggested above should be the best solution.",

I.e. if we do it that way and `yul: \"\"` still runs `UnusedPruner` then users can no longer have a completely empty sequence.
