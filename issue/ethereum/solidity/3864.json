  "body": "This is a feature request, and I wanted to know what your thoughts about it may be. Apologies in advance if this has already been discussed (couldn't find anything related here).\r\n\r\nIt'd be useful to be able to declare a sort-of contract-level modifier, that allows to inject code that executes on every call received by the contract, and executes based on raw msg data, signature, etc. This allows to provide a global behaviour to the contract, without needing to manually add a modifier to every external function, which is error-prone if one is forgotten.\r\n\r\nWe have identified two main use cases so far where this feature would be helpful:\r\n\r\n- Global pausable contract: we have a [Pausable](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/blob/master/contracts/lifecycle/Pausable.sol) behaviour in OpenZeppelin, which requires the user to add `whenNotPaused` modifiers to every public function that must be blocked. It would be much easier if the user of the contract could just add a global behaviour that blocks every external call to the contract if it's paused, except for specific `unpause` calls that could be detected manually via msg.sig in the global modifier.\r\n\r\n- Block calls to proxy backing implementations: we are working heavily on [proxies](https://github.com/zeppelinos/core/blob/master/contracts/upgradeability/Proxy.sol) at the moment, which depend on a backing implementation where all calls are delegated. However, it would be interesting to be [able to _lock_ the implementations](https://github.com/zeppelinos/core/issues/33), so any direct call made to them (without going via a proxy) is automatically reverted, in order to prevent confusions from users that inadvertently call those contracts directly. Doing this via a contract-level modifier that checks that `this != implementationAddress` on every call is trivial, while adding this check manually to every public function is cumbersome.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what you think about the feature, and whether you would consider adding it to the roadmap, or accept a pull request with its implementation.",

I thought about something very similar to the existing syntax for defining a modifier, using underscore to denote the fall-through to the dispatcher (or to the next contract-level-modifier in the inheritance chain), with the option to explicitly call an existing function. \r\n\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract GlobalPausable {\r\n  bool paused;\r\n  undecidedKeywordForThisBlock() {\r\n    require(!paused || msg.sig == GlobalPausable.unpause.sig);\r\n    _;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would probably require introducing a new reserved keyword to identify these blocks (filter? wrap? around? onCall? decorate? tbh I don't like any of these). Alternatively, a combination of existing keywords could be used (like `contract modifier`); however, this could lead to confusion as there is a fundamental difference to function-level modifiers: `modifier` defines a block to be used later, whereas `contract modifier` would introduce a block that executes where it is defined.\r\n\r\nAnyway, these are just a few ideas, and I have no strong preference towards any syntax in particular.",
