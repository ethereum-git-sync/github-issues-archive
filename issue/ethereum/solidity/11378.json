  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nI just updated my project to Solidity 0.8.4. I changed this debugging/helper function:\r\n\r\n    function ok() public view returns (string memory) {\r\n        return string(abi.encodePacked(\r\n            foo1 ? \"XXXXXXXXXXXX\" : \"\",\r\n            foo2 ? \"XXXXX\" : \"XXXX\",\r\n            \"XXXXXXXX\",\r\n            foo3 ? \"\" : \"XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\",\r\n            \"XXX\",\r\n            foo4,\r\n            \"X\"\r\n         ));\r\n    }\r\n\r\nto:\r\n\r\n    function bad() public view returns (string memory) {\r\n        return string(bytes.concat(\r\n            bytes(foo1 ? \"XXXXXXXXXXXX\" : \"\"),\r\n            bytes(foo2 ? \"XXXXX\" : \"XXXX\"),\r\n            \"XXXXXXXX\",\r\n            bytes(foo3 ? \"\" : \"XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\"),\r\n            \"XXX\",\r\n            bytes(foo4),\r\n            \"X\"\r\n        ));\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWhen executing my contract now, **without** calling the ok/bad function at all, it fails reproducible at a different/independent location. Adding a pointless `Assert.equal(var1, var2)` at that location makes the error \"go away\". It looks to me like the byte code is somehow corrupted. I went back to abi.encodePacked() since this seems to work fine and I don't need the additional bytes() casts.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version: 0.8.4\r\n- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): remix-tests default\r\n- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): remix-tests (local execution)\r\n- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: remix-tests default (JavaScript?)\r\n- Operating system: Linux\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nThe code is ~1k locs. Minimizing it while keeping the bug reproducible would take me quite a while. Removing one X from one of the strings already makes the error \"go away\". So I hope I can avoid the minimizing work by first checking a couple of other points:\r\n\r\n- Is there an obvious problem with/an obvious error in the bad() code? Maybe I wrote invalid code that compiles to invalid byte code?\r\n- Maybe someone knowing the compiler well directly has an intuition what might go wrong?\r\n- Unfortunately my only idea left is then minimizing the code. Since I'm short on time and `abi.encodePacked()` works, I'm somewhat reluctant.\r\n",

I managed to reproduce it and spent quite a bit of time trying to figure out what's going on and looks like it's not related to `bytes.concat()`. It fails only when the bytecode has a very specific length. If you replace the `bytecode.concat()` call in your `OpenEndKnockOutWarrant.description()` function with an instruction returning a string of exactly 501 characters (i.e. exactly as much bytecode as your `bytes.concat()` call takes), it behaves the same way. Adding/removing even a single character from the string makes the failure go away.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if it's a problem in the compiler or remix-tests. It's technically possible that something wrong happens in `solc` when the code size is exactly at the size limit (e.g. it gets truncated or something) but it's also very possible that there's something wrong with the transaction remix-tests uses to deploy it. There might also be some off-by-one error in some check along the way.\r\n\r\n### Repro with remix-tests\r\nThis how I reproduced it locally:\r\n``` bash\r\nnpm install @remix-project/remix-tests\r\nnpm install tslib\r\nsed -i 's/\\(function Message(opts) {\\)/\\1opts.gasLimit.words[0] *= 20;/' node_modules/ethereumjs-vm/dist/evm/message.js\r\n\r\ntar xfv problem.tar.gz\r\ncd problem/\r\nnpx remix-tests --compiler 0.8.4 --optimize true --runs 200 test/SellAtMarket_test.sol\r\nnpx remix-tests --compiler 0.8.4 --optimize true --runs 100 test/SellAtMarket_test.sol\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, here's the 501-character-long string I used:\r\n\r\n``` solidity\r\nreturn\r\n    \"XXXXXXXXXX\" \"XXXXXXXXXX\" \"XXXXXXXXXX\" \"XXXXXXXXXX\" \"XXXXXXXXXX\"\r\n    \"XXXXXXXXXX\" \"XXXXXXXXXX\" \"XXXXXXXXXX\" \"XXXXXXXXXX\" \"XXXXXXXXXX\"\r\n    \"XXXXXXXXXX\" \"XXXXXXXXXX\" \"XXXXXXXXXX\" \"XXXXXXXXXX\" \"XXXXXXXXXX\"\r\n    \"XXXXXXXXXX\" \"XXXXXXXXXX\" \"XXXXXXXXXX\" \"XXXXXXXXXX\" \"XXXXXXXXXX\"\r\n    \"XXXXXXXXXX\" \"XXXXXXXXXX\" \"XXXXXXXXXX\" \"XXXXXXXXXX\" \"XXXXXXXXXX\"\r\n\r\n    \"XXXXXXXXXX\" \"XXXXXXXXXX\" \"XXXXXXXXXX\" \"XXXXXXXXXX\" \"XXXXXXXXXX\"\r\n    \"XXXXXXXXXX\" \"XXXXXXXXXX\" \"XXXXXXXXXX\" \"XXXXXXXXXX\" \"XXXXXXXXXX\"\r\n    \"XXXXXXXXXX\" \"XXXXXXXXXX\" \"XXXXXXXXXX\" \"XXXXXXXXXX\" \"XXXXXXXXXX\"\r\n    \"XXXXXXXXXX\" \"XXXXXXXXXX\" \"XXXXXXXXXX\" \"XXXXXXXXXX\" \"XXXXXXXXXX\"\r\n    \"XXXXXXXXXX\" \"XXXXXXXXXX\" \"XXXXXXXXXX\" \"XXXXXXXXXX\" \"XXXXXXXXXX\"\r\n\r\n    \"X\";\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Test output\r\nThis is with `bytes.concat()` already replaced with the string I gave above.\r\n##### `--runs 200`\r\n```\r\n[19:59:14] info: Compiler version set to 0.8.4.

Both at its current length and when I add/remove parts. I do not see anything interesting in the `--bin` output and the differences in `--asm` seem to be just offsets and data hashes. The output between `--runs 100` and `--runs 200` does differ quite a bit but it's hard to investigate since it's just all marked as different after a certain point.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure I'm getting exactly the same content as remix though. `remix_tests.sol` is generated by remix-tests on the fly so it might not be the same exact version and the tool might be doing some extra modifications along the way. Also, my address for the `Assert` library is just a random value, not the same thing remix-test passes to the compiler.",
