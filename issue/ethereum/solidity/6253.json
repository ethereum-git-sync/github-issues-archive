  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nI'm not calling this a bug report, because once again, this isn't a *bug* as such; but recall that `type(C).runtimeCode` and `type(C).creationCode`, when introduced in version 0.5.3, did not include the usual padding-to-a-full-word (the padding is technically not part of the bytestring, I know, rather it's just a matter of how the free memory pointer is updated; but I am describing it as padding for simplicity).  This wasn't really an error, but it was an irregularity, resulting in later objects in memory being unaligned, and it was changed in version 0.5.4 to keep alignment.\r\n\r\nNow in 0.5.5, `type(C).name` has the same irregularity as `type(C).runtimeCode` and `type(C).creationCode` had in 0.5.3, so any objects in memory after it may be unaligned.  So, I wanted to suggest that this be similarly cleaned up to keep things aligned.  Thank you!",
