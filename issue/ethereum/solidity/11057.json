  "body": "Once we have #10474 we'll have a lot of opportunity to compare gas usage of optimised vs non-optimised and legacy vs. ir-based pipelines. With #10475 we'll have the opportunity to insert more realistic external tests, like we did with #10590.\r\n\r\nAt that point, having more realistic gas costs for precompiles could be useful. Especially for ecrecover and sha256 as they are used in external tests and have simple clear costs. Other precompiles are more complicated and not well used in our test suite so of less concern.\r\n\r\nCurrently we [charge 0 gas](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/test/EVMHost.cpp#L352) for them.",
