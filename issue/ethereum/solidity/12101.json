Not good form!\r\n\r\nA user can send a negative amount to another address, stealing money from that other address.\r\n\r\nAlso the negative value can be so negative that after the transfer, the \"recipient\"'s account balance could go negative, and the \"sender\"'s account balance could be arbitrarily large. If there was a way to cash out of the system, e.g. via DeFi, an attacker could steal the entire order book's worth of currency.\r\n\r\n`requires(amount > 0);` is what is missing.\r\n\r\n## Pull request\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12100\r\n",
