But `not` the libevmasm optimizer or more yul optimization steps. And we need the additional option to disable those minimal optimizations as well.\r\n\r\nReconciling that with the existing options in a natural way (i.e. what happens when user explicitly sets `settings.optimizer.yul` to `false`?) is a part of the task. Best if we can limit ourselves to keeping existing options and just flipping their defaults.",
