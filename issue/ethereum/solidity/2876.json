    "body": "Every IDE I know of also limits the number of errors.  When errors are limited, the first errors are retained as they are more likely to be the problematic ones.  The problem with `solc | less` is actually the exact thing you described, I am using `solc` by way of `py-solc` at the moment, and when running my tests each test ends up with a _ton_ of error spam.  If I did `pytest | less` I would miss out on the footer of the test details which sometimes includes useful aggregate information.  Also, the sheer volume of data spammed out by solc is so much that it actually takes my tests a _significant_ amount of time to fail because each test is throwing so much data to stderr/stdout.\r\n\r\nOf course, py-solc could also do better about dealing with this situation, but it feels to me like `solc` is a more generalized place to handle this since in the _vast_ majority of cases seeing anything after the first 100 (or even 1000) errors is _very_ unlikely to be useful.\r\n\r\nAs a point of reference, GCC has `-fmax-errors=n` to deal with this, though I'm not sure if there is a default setting or not.",
