  "body": "Interfaces have extremely limited utility and only academic use in real-world scenarios. While working on standardizing an interface, several shortcomings are apparent:\r\n\r\n* Interfaces handle implicit getters differently than contracts https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3411\r\n* Interfaces do not reason well about state mutability https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3412\r\n* Interfaces can't inherit https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3419\r\n* Interfaces don't allow default implementations https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3411\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo recognize the problem, see that none of the draft ERCs https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/ are using `interface` to specify their standards. Instead, they resort to using functions inlined in markdown. And the functions are not even correct (missing public or other warnings). Clearly `interface` is not filling the needs of today's ERC writers.\r\n\r\n# Solution\r\n\r\nCompletely scrap the way `interface` keyword is understood. Here is the new definition of `interface`:\r\n\r\n> An interface is identical to a contract in all ways except that a) an interface cannot inherit from a contract and b) you cannot compile an interface.\r\n\r\nSuch a definition would be immediately useful and simpler to explain than the current mechanism.\r\n\r\nAdditional work:\r\n\r\n- [x] Create metadata for abstract contracts: #3437",
