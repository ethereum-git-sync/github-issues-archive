We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.\r\n- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:\r\n\t- [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)\r\n\t- [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)\r\n- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.\r\n- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\n```\r\ncontract A {\r\n    uint x;\r\n    constructor() {\r\n        x = 42;\r\n    }\r\n    function f() public returns(uint256) {\r\n        return x;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\ncontract B is A {\r\n    uint public y = f();\r\n    function g() public returns(uint256) {\r\n        return y;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n// ----\r\n// constructor() ->\r\n// y() -> 0\r\n// g() -> 0\r\n// f() -> 0x2a\r\n```\r\n\r\npasses but it should not. What should not pass is the `y() -> 0` and `g() -> 0` parts. They should both equal `0x2a`.\r\n\r\nFunnily enough, this test reports correct results via yul i.e., new code gen. We already have a semantic test for it here (only for new code gen and ewasm) https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/test/libsolidity/semanticTests/constructor_inheritance_init_order.sol\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version: 23f03e1b6\r\n- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): Berlin\r\n- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: evm v0.4.0\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ isoltest -t test\r\n```",
