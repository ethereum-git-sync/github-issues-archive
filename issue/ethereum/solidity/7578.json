    "body": "But with escaped quotes you have to parse them visually and discard as non-essential :) When I see that when skimming over the code I just skip it as something complex not worth analyzing closer while in the version with `quoted()` I can easily see that it's just an expression between two strings.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I do not feel very strongly about this issue and I'm fine with either, just want to have a decision here so that contributors can work on it. Looks like no one was against quoting itself and it's just a matter of how we insert them (with or without a helper) so to cut the discussion short, I think it would be fine to start working on this by just inserting quotes directly. We can add a helper later if we get some consensus here.",
