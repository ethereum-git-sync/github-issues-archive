    "body": "Yes, but this practically means shipping either the whole solidity source as a submodule or incorporating it into dependent project build processes to make platform wheels available on pip for example. In any case, just having it exposed to CMake should be enough if I'm not mistaken. I suppose there may be some documentation work that might need to be done before this is shippable as part of the official release depending on Solidity policies on the matter, but ultimately, I feel like addressing it here is the right way to go.",
