Controversial: don't implement.\r\n- [x] Check that comparing two rational numbers for equality does not apply rounding before comparison.\r\n- [x] Check that the abi decoder reverts if the input value is out of range for the type (part of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11704)\r\n- [x] check that storing and loading from storage works properly (especially truncating sign bits)\r\n- [x] check that getters work properly\r\n- [x] check that rounding is towards zero for precision loss and conversion to integer (also for negative values)\r\n- [x] comparison operators (codegen + tests)\r\n- [x] abi json (fixed by https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11825 )\r\n\r\nAlso https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/409 has some. A fresh issue to track things that come up in PRs.",
