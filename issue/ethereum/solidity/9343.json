  "body": "## Description\r\nInvestigate, fix and re-enable tests disabled in #9342.\r\n\r\n[My analysis posted on Gitter](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity-dev?at=5f0489a9a9378637e8b2215b):\r\n> Looks like it's just 5 tests that take 99% of execution time with `--run_test=Phaser`. And takes more like 70 seconds:\r\n> ```\r\n> /solidity/test/yulPhaser/GeneticAlgorithms.cpp(215): Leaving test case \"runNextRound_should_select_individuals_with_probability_proportional_to_fitness\"; testing time: 2894241us\r\n> /solidity/test/yulPhaser/GeneticAlgorithms.cpp(256): Leaving test case \"runNextRound_should_select_only_individuals_existing_in_the_original_population\"; testing time: 7107841us\r\n> /solidity/test/yulPhaser/GeneticAlgorithms.cpp(300): Leaving test case \"runNextRound_should_do_mutation\"; testing time: 20214808us\r\n> /solidity/test/yulPhaser/GeneticAlgorithms.cpp(329): Leaving test case \"runNextRound_should_do_deletion\"; testing time: 14013702us\r\n> /solidity/test/yulPhaser/GeneticAlgorithms.cpp(358): Leaving test case \"runNextRound_should_do_addition\"; testing time: 22049925us\r\n> \r\n> /solidity/test/yulPhaser/GeneticAlgorithms.cpp(213): Leaving test suite \"ClassicGeneticAlgorithmTest\"; testing time: 66300487us\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> They're all tests for the classic algorithm that I added at the end.\r\n> \r\n> It's weird that those tests in particular are so slow. There are many others that repeat stuff thousands of times to check distributions of random values and they still run below 1 second taken all together. At a glance I don't see anything that should be making them that slow. For example `runNextRound_should_do_addition` runs just one round with 1000 identical `\"aaaaaaaaaa\"` chromosomes with a dummy metric that does not even optimize any program (it just returns chromosome length). It should finish instantly.\r\n> \r\n> I don't see anything obvious in these tests or in the algorithm code so this will need some profiling. In the meantime, I think I'll just disable them and create an issue to investigate and re-enable them when I'm done with `solc-bin` nightly and release scripts. The code has tons of tests anyway so I don't think it's going to fall into disrepair without those 5 in the meantime :)\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\nThis should finish instantly:\r\n```bash\r\nsoltest --log_level=test_suite --run_test=Phaser\r\n```",
