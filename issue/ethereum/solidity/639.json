  "body": "Solidity states that all strings are UTF8. Even though it doesn't offer internal methods for strings, all the libraries written for it are based on this assumption.\n\nContrary to this, the hex escape works as in C: `\\x80` means the byte `0x80`. In Javascript (and others with strict UTF8 compliance) it means the UTF8 encoded Unicode code point of `0080`: `0xc2 0x80`.\n\nThe main problem with the current behaviour is that it creates invalid UTF8 strings. This is the real reason why #603 is an issue.\n\nI think it should behave like Javascript and include better support for assigning binary data to the `bytes` (and `bytesNN`) type, such as the one proposed in #479.\n",

    "body": "@axic I don't find a proposed solution in #603. Yes, I was talking about something like `b\"...\"` to distinguish between string literals and byte array literals. If possible, we should also allow things like `{0x12, 0x34, 0x11, ...}` - but that is something else.\n\nSo basically as a summary: I proposed to parse `\\x12` as raw byte and `\\u0012` as unicode (then encoded as utf-8). You wanted to signal a warning if the parsed raw bytes do not represent valid utf-8. Note that this also means that we force the source code encoding to utf-8 and parse actual raw utf-8 bytes as that.\n\nIf we signal a warning, we have to provide a way to \"silence\" it and tell the compiler \"Yes, I really want a raw byte array, even if it is not utf-8\". This silencing mechanism could be to prefix the literal with a `b`. Are there other solutions? Perhaps `r\"...\"`?\n\nAs backticks have a special meaning in ecmascript, I would not use them.\n\nOh and I think a context-aware literal parser/scanner is no the best idea :-)\n",

    "body": "Sorry I've meant #479 and not #603 - but let's just put these aside for a moment.\n\nSolidity (and the ABI) documentation states that strings **must be** UTF8. It would be nice to take that seriously to avoid any possible issues down the line.\n\nIf I understand it correctly, the tokenizer needs uniquely identifiable tokens to do the parsing/validation - hence we cannot postpone this validation to when the parsed data is assigned  to the appropriate type.\n\nMy motivation regarding escapes/strings/bytes:\n- Fix #603 \n- Support #479 in some way (and perhaps support other ways you've proposed, such as `{0x12, 0x34, 0x11, ...}`)\n- Ensure that strings are UTF8\n\n## \n\nSummarising this issue:\n- `\"\"` should continue to work for both `string` and `bytes`\n- `\\xXX` should work for escaping any hex value\n- `\\uXXXX` should take a valid Unicode codepoint and encode an UTF8 sequence\n- `StringLiteral:toString()` should not return an invalid UTF8 sequence as that produces an invalid JSON compiler output. It should instead return `non-UTF8 string literal` or `invalid string literal`\n- When an invalid UTF8 sequence is detected in a `string` assignment, the compiler should throw a warning, unless the literal was enclosed in`b\"\"`\n\nDoes the above makes sense?\n\nThe last point is the only one I'm not sure how to actually implement.\n",
