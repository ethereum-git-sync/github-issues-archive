  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nAdding `public` to a mapping field in a contract that is deployed from another contract leads to a `RuntimeError: VM Exception while processing transaction: revert` error.\r\n\r\nIn EmptyContract.spec.ts, a NewContract is deployed first. Then, \r\n```solidity\r\n newContract.doDeploy()\r\n```\r\nis called, which creates a new EmptyContract. This test passes when `mapping(address => address) public depositContracts` does not contain the word `public`, and otherwise fails. Below are the dummy files I created to reproduce this issue. See [EVM stack trace](https://gist.github.com/akhila-raju/2d66be1f5e930f3897ba35beeb7d8ad1).\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version: 0.5.0\r\n- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): ethereumjs-vm 2.6.0\r\n- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Waffle\r\n- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: Ganache-core 2.5.6-beta.0\r\n- Operating system: MacOS 10.14\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\nDeploy the following contracts and run EmptyContract.spec.ts. Note that this uses ethereum-waffle which is dictating the EVM/ganache version that I'm using.\r\n\r\n### EmptyContract.spec.ts\r\n```typescript\r\nimport chai = require('chai')\r\nimport {\r\n  createMockProvider,\r\n  deployContract,\r\n  getWallets,\r\n  solidity,\r\n} from 'ethereum-waffle'\r\nimport * as EmptyContract from '../build/EmptyContract.json'\r\nimport * as NewContract from '../build/NewContract.json'\r\n\r\n\r\nchai.use(solidity)\r\nconst { expect } = chai\r\n\r\ndescribe.only('Creates EmptyContract and checks that fields are properly assigned', () => {\r\n  const provider = createMockProvider()\r\n  const [wallet] = getWallets(provider)\r\n  let newContract\r\n\r\n  it('it deploys', async () => {\r\n    newContract = await deployContract(wallet, NewContract, [], {\r\n      gasLimit: 6700000,\r\n    })\r\n    await newContract.doDeploy();\r\n  })\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n### NewContract.sol\r\n```solidity\r\nimport { EmptyContract } from \"./EmptyContract.sol\";\r\n\r\ncontract NewContract {\r\n  address public authenticationAddress;\r\n  address public commitmentChain;\r\n  mapping(address => address) public depositContracts;\r\n  mapping (bytes32 => uint256)  exitRedeemableAfter;\r\n\r\n  uint public id;\r\n\r\n  constructor() public {\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  function doDeploy() public {\r\n   new EmptyContract();\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### EmptyContract.sol\r\n```solidity\r\nimport { CommitmentChain } from \"./CommitmentChain.sol\";\r\nimport { Deposit } from \"./Deposit.sol\";\r\n\r\n\r\ncontract EmptyContract {\r\n  address public authenticationAddress;\r\n  address public commitmentChain;\r\n  mapping(address => address) depositContracts;\r\n  // mapping (bytes32 => uint256)  exitRedeemableAfter;\r\n\r\n  uint public id;\r\n  // mapping(string => string) public metadata;\r\n\r\n  constructor() public {\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```",
