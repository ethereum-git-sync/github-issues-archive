  "body": "Our semantics test framework runs EVM execution through evmone and collects runtime gas statistics.\r\n\r\nWhile the test expectations distinguish between the cost of the \"constructor\" and of calling methods, our test cases regularly themselves deploy contracts, yielding a mixture of runtime cost and code size as result.\r\n\r\nWhile there is some logic to that (contracts deploying contracts, of course, is a real world use case), it makes evaluating optimizer changes challenging.\r\n\r\nSo ideally, we should split the gas costs in our semantics test expectations into code size cost and deploy cost by tracking any contract creation, subtracting the code cost from the runtime gas cost and listing it separately.\r\n",
