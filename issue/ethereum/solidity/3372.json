    "body": "OK, thanks for the explanation! I think this is an effect of the tradeoff between deployment and runtime costs of constants. This step is only activated if there are at least four references to the same number (this is why you see the effect depending on the actual value used inside the `exp` function). The optimizer is not able to detect any loops, it just assumes that each constant will be used exactly `<optimizer-runs>` times during the lifetime of the contract and adjusts the tradeoff accordingly. Since you use one constant inside a loop, this estimate is of course dramatically off.\r\n\r\nYou might get better results by just using `--optimize-runs 5000000` or something like that.\r\n\r\nIn one version, the optimizer uses the value as a literal, in the other it computes the value using the `exp` opcode. The former method has lower runtime costs, the latter has lower deployment costs.",

    "body": "@chriseth:\r\n\r\nThis question is following your suggestion to use `--optimize-runs 5000000` ([above](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3372#issuecomment-355247593)).\r\n\r\nWe are now at a point close to release.\r\n\r\nOne of the comments that we received in an audit-report was:\r\n\r\n> Even though the community has started to experiments with such aggressive optimizations settings, it’s relatively new and not as battle-tested as the default 200 optimizer runs.\r\n> Our recommendation is to avoid such an aggressive optimization, for the time being, and prefer the default settings instead.\r\n\r\nWould you be able to say if a solid and thorough verification has been conducted, to ensure that the `optimize-runs` parameter is safe for use with any value? Any major projects that have used it with any value other than the default? How safe can we feel ignoring the audit-comment above?\r\n\r\nI've conducted extensive benchmark tests, showing that using 5000000 runs saves around 3% - 5% gas, so I'd hate to lose this cost-reduction. Then again, this upside is not worth even the slightest chance of erroneous execution due to a bug in the optimizer.\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your help :)",
