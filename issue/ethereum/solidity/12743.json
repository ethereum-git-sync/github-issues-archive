It can also lead to the name collision. For instance, it is not possible to define isDigit function in CommonSyntaxTest.cpp.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n1) Remove [using namespace util;](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libsolidity/ast/ASTAnnotations.h#L50)\r\n2) Update [CommonSyntaxTest.cpp](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/test/CommonSyntaxTest.cpp) so it has only one local definition of  \"isDigit\" function (can be addressed after #12740 merge).\r\n",
