  "body": "The Solidity code generator has an optimization where it delays cleaning the higher order bits of variables that are not 256 bit types (for example, cleanup is only needed at the end of the following expression if all types are unsigned integers: `(x+y)*a`). This delay is dangerous in various situations, for example when such variables are used inside of inline assembly. It would be better to clean always and add an optimizer stage that removes duplicate cleanups.\n",
