  "body": "EDIT: The `.gitattributes` approach mentioned below now works with `linguist`. Add to `.gitattributes`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n*.sol linguist-language=Solidity\r\n*.or-any-other-extension-you-like linguist-language=Solidity\r\n```\r\n\r\nOriginal issue description follows.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe main reason there's still no Solidity syntax highlighting on github is that the `.sol` extension is too generic.\r\n\r\n(There have been several attempts made so far, which I've listed in PR https://github.com/github/linguist/pull/3560. That PR itself is likely to get scrapped.)\r\n\r\nTherefore, `linguist` can't classify `.sol` files as \"Solidity\" based on extension alone. It must run a heuristic to determine a language based on the file's contents.\r\n\r\nHowever, due to `linguist`'s current design, heuristics have no way of indicating \"no match\" (documented in issue https://github.com/github/linguist/issues/3589). That, coupled with the same fact that `.sol` is too generic, will mean that a lot of unrelated files will still be mis-classified, which in turn means the heuristic approach is a no-go.\r\n\r\nSo, there are two options I see now:\r\n\r\n### `.gitattributes` file\r\n\r\nDon't rely on github's automated classification, and ask everyone to manually hint the language via `.gitattributes` (as in PR https://github.com/github/linguist/pull/3559).\r\n\r\nBoth new and old projects will have to do this if they want highlighing.\r\n\r\nThis will likely be made available regardless (probably by @frangio, ~~as discussed in PR https://github.com/github/linguist/pull/3559~~ in PR https://github.com/github/linguist/pull/3755).\r\n\r\n### `.solidity` extension\r\n\r\nUse a file extension that unambiguosly describes the contents.\r\n\r\nOld projects would have to mass-rename files, as well as mass-replace `import` statements, which will change their Swarm hashes AFAIU.\r\n  ",

    "body": "Not sure. It seems to be low on their priority list, and in either case might require changing the approach to classification in `linguist`. Since it's used and maintained by github, with a humongous set of files that _might_ get erroniously re-classified... the process is necessarily slow.\r\n\r\nEssentially, what I'm proposing is for Solidity to step out of the \"edge case territory\" that is the `.sol` extension.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n@Alhadis also (jokingly?..) [proposed](https://github.com/github/linguist/pull/3560#issuecomment-319352022) `.sold` in one of the above PRs, which has seen very minimal use on github so far.\r\n\r\nThis might be a compromise if a short extension is still desired, although it has the same downsides as `.solidity`.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Since the purpose of an extension seems to be aiding machine classification, I'd still recommend `.solidity`, since, well, that describes a Solidity file best.",
