This modifier would allow having compile-time protection similar to `nonReentrant` modifier functionality for 0 gas cost.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nReentrancy is such a terrific attack surface for smart contracts that many developers add `nonReentrant`, `_lock_` and even [`_viewlock_`](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-core/blob/master/contracts/BPool.sol#L131) modifiers to all the methods. It would be great to have 0 gas cost compile-time check that some method is not vulnerable to reentrancy because do not produce any non-view externals call.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nUse keyword `writeonly` or `reentracySafe` or any other for this modificator.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nFully compatible since restricts the only subset of non-view functions.",

    "body": "So this would basically be a new mutability level called `writeonly` (or `reentrancySafe` but this does not really fit the current set of names) that would sit between `view` and the current default where the state is completely mutable? \r\n\r\nWhat do you think about @axic's proposal from https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9248#issuecomment-713884387 that would introduce a `state()` modifier that would allow more granular control than the current set of mutability levels. If we combined it with your proposal, it could include a `call` permission and then you would have to explicitly define a function like this if you wanted to allow reentrancy:\r\n```solidity\r\nfunction f() state(read, write, call) {}\r\n```",
