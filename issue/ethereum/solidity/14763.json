We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.\r\n- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:\r\n    - [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)\r\n    - [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)\r\n- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.\r\n- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.\r\n\r\n*Delete the above section and the instructions in the sections below before submitting*\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nThis is an example of a contract that we found to be faulty using DeSCDT. Inconsistent returns when the optimizer is disabled or enabled. open return true and Otherwise return false.\r\n<!--Please shortly describe the bug you have found, and what you expect instead.-->\r\nContract sample:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    uint public a;\r\n    uint public b;\r\n\r\n    function f1() public { a;}\r\n    function f2() public { b;}\r\n    function f3() public { f1();}\r\n    function f4() public { f2();}\r\n    function f5() external returns(bool) {\r\n        return f3 == f4;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWe also tried many variations of the contract sample, and found that whether defining functions or variables, solc compiler ignored the effect of identifiers on the contract code when the optimizer was on, only cared about the function statements, and collapsed the storage if the function statements were consistent.\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version: solc 0.4.24 (In the latest 0.8.23 also exists)\r\n- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): no\r\n- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Remix\r\n- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: no\r\n- Operating system: no\r\n\r\n\r\n",
