    "body": "Macro is a very important feature missing in Solidity, it would be incredibly useful for developers when debugging complex code during development.\r\nOne way to currently achieve that is to emit a lot of events along a function to map what's going on. [example](https://github.com/flockonus/eth-denver-2019/blob/master/contract/contracts/City.sol#L225-L285), it's clearly undesirable.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to have flags that can be active only during development deployments, and not during production for logging events, for instance. Or balancing game mechanics.\r\n\r\nIn my mind it would also be similar to [c macros](https://www.quora.com/What-are-macros-in-C) in addition of taking an env var to define the mode / network it's being deployed to",

Because solpp and psol appear to be dead, I think developers should use something else that is STANDARD and SIMPLE so developers don't need to install a bunch of different tools and so that security auditors are not misled by some weird behavior from the preprocessor.\r\n\r\nOne place to start would be to find some open source contracts that use some kind of preprocessing so that we can see what is in use and what is working well. If there is a clear winner then developers could rewrite the preprocessing for various open source contracts or add it to some contracts that could benefit.",

    "body": "> But still I'd like to see a concrete use case that is helped by a preprocessor otherwise why is this issue still open?\r\n\r\nMacros\r\nImports\r\nConditionals\r\n\r\nHave you never programmed with macros before? Every language should have them. The alternative is copypaste boilerplate. Have a look at the [status quo](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/structs/EnumerableSet.sol). Some kind of template code is necessary; macros are the best because they can do more than type substitution.\r\n\r\nSuppose you had code like below, which I took from a contract I picked at random.\r\n```\r\n    function totalReleased(IERC20 token) public view returns (uint256) {\r\n        return _erc20TotalReleased[token];\r\n    }\r\n    function shares(address account) public view returns (uint256) {\r\n        return _shares[account];\r\n    }\r\n    function released(address account) public view returns (uint256) {\r\n        return _released[account];\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nMost of this code is the same. Should be written only once.\r\n```\r\n#def get_uint256(field)\\\r\n    function field(address account) public view returns (uint256) {\\\r\n        return _ ## field[account];\\\r\n    }\r\nget_uint256(totalReleased)\r\nget_uint256(shares)\r\nget_uint256(released)\r\n```\r\nWe can also break out the type to make it even more reusable.\r\n```\r\n#def get_(type, field)\\\r\n    function field(address account) public view returns (type) {\\\r\n        return _ ## field[account];\\\r\n    }\r\n#def get_uint256(field) get_(uint256,field)\r\n```\r\nMacros can contain other macros, which themselves don't have to be defined. This allows for reuse. Here is a solidity version of some code I wrote in C \r\n```\r\n#def OPS \\\r\nOP(buy, 2, uint256)\\\r\nOP(sell, 1, uint256)\\\r\nOP(lock, 0, address)\\\r\nOP(unlock, 0, address)\\\r\n\r\nenum ops {\r\n#def OP(name, _, _) name,\r\nOPS\r\n#undef OP\r\n}\r\n\r\n#def OP(name, argCount, argType)\\\r\nfunction name(argType[argCount] args) external {\\\r\n    _do_ ## name(args);\\\r\n}\r\n```\r\nLook at the ways I use `OPS` from https://github.com/wjmelements/evm/blob/master/include/ops.h. I redefine `OP` 7 times. 3 of them are for test cases.",

I think that the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) is a much better place for a general discussion on the topic so I'm going to close it.\r\n\r\nAs @ekpyron already said, we think that there are much better alternatives to C-preprocessor-style macros so it's unlikely we'll ever add such a feature to Solidity. We'd be more open to some flavor of syntactic macros but it depends on the details of the proposal so if we get one, we'll comment on it separately (though I'd still recommend asking for feedback on the forum first before going through the effort of writing it all out). For now we think those other features will be enough to cover most practical use cases and the effort is better spent on them.\r\n\r\nPreprocessing is also something that's very easily delegated to external tools. Some where already mentioned in this thread. It's even possible to directly use the preprocessor built into a C compiler if anyone really wants that.",

    "body": "Imports in Solidity are not merely text-based preprocessor imports, but semantic imports that even allow renaming of identifiers and introducing module namespaces. So cpp includes are not a replacement for them, nor does the existence of imports bind us to not using external preprocessors for any other macro use cases.\r\n\r\nIn general, we are moving towards compile-time-constant expression evaluation and support for generic programming in the language, which will be a superior solution to macros in most of their use cases. For anything that may be left (if anything at all), I see little reason to introduce compile-based support compared to asking tooling to allow tying an existing preprocessor like ``cpp`` into the build process.\r\n\r\nI'm actually in favour of closing this issue, since macros are not currently planned in the compiler and for any further discussion on the topic, resp. attempts to change our mind on this :-), the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org/) is the better place.\r\n\r\n\r\nI just see that @cameel was faster than I :-). Note that solidity imports can change and introduce identifiers and resolve recursive dependencies on the declaration rather than the file level (which is necessary since Solidity does not have forward declarations).
