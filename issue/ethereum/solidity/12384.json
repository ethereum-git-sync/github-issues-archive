I'm not sure if it's intentional or not. If it's not, it needs to be fixed. If it is, it should be documented.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\nNested mappings are omitted:\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract C {\r\n    struct T { mapping(uint => uint) m; }\r\n    struct S { T t; }\r\n    S public x;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```\r\nError: Internal or recursive type is not allowed for public state variables.\r\n --> test2.sol:4:5:\r\n  |\r\n4 |     S public x;\r\n  |     ^^^^^^^^^^\r\n```\r\nBut nested dynamic arrays are not. This compiles find and does return the whole array (tested in Remix):\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract C {\r\n    struct T { uint[] u; }\r\n    struct S { T t; }\r\n    S public x;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n- Compiler version: 0.8.10",
