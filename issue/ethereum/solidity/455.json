They are currently hosted in https://github.com/ethereum/homestead-guide/tree/master/source/ethereum-clients/cpp-ethereum, but with the repo reorganization, it would arguably be better for them to move to https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/docs, so they can also be 1-1 updated in parallel with code changes.\n\nRight now we have a mixture of different approaches.\n",
