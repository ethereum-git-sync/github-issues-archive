  "body": "## Abstract\r\n\r\nIt would be great to be able to concatenate string constants:\r\n```solidity\r\nstring public constant FOO = \"foo\";\r\nstring public constant BAR = \"bar\";\r\nstring public constant FOOBAR = FOO BAR; // Illegal, but would be great\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs of now one needs to explicitly write `FOOBAR = \"foobar\"`, which can be a source of bugs.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nMy use case for this feature is building an ERC-712 typehash of data containing structures. According to the standard if the type name of of the structures is this: `MyStruct(uint256 field1, uint256 field2)`, then the type name of the entire data needs to have the structure type name concatenated to itself: `MyData(MyStruct[] data)MyStruct(uint256 field1, uint256 field2)`. Hashes of both of these strings are needed when verifying the signature of the data. As of now it can be implemented only as\r\n```solidity\r\nstring internal constant STRUCT_NAME = \"MyStruct(uint256 field1, uint256 field2)\";\r\nbytes32 internal immutable structTypeHash = keccak256(STRUCT_NAME);\r\nstring internal constant DATA_NAME = \"MyData(MyStruct[] data)MyStruct(uint256 field1, uint256 field2)\";\r\nbytes32 internal immutable dataTypeHash = keccak256(DATA_NAME);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt'd be very elegant and less bug prone if the type name of the data didn't need to repeat the type name of the structure and could simply concatenate it:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nstring internal constant STRUCT_NAME = \"MyStruct(uint256 field1, uint256 field2)\";\r\nbytes32 internal immutable structTypeHash = keccak256(STRUCT_NAME);\r\nstring internal constant DATA_NAME = \"MyData(MyStruct[] data)\" STRUCT_NAME; // would be great\r\nbytes32 internal immutable dataTypeHash = keccak256(DATA_NAME);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are probably other use cases which I'm not aware of.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nCurrently Solidity allows concatenating string literals by writing one after another, e.g. `\"foo\" \"bar\"`. It'd be great if this syntax supported also constant names, e.g. `\"foo\" BAR`.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nThere's no backwards compatibility issue.\r\n",
