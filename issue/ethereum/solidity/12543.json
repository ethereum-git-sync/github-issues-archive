Solidity should emit a warning if a variable assignment is used in a condition without further comparisons.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nThe simplest option would be to blanket warn if _any_ assignment appears in a condition, but that is fairly limited. Unless assignment return values are going to be deprecated, this option is likely unworkable.\r\n\r\nInstead, taking inspiration from GCC's [`-Wparentheses`](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Warning-Options.html#index-Wparentheses), it might be possible to warn if an assignment in a condition appears without parentheses.\r\n\r\nFor example, this would not generate a warning:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nuint a;\r\n\r\nif (6 > (a = 5 + 4)) {\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile this would:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nbool a;\r\nif (a = true || false) {\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nSince this is just a warning, it shouldn't affect backwards compatibility.\r\n",
