  "body": "Referencing: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/docs/solidity-by-example.rst#blind-auction-1\r\n\r\nThe `auctionEnd()` says that:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        // We send all the money we have, because some\r\n        // of the refunds might have failed.\r\n        beneficiary.transfer(this.balance);\r\n```\r\nBut this isn't correct right? What if the bidders haven't called `withdraw` yet? Any unclaimed ether would also go to the beneficiary? And in what scenarios would refunds fail? This is the first instance since the beginning of the Solidity docs where `failure` is brought up. Could this be elaborated further?",
