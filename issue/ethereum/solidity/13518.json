    "body": "So in general, the easiest solution to this would be to just change the return types of ``abi.decode`` with a calldata argument, to calldata types - that should directly solve this with near-zero effort - and I think this should all work now (there is a comment in the type checker code for ``abi.decode`` about the implementation of calldata types lacking and hence memory types being forced, but I think that's utterly outdated by now).\r\n\r\nThe problem with that approach, though, is that it's technically a breaking change :-).",

    "body": "``abi.decode(bytes calldata, *)`` already exists, though, but so far is just an alias and returns memory types (and even if it didn't exist, since calldata to memory conversions are implicit effectively current code works *as if* it existed). And changing those return types to ``calldata`` types will change the revert semantics in certain corner cases. I'm saying it's *technically* breaking, since it's only weird cases that would actually change in behaviour, but strictly speaking it is.\r\n\r\nSo concretely:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncontract C {\r\n  function f() external {\r\n    abi.decode(msg.data[4:], (address[]));\r\n  }\r\n  function test() public returns (bool) {\r\n    uint[] memory x = new uint[](1);\r\n    x[0] = type(uint256).max;\r\n    (bool y,) = address(this).call(abi.encodeWithSelector(this.f.selector, x));\r\n    return y;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCalling ``test()`` here will currently return ``false``, since ``abi.decode``, despite having a ``calldata`` argument, will directly copy-decode to ``memory``, which validates that the ``address`` elements don't have dirty higher order bits (but the single array element passed in has all bits set).\r\n\r\nHowever, if we change the ``abi.decode(bytes calldata, *)`` version to returning ``calldata`` types, the ``abi.decode``-expression in ``f`` itself won't perform this validation just yet, so ``test()`` will return ``true``.\r\n\r\nSo yeah - it's the same valid code behaving differently due to changing this, making this at least technically breaking (even though it's a rather annoying technicality here...).",
