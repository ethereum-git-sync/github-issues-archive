The format is `<start>:<length>:<index>`, where `start` is the position of the first byte belonging to that location. It's not the number of lines. It's also 0-based.\r\n\r\nNot sure why you're getting wrong results from your function - it seems correct at a glance. There might be some subtle error though. Or you could be looking at a wrong line (does your editor display the first line as 0 or 1?). Or your file could be modified or maybe mangled due to line ending conversion in the editor if you're on Windows? Or it could even be a bug in the compiler. I can't really tell without seeing the input file and even with it, I'm not going to retype it all from a screenshot anyway.\r\n\r\nBy the way, the bug tracker is not the best place for questions like this. Please use it if you have a bug to report or a feature to request. If you need help just come to the [#solidity](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity) channel on gitter. Given that this is not properly documented, I think that this question would also be appropriate on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org).\r\n\r\nAlso, just a bit of advice. You're making it unnecessarily hard for people to answer your question :) When I saw it first a few days ago I just skipped it because the title is useless and the screenshots just make it seem like the problem is very complex. Now I see that it's just a simple question about the `src` property that could be answered in a few minutes.  You'd be better off pasting just a small input snippet and a compiler command that anyone can run locally. If you want to paste the output, trim it a bit. And paste it as text - posting a screenshot is quick and easy for you but then anyone wanting to examine your problem has to tediously retype it and no one is really going to do that.
