  "body": "I'm preparing a PR that will parallelize CLI tests (#14339) and in particular the via-ir equivalence will now get its own run. Comparing that between Ubuntu and macOS, I see that it runs 14x slower on the latter:\r\n- [`~via_ir_equivalence` in `t_ubu_cli`](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/30231/workflows/df459314-b1a3-42d0-965a-4393aa90f727/jobs/1342181/parallel-runs/6?filterBy=ALL): 30 sec\r\n- [`~via_ir_equivalence` in `t_osx_cli`](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/30231/workflows/df459314-b1a3-42d0-965a-4393aa90f727/jobs/1342203/parallel-runs/6?filterBy=ALL): 7 min\r\n\r\nThat's even bigger slowdown than we usually see when building solc, which is \"only\" 3x.\r\n\r\nIt also stands out compared to soltest, where macOS is about 2x slower:\r\n- [`t_ubu_clang_soltest`](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/30231/workflows/df459314-b1a3-42d0-965a-4393aa90f727/jobs/1342189): ~8 min (20 parallel runs, ~25 sec each)\r\n- [`t_osx_soltest`](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/30231/workflows/df459314-b1a3-42d0-965a-4393aa90f727/jobs/1342202): ~16 min\r\n\r\nFor via IR eqvivalence most of the execution time is taken by solc compiling contracts rather than evmone executing them or unrelated things like running clang. It's possible that it's not CI that's the culprit here but rather that solc is unusually slow on macOS.\r\n\r\nThe excessive slowdown does not seem to be caused exclusively by IR compilation. The legacy compilation tests are affected to a similar degree:\r\n- [`~compilation_tests` in `t_ubu_cli`](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/30231/workflows/df459314-b1a3-42d0-965a-4393aa90f727/jobs/1342181/parallel-runs/3?filterBy=ALL): 30 sec\r\n- [`~compilation_tests` in `t_osx_cli`](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/30231/workflows/df459314-b1a3-42d0-965a-4393aa90f727/jobs/1342203/parallel-runs/3?filterBy=ALL): 5 min\r\n\r\n### Reproducing the problem\r\nHere's how to run these particular tests locally:\r\n```bash\r\ntest/cmdlineTests.sh ~via_ir_equivalence ~compilation_tests\r\n```",

    "body": "After looking at this again today, looks like the difference is much smaller than I claimed in the description. There are 2 tests that are 2x/3x slower, but the rest much closer in reality, because the running time I posted includes dependency installation time, which is significant on macOS (several minutes, see #12925).\r\n\r\nHere's [`t_ubu_cli`](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/31958/workflows/a5ca4198-e730-454f-8e53-56df3450e3c0/jobs/1428307/) and [`t_osx_cli`](\r\nhttps://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/31958/workflows/a5ca4198-e730-454f-8e53-56df3450e3c0/jobs/1428314/) from the most recent run on `develop`:\r\n\r\n| test                                  | `t_ubu_cli` | `t_osx_cli` | `t_ubu_cli` (job) | `t_osx_cli` (job)\r\n|---------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|\r\n| remaining tests                       | 1:20        |  2:20       | 1:58              |  7:19\r\n| `~ast_export_with_stop_after_parsing` | 4:34        |  4:47       | 5:14              |  9:02\r\n| `~ast_import_export`                  | 7:01        |  8:20       | 7:30              | 12:43\r\n| `~compilation_tests`                  | 0:08        |  0:09       | 0:39              |  4:27\r\n| `~documentation_examples`             | 0:10        |  0:18       | 0:38              |  4:35\r\n| `~evmasm_import_export`               | 2:52        |  7:06       | 3:22              | 11:56\r\n| `~soljson_via_fuzzer`                 | 2:30        |  0:58       | 3:04              |  5:23\r\n| `~via_ir_equivalence`                 | 0:15        |  0:18       | 0:28              |  4:36\r\n\r\nThe first two columns are just the `command line tests` step and the last two are for the whole parallel run of the job, which includes container setup, dependency installation and other steps.\r\n\r\nSo looks like in most cases macOS is just a bit slower. It has a 4 CPU machine, while Linux has 1 CPU, but most of these are not multi-threaded. The only exception is the fuzzer, which is reflected in the numbers.\r\n\r\nThe biggest outliers are \"remaining tests\" and `~evmasm_import_export`. The former is 2x and the later 3x slower on macOS. Seems to be the only one worth looking into.\r\n\r\nI think that, when reporting this, I saw the 2x difference in the main batch of tests and must have mistakenly looked at the others taking the whole running time or each job rather than just the time it takes to run the test. Sorry for the confusion.",
