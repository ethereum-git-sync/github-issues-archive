If someone could guide me on how to make a PR there, that would be helpful. \r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n**How to submit the PR:**\r\nTL;DR -- After forking off the develop branch, in your forked repo: make a new  branch and commit your changes there. Then, in your forked repo, merge the changes. Finally, make a PR to the main repo (which essentially merges your `develop` branch to the main `develop branch`. \r\n\r\n*Note: Fork off of the latest version of the `develop branch`*\r\n\r\n",

To submit a fix you need to create a feature branch off `develop` in your fork (give it some meaningful name) make changes in it, commit them and push the branch to your fork. Then, on the github page for your repo, go to Pull Requests and select \"New Pull Request\". It will let you select the target branch (it should be `develop` from `ethereum/solidity`) and your branch and create the PR.\r\n\r\nBut overall, if you need help contributing, please drop in on the [#solidity-dev](https://app.element.io/#/room/#ethereum_solidity-dev:gitter.im) channel. We can help you with git. This is a bug tracker so not the best place to ask questions like that. You can still comment here but I'm closing the issue since this is not a bug report or a feature request.",
