  "body": "Related to #14535. This is another idea to deal with the same issue, but at an earlier stage.\r\n\r\nThe problem of extra files causing bytecode differences comes from the fact that we compile all the input files together. Why not change that and compile them separately? Due to imports we cannot compile every file in isolation, but we could group files into clusters, each containing files connected through imports. This would be the ultimate way to ensure that AST IDs are not affected by extra files.\r\n\r\nA variant of this idea would be to create namespaces for AST IDs, each cluster having a separate namespace. Or allowing duplicate IDs between clusters. Since one file cannot reach into another without imports, duplicate IDs should not cause problems in code generation.",

You get bytecode for A1 relative to that assignment of IDs.\r\n> But now you could also just compile A.sol+B.sol alone - that induces a different assignment of IDs - but you're supposed to get the same bytecode for A1 as before.\r\n> I.e. same issue as before.\r\n> Or well, for A1 you may be lucky in the example. But make it C1.\r\n> And compare compiling A.sol+B.sol+C.sol - in which C1 gets ID 5 - to compiling C.sol+B.sol, in which C1 would get ID 1 - or so (at least not identical IDs).\r\n\r\nSo this idea is not a complete solution. I think there might still be a possibility of salvaging it by ordering the files within clusters the right way (dependencies before files that use them) and then compiling each file (with dependencies) separately but that's getting much more complicated than my initial idea and also adds a lot of overhead (compiling dependencies multiple times) so I'm going to just close this.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso a note on AST ID backwards-compatibility:\r\n\r\n> On top of that, messing with the AST IDs themselves requires rethinking AST exports and all that...\r\n\r\n> I mean, currently you can expect that for all source files you shove into the compiler, you'll get unique AST IDs - changing that is breaking a rather fundamental invariant, isn't it :-)?",
