But there are two things confuses me:\r\n\r\n1.\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/ae273ff3bda86df699ab00185e2c409bad128d4a/libsolidity/ast/Types.h#L581\r\nNot sure why it want to return 0 when `m_bytes` is 0? (although `m_bytes` cannot be 0 in the first place)\r\n\r\n2.\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/ae273ff3bda86df699ab00185e2c409bad128d4a/libsolidity/ast/Types.cpp#L2781-L2787\r\n\r\nWhy this strange formulae?
