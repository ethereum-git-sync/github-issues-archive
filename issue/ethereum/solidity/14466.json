  "body": "## Abstract\r\n\r\nCurrently you cannot use named parameters in modifiers or constructors, but you are able to in function calls. \r\n```solidity\r\nfunction foo(uint256 bar, string memory baz) public {\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction main() public {\r\n  foo({baz: \"wow\", bar: 1 ether});\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nThe ability to explicitly use the parameter names helps add clarity especially when using imported libraries, abstract contracts, ect.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nI envision constructors and modifiers acting like any other function call. When passed as a struct the parameter order doesn't matter and the key has to match the parameter name in the given constructor / modifier.\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nabstract contract A {\r\n  constructor(string memory _name, uint256 _age) {}\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract B is A {\r\n  constructor()\r\n    A({_age: 100, _name: \"solidity\"})\r\n  {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI cannot comment to the implementation of this. But @cameel 's response suggest this is technically viable in the following post.\r\nhttps://forum.soliditylang.org/t/allow-for-named-parameters-in-constructor/1694\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nUnsure. See forum post above for more details.\r\n",

    "body": "Thanks for bring this up. However, we have decided to not proceed with this implementation for the time being given our current development focus on the new type system for Experimental Solidity. We intend to postpone any further syntactic sugar or feature development until that is ready.\r\n\r\nWe're closing this issue now as we would like to reserve issues for fully specified tasks that are staged for implementation. Please know that we have made a note of this in our internal list of community feature requests and if you want to discuss this further and/or gather further support from the community, you can open a discussion on our [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org/).",
