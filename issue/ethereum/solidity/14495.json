  "body": "Issues where changing something inconsequential in compiler input affects the bytecode keep popping up. We should be able to detect them in testing. A very common trigger for this is adding or reordering input files, which affects AST IDs (#14494, #11907, #9573).\r\n\r\nOne idea to detect this is to have an extra bytecode comparison run, that adds an extra, unrelated file to the original compiler invocation and makes sure that it does not affect the bytecode of other contracts. It would be enough to do this just on Linux, since running it on all platforms is quite resource intensive.\r\n\r\nThe content of the extra file is to be determined by trial and error. It might be enough to include some pragmas in it. The primary benchmark is whether it would detect the recent issue from #14494.",
