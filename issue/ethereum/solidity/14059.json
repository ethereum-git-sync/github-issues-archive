See e.g. [run #135 on Fix nodejs version to 16 in nightly builds](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/actions/runs/4245861443?pr=131:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngenerate (emscripten-wasm32, ubuntu-latest)\r\nNode.js 12 actions are deprecated. Please update the following actions to use Node.js 16: actions/setup-python@v2, actions/checkout@v2, actions/upload-artifact@v2. For more information see: https://github.blog/changelog/2022-09-22-github-actions-all-actions-will-begin-running-on-node16-instead-of-node12/.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe're not explicitly using node 12 (in fact we update it to node 16) so I think this must be caused by the stock actions that we invoke. They're even listed in the message:\r\n- `actions/setup-python@v2`\r\n- `actions/checkout@v2`\r\n- `actions/upload-artifact@v2`\r\n\r\nJust switching to a newer version for each of them should do the trick.",
