  "body": "## Abstract\r\n\r\nEach method has an ID. When a call to a smart contract is made the first step is to find the correct method based on that ID. Currently solidity generates code that checks all method ids that are available in alphabetical order. To allow the development of gas optimised contracts it would be useful if this order could be adjusted.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nTo optimise gas we were discussing in our project to rename a method from `execTransaction` to `execTransaction32785586`. The reason for this was that the later would cost ~400 gas less (in some other cases the differences were even higher). The differences in gas has 2 reasons: \r\n1. As described above all methods are checked alphabetically, so if there are a lot of methods with a smaller method id, more checks need to be performed. \r\n1. The data costs for the method id\r\n\r\nIn the described case the method id for `execTransaction` was `0x6a761202` and for `execTransaction32785586` was `0x00000081`. Thus we saved 192 bytes for the data and the rest because of the order of the methods.\r\n\r\nAs we know that nearly all transactions interacting with out smart contract will use this method we would love to be able to adjust the order in which the method id's are checked.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nA method annotated with `TBD` should always be checked first when searching the correct function. Only one method in a contract should be annotated with this.\r\n\r\n### Optional\r\nThe annotation could also specify an order (`uint`).  When generating the code to check the method id it would first check the annotated methods ordered by the provided order and afterwards the other methods in alphabetical order.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nThis should not break any current behaviour.",

So by not using the optimizer we say the chances that the generated code contains an error is lower. \r\n\r\nMy comment concerning binary search was that a contract where the method ids have been sorted by usage could be more gas efficient than a contract that uses binary search (depends on the usage). But binary search will be definitely be an improvement compared to a current (unoptimized) solution.\r\n\r\n",
