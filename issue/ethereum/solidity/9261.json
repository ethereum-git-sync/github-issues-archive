    "body": "The damaged files (`soljson-v0.6.10+commit.00c0fcaf.js` and `soljson-latest.js`) are actually truncated. I don't see anything in the scripts that would intentionally update an older release/nightly binary. Every run either adds a single new binary or exits. The only way it could happen is if they were damaged while being copied and then `git commit -a` picked up the unintended changes and included them in the commit.\r\n\r\nAs to how they got damaged - there are several suspects:\r\n- `git clone` or `git checkout` - though git is pretty reliable so I doubt it would cleanly exit on error\r\n- `cp` - same here\r\n- the [update](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/blob/gh-pages/update) script written in JS\r\n\r\nWhat's interesting is that `soljson-v0.6.10+commit.00c0fcaf.js` and `soljson-latest.js` (which are supposed to have the same content in that commit) are truncated at different points. `soljson-latest.js` is significantly shorter (19672 kB vs 20624 kB; both should be 20683 kB instead). In the `update` script I see that it always rewrites `soljson-latest.js` (even if there was no new release) so it could happen at that point. But this does not explain why `soljson-v0.6.10+commit.00c0fcaf.js` is shorter too. The script does not touch it. It looks as if both files were truncated independently but this seems unlikely to me.\r\n\r\nThis also looks a bit as if one of the operations was being performed asynchronously and did not finish before another. This could be the case with the `update` script but I don't see anything asynchronous in [publish_binary.sh](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/scripts/travis-emscripten/publish_binary.sh).",
