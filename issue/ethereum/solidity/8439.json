We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.\r\n- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:\r\n\t- [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)\r\n\t- [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)\r\n- Ensure the issue isn't already reported (check `feature` and `language design` labels).\r\n\r\n*Delete the above section and the instructions in the sections below before submitting*\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Abstract\r\nFor some algorithms having a mapping or set type to check the existence of multiple values can simplify code and improve its performance.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease describe by example what problem you see in the current Solidity language\r\nand reason about it.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nIn the next Ethereum hard fork, with EIP-1884, which increases the cost of SLOAD from 200 to 800 it might start to be more cost effective to store some data directly in code, in data structures, and query it. Having a memory mapping or set type would help with this.\r\n\r\nExternal Solidity functions that are only meant to be called by off chain code would benefit with cleaner code in some cases that could use a mapping in the algorithm. Solidity functions that are only meant to be called off-chain have no gas cost but I think some of them could still be implemented more efficiently if there was a memory mapping type.\r\n<!--\r\nIn this section you describe how you propose to address the problem you described earlier,\r\nincluding by giving one or more exemplary source code snippets for demonstration.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThe technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The\r\nspecification should be detailed enough to allow any developer to implement the functionality.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nAll language changes that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing\r\nthese incompatibilities and their severity.\r\n\r\nPlease describe how you propose to deal with these incompatibilities.\r\n-->",

Perhaps some testing would need to be done to find out the gas performance sweet spot.\r\n\r\nIt would need to have better gas efficiency than linear searches to be useful.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of a problem that could be solved easier with a memory map:\r\nLet's say that I have 100 function selectors stored in an array. And each function selector is associated with a contract address.  The program must produce an array of contract addresses that are all the addresses that are associated with the function selectors.  The program prevents duplicate addresses.\r\n\r\nThe algorithm would do this:\r\n1. Loop through the array of function selectors. For each selector get the contract address associated with it. See if the contract address is in our map.  If it is not then put it into our map and put the contract address in our results array. If the contract address is in the map then skip it and go on to the next selector. When all the selectors are exhausted return the results array.\r\n\r\nIt would be great, if possible, to be able to query a memory mapping to return all of its keys or values as arrays, if that is possible. \r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Hm... I'm not sure - mappings in storage work, since we can write to arbitrary slots and with 256-bit hashes we can just trust that there are no collisions (i.e. no buckets, no actual key comparisons, etc.).\r\nIn memory we would severely need to restrict the hash size (random access to memory locations up to 2^32 would still be way too expensive, so it'd need to be restricted to much less than uint32). That in turn means we would need to account for collisions with buckets of some sort - for which it would not be clear where to allocate them, unless we have full proper memory management, which itself is too costly... I'm pretty sure the randomly high memory accesses plus the hashing plus the arithmetic on hashes plus buckets plus actually having to compare the keys in the buckets, etc., would hardly ever be cheaper than other algorithms. In your example an appropriate sorting algorithm for example would do and you could achieve very reasonable complexity that way...\r\n\r\nAnd if you're talking off chain where gas costs don't matter, you can use linear searches in arrays anyways... and like for the growing arrays you could e.g. use helper functions or libraries to make it more convenient...\r\n\r\nCurrently, I don't see a feasible way to do this efficiently and safely in general...\r\n",
