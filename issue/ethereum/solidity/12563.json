    "body": "Thanks for filing this issue!\r\n\r\nYou're right, that's a known shortcoming right now. Array literals (e.g. ``[address(0), address(0)]``) are only convertible to statically sized arrays at the moment, so only either of the following works:\r\n```\r\naddress[2] memory x = [address(...), address(...)];\r\n```\r\nor\r\n```\r\naddress[] memory x = new address[](2);\r\nx[0] = address(...);\r\nx[1] = address(...);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe know that this is inconvenient and we're working on changing this, so hopefully in one of the next releases you *will* be able to simply use ``address[] memory x = [address(0), address(0)];``.\r\n\r\nWe're tracking this problem in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11879, so I'm closing this issue as a duplicate, but feel free to reopen it, if you want to add anything!",
