  "body": "Hello Ethereum,\n\nGreat work, simply brilliant, so a big thanks up front. I'm making my own set of docs on readthedocs with Sphinx and the docs compile/build just fine on my local machine. And when I initially set up the service hook between Github where the files are hosted and Readthedocs, again, still no problem. However, when I added in the `SolidityLexer` and configured the `conf.py` file, the docs build fine on my local machine but throw an error when trying to build on the readthedocs:\n\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"/home/docs/checkouts/readthedocs.org/user_builds/idrevo/envs/latest/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sphinx/cmdline.py\", line 244, in main\nopts.warningiserror, opts.tags, opts.verbosity, opts.jobs)\nFile \"/home/docs/checkouts/readthedocs.org/user_builds/idrevo/envs/latest/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sphinx/application.py\", line 148, in __init__\nself.config.setup(self)\nFile \"conf.py\", line 27, in setup\nfrom SolidityLexer import SolidityLexer\nImportError: No module named SolidityLexer\n\nException occurred:\nFile \"conf.py\", line 27, in setup\nfrom SolidityLexer import SolidityLexer\nImportError: No module named SolidityLexer\nThe full traceback has been saved in /tmp/sphinx-err-AFMkl3.log, if you want to report the issue to the developers.\n```\n\nIt has to do with this line of code in the conf.py file, and again, it works fine on my local machine. This seems like a path issue, but unfortunately I am new to Python. All help is appreciated, thanks!\n\n```\ndef setup(sphinx):\n  sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('./utils'))\n  from SolidityLexer import SolidityLexer\n  sphinx.add_lexer('Solidity', SolidityLexer())\n```\n",
