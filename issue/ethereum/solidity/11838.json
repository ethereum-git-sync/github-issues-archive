  "body": "Please I need help with this. I sent 8248 alix to the contract by mistake for avoiding a scam.\r\nI spoke to the devs since the token is the same currency of the contract but they told me they \"can't do nothing about it. \"\r\nIt seems not fair since they could just return the tokens back to me. \r\n\r\nI've researched and there is an option to re-transfer back the tokens to my wallet but only the owners can do this.\r\nAlso, as I've seen here https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10616 . My tokens are the same as the contract ones!\r\n\r\nPlease help! the red is BSC",
