    "body": "You may be onto something here; none of the steps you're using have hard prerequisites (although omitting a hard prerequisite should yield a different ICE). Now, the interesting thing is that using the `Rematerializer` step (`m`) has no effect on the produced Yul code after the `SSATransform` (`a`), so using the `am` sequence is equivalent to just using `a` by itself. Also, running it with `as` works just fine as well, so my assumption is that running the `Rematerializer` step in this case messes up the tracking in `DataFlowAnalyzer`, which is also a dependency for the `ExpressionSimplifier`. I'd say it's worth investigating, but a confirmation from @ekpyron or @chriseth would be nice.",
