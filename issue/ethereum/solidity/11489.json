    "body": "Thanks for creating the issue. Yeah, there's always too much stuff going on so it's best to file an issue in any case :)\r\n\r\nLooks this one is easy to reproduce:\r\n```bash\r\nnpm install truffle@5.3.9\r\nnpx truffle init\r\nnpx truffle create contract C\r\necho 'module.exports.compilers.solc.version = \"0.8.2\";' >> truffle-config.js\r\nnpx truffle compile\r\n```\r\n\r\nInterestingly, `compile` does not fail in older versions of Truffle. Looks like it started in 5.3.3. Of the ones I tried:\r\n- works on 5.2.4, 5.3.0, 5.3.1 and 5.3.2,\r\n- fails on 5.3.3, 5.3.4, 5.3.5, 5.3.7 and 5.3.9.\r\n\r\nThe binary did pass bytecode comparison check in solc-bin. I.e. it produces the same exact JSON output, including bytecode, on all the ~5k test snippets from our repo as all the other binaries (excluding the Windows one, #11365) so I wonder if it isn't actually something in the input that throws it off.\r\n\r\nI'll need to compare standard JSON input produced by Truffle in 5.3.2 and 5.3.3 and see if there's a difference. (BTW, I wish we already had https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/issues/3368).\r\n\r\nEDIT: It actually started happening in Truffle 5.3.3 (I originally said 5.3.4).",

    "body": "@haltman-at I managed to get to the bottom of it. The root cause is that Truffle (specifically its `compile-solidity` package) [depends on an old version of solc-js (0.6.0)](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/blob/bd53ee4a4bdc107c12a2ddf50bab81036ccfccb7/packages/compile-solidity/package.json#L35).\r\n\r\nThe crash you're seeing is caused by a bug in solc-js that was fixed a year ago (#470). It was in `wrapper.js`: the second argument was missing in `addFunction(singleCallback, 'viiiii')`. This function is inside the compiled binary and calls other stuff that ultimately tries to call `.slice()` on the second argument, which should have been a string but was `undefined` instead.\r\n\r\nTwo things do not add up though. Why only solc 0.8.2 and Truffle >= 5.3.3?\r\n\r\n### solc 0.8.2\r\nLooks like in 0.8.2 `addFunction()` is defined slightly differently than in all the other 0.8.x ones:\r\n- 0.8.1: `function addFunction(func,sig){sig=sig||\"viiiii\";return addFunctionWasm(func,sig)}`\r\n- 0.8.2: `function addFunction(func,sig){return addFunctionWasm(func,sig)}`\r\n- 0.8.3: `function addFunction(func,sig){sig=sig||\"viiiii\";return addFunctionWasm(func,sig)}`\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the other binaries have a default for `sig` which is why they do not fail. I suspect that this is somehow related to the fact that we updated to a newer emscripten version in 0.8.2 (#10751). Not sure why the default came back in 0.8.3 though.\r\n\r\n### Truffle >= 5.3.3\r\nIn https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/pull/3975 the dependency on `solc` has been changed from `^0.6.0` to `0.6.0`. Bug was fixed in 0.6.9 so you effectively reverted to the buggy older version.\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\nSo, well, it's true that the binary for 0.8.2 is different, but looks like it's not really broken so I'm closing this issue. I'll file a report about the outdated solc-js in Truffle's bugtracker.",

But I suppose if the messages change at the same time as the new mechanism is added...?\r\n\r\nReally there's already something of a new mechanism for this what with the `stopAfter: \"parsing\"` option that we don't currently use -- we could use that and get them out of the AST, I imagine -- but we don't use that because it requires passing a special option that doesn't exist on older Solidity versions.  It's possible it might be worth revisiting that though.  (Though of course something directly in `outputSelection` might be easier to use?)",
