For example\r\n```solidity\r\n[[invariant x == y]]\r\ncontract C {\r\n  int x; int y;\r\n  // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n(or `@invariant(x == y)`).\r\n\r\nThis approach can also have better flexibility if verifiers want to have tool specific extensions. For example they could define custom annotations (or functions to be used in annotations). Similarly as Java or C# allows custom annotations/attributes. E.g., the former example could be expressed with some syntax saying \"I want to define an annotation with name `invariant` that can be attached to nodes of type `contract` and would have an `expression` as argument.\".",

    "body": "As discussed during the Solidity summit, I like the general idea.\r\n\r\nSome comments\r\n- If we add invariants at the contract/function level, we should define what it means; Is it going to be always-true invariant or invariant that must hold at the beginning/end of transactions, or something else? I think @leonardoalt mentioned that invariants would hold at the beginning/end of transactions during the summit.\r\n- We should be careful with the wording and documentation on this feature. I like `assert`, but as `assert()` is already used by developers to do input filtering, we must be careful that no one will use it thinking that code will be generated.  I think this is particularly true for `static_assert`, the options 2 and 3 are likely to be less confusing, but it's probably worth asking more people about it. \r\n- I definitely think the compiler should be able to generate bytecode with an extra flag. Ideally, the compiler could take an optional flag to define the opcode used to trigger the invalid states. As `0xfe` is already used for /0, out-of-bound access etc, it would help dynamic tools to be able to focus on another opcode.\r\n",

    "body": "I also like option 3.\r\n\r\nAbout contract invariants: I think it's worth thinking carefully about where the checks should happen. In the literature on class/object invariants there are many different methodologies for checking invariants and not all of them are sound or easy to check at runtime. At MythX/Diligence, we are currently experimenting with an option that should be sound and quite easy to check at runtime (@cd1m0):\r\n\r\n- Check at the end of the constructor.\r\n- Check before external calls. (Shouldn't lead to many \"false positives\", since external calls should happen after state changes anyways to avoid reentrancy issues.)\r\n- Check at the end of public/external functions.\r\n\r\nAll these check use assert-statements and no require-statements are used; when performing modular checking, one might want to assume/require the invariant at the beginning of functions to simplify the reasoning, but I think this should be optional.\r\n\r\nCurrently, we also disallow invariants that refer to the state of other contracts (that is, multi-contract invariants) since they are notoriously hard to check soundly and efficiently at runtime.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, we use regular assert for these check, but we also emit a special event (see https://medium.com/consensys-diligence/checking-custom-correctness-properties-of-smart-contracts-using-mythx-25cbac5d7852 for more details) to distinguish them from implicit assertions that are emitted by the compiler. I also like the option of using a separate opcode as suggested by @montyly.",

    "body": "Some notes from today's design call.\r\n\r\nRust has two kinds assertions:\r\n- [`assert!`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.assert.html)\r\n- [`debug_assert!`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.debug_assert.html)\r\n\r\nWe were trying to identify the use cases addressed by this topic:\r\n1. People add many assertions to code during development, but remove many of them at deploy time to save gas.\r\n2. Analysis tools could benefit from detecting these assertions.\r\n\r\nSentiment from the call:\r\n1. Having a compiler flag to remove all asserts is a bad idea. There needs to be a way to select which ones to keep.\r\n2. Introducing `static_assert` would be confusing if it is not compile-time evaluated. It should only be introduced for constant expressions.\r\n3. Could follow Rust and have a `debug_assert` as well, which is not included in the code based on a compiler flag.\r\n4. Could also implement this as a user defined function: `function debug_assert(bool){assert(bool);}`. Just change the body be empty for the release build.",
