  "body": "Recently, Ward Beullens published a paper saying that using his method, it took only 55 hours to break the rainbow signature using the second round of L1 parameters submitted to NIST.\r\nThe encrypted currency abc uses the rainbow signature. If someone can use his method to crack the abc, then this will be the first time in the field of cryptocurrency to break the encryption algorithm. This will be the first time in the field of cryptocurrency. The event of the encryption algorithm will have cross-generational significance\r\nBelow is the required data:\r\nthis is Jin Liu, the coin holding address of the chairman of the ABCMint Foundation, and we have been authorized.\r\n(1).8JEj33ydPCSYhkaYv17PXfuPF66rtr6cTn8on5zWHNgPkoKpq\r\npaper:\r\n https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/214.pdf\r\ngithubï¼š\r\n https://github.com/WardBeullens/BreakingRainbow\r\n https://github.com/abcmint/abcmint\r\nBlockchain URL:\r\n https://abcscan.io/#/",
