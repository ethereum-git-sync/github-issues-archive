What is the assembly op code for this?\r\n\r\nDoes it cost more gas to use =, >, <. operators with bytes32 than it does with uint256?\r\n\r\nSpreadsheets about gas costs say it cost 3 gas for =, >, < operations, so is that true with all types that support those operators?  Or is the gas cost for these operators different depending on the type?\r\n\r\nI tested some of these things in remix and got mixed results -- sometimes it cost more gas, sometimes less.\r\n\r\nDoes it make any sense to cast bytes32 to unint256 for doing an operation like this: `require(uint256(myvalue) != 0);`\r\n\r\nIf you know the answers to these, can you please tell me how you know?",
