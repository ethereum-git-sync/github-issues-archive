In any case, if this is done in a month or so, it should be a part of next Linguist release.\r\n\r\n",

Submitted 4. **Done** \n\n<hr>\n\n__Work has been started__.\n\n\nThese users each claimed they can complete the work by 8 months, 3 weeks ago.\nPlease review their action plans below:\n\n\n**1) [raphaelhuefner](https://gitcoin.co/profile/raphaelhuefner) has started work.**\n\n# Questions\n\n- https://github.com/ethereum/solidity : Why can't I find any `.. code-block:: solidity` in `/docs/*.rst` ?\n- https://github.com/ethereum/remix-ide : I could not recognize any test coverage for the existing syntax highlighting. Am I missing something obvious here?\n\n# Action Plan\n\n- Collect new keywords from here: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3627/files#diff-526895adda8a40510dd8574b69c948d7\n- For `/docs/utils/SolidityLexer.py`:\n    - Match all new keywords with appropriate pygments' Keyword Token subtypes (from this list: http://pygments.org/docs/tokens/#keyword-tokens ) ... for this I will need to double-check with either @chriseth or @axic if I got the classification right\n    - Insert them into the list of `root` tokens, according to subtype: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/docs/utils/SolidityLexer.py#L50-L81\n    - Create a test .rst file with examples for all new keywords in `.. code-block:: solidity` blocks\n    - Run `sphinx-build -b html` and test that the new keywords are recognized and correctly classified.\n- For Remix's ACE highlighter:\n    - Insert new keywords into https://github.com/ethereum/remix-ide/blob/master/src/app/editor/mode-solidity.js#L60 and https://github.com/ethereum/remix-ide/blob/master/src/app/editor/mode-solidity.js#L76 and possibly a few other places I haven't figured out yet.\n    - Test syntax highlighting manually on my local `remix-ide` instance.\n\nLearn more [on the Gitcoin Issue Details page](https://gitcoin.co/issue/ethereum/solidity/3637/473).\n\n",
