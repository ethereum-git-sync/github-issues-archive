Instead of using the assignment operator `=`, the double equal `==` operator is used, which is a comparison operator and does not assign a value to the variable. This mistake can be hard to identify, as the Solidity compiler does not raise any `warnings` or `errors` for this issue.\r\n\r\n**Feature Expected:** As a result, it is essential for the compiler should carefully check the code and make sure that the correct operators are used at the time of initialization of a variable at the function level.",

    "body": "We in fact do have a warning for cases like this: ``Statement has no effect``. However, we reserved it to only pure statement for a somewhat odd reason: a view statement without effect can be used to silence the ``mutability can be restricted to pure`` warning and we don't have a better workaround.\r\n\r\nThe middle ground here would probably be to only allow very specific view statements without effect (like e.g. ``this``), while extending the \"has no effect\" warning to all other more complex cases. An even better solution may be to extend the warning to *all* statements without effect and to come up with a new way to silence mutability warnings explicitly.",
