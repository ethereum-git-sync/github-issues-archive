Instead of using the assignment operator `=`, the double equal `==` operator is used, which is a comparison operator and does not assign a value to the variable. This mistake can be hard to identify, as the Solidity compiler does not raise any `warnings` or `errors` for this issue.\r\n\r\n**Feature Expected:** As a result, it is essential for the compiler should carefully check the code and make sure that the correct operators are used at the time of initialization of a variable at the function level.",
