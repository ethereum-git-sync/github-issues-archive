  "body": "ethereum.org is being re-designed and aims to rather be an information hub than an actual provider in the future. Did I phrase this correctly @alexvandesande? We could move all Solidity examples from there (https://www.ethereum.org/greeter, https://www.ethereum.org/dao and such) to our documentation. I can already identify a few benefits / disadvantages:\r\n\r\nBenefits:\r\n- The examples would probably get lost otherwise\r\n- We have the code under control could remove the (unperceived) dependency\r\n\r\nDrawbacks:\r\n- Examples would probably not look that fancy ;) \r\n\r\n",
