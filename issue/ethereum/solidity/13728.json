Which is true:\r\n\r\n```\r\nError: This looks like an address but is not exactly 40 hex digits. It is 39 hex digits. If this is not used as an address, please prepend '00'.

And yeah, in that case you'd fork `develop` and submit a PR to `develop` - though I'd recommend to still create a branch for your commit since it makes pulling in changes from the main repo easier. Take a look at our [review checklist](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/ReviewChecklist.md), especially the first and the last section.",
