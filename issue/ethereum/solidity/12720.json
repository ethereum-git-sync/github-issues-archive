    "body": "Have you tried to force `setlocale()` to use something that is not a real locale? @chriseth's idea was to do that so basically any use of these functions fails in some obvious way.\r\n\r\nThis way we'd find them all and replace them with locale-neutral alternatives. For example instead [`int toupper(int)`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/byte/toupper) from `<ctype>` we'd use [`charT toupper(charT, const locale&)`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/locale/toupper) from `<locale>` passing it the C locale explicitly.\r\n\r\n> Another option could be to run all tests we have against several locales. Do you think it might work?\r\n\r\nNot sure it's worth it. `soltest` runs in CI are already pretty heavy and we have quite a few of them. Locale is a corner case that I'd expect to work correctly once we get it right once so my minimal test should be enough to detect it. I even have doubts it my test isn't an overkill - it's an extra standalone job that will now run on every PR. Ideally I'd have it a a part of the CLI runs but I didn't want to add a dependency on the locale package to the CLI test script.",
