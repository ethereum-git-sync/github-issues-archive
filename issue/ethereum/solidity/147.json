    "body": "The main problem with this is that strings are sequences of utf-8 encoded characters. This means that they do not really behave like arrays - arrays are lists of elements with equal encoding sizes.\nSo if you want to change a character inside a string, you might have to shift a large portion of the string - which causes a potentially unexpected impact on the gas usage.\n\nFurthermore, such routines are currently hard to implement in the compiler, but eventually we will have to add support for something like dynamically injected Solidity.\n",
