I guess the bytecode/AST/assembler outputs wouldn't make a big difference as they are generated together for EVM, but Why3 is not necessary in all scenarios.\n\nSimilarly if WASM/WAST would come along that would be an extra step taking time.\n\nNot sure what kind of speed loss we're talking about at the moment.\n",

    "body": "The idea is that in the future, all behaviour of the compiler is controlled by a single json object (which also includes the source files). The compiler can also _generate_ such a minimal json object to be used for source verification.\n\nConcerning the output selection, I guess the syntax would be something like `outputs=[\"ast\", \"bytecode\", \"runtime-bytecode\", \"gas\"]` - similar to the combined-json options on the commandline. It would also be nice if we could select which contract to compile or that we only want the ast for certain source files and so on.\n",
