I went and tried it.\n\n[Here is my test code.](https://gist.github.com/anonymous/6c123d75adb8279b41c33be0d893e458)\n\nThe good news is that all that happens is the calling contract gets confused and loops until out of gas. This is probably the desired behavior overall, but would it be better/possible if Solidity explicitly threw?\n",

    "body": "@Smithgift you are right that these three opcodes are executed, but it is not really a \"loop\". Instead, the `JUMPI` causes an invalid jump exception (on purpose) and thus an immediate return to the caller. Since the opcode before the `ISZERO` opcode is the `CALL` one call stack level higher, it seems to loop by continuing with the `ISZERO` opcode. So the snippet you cite above is exactly the code that is responsible for exception propagation.\n",
