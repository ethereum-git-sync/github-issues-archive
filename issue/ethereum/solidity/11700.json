The type may be equal in the case the child contract has no changes (`contract B is A {}`), but what should it return in case the underlying address is different?  Because of this confusing aspect, it is better not to allow comparison of instances, but potentially allow comparison of the type, and of course comparison of the address is supported via explicit cast.",
