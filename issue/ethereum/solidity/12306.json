  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nSolidity automatically copies all return data into memory after any external call, including low-level calls for which the return data is never captured or used. To my knowledge, the only way to prevent this is to make the call from an inline assembly block.\r\n\r\nThis is somewhat counterintuitive and makes it difficult to reason about the resource consumption of an untrusted external call. Here is an example of a subtle vulnerability resulting from this behavior (acknowledging that this violates the [suggested](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.10/common-patterns.html#withdrawal-from-contracts) withdrawal method for sending funds to untrusted addresses).\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0\r\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\r\n\r\ncontract KingOfTheHill {\r\n    address public king;\r\n    uint256 public topBid;\r\n\r\n    function bid() external payable {\r\n        require(msg.value > topBid);\r\n        address unseatedKing = king;\r\n        uint256 unseatedBid = topBid;\r\n        king = msg.sender;\r\n        topBid = msg.value;\r\n        // Return the previous king's bid amount.\r\n        // Common to assume that 1/64 of gasleft() before the\r\n        // call will be available to complete execution.\r\n        address(unseatedKing).call{value: unseatedBid}(\"\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract EvilKing {\r\n    KingOfTheHill private hill;\r\n    constructor(KingOfTheHill _hill) { hill = _hill; }\r\n    function doBid() external payable {\r\n        hill.bid{value: msg.value}();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // Force calling contract to consume remaining gas in RETURNDATACOPY\r\n    // by returning as much 0 data as possible without running out of gas.\r\n    fallback() external payable override {\r\n        // approximate solution to Cmem for new_mem_size_words\r\n        uint256 rsize = sqrt(gasleft() / 2 * 512);\r\n        assembly {\r\n            return(0x0, mul(rsize, 0x20))\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function sqrt(uint x) private returns (uint y) {\r\n        uint z = (x + 1) / 2;\r\n        y = x;\r\n        while (z < y) {\r\n            y = z;\r\n            z = (x / z + z) / 2;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is common to assume that the external call made in `KingOfTheHill.bid()` will always have some gas remaining after the call to complete execution. In theory, the `unseatedKing` address receiving this call will be able to consume a maximum of `63/64 * G` gas, where G is the gas remaining at the callsite. This may lead to the assumption that there is always some amount of gas that a bidder can provide to the `bid()` call such that the remaining `1/64 * G` gas will be enough to finish execution without exhausting the gas.\r\n\r\nBut, the call recipient can force the caller to consume gas *after* the call by returning a large amount of data.\r\n\r\nAs seen above, if the `unseatedKing` is a contract that returns as much 0 data as possible without throwing an `OUT_OF_GAS` exception, there is no amount of gas that a bidder can provide to `bid()` such that execution does not run out of gas after the call to the `unseatedKing`. All of the data that the `unseatedKing` contract returns will be copied into memory after the call, and `RETURNDATACOPY` is more expensive per byte of data than `RETURN`. The `unseatedKing` gets 63/64 of remaining gas `G` to return as much data as possible, and the `bid()` function can never copy that much data into memory without exhausting the remaining `1/64 * G` gas.\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\nDo not `RETURNDATACOPY` after a low-level external call unless the return data is captured or used, e.g.:\r\n```solidity\r\n(bool success, bytes memory data) = address(unseatedKing).call{value: unseatedBid}(\"\");\r\n```\r\n",

    "body": "Right, this does sound like a sensible optimization. I suppose it was done this way because we generally try to make the code generation straightforward and rely on the optimizer to remove unused stuff instead. In this case it looks like this is not being optimized out even though memory goes unused. This is something that the upcoming `RedundantStoreEliminator` (#11352) might be able to handle in the Yul optimizer but I think this is simple enough to change in the codegen that it might be worth doing there. For example in the old codegen the change would probably be limited to just this part: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/defc74c8a248585b9fe1ddc8a10d10f11c92c052/libsolidity/codegen/ExpressionCompiler.cpp#L2725-L2761\r\n\r\nAt least as long as we're talking about the case where the return data goes completely unused (which would cover the low-level calls). Handling the situation where it's only partially used (i.e. you ignore some but not all return values) in a high-level call would be more complex and might require changes in the ABI decoder code.",
