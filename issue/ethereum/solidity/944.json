    "body": "The reason why this doesn't work is because of the way the compiled bytecode accesses variables in Solidity. When `B.set` executes, it doesn't look for `x`, explicitly. Instead, when `B` is compiled, it sees that `B.x` is in the second storage slot so whenever it deals with `B.x`, it will go there. (This is a gross oversimplification but it should get the point across.)\n\nWhen you call `A.makeCallCode`, it will run `B.set`. What that does is it will look in the second storage slot (because that's where `B.x` is). In `A`'s case, though, the second storage slot is `A.sender`. Thus, `A.sender` is set to `255`, instead of `A.x`.\n\nIn order to fix this, simply rearrange the variable declarations as follows:\n\n```\naddress public sender;\nuint public x;\nB addressB;\n```\n",
