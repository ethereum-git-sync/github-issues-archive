  "body": "This was originally a bug report that turned into a feature request:\n\nThe compiler should warn about calling functions on `this` in the constructor and any function called from the constructor. I think we will not be able to catch all cases (you also have to include modifiers, base classes and other things), but we could at least try.\n\n---\n\nThis seems like a compiler bug to me, unless I have a misunderstanding here…\n\nConsider the contract\n\n``` js\ncontract PingPong {\n    function PingPong() {\n        this.foo(msg.sender, msg.value);\n    }\n    function () {\n        this.foo(msg.sender, msg.value);\n    }\n    function foo(address originalSender, uint originalValue) {\n        originalSender.send(originalValue);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou can see this deployed on Morden here: [0x1689e1992bc3690383d74d439e4055c34a2640fe](http://testnet.etherscan.io/address/0x1689e1992bc3690383d74d439e4055c34a2640fe)\n\nUpon contract creation, I was expecting the value sent with the tx to be bounced back to the sender. Instead, the contract ends up sending the ETH to itself in an internal tx: `msg.sender` was resolved to the address of the newly created contract _not_ the true sender.\n\n(The default method works as expected: two internal txs, the second returning the ETH to the original sender.)\n\nLifting `msg.sender` to a local name makes no difference:\n\n``` js\ncontract PingPong {\n    function PingPong() {\n        address originalSender = msg.sender;\n        uint originalValue = msg.value;\n        this.foo(originalSender, originalValue);\n    }\n…\n```\n\nOnly an internal method call works as expected:\n\n``` js\ncontract PingPong {\n    function PingPong() {\n        foo(msg.value, msg.sender);\n    }\n…\n```\n\nIs this a bug? Have I misunderstood something special about the constructor?\n",

This is what happens: When the contract is still in construction, its code is not yet deployed to its address (that is a \"feature\" / limitation of the EVM). This means if you call `this.setX(tmp)`, you call a function on a non-existing contract and thus `setX` is not really called. When the fallback function is called, the contract does exist and thus `setX` is correctly called.\n",
