We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.\r\n- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:\r\n\t- [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)\r\n\t- [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)\r\n- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.\r\n- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\n<!--Please shortly describe the bug you have found, and what you expect instead.-->\r\n\r\nWhen attempting to build the compiler from source, I follow the instructions, e.g, here: https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.6.10/installing-solidity.html#command-line-build\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nmkdir build\r\ncd build\r\ncmake .. && make\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt turns out this misses a step that _does_ happen in the next direction given:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./scripts/build.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich is to set the build type as `Release` (instead of `Prerelease`).\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if the docs above were updated to reflect the correct way to configure `cmake` so that the default build is `Release`. I ran into this a few times when working on a recent smart contract and wanted to use the latest version of the compiler:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\npragma solidity ^0.6.10\r\n// some cool dapp\r\n```\r\n\r\nwould fail w/ the source build according to the first block of instructions as it outputs a `Prerelease` compiler.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\nNOTE: this is solely (?) a documentation issue.\r\n\r\n- Compiler version: v0.6.9 and v0.6.10 but this has likely been around before those versions of the compiler\r\n- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): ...\r\n- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): None\r\n- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: Geth\r\n- Operating system: macOS\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease provide a *minimal* source code example to trigger the bug you have found.\r\nPlease also mention any command line flags that are necessary for triggering the bug.\r\nProvide as much information as necessary to reproduce the bug.\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n// Some *minimal* Solidity source code to reproduce the bug.\r\n// ...\r\n```\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSee above.\r\n",
