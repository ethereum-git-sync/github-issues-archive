  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nSolidity allows casting an undefined address to a smart contract, this should probably not be allowed. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/HarbourProject/protocol/blob/204312da5b445f5574ec10a79ab7ac9ba06653dc/contracts/Organization.sol#L72-L85).\r\n\r\nIn this example ```proposal``` is undefined yet we can do this\r\n\r\n```Solidity\r\nProposalInterface proposal = ProposalInterface(proposal);\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom what I can see, it initializes an ProposalInterface with the address ```0x0```, ideally, this would not even compile as there is never a previous variable definition of ```proposal```.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version: 0.4.24\r\n- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Truffle",

It is mathematically impossible to check whether the bytecode of a contract implements a certain interface, and even getting close to checking almost all would be very costly.",
