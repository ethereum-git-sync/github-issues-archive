We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.\r\n- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:\r\n\t- [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)\r\n\t- [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)\r\n- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.\r\n- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nWe error on running the Yul optimizer on\r\n\r\n```\r\npragma solidity >= 0.0.0;\r\ncontract C {\r\n        function test() public returns (int)\r\n        {\r\n                int8 v0 = int8(0xdc4c7fbf8ec49ab53bc225a482aad76de9d21c98cbf2a163c351192dfaec2e05);\r\n                assembly {\r\n                        v0 := msize()\r\n                }\r\n                return int(v0);\r\n        }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nbecause\r\n\r\n`The msize instruction cannot be used when the Yul optimizer is activated because it can change its semantics. Either disable the Yul optimizer or do not use the instruction.`\r\n\r\nWe should probably do something similar for `pc()`. Not that it changes optimizer semantics but that one should not rely upon the value of `pc()`",
