  "body": "## Abstract\r\n\r\nI found myself needing to reference another contract's events while writing unit tests in the Solidity language:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\r\npragma solidity ^0.8.18;\r\n\r\ncontract Test {\r\n    event MyEvent(uint256 index);\r\n\r\n    function testingEvents() external returns (bytes32) {\r\n        // Works\r\n        return Test.MyEvent.selector;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function testingEvents2() external returns (bytes32) {\r\n        // Works\r\n        return MyEvent.selector;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\ncontract AnotherTest {\r\n    function testingEvents() external returns (bytes32) {\r\n        // Doesn't compile due to failed lookup of `MyEvent`.\r\n        return Test.MyEvent.selector;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm actually not sure whether to format this as a feature request or a bug :sweat_smile:\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nIn the [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) framework, you can write unit tests with Solidity. If I want to filter events emitted in logs, I can hash the signature manually:\r\n```solidity\r\nbytes32 selector = keccak256(\"MyEvent(uint256)\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, it would be cleaner to actually reference the event so it's harder for the selector definition to go stale:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nbytes32 selector = Test.MyEvent.selector;\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nI don't think this introduces new syntax.\r\n\r\nRegarding semantics, I'm personally only interested in being able to evaluate an event's selector.\r\n\r\nHowever, I wouldn't know whether it makes sense to allow emission of foreign events in your own contract:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract Test {\r\n    event MyEvent(uint256 index);\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\ncontract AnotherTest {\r\n    function testingEvents() external returns (bytes32) {\r\n        emit Test.MyEvent(5);\r\n        return 0;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUpdate: Actually, to assert that an event was emitted, [`expectEmit`](https://book.getfoundry.sh/cheatcodes/expect-emit) is used, and it requires emitting the event with the expected arguments. So it does make sense to allow emitting foreign events in the context of test writing at least.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nAs far as I can see, there should be no backwards incompatibility due to the fact that function, modifier, struct and event identifiers that overlap are disallowed. I might be missing something though.",
