On the other hand, the unoptimized program bails out early because `msize()` is zero at the point of evaluation.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version: latest develop\r\n- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): istanbul\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ solc --strict-assembly --optimize <test.yul>\r\n$ yulrun --input-file <test_opt.yul>\r\n``` ",

    "body": "I have a feeling this is because of #7461 \r\n\r\n- `x_3` is moved out of the loop because it is a movable loop invariant\r\n- Then probably expression simplifier plus function in-lining leads to the optimized code\r\n\r\nI think the main issue here is that we don't check if loop executes at least once before moving the \"movable loop invariant.\" If the movable loop invariant is in for-init block, it is fine to move it outside the loop because the init part is unconditionally executed. However, if it is either in the for-body or for-post blocks, then we shouldn't move if the loop may never be executed, because moving it without this guarantee is tantamount to adding code that is not intended. In other words, we should perform loop invariant code motion if we are sure that loop executes at least once.\r\n\r\nAnother approach that we may take is to define infinite loop (a denial of service attack essentially) as a side-effect. If an expression can result in an infinite loop, it is not movable. With this approach, I think we will have to err on the side of caution (meaning that when we cannot decide on for loop termination at compile time, we may have to assume the worse).",

    "body": "Ah, nice example.\r\n\r\n> I think determining whether a loop terminates with finite gas or not in general will be a (probably too) hard problem for the optimizer.\r\n\r\nYeah, I think it will be impossible unless we interpret code at compile time. For example, the value of `msize()` in the original example is unknown unless we start interpreting code from the very beginning. On top of that, the additional constraint of \"bounded with regard to finite gas\" would mean the interpreter (which at the moment does not have a notion of gas) will need to do emulate gas costs as well.\r\n\r\n> I think @chriseth wants to solve this for now by marking all loops and recursive functions as non-movable for 0.5.14 and then think about how we can improve upon that later.\r\n\r\nSounds good to me. Better to forgo a potential optimization opportunity than give room for potentially incorrect code.",
