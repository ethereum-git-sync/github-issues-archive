  "body": "I will payout 1000 LINK (13k $) for help in my problem.\r\nI'm just recovering from a terrible loss, I'm a father and husband, and a few days ago I lost my life savings due to one small mistake and rush.  I don't want to bother you with my problems, so I'll go to the details.  I accidentally sent 4,000 LINK worth $ 50k to the Ghst Stacking smart contract that does not support the LINK cryptocurrency chain.  Theoretically, the contract is immutable, and even its creator Nick Mudge admitted it.  However, when I launched the rescue operation, good people came to me who said that there should be a chance to add a LINK sidechain to it, which would allow me to recover all my life savings.  All information is contained on this website www.aavegotchi.com, while cale Aavegotchi agrees to cooperate if it turns out that it is possible to do so.  Of course, it will cover the cost of your work, I think that it is enough money that \"hangs\" there that we will be able to agree.  I got a link to you as a group that can do Magic.  I am begging you for help.  Dawid Kaczówka from Poland.\r\nTx: https://eth1.trezor.io/tx/0xd82fec2e5c2e37f82185307c8e74d9c3302f77c3fd85c2201876b403d55dbcef\r\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x93ea6ec350ace7473f7694d43dec2726a515e31a#code\r\ncode.\r\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x93eA6ec350Ace7473f7694D43dEC2726a515E31A#code\r\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x4a271b59763d4d8a18ff55f1faa286de97317b15#code",

    "body": "I'm very sorry to hear about your loss. Unfortunately I don't think the funds are recoverable. There are two ways it could theoretically be done and both require functionality the contracts are missing.\r\n\r\nFirst, the Chainlink contract could give you your tokens back if it was designed for such an eventuality. Etherscan does not show me the code of their token (just a summary of available ERC20 token functions), but I'm pretty sure that the contract is some version of this: https://github.com/smartcontractkit/LinkToken/tree/master/contracts/v0.6. It's a dead simple contract (as tokens tend to be) and it's designed to do just one thing: keep a big list of which address owns how much. In fact most of the implementation is the battle-tested standard OpenZeppelin ERC20 contract. Chainlink added a few functions to support ERC-677 but that does not change much. I can see no functions that would allow anyone but the owner to transfer funds. And the owner in this case is the Aavegotchi contract.\r\n\r\nSo the second option would be to make the Aavegotchi contract transfer funds back to you. And there's a ray of hope since the contract that owns the funds is a proxy (implemented as @mudgen's Diamond). If you could somehow get the proxy to register the transfer function of the Chainlink contract as a diamond facet, you (or anyone else) would then be able to call it via the proxy and move the funds as if you were the owner. Aavegotchi, as any diamond, has an admin interface for changing registered functions, called `IDiamondCut`. The thing is, that interface is disabled (commented-out so it can't really be enabled again). That's great for security of the contract but it's also bad news for you. You can't do it that way. You'd have to find and exploit a pretty serious security hole in Aavegotchi to make it possible and I know @mudgen ran a bug bounty on it so even if there were a hole, it would be unlikely to be an easy one to find.\r\n\r\nI'm going to leave this open for a moment in case anyone else on the team wants to chime in but I don't want to get your hopes up. I wish you luck but I think that recovering it is pretty much impossible. ",

I have enough work for the rest of the week but I can give it an hour or two on the weekend and see if there's anything I missed. But like I said, everything here seems very solid so really, please don't put too much hope in it as I'm pretty sure I won't find anything. GHST and Nick's contract were audited and the Link contract could hardly be simpler. From the link you gave me I see that it's an older version of the token (still running on Solidity 0.4.x) and maybe it is affected by some long patched security issue in the compiler but again, that's not something I would count on.",
