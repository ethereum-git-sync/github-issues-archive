The only solution is to set `{gasLimit: 3e7}` in each contract function call.\r\n\r\nOne thing that can trigger this problem is when the contract size approaches the maximum possible size. (Hopefully the testcase triggers this as a standalone program -- other contracts in my build environment raise the total size close to the limit.)\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version: 0.8.14\r\n- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): unknown\r\n- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Hardhat\r\n- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: Hardhat network\r\n- Operating system: Linux\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n`Contracts.sol`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\r\npragma solidity ^0.8.14;\r\n\r\ncontract HasReceiveFunction {\r\n    uint256 public receivedETH;\r\n    receive() external payable {\r\n        receivedETH += msg.value;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract SendFunction {\r\n    function send(address to) external payable {\r\n        (bool success,) = to.call{value: msg.value}(\"\");\r\n        if (!success) {\r\n            revert(\"Failed to send ETH\");\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`index.js`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst { expect } = require(\"chai\");\r\nconst { ethers } = require(\"hardhat\");\r\nconst SendFunction = require(\"../artifacts/contracts/Contracts.sol/SendFunction.json\");\r\nconst HasReceiveFunction = require(\"../artifacts/contracts/Contracts.sol/HasReceiveFunction.json\");\r\n\r\nasync function deployContract(wallet, contract, constructorArgs) {\r\n    const contractInstance = await ethers.ContractFactory.fromSolidity(contract, wallet).deploy(...constructorArgs);\r\n    await contractInstance.deployed();\r\n    return contractInstance;\r\n}\r\n\r\ndescribe(\"TestSendReceiveFunction\", () => {\r\n  let wallet;\r\n\r\n  beforeEach(async () => {\r\n    wallet = await ethers.getSigners();\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  it(\"send ETH\", async () => {\r\n    const send = await deployContract(wallet[2], SendFunction, []);\r\n    const hasReceive = await deployContract(wallet[1], HasReceiveFunction, []);\r\n    await send.send(hasReceive.address, {value: 101, gasLimit: 3e7});\r\n    expect(await hasReceive.receivedETH({gasLimit:3e7})).to.equal(101);\r\n  });\r\n)};\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo trigger the error, you need to do two things:\r\n\r\n1. Remove the `gasLimit: 3e7` args.\r\n2. Change `(bool success,) = to.call{value: msg.value}(\"\");` into `(bool success,) = to.call{value: msg.value}(\"x\");` -- this should revert the `call`, because `receive` functions require that `msg.data.length == 0`. It's when this call tries to revert that the \"cannot estimate gas\" error seems to be triggered.",
