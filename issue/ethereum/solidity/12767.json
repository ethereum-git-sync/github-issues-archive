  "body": "Closes #11889.\r\n\r\n**## Abstract**\r\n\r\nPrivate functions are isolated to the specific contract they are defined in. This holds true during inheritance as well. A contract that inherits another contract cannot use or access private functions from the parent contract. In cases where a contract inherits two separate contracts that each contain the same private function name, there should be no compilation error due to naming conflicts. \r\n\r\n**## Motivation**\r\n\r\nBecause inheriting contracts cannot use or access the private functions of parent contracts, enforcing uniqueness of these private function names is unnecessarily restrictive.\r\n\r\nAn example of how this can happen is explained [here](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11889#issue-987605750)\r\n\r\n\r\n**## Specification**\r\n\r\n1. Update the [ambiguous overrides checking function](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/c47da51eab8e5c4ebff0f6dd2ca748179aa21ab4/libsolidity/analysis/OverrideChecker.cpp#L727) in [OverrideChecker](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/c47da51eab8e5c4ebff0f6dd2ca748179aa21ab4/libsolidity/analysis/OverrideChecker.cpp#L1) to track the scope of functions when comparing them for uniqueness.\r\n\r\n2.  Write tests for that case [here](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/tree/69411436139acf5dbcfc5828446f18b9fcfee32c/test/libsolidity/syntaxTests/inheritance)  \r\n\r\n\r\n**## Backwards Compatibility**\r\n\r\nThis change makes solidity compilation strictly more permissive and should not introduce any incompatibilities with existing contracts.",

Rather, ``ContractDefinition::definedFunctions`` should be split into functions visible only in the contract itself and functions also visible via inheritance and the override checker should in general only use the appropriate version. The tricky part will be to verify that all uses of (the versions of) this function will remain correct throughout the compiler and that it's never possible to call an incorrect function due to this.",

Done \n\n<hr>\n\n__Work has been started__.\n\n\nThese users each claimed they can complete the work by 264 years, 8 months from now.\nPlease review their action plans below:\n\n\n**1) [viktorbodrogi](https://gitcoin.co/viktorbodrogi) has applied to start work _(Funders only: [approve worker](https://gitcoin.co/issue/ethereum/solidity/12767/100028567?mutate_worker_action=approve&worker=viktorbodrogi) | [reject worker](https://gitcoin.co/issue/ethereum/solidity/12767/100028567?mutate_worker_action=reject&worker=viktorbodrogi))_.**\n\nI would like to get involved with Ethereum related development, and this task seems easy enough for someone even with zero experience in the specific area, but very many experience in coding. So I would give a shot, if you are patient enough. It seems this is not an urgent task, the given one year timeframe must be enough :)\n\nSteps:\n- Setup build environment and do builds.\n- Study the code around the specific task and in general also.\n- Learn and run test.\n- Create a test which fails with current code, but should be OK with the enhancement.\n- Fix code to satisfy requirement.\n- Submit solution.\n**2) [fsw-life](https://gitcoin.co/fsw-life) has been approved to start work.**\n\nI am leaning towards this not being something to change.\n\nSolidity allows for parent contracts to be called from within contracts that have inherited them using the \"Super\" function. \n\nWouldn't it then be possible for contract AB to gain access to contract A's functions by calling the Super function, at which point contract AB could call MyPrivateFunction and cause contract A to call the same function as there is no way to differentiate between the two functions?\n\nAnother issue is that it is possible to override functions as long as they are not \"Private\"\nAll interface contracts treat functions as virtual, which are able to be overridden. that might create an issue since contract A can be treated as an interface contract if it was to inherit an interface like many contracts do (for example erc20 is Ierc20 is pretty common) and calls it internally rather than through an externally accessed library contract. \n\nand all of this is may not be dangerous or even possible when using high level code like Solidity, but what happens when you interact with contract AB's virtual Interface? (lets call it the ABI for now) sorry for the pun! \n\nit just seems like having a private inaccessible function  indistinguishable from a function that a contract can access would eventually create a backdoor for another contract down the road, Especially if either contract has admin proxy upgrade functions, not to mention the possibility that the contract that was inherited might be the malicious contract! \n\nAlthough you may not have to worry about your contract being exploited, others may use your contract with ambiguous overrides to unambiguously override the private functions of contracts that unknowingly use your contracts code through inheritance....  the same way Contract A might access your contract and possibly override or gain access to MyPrivateFunction from within contract (AB)'s virtual interface.\n\nLearn more [on the Gitcoin Issue Details page](https://gitcoin.co/issue/ethereum/solidity/12767/100028567).\n\n",
