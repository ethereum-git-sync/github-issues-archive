At the same time set the `model-checker-engine` to `none`, which ultimately means the SMT checker is not run. (But perhaps the AST traversing is conducted, @leonardoalt?)\r\n\r\nSince we already have the setting exposed via standard JSON and solc, this step would remove complexity of having the extra pragma.\r\n\r\nHowever one downside it has, that with the pragma it is possible to enable checking per-file.",
