    "body": "Yeah, the memory layout may be different from calldata even for static types. IIRC the compiler just always stores pointers for reference types and allocates them separately. That seems to be what you're seeing in your example. The dynamic array of structs is really an array of pointers to structs here.\r\n\r\nSo this is not a bug - it works as designed. It's different because trade-offs for memory are different from calldata and storage. I think that the efficiency of copying between calldata and memory wasn't high on the list of priorities back when this was designed. Probably still wouldn't be now.\r\n\r\nI recall @ekpyron saying that we will likely be changing the memory layout in the future though, so if you think it should be different, the discussion is open. For that I'd suggest to drop by on one of the design calls though.",

    "body": "It's tricky... the memory layout allows it to easily switch out pointers to sub-structures, i.e. in ``uint[100][1] memory x;``, since everything is pointers, I can switch ``x[0]`` to point to a different memory location without copying. Which is a good property for memory, but useless for (read-only) calldata.\r\nThe current situation in which calldata and memory have different layouts is rather unfortunate, but we can't really break the calldata layout and it doesn't always fit the requirements of an optimal memory layout, unless we simultaneously change a lot of e.g. the current reference semantics.\r\nWhat we'll likely change at some point anyways, is the layout of memory types on stack, i.e. have a pointer to a data area and a length on stack like for calldata types, since that allows slicing of memory types. When doing that, we can consider further changes in the memory layout.",
