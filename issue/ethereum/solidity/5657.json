  "body": "## Abstract\r\n\r\n``solc`` could generate flattened sol source code in output JSON.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nA flattened source code, all includes eliminated and having source in a single file, is needed for source code verification (reproducible builds). The most common venue is EtherScan and public verification.\r\n\r\nCurrently there are third party tools doing this - see ( https://github.com/BlockCatIO/solidity-flattener and https://github.com/nomiclabs/truffle-flattener ). However the add extra complexity to the toolchain, as the natural place to to produce the flattened source code would be the compiler itself as the compiler know from where it has assembled the source code files. For non-trivial source code tree doing a flattened version of a contract tends to be a labour intensive process.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nIn Input Description, include new `outputSelection` option `source`. This will procude matching `source` item in `contracts` section.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nAs this is additional change to the compiler output, I do not see it should cause \r\n\r\n## Earlier discussion\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2620\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/611",

Contract source code verification should be done based on standard-json input and not based on flattened files.

    "body": "@chriseth Thank you for very insightful feedback.\r\n\r\nRegardless if you are transfering a single source file or multiple source files, you need to have a method to extract these source files and bundle them for a verification.\r\n\r\nI agree with you, the current flattened method is a poor man's `tar`.\r\n\r\nIf `standard-json` input is the answer, then we should be able to generate a bundle that contains all `standard-json` plus source code files inlined/bundled/etc. there? Then you can pass this mega JSON blob to a `solc` compiler elsewhere? \r\n\r\nI am aware of `ethpm` work where they try to address some of these issues through a hash links. However I feel some of `ipfs://` and `bzz://` is still futuretech and meanwhile developers need to work with git and local filesystems. ",

Then I did:\r\n```\r\ntruffle compile --all\r\ntruffle migrate --network kovan --reset\r\n```\r\nWhen veryfying at https://kovan.etherscan.io/ which file should I use?\r\n\r\n`./contracts/Master.sol`\r\nor\r\n`./client/src/contracts/Master.json`\r\n\r\nI tried both, separately of course, and it did not verify with either, \r\n\r\nWhat should I do? Should  I bundle all the `./client/src/contracts/*.json` into a `./client/src/contracts/GrandMaster.json`? How do I do that? Would it work when verifying? \r\n\r\n",

I would much rather see either integration with IPFS, or even better, if `solc` had a way to spit out an input-json with the source code inlined as its output, and running solc with that single file as input (and no other files) would reproduce the build exactly\r\n\r\nI can create a separate ticket for this if desired, but I do feel like the current `--metadata` solution isn't particularly great due to swarm dependency and complications of fetching files from swarm.",
