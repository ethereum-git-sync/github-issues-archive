    "body": "I've been taking a crack at this one over the past couple of days.  It appears to be caused by the CompilerStack's parsing functions uncritically stuffing the second contract over the first; this eventually leads to the code generation of the Registrar looking for the first Deed contract and only being able to find the second one.  I added some guard code to throw a descriptive exception when the second contract would clobber the first.\n\nIt seems to work, but I wanted to check in about the library_name_clash_with_contract test.  According to the test system, the code in that test should compile just fine, and it's okay to have a library and contract named the same thing.  Is that intended to be the case?  I might be mistaken, but don't libraries get ContractDefinitions, and thus wouldn't the library clobber the contract in that case?\n",
