Expressions involving ternary operator or indexing of array literals are not evaluated at compilation time and the oversized constant cannot be detected. They're still subject to runtime overflow checks though.\r\n\r\nWe won't be addressing this directly so I'm closing the issue, but we have #3157 in the pipeline which will generally enable the compiler to evaluate more kinds of expressions at compilation time and those two cases are likely to be covered by it as well.",
