  "body": "I'm creating this issue to discuss/track adding Windows, Linux, and MacOS binaries of `solc` to [`solc-bin`](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin).\r\n\r\nWe've already talked about this in multiple places, but there was no issue to keep track of its progress. The closes thing was #3168, but that's ready so that issue is no longer relevant.\r\n\r\n## Abstract & Motivation\r\n\r\nThe reasons to do this are:\r\n\r\n1. It can be used by JS tools like truffle and buidler to improve the compilation speed.\r\n\r\n2. Tools that are not written in JS need this to simplified their required setup. Now they only work with docker or a github API key. @iamdefinitelyahuman can provide more info about this if needed.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nJust like with asm.js and wasm, binary versions for each of the major OS should be added.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nThis doesn't introduce any change to the language. \r\n\r\nTo make the effort effective all the versions in `solc-bin` should be compiled and published, except maybe nightlies.",

    "body": "Very excited about this!\r\n\r\nWith [`py-solc-x`](https://github.com/iamdefinitelyahuman/py-solc-x) I'm pulling the binaries from Github, and can confirm that it creates a headache when used in the CI.  Without an access token it almost always fails from rate limiting.  Having binaries served elsewhere will be a huge help to me.\r\n\r\nRe OSX: I wrote a [wiki article](https://github.com/iamdefinitelyahuman/py-solc-x/wiki/Installing-Solidity-on-OSX) to field the repeated questions, but I think more often than not I end up losing potential new users who hit the issue.  Especially when working on the mainnet Brownie installs many `solc` versions to locally compile source codes from Etherscan.  The delay in compiling `solc`, combined with uncertainty that it won't fail at 90%, is just too much.\r\n",

    "body": "A little update on the progress here:\r\n- Linux, MacOS and Windows binaries are now available in `solc-bin` repo. You can see the matrix of available versions in [my comment in #42](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/pull/42#issuecomment-659770086)\r\n    - We currently only have MacOS builds starting from v0.6.9 on but we're planning to build older versions and add them to `solc-bin` too.\r\n- Due to size constraints of GH pages the new binaries are not accessible via [solc-bin.ethereum.org](https://solc-bin.ethereum.org) yet. They can't  be included until we start hosting them elsewhere and switch over the domain. We're in the process of setting that up.\r\n    - By the way, please don't use the [solc-bin.github.io](https://solc-bin.github.io) domain directly. We don't control that domain so we can't transparently switch that over. We'll keep the `soljson.js` files available there not to break tools that have it hard-coded but we won't be able to make binaries for other platforms available that way.\r\n- We set up a new directory structure for the binaries, segregated by platform. The old `soljson.js` binaries are still available in `bin/` and `wasm/` but they're also symlinked under new names. Please use the new ones whenever possible.\r\n- We'd like to make the content of `solc-bin` available via IPFS as well, though not necessarily as a part of this task.",
