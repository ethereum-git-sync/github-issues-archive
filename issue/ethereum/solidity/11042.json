  "body": "## Description\r\nWhen using relative paths the error message often (but not always) shows only a relative path to the file. When using path remapping and base path together with various flavors of relative imports (see #11036) it might not be obvious where the compiler is looking for the file. I think the compiler should display the final, resolved filesystem path instead of (or in addition to) the relative one.\r\n\r\n### Example 1\r\n`/tmp/a/b/contract.sol`\r\n```solidity\r\nimport \"relative.sol\";\r\n```\r\n```bash\r\ncd /tmp/c/d/\r\nsolc /tmp/a/b/contract.sol --allow-paths .\r\n```\r\nHere the compiler will look for the file in `/tmp/c/d/relative.sol`, not `/tmp/a/b/relative.sol` as some users might (wrongly) expect. It only says `relative.sol` though:\r\n```\r\nError: Source \"relative.sol\" not found: File not found.\r\n --> /tmp/a/b/contract.sol:1:1:\r\n  |\r\n1 | import \"relative.sol\";\r\n  | ^^\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Example 2\r\n`/tmp/a/b/contract.sol`\r\n```solidity\r\nimport \"/tmp/absolute.sol\";\r\n```\r\n```bash\r\ncd /tmp/c/d/\r\nsolc /tmp/a/b/contract.sol /tmp=/contracts --base-path /home\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere the compiler says that the missing import is `/contracts/absolute.sol` but omits the fact that it prepends base path to it and actually expects the file at `/home/contracts/absolute.sol`:\r\n```\r\nError: Source \"/contracts/absolute.sol\" not found: File not found.\r\n --> /tmp/a/b/contract.sol:1:1:\r\n  |\r\n1 | import \"/tmp/absolute.sol\";\r\n  | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe fact that the base path is prepended to an absolute path is of course a bug (reported in #11036) but showing the full path would at least allow the user to realize why his code does not compile.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version: 0.8.1",
