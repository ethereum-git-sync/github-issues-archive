It's unlikely that we'll be handling `bytes32` arguments as a special case so I'm going to close this issue. Feel free to post any specific ideas in that other issue.\r\n\r\nAs for using the scratch space, we might do that in a more general way, based on the total length of the input, but then I'd consider that an implementation detail for whichever solution we implement in the end.",
