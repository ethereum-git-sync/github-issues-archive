  "body": "## Abstract\r\n\r\nConsider following struct:\r\n\r\n```sol\r\nstruct Foo {\r\n    bool val1;\r\n    bool val2;\r\n    bool val3;\r\n    bool val4;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen abiencoded value Foo(true, true, false, true) translates into `0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001`, while it could be just `1101`.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nSince gas usage is a big topic almost all big ethereum projects use tight structs packing to save caller funds. You can see it in the wild everywhere, e.g. [1Inch limit orders](https://github.com/1inch/limit-order-protocol/blob/179b4fef24bec0a043b45e5d7a4412de6cc7864c/contracts/OrderRFQMixin.sol#L23) encodes order Id and timestamp into `Order.info` or [Uniswap V3 swaps](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/contracts/UniswapV3Pool.sol#L547) encodes zeroForOne and oneForZero fees into `feeProtocol` field. There are other examples in the wild. Since it's a repeatable pattern which is kinda error-prone and dull I think it just might be worthwhile to move this to compiler and code generation.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nIntroduce new keyword `packed` that changes ABI representation and field access. It might look like:\r\n\r\n```sol\r\nstruct packed Foo {\r\n    bool val1;\r\n    bool val2;\r\n    bool val3;\r\n    bool val4;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis struct should be only 4 bytes long. When abiencoded it might look like `00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001101` or `11010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000` depending on if we want `bytes` or `uint` zeroing pattern. Compiler is responsible for generating appropriate bit shifts and masks when reading and writing fields:\r\n\r\n```sol\r\nfoo.val2 = true; // foo = foo & (1 << 1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that unlike current behavior this should affect calldata representation as well as inner storage.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nSince this proposal introduces a new keyword it doesn't change meaning for any existing code.\r\n\r\nRelated: #11691\r\n\r\n\r\n## Additional considerations\r\n\r\nIt may be also worthwhile to consider packed arrays like:\r\n\r\n```sol\r\nfunction bar(uint8[] packed calldata foo) external {\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nso it doesn't put padding zeroes between elements, but unaligned access from those might be tricky and come with surprise costs.",
