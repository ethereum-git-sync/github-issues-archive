    "body": "Thank you for linking the old issue again, @axic - I was not aware that there could be a unified solution.\r\nSo something like this could actually work - not sure if we want to make it stand out more:\r\n```\r\nfunction myNewOpcode(a, b, c) -> d, e, f = 0x1234567844\r\n```\r\nIt essentially say that it takes three items from the stack and puts three items on the stack. It promises that the stack underneath is unmodified, but that cannot be checked by the compiler (since it has no concept of the meaning of the opcodes represented by the byte values). Such an opcode is assumed to have worst side-effects and the sequence of bytes should not be touched by any stage of the assembly-items based optimizer. Any call to such a function arranges the stack such that the arguments copied to the top and then inserts the byte sequence.\r\n\r\nAnother option, if we do not want to modify the syntax of yul is to use a builtin:\r\n```\r\nlet d, e := verbatim(2, 0x1234567844, a, b, c)\r\n```\r\nThe first parameter is the number of stack slots returned, then there is a hex sequence of actual code emitted, followed by a variable number of input arguments.",

    "body": "As a crazy proposal: yul is supposed to be a universal assembly language and all - what about having a generic mechanism for producing bytecode in yul similar to let's say contract creation? E.g.\r\n```\r\nopcode nameOfOpcode(a, b) -> c {\r\n  mstore(0, 0xE0)\r\n  return(0, 1)\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWould introduce an opcode 0xE0 expected to take two arguments and return one.\r\n\r\nWe'd then just interpret this as yul reading the bytecode to be generated from returndata...\r\nIt could even have a mechanism to supply some typed literal arguments that can be read from simulated calldata, or something like that - or alternatively special builtins for reading literals and outputting bytecode from within an ``opcode ...`` definition...\r\n\r\nFor example\r\n```\r\nopcode newOpcode(a:literalUint256, b, c) -> c {\r\n  if gt(a, 7) {\r\n    raise(\"Invalid argument to newOpcode\")\r\n    // or revert with a message instead or sth\r\n  }\r\n  emitBytecode(add(0xE0, a))\r\n}\r\n```\r\nHaving ``let result := newOpcode(1, a, b)`` with two arguments on stack yielding one return value on stack with opcode 0xE1?\r\n\r\nIn fact a special case of this could be ``verbatim``:\r\n\r\n```\r\nopcode verbatim(x:literalString) {\r\n  let v := literalSize(x)\r\n  for { let i := 0 } lt(i, v) { i := add(i, 1) } {\r\n    let x := and(literalValue(x, i), 0xFF)\r\n    emitBytecode(x)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nEDIT: maybe we could even have it specify it's side-effects actually... like ``invalidateMemory()``, etc....",

    "body": "I'm still not fully clear how this functionality would help Optimism, @ben-chain if you could explain? My understanding is that Optimism replaces state access opcodes with a call to the manager (which equals to the sender), e.g. `balance` would be replaced with `call(sender(), ..., <encoded query>)`.\r\n\r\nThe way this is accomplished is by changing the codegen of Solidity. How would a functionality like `literbytecode` help here? Isn't the better solution just using what the `--ir` emits? Couldn't one just replace calls like `balance` with `call()` and run the resulting yul file via the assembler? The `--experimental-via-ir` feature does the very same thing, gets the output of `--ir` and passes it to the assembler.",

The way this is currently done is that the validator only allows a certain sequence of bytes to violate pureness (the one that calls the manager).

    "body": "Thanks you guys for opening this!  This is a super important feature for us to have.  \r\n\r\n@chriseth is correct that the difficulty comes from requiring on-chain enforcement that bytecode conforms to this manager interface.  It is straightforward enough to modify the Yul IR to call out to the manager, but we must also enforce that contracts are *only* accessing stateful opcodes to query the manager contract.  We allow two rules:\r\n1. The contract is permitted to call the identity precompile.\r\n2. The contract is permitted to call the `msg.sender`, but if that results in an exception, the contract must also revert with the same data.\r\n[Here](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/contracts-v2/blob/13b7deef60f773241723ea874fc6e81b4003b164/contracts/optimistic-ethereum/OVM/execution/OVM_SafetyChecker.sol#L123-L130) is the core logic which checks the bytecode follows those rules. \r\n\r\nFor gas performance reasons, enforcing these rules requires specific literals in the code, and the `CALLER` opcode is always used to indicate the start of one of the literals.  (This is why you will see `CALLER POP` in the identity precompile case.  This is already a problem for us; getting the optimizer to play nice with this required disabling peephole optimization if the op is `CALLER`, but we only really need to avoid if it is within this literal).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the safety check is much harder if the logic is position dependent.  To get around this, we use `PC` to make the literal be position independent.  This introduces further complexity--the compiler/optimizer really doesn't like unlabelled jumpdests.  Currently, I define a different literal which the optimizer doesn't touch, but is the same length and causes the same stack difference, and then find-and-replace in the raw bytecode once compilation is complete.  Not pretty!\r\n\r\nSo @axic I think your confusion comes from two layers that are going on here.  There's the part in the compiler of generating the right calldata to the manager, which can and should be handled by modifying the Yul IR.  Separately, the reason we need this feature is to enforce that the calldata payload is delivered following the above logic and post-call behavior.\r\n\r\nHope that makes sense!",

In that sense @ekpyron's proposal is much better.\r\n\r\nWell, more flexible definitely, but also orders of magnitude more complicated, of course. (Especially since it's pretty much impossible to make the optimizer aware of the opcodes that way, so whatever is generated would have to be annotated explicitly... not to speak of having to define a dialect and execution schema for it, pulling in the interpreter to production code, etc., etc. - if the simpler approach is enough, maybe more than it is overkill.)",

I mean with the generative approach I had before one could even generate jumpdests and jumps with fixed offsets referring to those jumpdests within the verbatim block, since one could just make the base offset at which the opcodes will be generated available as a builtin in the generating code... but I didn't bring that approach up in the call again myself, because I myself think it's most probably overkill and a huge effort in comparison, so there'd need to be very good reasons to go for anything in that direction.\r\n\r\n",
