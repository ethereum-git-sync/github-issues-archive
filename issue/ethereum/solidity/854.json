    "body": "I can do a pass on the CMake files, just like I already did for cpp-ethereum at https://github.com/bobsummerwill/cpp-ethereum/pull/2.\n\nHaving gone through that process once, I can do it again much quicker for Solidity, which has many fewer modules.\n\nThe easiest approach is likely just to plop everything into `libsolidity`, yes.\n\nAside - I honestly think that the same kind of consolidation makes sense in cpp-ethereum too - ie. just blob everything together into libethereum.     You can still have sub-structure within folders, but the actual separate `.so` files really add no value, IMHO.\n\nIf we were actually having optional modules for optional features with runtime dynamic library loading with some plugin mechanism, it would be a different story.\n\nAnother consideration here is that because we are (intentionally) not providing any published C++ API, the innards of these repositories can be refactored at will.     We just need to make them as simple as they can be, for ease of work and iteration.\n\nIf at some future point we add published C++ APIs then that is when we need to consider fine-grained `.so` boundaries again.    For now it's just \"you're never gonna need it\" premature, IMHO.\n",
