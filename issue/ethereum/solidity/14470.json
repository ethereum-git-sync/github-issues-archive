  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nWhen compiling Yul, setting `enabled: false` and even `yul: false` seems to leave on a lot of optimizations.  Moreover, setting `yul: false` prohibits setting `yulDetails`; this means that to get code that isn't substantially optimized, you actually have to set `yul: true` so you can go into `yulDetails` and turn things off!\r\n\r\nI'm a bit unsure how much this is a bug and how much this is intentional, but it didn't seem right to me (the part about having to set `yul: true` in particular strikes me as perverse), so I thought I'd file an issue.  Thanks!\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version: 0.8.21\r\n- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): default\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nFor what it's worth, the test contract I was trying this with was\r\n\r\n```yul\r\nobject \"YulTest\" {\r\n  code {\r\n    let size := datasize(\"runtime\")\r\n    datacopy(0, dataoffset(\"runtime\"), size)\r\n    return(0, size)\r\n  }\r\n  object \"runtime\" {\r\n    code {\r\n      let a := 1\r\n      let b := 2\r\n      b := add(b,a)\r\n      mstore(0, add(b, a))\r\n      return(0, 0x20)\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n(Well, that, and quite a few variants on it.)  The code above got substantially rewritten even with `enabled: false` and `yul: false`, as mentioned above!  I had to set `yul: true` and go turn things off in `yulDetails` to get something that worked the way I wrote it above...",
