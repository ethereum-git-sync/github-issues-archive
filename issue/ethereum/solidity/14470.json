  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nWhen compiling Yul, setting `enabled: false` and even `yul: false` seems to leave on a lot of optimizations.  Moreover, setting `yul: false` prohibits setting `yulDetails`; this means that to get code that isn't substantially optimized, you actually have to set `yul: true` so you can go into `yulDetails` and turn things off!\r\n\r\nI'm a bit unsure how much this is a bug and how much this is intentional, but it didn't seem right to me (the part about having to set `yul: true` in particular strikes me as perverse), so I thought I'd file an issue.  Thanks!\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version: 0.8.21\r\n- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): default\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nFor what it's worth, the test contract I was trying this with was\r\n\r\n```yul\r\nobject \"YulTest\" {\r\n  code {\r\n    let size := datasize(\"runtime\")\r\n    datacopy(0, dataoffset(\"runtime\"), size)\r\n    return(0, size)\r\n  }\r\n  object \"runtime\" {\r\n    code {\r\n      let a := 1\r\n      let b := 2\r\n      b := add(b,a)\r\n      mstore(0, add(b, a))\r\n      return(0, 0x20)\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n(Well, that, and quite a few variants on it.)  The code above got substantially rewritten even with `enabled: false` and `yul: false`, as mentioned above!  I had to set `yul: true` and go turn things off in `yulDetails` to get something that worked the way I wrote it above...",

Are they causing any issues for you?\r\n\r\nI'd be open to allowing a more intuitive and user-friendly way to disable those optimizations, but the idea was that the default settings should produce compiler output that's fine to consume for tooling and that the need to disable them should not arise.

    "body": "Yeah, it could be that it's actually interfering with what you're trying to do, but it's also possible that it just seems more \"rewritten\" than it actually is. The only optimizer step we run with `yul: false` is [`UnusedPruner`](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/internals/optimizer.html#unused-pruner). All it does is remove unreferenced functions, unreferenced variables and movable expression statements. So I wonder it's just the case of the diff looking horrible while the non-removed bits are actually intact.\r\n\r\nAnd additional factor making it look worse might be that now the `--ir` output is always reformatted just like `--ir-optimized` is. It might even reorder functions compared to how it was before (though I'm not not 100% sure about that). That's the consequence of the Yul stack being always on. Even if no optimization is performed, the Yul code is still reparsed after code generation and only then printed to the output.",

    "body": "Hm, interesting.  Yes to be clear, I was only looking at the final result (EVM directly).  Or rather -- I wasn't really looking at the bytecode directly.  Rather, when I say \"too much optimization\", what I really mean is, variables aren't being placed in predictable places / aren't sticking in one place.  It sounds like this may be a matter of the `stackAllocation` setting?\r\n\r\nI mean of course this report is all coming from my point of view as the maintainer of Truffle Debugger.  Basically I figured that, the debugger does fine detecting Yul variables when used inside Solidity assembly with optimization turned off; how come when I compile straight Yul, I seemingly get more optimization that completely throws it off?  I guess this is because compiling straight Yul is using the IR pipeline that uses things like the `stackAllocation` setting?\r\n\r\nThis is why I wasn't really sure there's a bug here.  After all -- it's not a bug if Solidity, or Yul, or anything, places its variables in ways we can't predict or locate.  It's our job to locate the variables, not your job to make them locatable!  So if all this is intentional, there's no bug, just one more thing we have to figure out how to deal with.  But, due to the differences I was seeing between Yul inside Solidity assembly and Yul straight, I thought there might be a chance that this was actually a bug, and that it wasn't supposed to be doing this much with optimization turned off.  Sounds like probably that's not the case, though?\r\n\r\nI should probably come back later and post an actual concrete example, but yeah, hopefully this clarifies what I was talking about.",
