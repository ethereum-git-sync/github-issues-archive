The contract? If so, how about this:\r\n\r\n`function`: an `address`, usually the contract, cast to `bytes20` followed by a function selector (`bytes4`, see \"Function Selector and Argument Encoding\"). The two are concatenated in order into a `bytes24` function type.\r\n\r\n\"Function Selector and Argument Encoding\" should be a link.",
