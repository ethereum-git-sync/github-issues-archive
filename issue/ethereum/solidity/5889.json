I am giving this a try right now.",

You can disable it until they support bionic, and in the meantime we use launchpad to build and release.\r\n\r\nAnother important thing is that we missed a beat, 0.5.3 didn't get into the snap store. We should leave this new bionic-based package for a while anyway, so more people get a chance to test it. I think it would be better to just wait and do the next stable snap release with 0.5.4.",
