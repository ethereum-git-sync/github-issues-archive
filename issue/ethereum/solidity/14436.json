These links are currently not bringing the user to the correct page position.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n_Issue unrelated to Solidity compiler_, but is present on the docs website as of version v0.8.21.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Go to https://docs.soliditylang.org\r\n2. Click \"Solidity by Example\" in left menu near top\r\n3. Click on \"Blind Auction\"\r\n4. Notice the URL now contains \"#blind-auction\" but the page has not scrolled to this section.\r\n5. Click \"Blind Auction\" one more time\r\n6. Notice that only now does the window scroll to the intended position.\r\n\r\n## Additional info\r\n\r\nRoot cause is known, patch in progress",
