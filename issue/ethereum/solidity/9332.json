I think this is a good idea, but we should not stop at only that number.\r\n\r\nIn essence, we have code, sub-objects (runtime code of the current contract or creation code of created contracts), data and metadata. This structure also matches what we have when we compile Yul objects, so I think a common data format can be found here.\r\n\r\nProposal:\r\n\r\nExport an array of sections, each section is a json object of the following form:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  start: x, // bytes\r\n  length: n, // bytes\r\n  kind: 'code' / 'data' / 'object' / 'deployObject' / 'metadata',\r\n  name: 'factory.sol:Factory'\r\n]\r\n```\r\n",
