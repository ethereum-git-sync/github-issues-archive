  "body": "The gas estimate feature is nice, but it can quickly become useless if there are functions for which the compiler cannot estimate gas.  For example, calling another contract.  While in a strict sense, it's true that the amount is unknown, it would be nice to allow the developer to annotate a method with some empirically determined estimate/hint.  In cases where the gas estimator cannot estimate gas, it can fallback on the hint.  \r\n\r\nEstimates that we computed using one or more hints should probably indicate that they may be less reliable that other estimates.",
