However, there are some use cases, like factory contracts, which use bytecode coming from function calldata.\r\nCurrently we need to use assembly to achieve this:\r\n```solidity\r\nassembly {\r\n    createdContract := create2(0, add(_initCode, 0x20), mload(_initCode), _salt)\r\n} \r\n```\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n```solidity\r\n    function deploy(bytes memory _initCode, bytes32 _salt)\r\n        public\r\n        returns (address payable createdContract)\r\n    {\r\n        createdContract = new type.Contract{salt: _salt}(_initCode)\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nNo issues",
