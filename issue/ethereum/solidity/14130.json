We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.\r\n- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:\r\n    - [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)\r\n    - [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)\r\n- Ensure the issue isn't already reported (check `feature` and `language design` labels).\r\n- If you feel uncertain about your feature request, perhaps it's better to open a language design or feedback forum thread via the issue selector, or by going to the forum directly.\r\n    - [Solidity forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org/)\r\n\r\n*Delete the above section and the instructions in the sections below before submitting*\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Abstract\r\n\r\nI saw the examples codes like auctions, voting smart contracts provides in the code base. I will like to add one more example code to it namely lottery game smart contract.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nReason to add this example smart contract is to show use of global variables and show automation in smart contracts, Additionally, lottery smart contract will give insights on creating random numbers in solidity, registering users and fund allocation.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
