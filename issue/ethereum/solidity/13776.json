Similarly to T.isSigned we could have something like T.toUnsignedType (aka C++ has), if we wanted to do type conversion at the end of abs.\n\nShould we have more type inspection capabilities, we could introduce further restrictions on what types are accepted, such as isIntegral, isFixedPoint, etc. However even the above version would be sufficient to be used with int/uint/fixed types, while others would just throw a compile time error for invalid comparison operator.\n\nAnother questions springs to mind: what about variadic functions? min could be nice with variadic number of arguments, though that is something we may not actually want.\n\n### Out of scope\n\n- TBD\n\n---\n### Resources\n\n1.
