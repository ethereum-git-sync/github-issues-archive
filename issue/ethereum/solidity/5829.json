However, a build failure there is perhaps too late.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to add/modify a CI job in solidity such that the libFuzzer test harnesses are built alongside and any build errors stall potential PR merges.\r\n\r\nBy adding libFuzzer specific build steps to a CI job, we can also support regression testing against fuzzer-generated test inputs on a regular basis.",
