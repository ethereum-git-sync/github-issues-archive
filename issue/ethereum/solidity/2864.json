  "body": "I think with the JSON I/O specification we could consider our interface quite stable and could consider making it public (it is already public as an emscripten binary) in terms of a statically linked shared library on Linux similarly to the static build based on Alpine.\r\n\r\nFor that I'd propose to:\r\n- rename `soljson` / `jsonCompiler` to `libsolc`\r\n- create three public methods: `solcLicense`, `solcVersion`, `solcCompile` (aka. `license`, `version`, `compileStandard` currently)\r\n- retire the obsolete method in the future (`license`, `version`, `compileJSON`, `compileJSONMulti`, `compileJSONCallback` and `compileStandard`) \r\n- build `libsolc` as a statically linked shared library so that the only symbols it exposes are those three and doesn't import anything\r\n- include `libsolc` in `make install` and the releases\r\n\r\n@chriseth @chfast what do you think?",
