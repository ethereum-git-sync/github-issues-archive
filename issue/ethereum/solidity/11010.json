  "body": "Currently the compiler has a setting for \"evm version\" (introduced in #1117). This setting is basically tied to the Ethereum mainnet hard forks, i.e. `homestead`, `byzantium`, `istanbul`, etc.\r\n\r\nCurrently each of these options set a bunch of underlying settings (see libsolutil/EVMVersion):\r\n```\r\n        /// Has the RETURNDATACOPY and RETURNDATASIZE opcodes.\r\n        bool supportsReturndata() const { return *this >= byzantium(); }\r\n        bool hasStaticCall() const { return *this >= byzantium(); }\r\n        bool hasBitwiseShifting() const { return *this >= constantinople(); }\r\n        bool hasCreate2() const { return *this >= constantinople(); }\r\n        bool hasExtCodeHash() const { return *this >= constantinople(); }\r\n        bool hasChainID() const { return *this >= istanbul(); }\r\n        bool hasSelfBalance() const { return *this >= istanbul(); }\r\n        /// Whether we have to retain the costs for the call opcode itself (false),\r\n        /// or whether we can just forward easily all remaining gas (true).\r\n        bool canOverchargeGasForCall() const { return *this >= tangerineWhistle(); }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdditionally it controls the \"code size too big\" warning enabled since `spuriousDragon`.\r\n\r\nSince custom EVM versions and custom chains come up as a question/discussion once a year, perhaps for the long term we could consider exposing these underlying settings via standard json.\r\n\r\nOne way I could think is that the `evmVersion` setting would set the baseline, and modifying any specific setting would override that. The other option is to introduce a new `evmVersion` called \"custom\" and require an explicit value for each of the settings listed above.\r\n\r\nThis of course does not solve the problem of supporting new features, but allows fine tuning for custom chains. It is unclear however if this would be entirely beneficial for them.",
