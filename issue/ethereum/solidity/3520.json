    "body": "I can understand @axic's concern about visually hiding declarations. And I also agree with @axic, that we should think about whether we should allow multiple variable declarations on the same line in general, if we choose to allow it when assigning.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat about ``(uint, uint, uint) (a,b,c) = f()``? I'm not sure about it myself, but it would be closer to the old ``var`` syntax and make it at least somewhat clearer that a declaration has taken place. Again, declarations without assignment should be considered as well, though.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne should probably also consider #3314 and whether e.g. ``(uint ,_ , uint) (a,_,c) = f()`` or ``(uint,,uint) (a,,c) = f()`` will be acceptable (I'd suggest to disallow them, but to allow ``(uint, uint, uint) (a,,b) = ...``, resp. ``(uint, uint, uint) (a,_,b) = ...``).\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother general consideration from a language design perspective would be: do tuple expressions have a type? As far as I can see, currently there is no tuple type in the grammar (although there's ``TupleType`` in ``Types.h``) - however, tuples can still be returned and assigned, making it hard to conceptualize the types in statements like ``return (0,0);`` or ``(a,b) = (0,1);``\r\n\r\nSo should tuples maybe be a full-fledged kind of type in general? ``(uint, uint, uint)`` would then be a tuple type and could be used in variable declarations as well as in assignments. One could still impose the restriction that expressions of the tuple type cannot be bound to a single variable name, as in ``(uint, uint, uint) t;``, since otherwise one would also have to introduce some means to access tuple elements (on the other hand doing so may not be the worst of ideas). However, even if one only allows tuples to be bound to several variables in tuple expressions such as ``(a,b,c)``, this would still mean that one should at least allow a declaration like ``(uint, uint, uint) (a,b,c);`` in this case.",
