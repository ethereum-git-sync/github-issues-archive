  "body": "With more complex applications being built with Solidity, the need for more flexibility in how contracts are created arises and will over time become pressing.\r\nCurrently the only way to have a contract C create a new contract N1is to either include all of N1's bytecode in C, or to copy an already deployed contract N0. In both cases, the entirety of the contract is copied.\r\nA problem emerges when there exist _independent_ variations on N (called Na, Nb, ...) which are to be combined into one contract Nabc...\r\nThis means that every version of N has to be provided to C as a whole, resulting in a combinatorial explosion of the amount of bytecode that has to be deployed, once for each combination of these variations, leading to exponentially growing deployment costs.\r\nThere are two possible solutions to this:  \r\n\r\nDispatcher contract\r\n---\r\nA naive solution might use a dispatcher contract D and 'libraries' (not the current Solidity kind) La, Lb, ... , repeatedly calling on the D to (delegate)call a function from another library Lx.\r\nThe problems with this are threefold:\r\n\r\n1. Call instructions themselves cost considerable amounts of gas.\r\n2. There is no cross-library optimization performable on the number of SSLOAD and SSTORE instructions, leading to massively higher gas costs.\r\n3. delegatecall does not make return values easily accessible, which vastly complicates the usage.\r\n\r\nThese problems might be fixed by allowing internal calls into other contracts, such that all relevant information is loaded to memory once by D, operated on by the Lx (which jumps are performed to / between), and then stored again by D.\r\nHowever, this would require a **change to the EVM**, which is why I propose the solution below.\r\n\r\nDynamic Inheritance\r\n---\r\nThe alternative is to create new contracts N1 not just from one other N0 , but to allow creating it from more than one by combining for example Na and Nb into Nab, also known as dynamic inheritance or runtime inheritance.\r\n\r\nHere, all relevant Lx would be copied together into the new contract N1. This requires the patching of jump locations, for which the bytecode is generated by the compiler.\r\nSimilarly to the solution proposed above, the relevant storage values would only be loaded / stored once.\r\n\r\nWith a small backwards-compatible extension to the ABI it might even be possible to allow inheritance from Lx not compiled together with the deploying contracts.\r\nThis would be achieved by including a list of internal functions and the storage locations they access, allowing the patching of the instructions for these accesses to instructions for accessing memory.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, this only requires a **change to Solidity**.  \r\n\r\n---\r\n(Using mega-contracts that include all of the possibly needed variations Nabc... is both terrible for extensibility and not viable under the current block gas limit.)\r\n\r\nThanks for reading and consideration, I'm interested what you think about this idea. Feel free to correct me if I got anything wrong.",

    "body": "Solidity could propose a convention on use of `delegatecall' for the end use of dynamic inheritance. \r\nI think is a fair use case of solidity, specially if you are writing a contract intended to be a user account contract, which a requirement might be either upgrade-ability or extend-ability.\r\n\r\nI agree that this is too high complexity for the compiler, however the design of language should consider the use of delegatecall. For example, better documentation on how the storage layout is written, a solidity implementation for `exit-return`, useful for attaching views from a delegatecall. \r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n            bytes memory returnData;\r\n            bool success;\r\n            (success, returnData) = _target.delegatecall(msg.data);\r\n            require(success, \"Delegated Call failed\"); \r\n\r\n            //exit-return delegatecall returnData\r\n            assembly {\r\n                return(add(returnData, 0x20), returnData) \r\n            }\r\n```",
