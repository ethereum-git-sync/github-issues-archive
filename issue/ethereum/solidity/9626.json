I don't think this can be done perfectly, but in a situation like\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  let x := 0\r\n  // a lot of variables\r\n  let _1 := 0x20\r\n  sstore(0, mload(_1))\r\n  // last use of the lot of variables - so they could be popped if not for ``_1``\r\n  sstore(2, x) // x may be unreachable because of this.\r\n  sstore(1, mload(_1))\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be much better not to have CSE unify ``_1`` and keep it at\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  let x := 0\r\n  // a lot of variables\r\n  sstore(0, mload(0x20))\r\n  // last use of the lot of variables - so they *will* be popped afterwards\r\n  sstore(2, x) // x is now reachable\r\n  sstore(1, mload(0x20))\r\n}\r\n```",
