  "body": "<!--## Prerequisites\r\n\r\n- First, many thanks for taking part in the community. We really appreciate that.\r\n- We realize there is a lot of information requested here. We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.\r\n- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:\r\n\t- [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)\r\n\t- [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)\r\n- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.\r\n- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\n<!--Please shortly describe the bug you have found, and what you expect instead.-->\r\n\r\nThe `solc` v0.5.11 that has been distributed widely does not appear to be the same version that is defined on the [solc-bin list.txt](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/blob/gh-pages/bin/list.txt) \r\n\r\nThe snap distribution and the docker image both appear to be running `0.5.11+commit.22be8592`, while the canonical version of `0.5.11` appears to be `0.5.11+commit.c082d0b4`\r\n\r\nThe [ReadTheDocs versions page](https://readthedocs.org/projects/solidity/versions/) also seems to be based on `22be8592`\r\n\r\nThis discrepancy can become a problem because programmatic [etherscan contract verification via the api](https://etherscan.io/apis#contracts) relies on a compiler string matching one of the [entries](https://etherscan.io/solcversions) on the `solc-bin/bin/list.txt` source. A contract compiled on the command line using one of the distributed binaries version output would not match a compatible version and fail verification. \r\n\r\nI also noticed a similar discrepancy with `v0.5.9` and a few earlier versions. `v0.5.12 (7709ece9)` and `v0.5.10 (5a6ea5b1)` match as expected.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version: v0.5.11, v0.5.9, others\r\n- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): N/A\r\n- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): N/A\r\n- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: N/A\r\n- Operating system: Linux/OSX\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease provide a *minimal* source code example to trigger the bug you have found.\r\nPlease also mention any command line flags that are necessary for triggering the bug.\r\nProvide as much information as necessary to reproduce the bug.\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n// Some *minimal* Solidity source code to reproduce the bug.\r\n// ...\r\n```\r\n-->\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ snap run solc --version\r\nsolc, the solidity compiler commandline interface\r\nVersion: 0.5.11+commit.22be8592.Linux.g++\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ docker run ethereum/solc:0.5.11 --version\r\nsolc, the solidity compiler commandline interface\r\nVersion: 0.5.11+commit.22be8592.Linux.g++\r\n```\r\n\r\nCompare with [list.txt](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/blob/gh-pages/bin/list.txt#L32) entry.\r\n",

    "body": "FWIW, only the binary output needs to match to do source verification, since the service regenerates the artifacts on the other end from the source and compares the bin with the contract code on-chain. In this case, I was able to verify a contract compiled with `0.5.11+commit.22be8592` using solc.js `0.5.11+commit.c082d0b4`, probably because of the difference only being in the build scripts, but in the case of other compiler tag mismatches the bin may not match. \r\n\r\nWe're trying to programatically verify on this end though by stripping the platform and sending the version off that way, etherscan bases their list of [supported compilers](https://etherscan.io/solcversions) on the js versions though.",

    "body": "### 0.4.15, 0.5.9 and 0.5.11\r\nFor the first part, here's a PR that adds the binaries built on different commits to solc-bin: https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/pull/57\r\n\r\n### 0.2.0, 0.2.1 and 0.4.11\r\nFor the second, I have edited the releases ([0.2.0](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.2.0), [0.2.1](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.2.1), [0.4.11](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.4.11)) to remove the old `soljson.js` files and add the ones from `solc-bin`.\r\n\r\nBy the way, in 0.2.0 and 0.2.1 the file name included also the date and commit hash, now they're all `soljson.js` like in newer releases; this is not consistent between releases anyway.\r\n\r\n#### Original files\r\nIn case we ever need them (or want to roll back this change), here are the original files: [original-0.2.0-0.2.1-0.4.11-releases.zip](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/files/5327663/original-0.2.0-0.2.1-0.4.11-releases.zip)\r\n\r\nAnd their hashes (both old and new):\r\n| Version | keccak256 (github)                                                   | keccak256 (solc-bin)                                                 |\r\n|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| 0.2.0   | `0x75c4aec16b19b148720cc889dec60f639bf5b31b5456bede69c7756d74f35804` | `0x7d8ea0312905d250ec7554bd84526c3d97d05f6d5748888e6ec00629bd3ea7a6` |\r\n| 0.2.1   | `0x8f5a019f1aeda91cbcb20ddd512253a66babb63450c07e53d907c923d5059148` | `0x7067e5792a88111c06a7078a23358641a64d0fa273b5220bfa5212029352dbe9` |\r\n| 0.4.11  | `0xae353b2d1da5ec2acb1bb54c35cf06bb2312d8f69f527f183d5b980d7afcb67a` | `0xde17e284da94d3d600c1096f05d83af794eef746d2aba2e4e066e3d3efce7abf` |\r\n\r\n#### Versions reported by replaced files\r\nJust in case I also used `solc-js` to check what the executables actually report as version:\r\n| Version           | Output from `version()` |\r\n|-------------------|-------------------------|\r\n| 0.2.0 (github)    | `0.2.0-4dc2445e/.-Emscripten/clang/int linked to libethereum-1.1.0-c9886e9e/.-Emscripten/clang/int` \r\n| 0.2.0 (solc-bin)  | `0.2.0-4dc2445e/.-Emscripten/clang/int linked to libethereum-1.1.0-34716679/.-Emscripten/clang/int` \r\n| 0.2.1 (github)    | `0.2.1-91a6b35f/.-Emscripten/clang/int linked to libethereum-`\r\n| 0.2.1 (solc-bin)  | `0.2.1-91a6b35f/.-Emscripten/clang/int linked to libethereum-`\r\n| 0.4.11 (github)   | `0.4.11-nightly.2017.5.3+commit.68ef5810.Emscripten.clang`\r\n| 0.4.11 (solc-bin) | `0.4.11+commit.68ef5810.Emscripten.clang`\r\n\r\nSo it looks like 0.4.11 is a nightly built from the tagged release commit, just like 0.4.15 for windows (#9545).\r\nI checked `soljson.js` from 0.4.12 and 0.4.15 just in case but they all identify as release builds so (hopefully) those are just some individual cases.\r\n\r\nThe other two seem to have been built with `libethereum` checked out at a different commit.",
