  "body": "Currently the `type` in the ABI refers purely to the *encoding type* (which is specific and defined in the ABI).\r\n\r\nIt could be useful to show a higher level type how the data can be interpreted. For example `structs` and `tuples` can both be encoded as `tuples` (and they do not need a different low level encoding), but their high level interpretation might differ (for one, `structs` will have named components, while `tuples` wont).\r\n\r\nAnother good example is function types are encoded as `bytes24` but could benefit from a specific interpretation if the application desires.\r\n\r\nPropose to extend the ABI with a new field `annotatedType` next to `type`.",
