So I'm bound to asynchronous, topic based media (issue-tracker, email etc.).\r\n\r\nI have just two or three questions:\r\n\r\n* The documentation in the header-files is used to produce docs? Where can I find info on this?\r\n* where can i find more info about the deprecation? \r\n\r\n\r\n(And please: don't tell anyone that I oversaw the docs in the header-files. I guess I was for far too long within JS and java code)\r\n",

I usually much prefer seeing documentation and code in the same place because they often complement each other and it is easy to jump to definitions using a proper IDE. Standalone documentation is only useful if the documentation is a full specification, which only makes sense for standardized libraries in my opinion.\r\n\r\nThe function is in deprecation because all of the code generator is in deprecation - this is not specifically documented anywhere, though, except via our regular planning meetings.",
