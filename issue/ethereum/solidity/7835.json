  "body": "## Abstract\r\n\r\nWith https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7534, we introduced a (partially) breaking change: the developer documentation of a function must contain a `@return` tag for every named return parameter and define the parameter name as the first word after the tag. Compiling without `--devdoc` is still fine, but requesting it, leads to an Internal Compiler Error.\r\n\r\nWe should generate proper parser errors in the analyzation phase of a NatSpec string.\r\n\r\nThis will require some changes to the AST, since documentation needs to become an ASTNode such that it can provide source locations and, in a subsequent step, even every tag as an individual ASTNode which we can pinpoint to in case of an error.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nConsider the following contract in a file called `Test.sol`\r\n```\r\npragma solidity ^0.6.0;\r\n\r\nabstract contract C {\r\n    /// @dev Some nice documentation\r\n    /// @return A value\r\n    function test() public returns (uint value);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nCompiling it with `solc Test.sol` will succeed. Requesting the developer documentation using `solc --devdoc` will result in an Internal Compiler Error because `/// @return A value` does not contain the name of the return parameter as the first word after the tag.\r\n\r\nAlso, our source upgrade tool (`solidity-upgrade`), that is currently in development, will profit from source locations, because it would be also able to upgrade documentation then.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\n- [x] A minimal solution for the 0.6.0 release could be the generation of a `DocStringError` without source location. That would at least make the change a consistently breaking one  --> https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7837\r\n\r\n- [x] The next step could be the introduction of a `DocString` node to the AST, and the `Documented` class having a pointer to it (instead of `ASTString`) --> https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7834\r\n\r\n- [ ] After the AST node was introduced, report source locations at least for every single or multiline comment, spanning over the whole documentation string -> https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8221\r\n\r\n- [ ] In order to report errors and their source location correctly, an additional AST node for every tag is needed.",

    "body": "I think we need to discuss the last point: \"In order to report errors and their source location correctly, an additional AST node for every tag is needed.\"\r\n\r\nI did some hacking on that and realized a few things that might need more work than initially thought:\r\n- The `DocStringParser` would need to create nodes, but doesn't have the full documentation string.\r\nComment literals `///`, `/* */` etc. are filtered by the scanner before and thus the `DocStringParser` cannot properly compute the offset from the actual tag to the beginning of the documentation string.\r\n-  The above would probably require proper tokenization of documentation strings in order to report the correct, \"inner\" source location of tags.\r\n- Both would need a solution which needs a good chunk of code to be rewritten (enhance scanner and parser and throw away `DocStringParser`)\r\n\r\nSo I would propose to post-pone the last step and at least report the location of the full documentation string in which the error occured. This will be done with: #8221.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have further thoughts or opinions?",
