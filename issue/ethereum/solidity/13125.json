    "body": "The current concept of the compiler is to *not* optimize on the Solidity level at all, but have a very simple and foolproof translation to Yul, and then optimize on the Yul representation (for which we have data flow analysis, which is much simpler on Yul, since the language is much more restricted). That's a good strategy most of the time - however, since Yul looses a lot of the type structure and lifetime information, it also makes things trickier, especially for memory optimizations. That's what the issues I linked are about - either transfer sufficiently much information from a Solidity-based analysis to Yul, or to add more structure to Yul to make such optimizations possible on the Yul level. So long story short: this is on the agenda; there are multiple ways to go about it; it may take a while - but eventually we'll have it and then we can be more relaxed about changing the language in ways that currently may still be wasteful lacking such optimizations.",
