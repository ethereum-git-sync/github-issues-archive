See https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/blob/48f321e93939354788fa7a0e1e41c5843b069ad5/infra/base-images/base-clang/checkout_build_install_llvm.sh#L44-L47\r\n\r\nSince ossfuzz build failures are reported rather late, it would be nice to have a solidity CI that uses this or perhaps the latest stable clang version to build solidity.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\n@ekpyron mentioned that\r\n\r\n> The static z3 lib in our docker image is incompatible, though, so we could either disable Z3 for that run or we'd need a separate CI docker image with a shared z3 lib for it...\r\nSplitting into one gcc and one clang docker image might generally make sense, though, since they will probably both be smaller and therefore faster to extract...\r\n\r\nso one approach would be to create a new clang specific docker image.
