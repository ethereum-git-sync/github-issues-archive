This way, the caller expects (and uses) an exact amount of memory (it is also slightly cheaper than `returndatacopy(memptr, returndatasize())`, but this cost saving is marginal)\r\n3. handling a function with dynamic return (e.g. `returns ( string memory)`) is more complex. This would probably require a language change, to signal the max expected size\r\n\r\n## try/catch blocks\r\nThe same rules apply to:\r\n```\r\n    try methodCall() { }\r\n    catch {\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n",
