  "body": "## Abstract\r\n\r\nThe Solidity compiler (solc) ignores the `--optimize-runs` parameter in Yul mode in favor of a list of Yul-specific optimizations. However, the default Yul optimizer list does not include runs-based optimizations that can improve gas efficiency, most notably for high numbers of expected runs.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nIt seems that some, if not all, of the optimizations done on Solidity contracts expecting a high number of runs are not included when compiling for Yul, so those using `solc` to compile Yul contracts aimed at high run counts are penalized.\r\n\r\nRemix has a \"Runs\" field for Yul contracts and is able to apply these optimizations. Here is one example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nobject \"RunsTest1\" {\r\n    code {\r\n        // Deploy the contract\r\n        datacopy(0, dataoffset(\"Runtime\"), datasize(\"Runtime\"))\r\n        return(0, datasize(\"Runtime\"))\r\n    }\r\n    object \"Runtime\" {\r\n        code {\r\n            let funcSel := shl(224, 0xabc12345)\r\n            mstore(0, funcSel)\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen compiled with Runs = 1 in Remix, the output becomes\r\n```\r\n600b80600e600039806000f350fe63abc1234560e01b600052\r\nPUSH1 0xB DUP1 PUSH1 0xE PUSH1 0x0 CODECOPY DUP1 PUSH1 0x0 RETURN POP INVALID PUSH4 0xABC12345 PUSH1 0xE0 SHL PUSH1 0x0 MSTORE\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen compiled with Runs = 100000 in Remix, the \"PUSH4 0xABC12345 PUSH1 224 SHL\" gets compressed into a PUSH32 for gas savings:\r\n```\r\n602480600e600039806000f350fe7fabc1234500000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000600052\r\nPUSH1 0x24 DUP1 PUSH1 0xE PUSH1 0x0 CODECOPY DUP1 PUSH1 0x0 RETURN POP INVALID PUSH32 0xABC1234500000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 PUSH1 0x0 MSTORE\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing `solc` does not give this result (command `solc --yul --yul-dialect evm --optimize`)\r\n```\r\n600b80600d600039806000f3fe63abc1234560e01b600052\r\nPUSH1 0xB DUP1 PUSH1 0xD PUSH1 0x0 CODECOPY DUP1 PUSH1 0x0 RETURN INVALID PUSH4 0xABC12345 PUSH1 0xE0 SHL PUSH1 0x0 MSTORE\r\n```\r\n\r\n`solc` works better than Remix for a number of other optimizations (for instance, Remix will output multiple `JUMPDEST`s in succession). Nonetheless, the Yul compiler would benefit greatly if some of these high-runs optimizations could be included.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nThe `--optimize-runs` option should be made available in Yul mode. `--optimize --optimize-runs 100000` for the Yul code above should contain the PUSH compression optimization given above, for example.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nThis feature will not introduce backward compatibility issues because the `--optimize-runs` option would be new for Yul mode.",

    "body": "I took a quick look at the CLI code and it's just that the `--optimize-runs` option is ignored in assembly mode (but the compiler does not report it as an invalid argument - we should really fix #11629).\r\n\r\nSo this should be very simple to fix - just pass the option down to `assemble()` in `CommandLineInterface.cpp`.\r\n\r\nFortunately this does not happen in Standard JSON mode and also this is the only optimizer option that is ignored without giving any feedback.\r\n\r\nI'd classify it as a bug rather than a missing feature because this is a discrepancy with how Standard JSON works. It should have been changed back when the option was being added for Yul in Standard JSON.",
