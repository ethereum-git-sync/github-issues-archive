  "body": "I would expect that all compilers do real compilation, if a compiler gets called with a single source file. This works like this for `gcc`, `javac`, `clang` - so why not `solc`? Right now, if there was  no output explicitly selected, `solc` is just performing parsing, but no real compilation. If a user knows that behaviour, this behaviour may be totally ok. But it may cause some confusion, if someone is not fully aware of this. Maybe we should just prevent that such confusion arise.\r\n\r\nOne solution could be to define a default output mod - to force real compilation. Where someone could force the compiler to not select any default output with a special parameter command line parameter, e.g. `--no-output`\r\n\r\nThis behaviour is only visible, if something is going wrong during code generation (e.g. unimplemented feature error).",

    "body": "> Where an `UnimplementedFeatureError` exception is thrown, if called with e.g. `--combined-json asm`.\r\n\r\nWell, this is just an unimplement feature in the codegen. We already had this reported as a bug (e.g. #3446) and these issues were all closed. In the end this is going to be resolved when we add `copyof` (#2435).\r\n\r\nI do think that just throwing an ICE is not very user-friendly. I think we should either detect this in the analysis and report a normal error or have a way to report unimplemented features as errors during the codegen phase. I'd report this specifically as a separate issue (feature request?) though. We'd need to add it to the design backlog and discuss it first.\r\n\r\n> The compiler is just not doing anything (apart from parsing?), if no output was selected - it makes somehow sense, but it may create some confusions.\r\n\r\nThis was intentional. See #11895. Daniel used to complain that we pointlessly run the old codegen even if we don't use its results and at some point he just went and changed it. I think it's a good change. If we're not printing the output then there's really no point.\r\n\r\n> However, maybe we should then always select an output [here](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/scripts/ASTImportTest.sh#L43), e.g. specifying `--bin`.\r\n\r\nTrue, I think this part was written with the assumption that the compiler does the full compilation, all the way down to the bytecode, even without `--bin`. So I'd add `--bin` there.\r\n\r\nIt was not really about performance so I would not worry about the additional overhead of `--bin`. Just that the test does what was intended.",

For me that's the most common thing I want to see and the fact that there's not much printed when there are no errors is a good thing to me.

I think an error would be better - because it will exit with != 0. An explicit `--no-output` would then just behave as right now without having compiler output selected (also returns with exit code of 0, if everything went good).\r\n\r\n\r\n",
