    "body": "32-bit Windows is all but irrelevant by now. Even Microsoft is soon going to [stop offering it on new PCs](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-takes-a-step-toward-phasing-out-32-bit-pc-support-for-windows-10/). Most hardware it currently runs on is actually 64-bit anyway and fully capable of running a 64-bit OS.\r\n\r\nWe do not think this is worth the extra maintenance burden. We provide native builds for the most popular platforms (including 64-bit Windows) and on others you can still use the universal emscripten (wasm) binaries. It should also still be possible to build a 32-bit Windows binary from source if you really need it.",
