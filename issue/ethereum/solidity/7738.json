  "body": "In the effort to increase the link between a contract's address and its ABI / source code, one stepping stone is encouraging developers to publish their source code. Some of the tool writers we have spoken to are reluctant to auto-publish the source code at the point of deployment because the tools are also used for closed-source contracts, on private chains and with testnets.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, an interactive deployment process where users have to answer a \"publish or not publish\" questions is also not an option because he deployment is usually performed by Ci/CD servers.\r\n\r\nThis leaves us with the option that contract developers have to state their decision before the code is published. One way of enforcing this decision is to add a pragma to the Solidity language that is required and specifies whether or not the source code can be published. We can go so far and even allow users to specify a license, which could be a good measure anyway.\r\n\r\nProposal:\r\n\r\nA `pragma license \"<license>\";` line is required in each source file. The compiler parses the value as a generic string. The only interpretation performed on that string is to check whether it is the string `closed` or `none`, which means that the source code is not to be published.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```\r\npragma license \"closed\";\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\npragma license \"CC BY-SA 2.0\";\r\n```\r\n\r\ncc @gnidan",
