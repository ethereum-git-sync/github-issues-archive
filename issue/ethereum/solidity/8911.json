    "body": "Firstly, it's not mentioned in the docs how inherited (implemented) members would contain the NatSpec from base. Perhaps we should add this under the section \"Inheritance Notes.\"\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nFor Q2. \r\n\r\n1. For `@notice`, the overriding function's notice should take precedence. I see no arguments against this.\r\n2. For `@param` I think it's reasonable to assume that the overriding function will not have different description for `@param.` But for the sake of consistency, we should allow the NatSpec to be overridden. \r\n\r\n With this rule, I don't see any problem with such a feature for interfaces. Also, why do we have to restrict this for only interfaces? Contracts can also have this.\r\n",

[`ERC20.transfer`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/api/token/erc20#ERC20-transfer-address-uint256-), for example, looks like this:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/481465/81841610-1959db00-9521-11ea-9fc7-334a2d0a7618.png)\r\n\r\nWe plan to eventually also embed along with the link a portion of the referenced docs so the user doesn't have to click through so many links to see what is conceptually a single piece of information. It would probably be the first sentence, or maybe a few sentences up to some other delimiter.\r\n\r\nWe would not expect any of this to be done automatically by the compiler, but we would be interested in some help from the compiler. For example, I don't think the AST currently has a reference to the function that is being overriden, so we don't have a way of automating the \"See `Parent.foo`\" text. That would be very valuable.",
