  "body": "## Abstract\r\n\r\nThere may be situations where compiling staring from a solcAST is advantageous. \r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nHere are two potential use cases. The first which is my main motivation for mentioning is that in IDEs where a program is getting developed the expected pattern is many failed compiles as one is developing the program followed by one last full compile. \r\n\r\nFor failed compiles, right now I am turning off all optimization, and disabling all output except the AST. It may even be that adding a command-line switch would make \"no output after AST\" more explicit. \r\n\r\nIn the last full compile though optimization and so on are desired. So there might be a small benefit here, in saving time.\r\n\r\nHowever the other use is to allow other kinds of frontends,  preprocessors, language to work that allow people to experiment with solidity without having to write in C++ and work on the Solidity code base.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nWill be filled in if this moves forward. \r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nThis should be completely backwards compatible.
