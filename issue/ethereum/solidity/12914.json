  "body": "Since https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12907 slipped through our fingers in our last fuzzing efforts, maybe we should think about fuzzing validation of invalid encodings again. (I think previously we were mainly focusing on sound decoded values of valid encodings, resp. fuzzing encoding-decoding-encoding etc.)\r\n\r\nThere are multiple ways to trigger full calldata validation.\r\n```\r\n  SomeType s;\r\n  function f(SomeType calldata x) {\r\n    abi.encode(x); // validation during re-encoding\r\n    SomeType memory y = x; /// validation during copies to memory\r\n    s = x; /// validation during copies to storage\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nWe need to double-check that the \"copy-to-memory\" case includes member- and index-access cases - if not, we'd have to also generate function bodies that access each nested value of the argument.\r\n\r\nMore than that, generating random encodings may too rarely merely fail in nested sub-types, so we may need to start from full valid encodings and mutate them only slightly.\r\n\r\nAnother issue is that the Isabelle-based reference implementation of an decoder may be too slow to do this on a large scale, but we can try.\r\n\r\nWhile all of this is significant effort, unfortunately it's also quite hard to test the various scenarios in up to three-fold nested types manually...",
