  "body": "### Problem Description\n\nThe scenario is as follows. Let's imagine a contract A with a public struct that also contains variable sized data types not all of which are placed at the end of the struct:\n\n``` js\ncontract A {\n\n...\n\n    struct Proposal {\n        address recipient;\n        uint amount;\n        string description;\n        uint votingDeadline;\n        bool open;\n        bool proposalPassed;\n        bytes32 proposalHash;\n        uint proposalDeposit;\n        bool newCurator;\n        SplitData[] splitData;\n        uint yea;\n        uint nay;\n        mapping (address => bool) votedYes;\n        mapping (address => bool) votedNo;\n        address creator;\n    }\n\n    struct SplitData {\n        uint splitBalance;\n        uint totalSupply;\n        uint rewardToken;\n        DAO newDAO;\n    }\n    Proposal[] public proposals;\n\n...\n\n}\n```\n\nNow imagine a contract B trying to interface with contract A:  \n\n``` js\ncontract B {\nA public other;\n\nfunction foo(uint _proposalID) {\n        if (_proposalID > other.numberOfProposals()) {\n            return false;\n        }\n        var (,,,,proposalPassed, proposalHash,,, yea, nay,) = other.proposals(_proposalID);\n}\n\n}\n```\n### Expected Results\n\nAt this call:\n\n``` js\nvar (,,,,proposalPassed, proposalHash,,, yea, nay,) = other.proposals(_proposalID);\n```\n\nWe are decoding the struct by extracting all the non-variable sized members. We would expect to see the actual values stored in the solidity variables.\n### Actual Results\n\nThe variables in the above call contain data different than what is expected. The data seems to be moved around, indicating some problem with the way solidity decodes them.\n\nMore specifically `proposalHash` appears to be `0x0` while it's not and in `yea` we get the value of `nay` and vice versa.\n",

It does not seem to totally solve the problem.\n\nThis time all returned and decoded data were zero. I tried to use a simple contract that includes the DAO contract and wanted to see if the voting deadline and yay and nay would be read properly:\n\n```\nvar (,,,votingDeadline,,,,,,yea,nay,) = client.proposals(proposalID);\n```\n\nSo when doing the above all 3 variables were zero, while they should have actual values.\n",

    "body": "I don't see the problem here, and think a mistake has been made. This PR should be reverted and should not ever go into production. The original bug report was a bug in the mind of the programmer who expected there to be place-holders for dynamic structure elements, when everyone already knew about the lack of support for those elements from the automatic public accessor function for public variables within contracts. The \"fix\" that was appropriate for this \"showstopper\" was for the programmer to stop expecting something different from what reality has provided to calling code since the automatic public accessor function was first created.\n\nConsider what PR 598 is going to do if it is deployed to production... Nobody will ever know which version of the solidity compiler was used to compile a particular contract, so the result from a call to the public accessor function will be unpredictable in live blockchains. There's no mechanism for preventing pre-598 contracts from being deployed to a blockchain, so it will happen even though it doesn't make any sense to compile with old compilers, and all this confusion is being created for why, exactly? It seems to me the confusion is being created simply because the original \"bug report\" was not categorized as a \"feature request\" for a new alternative to the automatic public accessor function. There is going to need to be an alternative versionable public accessor function in the future, so put it on the list of features and we'll build it, but leave the original functionality please to avoid causing avoidable problems in the real world.\n\nI strongly recommend AGAINST merging PR 598 into the master branch.\n",

    "body": "@JasonCoombs I think you might have misunderstood what this PR does. It does not change the behaviour of accessor functions. Accessor functions have always dropped some array elements and included some other array elements. Specifically, those with packed encodings (bytes, string) are included and padded ones (int8[], uint[], byte[]) are ignored.\n\nThis PR is about making it possible to correctly decode return values from accessor functions from within Solidity. Solidity wrongfully removed all array types from the return type, although string and bytes return types are indeed present in the return value. Until EIP-5/8 is accepted, there is no nice way to decode them, so I added placeholders that will be replaced by their proper type once the EVM is upgraded.\n\nTo be clear, Solidity tries very very hard not to introduce any breaking change, and even harder not to introduce them at the point where new contracts interact with existing contracts.\n",

    "body": "@chriseth what this PR does is make it impossible for client code which calls an accessor function to know what to expect unless it has hard-coded knowledge of the solidity compiler version used to produce the bytecode of the accessor function. This means forget about iterating across the blockchain and calling accessor functions, and existing code won't work for newly-compiled contracts -- perhaps you have misunderstood the practical impact of \"fixing\" what is clearly not a bug but is just an arbitrary design decision which there is no good rationale to alter... You're going to cause \"contracts\" to be \"un-enforceable\" on the blockchain until and unless the contracts are replaced with new contracts. This one PR, if implemented, demonstrates a fundamental flaw in Ethereum that will deter its wider adoption.\n\nSuppose Contract A promises to deliver Eth to a recipient B from every Contract C that is deployed to the blockchain. Suppose Contract A is written in such a way as to attempt to query Contract C using an accessor function to keep a record of something, such as the source of the Eth that is going to be transferred, and suppose Contract C is designed with public padded array elements. Contract A must be able to read Contract C regardless of the solidity compiler used to deploy Contract C, but with what you're doing here Contract A is going to be unable to do so, period. End of Contract A.\n\nThere will be so many instances in the real world in which people presume that \"if they like their smart contract, they can keep their smart contract\" that intentionally causing contracts to break in the way that is being proposed here is the real show-stopper. Doing this basically puts an end to Ethereum. You're turning it into a novelty rather than a reliable platform, and why? Just because you don't want to create a different versionable public accessor function v2 -- again, I do understand what this PR is trying to accomplish and I am saying it is very, very wrong and should not be implemented. You are violating the most important covenant that everyone who deploys a contract or who relies on a deployed contract presumes will never be violated! This is not a bug in Contract A it is an arbitrary change of interface that alters the way public accessor functions return values to the caller and it serves no purpose whatsoever.\n",

Imagine we wake up tomorrow & all of our computers, our phones, simply couldn't run anything anymore without upgrading them? That's fine on occasion for voluntary major upgrades, or switch to a different platform, but not for this. I have to agree with you Jason, this does not sound good at all. Most people in the software world know, backwards compatibility is very important and should only be violated for good reason.\n",
