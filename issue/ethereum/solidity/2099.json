This avoids the problem of having to come up with globally unique names, or at least moves this problem to the package manager.\r\n\r\nIf I understand you correctly, you suggest to add the name of a contract to the function signature to avoid naming conflicts. Note that functions in different contracts cannot really conflict, because each function call in Ethereum is always directed to a contract.",
