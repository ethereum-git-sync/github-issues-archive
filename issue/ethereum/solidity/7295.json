I would reckon that most users are not aware, few care, and only some are against compiler metadata. \r\n\r\nThere are many reasons why contract developers might be interested in opting out of the metadata; they may wish to pay less gas, bring less storage weight upon the network, have less code to analyze, or simply be interested just out of aesthetic reasons.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the compiler metadata is only even useful if contract devs actually publish the swarm/ipfs metadata somewhere, which I imagine few do. (I don't have any statistics here, because I don't even know where to look for compiler metadata! etherscan does not have it. I'm not interested in installing swarm at this time to check :)).",
