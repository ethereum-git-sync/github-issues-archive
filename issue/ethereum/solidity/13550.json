Implementing a pretty-printer mode for Yul that does no actual processing would be trivial and potentially useful.\r\n\r\nNot sure if we actually want to do this (it's a bit tangential to compiler's main purpose) but on the other hand we already have all the pieces for it.

    "body": "Good question. I think it might be better for the formatter not to add the `object` if it's not there because then it would have to come up with a name and this could affect the meaning of the code. For example `datasize()` should fail if the object you're referencing does not exist - but if you happen to reference `\"object\"`, and the formatter adds it, it will compile, potentially obscuring a bug in the code.",
