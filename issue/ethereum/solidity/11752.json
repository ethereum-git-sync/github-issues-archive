    "body": "Only external functions are a part of the ABI and thus have documented signatures.\r\n\r\n`internal` and `private` functions can have parameter of types that can't be expressed in the ABI - for example this function is perfectly legal when marked as `internal` or `private`:\r\n```solidity\r\nfunction f(mapping(uint => uint) storage _map) internal {}\r\n```\r\nbut it can't be `external` or `public` so it does not really have a selector (hash).\r\n\r\nIn some cases, when an internal function is only using parameter types that are valid for external functions, the compiler could compute the hash for you but then it could be misleading (you might think such a function is part of contract's ABI while it's not). Since the selector is useless to you unless the function is actually `external`/`public` why not make it such? If it's not you won't be able to use it to call the function anyway.\r\n\r\nClosing, since this is not a bug report or a feature request. If you have general questions about the compiler or need help with your contracts please feel free to ask at the [#solidity](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity) Gitter channel.",
