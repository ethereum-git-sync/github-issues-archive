They are not accessible from `AB`, so it is not like if a call from a function within `AB` wouldn't be resolvable.\r\n\r\nIMO, this should compile, possibly with a warning, but not with an error.\r\n\r\n## What happens\r\n\r\nI get an error:\r\n\r\n```TypeError: Derived contract must override function \"__myPrivateFunction\". Two or more base classes define function with same name and parameter types.```\r\n\r\n## Question/Request\r\n\r\nIs that behaviour wanted? needed? Whould it be possible to accept this kind of ghost-conflicts?",

    "body": "Shadowing makes no sense considering inaccessible functions (i.e. private), so in essence allowing this makes sense.\r\n\r\nHowever it definitely opens up the possibility for crafting/hiding confusing code, given contracts can have many internal and private functions, combining that with inheritance sometimes it is really hard to decipher what is the actual code used for the contract. The virtual/override specifiers help with that.\r\n\r\nWhile I do not think it is a good idea to try \"saving people from mistakes\" with weird rules like this, but I would put the question on the table: should this change be made in a breaking release, just in order to trigger a more thorough review from people using the language? Users tend to review their contracts more carefully when they bump a breaking release.",

    "body": "My use-case is a bit complex, and one might argue that it comes from bad design on our end.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOpenZeppelin provides a lot of functionalities in its different contracts and library. We also offer a framework for upgradeable contracts. This framework includes solidity code, and javascript tooling to help use deploy and update their contracts.\r\n\r\nThis tooling, in particular, checks dangerous behaviour, such a selfdestruct (see parity bug) and delegate calls (which can lead to self destruct). We want to protect users from using these in upgradeable contracts.\r\n\r\nWe have an `Address` library, which includes functions such as `isContract`, `sendValue`, `functionStaticCall` and `functionDelegateCall`. While most are safe, this last one can be dangerous. In our plugin we don't have the ability to filter that effectively, and whenever a user import the library, we do check the entire library for potential vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nTo limit false positives, we decided to:\r\n- Remove the `functionDelegateCall` for the Address library (in the upgradeable repo)\r\n- In the very rare places where we internally use it (in a safe way), inline a private copy with natspec comment to locally disable our security check.\r\n\r\nThe result is that we have this private function in some of our upgradeable contracts:\r\n- https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/utils/MulticallUpgradeable.sol#L37-L43\r\n- https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/proxy/ERC1967/ERC1967UpgradeUpgradeable.sol#L207-L213\r\n\r\nNow if I want to build a UUPSUpgradeable contract (inherits from ERC1967UpgradeUpgradeable) with  the multicall feature ... I get my private function defined twice.\r\n\r\nI'm sure we can rework our transpilling workflow, and the way our checks are performed ... but you asked me for my usecase so here it is. ",

Please have a look: \r\n```\r\ncontract A {\r\n    uint x; \r\n    function __myPrivateFunction(uint _num) private { // some state change\r\n        x=_num;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    function callA() public {\r\n        __myPrivateFunction(1);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract B {\r\n    uint x;\r\n    function __myPrivateFunction(uint _num) private { // some state change\r\n        x=_num;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    function callB() public {\r\n        __myPrivateFunction(2);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow since we are not able to inherit A and B together, we creat contracts that delegate calls to A and B:\r\n```\r\ncontract A_caller{\r\n    uint public x_A;\r\n    A contractA;\r\n\r\n    function set_contractA(address _A) external {\r\n        contractA = A(_A);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function call_contractA() public {\r\n        (bool success,) = address(contractA).delegatecall(abi.encodeWithSignature(\"callA()\"));\r\n        require(success);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract B_caller{\r\n    uint public x_B;\r\n    B contractB;\r\n\r\n    function set_contractB(address _B) external {\r\n        contractB = B(_B);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function call_contractB() public {\r\n        (bool success,) = address(contractB).delegatecall(abi.encodeWithSignature(\"callB()\"));\r\n        require(success);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd inherit these contracts together\r\n```\r\ncontract AB is A_caller, B_caller{  }\r\n```\r\nThis will allow us to access all the functions of A and B using the state of A_caller and B_caller.\r\n\r\nBest regards!",

    "body": " when you inherit contracts, their functions and state variables are available to the derived contract. This includes functions marked as private. While you might expect that private functions in contract A and contract B would not be accessible from contract AB, Solidity allows access to these functions when they are inherited.\r\n\r\nThis behavior is by design in Solidity. When you inherit from contracts A and B in contract AB, all the functions and state variables from A and B, including the private ones, are part of contract AB. This allows the derived contract to access and use those functions as if they were its own.\r\n\r\n```\r\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\r\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\r\n\r\ncontract A {\r\n    function __myPrivateFunction() private {\r\n        // Does something useful\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function callA() public {\r\n        __myPrivateFunction();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract B {\r\n    function __myPrivateFunction() private {\r\n        // Does something useful\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function callB() public {\r\n        __myPrivateFunction();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract AB is A, B {\r\n    function callAB() public {\r\n        __myPrivateFunction(); // This works because it's inherited\r\n        callA(); // This works too\r\n        callB(); // This works too\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this code, AB inherits from both A and B, and it can access and call the private functions from both of them. This behavior follows Solidity's inheritance model, where all functions from parent contracts are included in the derived contract.\r\n\r\nIf you want to prevent access to the private functions from the derived contract, you should consider changing the access level of those functions to internal or external, depending on your intended use case and visibility requirements.",

It is part of AB's bytecode, and it can be called indirectly through `callA` ... but as far as `AB` is concerned, it could have any name, that would not matter.
