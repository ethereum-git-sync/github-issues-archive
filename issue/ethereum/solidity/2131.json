  "body": "This is an umbrella issue to cover the steps needed for Yul, the internal IR of Solidity. Yul aims to be fairly expressive, support basic types (bool, numbers) and be a source to generate both EVM and eWASM bytecode.\r\n\r\nA superset of Yul, currently named Yul++ or Solidity--, can include \"user defined types\", which here means internal types of Solidity, like contracts, address, etc. This superset is also exposed to the user as \"inline assembly\".\r\n\r\nPlanned is to have transformations / optimisations on Yul as a middle layer.\r\n\r\nThree targets / backends are proposed for Yul: EVM, \"EVM 1.5\" and eWASM.\r\n1. eWASM can easily handle functions and translate them as-is\r\n2. EVM needs a phase called \"desugaring\", which removes functions and replaces them with jumps\r\n3. \"EVM1.5\" has support for functions (\"subroutines\") and only supports static jumps\r\n\r\nIn the compiler the following components are affected:\r\n1. `libsolidity/inlineasm` is extended to support parsing Yul (and Yul++). It also exposes an AST structure which is returned by the parser and is supported as an input by the printer. Since this code is also able to parse current inline assembly, there should be a flag to switch between the two formats. Perhaps we could rename it `libsolidity/yul`. (flag has been added)\r\n2. `libsolidity/frontend` is to be created, which receives the Solidity AST and produces a Yul AST\r\n3. `libsolidity/backend/evm` is to be created, which receives the Yul AST and produces EVM bytecode - has been implemented\r\n4. `libsolidity/backend/evm15` is to be created, which receives the Yul AST and produces EVM1.5 bytecode  - has been implemented\r\n5. `libsolidity/backend/ewasm` is to be created, which receives the Yul AST and produces eWASM bytecode\r\n6. Yul is to be supported in \"JSON I/O\" with the ability to receive Yul source code and output code generated by the selected backend\r\n\r\nAnother possible layout of code as discussed is:\r\n- `libjulia` - AST, parser, printer (the current `libsolidity/inlineasm`)\r\n- `libjulia/backend/evm` (doesn't uses `libevmasm`, but the peephole optimiser is copied from there)\r\n- `libjulia/backend/evm15`\r\n- `libjulia/backend/ewasm`\r\n- `libsolidity/codegen/evm` (the current `libsolidity/codegen`, uses `libevmasm`)\r\n- `libsolidity/codegen/julia` - the new Julia AST generator\r\n\r\nThe first milestone here is the [ABI coder](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/projects/7)",

This was also the impression of a Gnosis employee.  Julia the scientific computing language has been around since 2009 or 2012, depending on which date one uses; I anticipate the use of the scientific language Julia to grow with upcoming releases. If the name of the IR language in this thread stays \"Julia\", naming collisions such as that which I experienced can be expected to increase.\r\n\r\nI suggest the name for the IR language be changed to something different than Julia.",
