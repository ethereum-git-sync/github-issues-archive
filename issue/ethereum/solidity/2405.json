Also we have some engineer's time available but not sure what is the best way to contribute to help it to progress.\r\n\r\n#2233 looks like a solid starting point. Maybe we can merge that PR into develop so people can start to contribute missing features/tests listed in this issue? What do you think? Thanks :)",
