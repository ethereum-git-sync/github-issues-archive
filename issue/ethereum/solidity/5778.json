  "body": "``yul::Statement`` and ``yul::Expression`` are ``boost::variant``s. Therefore they can be implicitly constructed from the variant alternative types. This may be convenient, but in a lot of cases will silently not be what we want.\r\nConsider:\r\n```\r\nclass Example: ASTWalker {\r\npublic:\r\n    using ASTWalker::operator();\r\n    void visit(Statement const& _statement) override;\r\n    void operator()(Block const& _block);\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow consider you want to use ``Example`` to visit a ``Block``. Naturally you may write:\r\n```\r\n    Block const* block = ...;\r\n    Example example;\r\n    example.visit(*block);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will work and doesn't look suspicious, but it will perform a deep copy of the block, since it is implicitly converted to ``Statement`` in order to call ``Example::visit``.\r\n\r\nI think this is an actual design flaw in the current Yul AST. A possible solution would be to have a thin wrapper deriving from ``boost::variant`` that only has explicit constructors from the variant alternatives (we'd have to check whether ``apply_visitor``, etc., will still work smoothly that way;  and maybe there's a better solution altogether).",

    "body": "A sufficient solution to this might be to delete all copy constructors and copy assignment operators for the Yul AST Nodes. That way the ``boost::variant`` won't be implicitly copy-constructible from its alternatives either, mitigating the issue. If one wants to copy Yul AST nodes, I guess the right way to do it is to use the ``ASTCopier`` anyways, so I think it makes sense if direct copies are disallowed in general.\r\nEDIT: Deleting constructors will not prevent the ``struct``s from being considered aggregates, so aggregate initialization will still work.",
