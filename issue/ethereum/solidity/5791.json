M consecutive jumpdests can be replaced with one because they point to the same operation (i.e., the operation after the final jumpdest). The deployment and invocation of this anti-pattern waste 68 √ó (ùëÄ ‚àí 1) units and (ùëÄ ‚àí 1) units of gas (the execution of a jumpdest needs 1 unit of gas), respectively.\r\n\r\nWhile libevmasm has a step to remove unreferenced `JUMPDEST`s there doesn't seem to be a way to change referenced ones.\r\n\r\nA good new step could:\r\n1) search for consecutive `JUMPDEST`s\r\n2) change all the references to the first one\r\n\r\nAfter this step the `UnusedJumpdests` step could prune the ones left.\r\n",
