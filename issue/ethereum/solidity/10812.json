    "body": "Actually, you can already do that using `yul-phaser`.

It's meant to be used multiple times to specify the whole initial population but in the example above I'm giving it `\"\"` to see the unoptimized program and `xarrscLM` as an example sequence to check out. You can also put the sequence(s) in a file (`--population-from-file`), one sequence per line. The be precise, unoptimized program is not not completely unoptimized - phaser applies diambiguator, function hoister, function grouper and for loop init rewriter to every program so you may want to skip these from your sequence.\r\n\r\nThe only downside is that phaser does not support square bracket notation (might support that in the future if we really want it but mutating that is tricky) so you just have to repeat parts of the sequence manually.",
