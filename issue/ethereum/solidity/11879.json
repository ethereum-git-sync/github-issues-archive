    "body": "Forwarding the target conversion type will be very tricky, since there are too many situations in which this can happen, in my opinion.\r\n\r\nIn summary, I think we can only achieve the following without considerable effort:\r\n\r\nWe add an additional flag to ArrayType that is valid for statically-sized arrays in memory and tells that it is fine to convert this array into a dynamically-sized array. The flag is only set for array types deduced from TupleExpressions that are inline arrays for now.\r\n\r\nSuch array types are convertible to other such array types if the size matches (this is needed for two-dimensional inline arrays). They are convertible to statically-sized array types of the same size or dynamically-sized array types.\r\n\r\nIn code generation, they are handled as dynamically-sized memory arrays.\r\n\r\nWhen converted to statically-sized memory arrays, we just add `0x20` to the pointer, while conversion to dynamically-sized memory arrays is a no-op.\r\n\r\nThe `.length` member and index access has to be done accordingly.\r\n\r\nAnother option to implement this is to make `mobileType()` to be the dynamically-sized memory array. I think this could require less implementation effort, but I'm not sure.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the first (A) and the second (B) way to implement it is that:\r\n\r\nIn (A), the expression `[[1, 2], [4, 5]]` can be converted to `uint8[2][2]`, while it can only be converted to `uint[][2]` in (B).\r\nOn the other hand, `[[1, 2], [3]]` is valid in (B), while it is invalid in (A).",
