    "body": "I think it's a good idea and here's the plan for doing it I came up with with @Marenz last year:\r\n1) Add support for a new kind of CLI test - one that has a Python or Bash script inside.\r\n2) Split the [Bash tests that are currently tacked on at the end of `cmdlineTests.sh`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/v0.8.13/test/cmdlineTests.sh#L291-L674) into such smaller tests.\r\n    - When naming dirs for these tests use a prefix to makes them sort at the end to much the current behavior (they currently run after all the other tests and I think we want to keep it that way since they can be long). `~` is a good candidate for such a prefix.\r\n3) Rewrite the smaller scripts in Python.\r\n4) Rewrite `cmdlineTests.sh` in Python.\r\n\r\nI actually have an old branch where I did (1) and started (2). I'm going to assign myself here for now since I'd like to finish that when I have time. Then (3) and (4) could be done piece by piece.",
