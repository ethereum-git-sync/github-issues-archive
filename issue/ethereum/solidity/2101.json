  "body": "Currently, in the assembly, labels cannot be used out of the block it is defined.  This creates an artificial burden that one cannot jump into a block, except when the label is passed in the runtime dataflow.  This restriction poses problems like https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2091#issuecomment-289460221 .\r\n\r\nThis issue proposes to remove this restriction by introducing a label declaration `label(_IDENTIFIER_)`, where `_IDENTIFIER_` is declared to be a label, but unknown to reference any location.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    label(L2)\r\n    jump(L2)\r\n    {\r\n        L2:\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: Usually, I don't propose a new language feature but this proposal is a compromise.  My real preference is to remove scoping rules about labels and put labels in a single global namespace.  ",

    "body": "Discussion lead to the following conclusions:\r\n\r\n - `label(L2)` requires an identifier `L2` to be uniquely defined in the current or any of its sub-blocks.\r\n - It makes it possible to refer to the identifier in the current or any of its sub-blocks (usual scoping rules), also before the point of declaration.\r\n - Requiring the declaration to be at the beginning of the block makes function definition desugaring non-local, so it should not be enforced.\r\n - The syntax should be different from a usual expression and we should potentially find a better name. A candidate could be `label x` (without parentheses). This would make `label` a keyword.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n@axic what do you think?",
