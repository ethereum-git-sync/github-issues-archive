  "body": "I am using hashes of the contract binary to determine if the structure of the contract has been changed and it appears if I compile contract A it gets one deterministic hash, but if I compile contract B which inherits contract A then contract A gets recompiled and the swarm hash is changed, therefore indicating that the contract binary data has changed even though the actual contract and its logic are identical.\r\n\r\nI'm assuming here that the last 34 bytes in the binary is the swarm hash + 2 extra bytes? I could be wrong, maybe its something else.\r\n\r\nGiven storage space for these contracts is expensive and limited, and the manifest may not make it into swarm or still be there it would be great to have an option to strip out or not included any metadata including swarm hash from the contract binary output if one wishes.\r\n\r\nHere is a similar discussion from January. https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1571 which got rejected it seems.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, if I was able to import from parent directories https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/553 this problem wouldn't effect me..  but it appears the PR https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/554 got rejected.",
