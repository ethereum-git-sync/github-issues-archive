See https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10961#issuecomment-829666764 for details.\r\n\r\nNot sure the PR is worth keeping open so feel free to close it again and just move the repro to a gist. Overall my opinion is that it's not really a bug and more like a performance problem when running on a contract this size. In my opinion it could be a good candidate for a SMT performance test and a benchmark for optimizations.\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "@cameel yea that's also how I'm seeing this. I have another pretty heavy benchmark from the Circles contract, gets killed even with abstractions and 32gb of ram. I'll collect these somewhere as performance tests. It's a really good goal to try to not get those killed via abstractions. However, at some point we can't abstract more and it ultimately depends on the solver. I'm also going to test them with another solver I've been experimenting with.",
