These keywords have been dropped in `soldidity 0.6.x`, which breaks the interoperability with the `geth` console in its current versions. For some reason, the `geth` console still uses `web3.js 0.20.1`, which depends on these keywords (see #8065 and [geth#20760](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/20760)).\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nRe-introducing the keywords does not break anything.

As someone in the business for 40 years, I can assure you that this policy is harmful to the community, and totally unnecessary.

For didactic purposes it is useful to let the students first interact directly with the chain, from the geth console, and then we introduce remix as well as truffle (and maybe other tools in the future). The students try all sort of things, which is basically good, but it causes headaches if the different pieces do not fit together. What I find most painful is that this experience conveys the impression of an immature technology.\r\n\r\nBesides us, there are others with the same problem, mostly reporting it as a geth issue.
