  "body": "I have a question about how EVM and Solidity work. In this example on the official Solidity website, there are two contracts ( Caller, C ). What happens and I didn't know is that I can host the \"Caller\" contract and still interact with the \"C\" contract even though it's not instantiated in the blockchain. Just so I understand, does \"Caller\" host under the hood the \"C\" contract with you? Because I'm imagining that if I wanted to create a contract that offered several services I would do it just like that, it's much better than passing instance of related contracts in the blockchain. Or is there something I don't understand?\r\n\r\nThe source code is in ( Getter Functions - https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.4/contracts.html )\r\n\r\n```\r\ncontract C {\r\n    uint public data = 42;\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract Caller {\r\n    C c = new C();\r\n    function f() public view returns (uint) {\r\n        return c.data();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```",
