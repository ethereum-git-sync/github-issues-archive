Unfortunately this is nowhere close to our current roadmap. This is not a big task so we might be able to fit it in somewhere between bigger tasks, but I can't really promise anything.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, we have a pending PR that adds support for NatSpec on enums: #13626. It's stuck on some trivial things (needs more tests), mostly because everyone on the team is busy with other tasks so there and there was no one to take it over so far.

    "body": "I'm fine with increasing the impact - this is only an estimate and the fact that it's of that much interest to libraries shows that it perhaps should be higher. I wouldn't really consider it a bug though because AFAIK it's was just designed that way and not originally meant for internal documentation. Of course it does not mean that we should not change it. It's just more of a minor feature at this point.",
