Unfortunately this is nowhere close to our current roadmap. This is not a big task so we might be able to fit it in somewhere between bigger tasks, but I can't really promise anything.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, we have a pending PR that adds support for NatSpec on enums: #13626. It's stuck on some trivial things (needs more tests), mostly because everyone on the team is busy with other tasks so there and there was no one to take it over so far. If some contributor would pick that up, we might have at least that pretty soon.",

NatSpec is Doxygen inspired, which generally serves to document the interface, rather than the implementation itself, so I am personally not a big fan of having custom tags for contract/struct internals, however, I do agree that having a specific tag for such scenarios (e.g. `@field` that you suggested) is preferable than misusing `@param` for that purpose.\r\n\r\nPRs for UDVTs and enum values are open right now and will be part of the next release; beyond that, we have no plans to work on NatSpec for the foreseeable future (as far as I'm aware). You are of course welcome in the Wednesday language design meetings to convince us otherwise :)",
