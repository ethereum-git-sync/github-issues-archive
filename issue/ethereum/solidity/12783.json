    "body": "There are actually two different problems embedded in this issue:\r\n1. `UnimplementedFeatureError` reported by the compiler with no line indication\r\n2. No support by the compiler for copying an array of structs into storage\r\n\r\nOne the one hand, I guess that you could consider both as low-priority, since 1 only requires a bit of a \"dig through\" in order to find the error in the code, and 2 can be worked-around by copying struct by struct into storage.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, both are rather annoying when you (I) encounter them...\r\n\r\nThanks",
