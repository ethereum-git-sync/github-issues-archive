The following used to work, according to code examples I found online:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbytes1 b = 0xf;\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever this gives an error\r\n\r\n```\r\nTypeError: Type int_const 15 is not implicitly convertible to expected type bytes1.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe implicit conversion only works if the value is specified with two hex digits:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbytes1 b = 0x0f;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is an unnecessary and confusing restriction.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version: 0.8.17\r\n- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings):\r\n- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix):\r\n- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client:\r\n- Operating system: Linux\r\n",
