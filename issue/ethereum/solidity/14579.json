  "body": "## Abstract\r\n\r\nFunction pointers don't work with overloaded functions.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nThe current compiler doesn't recognize valid overloaded functions as candidates for function pointers. This limitation forces developers to use different function names *for the functions that have similar functionality*, which creates unnecessary code bulk. \r\n\r\nThe compilation fails with the misleading message `TypeError: No matching declaration found after variable lookup.`. Even though the matching declaration is there. At least the error message may be a tiny bit more meaningful.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nCan't provide in-depth technical specification, however here is the code snipped that doesn't compile. \r\n\r\n```solidity\r\npragma solidity ^0.8.21;\r\n\r\ncontract WontCompile {\r\n    function deduce() external {\r\n        bar(foo); // compilation fails due to this line\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function foo(uint256) internal {}\r\n\r\n    function foo(address) internal {}\r\n\r\n    function bar(function(uint256) internal numFoo) internal {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nShould not be backward incompatible.\r\n",
