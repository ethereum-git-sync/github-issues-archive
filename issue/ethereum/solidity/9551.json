  "body": "Currently to use a struct storage pointer/Diamond Storage I need to do this:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nDiamondStorage storage ds;\r\nbytes32 position = DiamondStorageContract.DIAMOND_STORAGE_POSITION;           \r\nassembly { ds_slot := position }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be really nice to be able to do this on one line without assembly.  Something like this:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nDiamondStorage storage ds = DiamondStorageContract.DIAMOND_STORAGE_POSITION \r\n```\r\n\r\n`DiamondStorageContract.DIAMOND_STORAGE_POSITION` is a bytes32 constant in the [DiamondStorageContract](https://github.com/mudgen/Diamond/blob/master/contracts/DiamondStorageContract.sol) contract.\r\n\r\nThis pattern is extensively used in diamonds  which are [growing in use](https://dev.to/mudgen/ethereum-s-maximum-contract-size-limit-is-solved-with-the-diamond-standard-2189#the-diamond-standard-is-gaining-traction).\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more info see the [Diamond Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535) and the [diamond reference implementation](https://github.com/mudgen/Diamond).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
