  "body": "Currently ``IRGenerationContext::internalDispatch`` creates a switch statement with a case for every function defined in the contract.\r\nHowever, the only valid way to initialize an internal function pointer is by explicitly assigning it to an internal function - so we know at compile-time which subset of internal functions might be called using the dispatch. The dispatch should only contain these cases.\r\n\r\nNote that an assignment to function pointers can already happen in the constructor, so this needs to be considered when collecting the set of internal functions that might be called.",
