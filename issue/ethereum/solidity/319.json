  "body": "Try to implement and document the following general pattern:\n\nA certain expensive computation is implemented as a contract function on the blockchain.\nBy default, the computation is performed off-chain and only its result is supplied together with a deposit.\nAnyone can challenge the computation by forcing the contract to run the computation, including another deposit. If the challenge is successful, the challenger gets half of the original deposit, the second half is destroyed. If it is not successful, the challenger's deposit is destroyed.\n\nPotential problems:\n- computation has to be stateless (and this has to be enforced in some way)\n- parameters should be implemented in a polymorphic way\n- verification could take more than one transaction (gas)\n\nPossible extensions:\n- initial invocation could supply an appropriately encoded transcript of the computation (or only its hash) and the challenge only has to uncover a single incorrect bit in the transcript.\n",
