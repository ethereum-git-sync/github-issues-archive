    "body": "This is actually a very good question and we had some discussions on different level of \"pureness\". Currently `pure` functions are only pure when externally called. If they are called internally, they can use `revert` as well as modify the memory as they wish.\r\n\r\nRegarding the avoidance of memory modification we have the `immutable` keyword on input arguments (not yet implemented).\r\n\r\nI think `revert` is a very useful feature in many use cases of a pure function (when externally called), but how (if) should we mark these two types of pure functions within a contract?\r\n\r\nOne obvious answer is that `pure external` functions can use `revert`, `require`, etc., while `pure internal`, `pure private`  and `pure public` cannot (the last has both an internal and external interface). This however seriously affects the usefulness of such functions.",
