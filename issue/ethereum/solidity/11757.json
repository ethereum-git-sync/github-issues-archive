    "body": "> I will make two link files to /usr/lib\r\n\r\nThat's not necessary. Looks like CMake does find the lib files inside `/usr/local/lib/` and properly includes them in the linker command. The problem must be somewhere else.\r\n\r\nThere's something weird going on. Linker gets the right file but does not see the symbols. Here's some more things to try:\r\n- I see that you're running some commands as root. Could you make sure that the lib files are readable by a normal user? What are their permissions and which user owns them?\r\n- Could you make sure the files are not corrupted? Do they have non-zero size? What do you see if you run `ar -t /usr/local/lib/libboost_program_options.a`? On my system it prints this:\r\n    ```\r\n    cmdline.o\r\n    config_file.o\r\n    options_description.o\r\n    parsers.o\r\n    variables_map.o\r\n    value_semantic.o\r\n    positional_options.o\r\n    utf8_codecvt_facet.o\r\n    convert.o\r\n    winmain.o\r\n    split.o\r\n    ```\r\n- If you're building boost from source, could you try installing it with a package manager instead?",
