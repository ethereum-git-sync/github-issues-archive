We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.\r\n- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:\r\n\t- [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)\r\n\t- [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)\r\n- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.\r\n- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nFixed-size array should be fixed not dynamic.  in the below code I can change the size after deploying the contract.\r\n\r\n- Compiler version:\r\n- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): tested on 0.5, 0.6 & 0.7\r\n- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Remix \r\n- Operating system: Ubuntu\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\npragma solidity ^0.7.5;\r\n\r\ncontract FixedSizeArray{\r\n    \r\n\r\n    // referance type\r\n   \r\n    uint256[] public myFixedArray = new uint256[](3); // or uint [] balance = [1, 2, 3];\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    function addToArray(uint256 val) public {\r\n     myFixedArray.push(val);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n       function removeToArray() public {\r\n     myFixedArray.pop();\r\n    }\r\n    function addToArrayByIndex(uint256 val, uint index) public {\r\n     myFixedArray[index]=val;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n   \r\n    \r\n} \r\n\r\n",
