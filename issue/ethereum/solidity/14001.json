Interestingly, it does not seem to crash, which is why it slipped through. Could be because we only ever touch the value it returns in the non-null case.\r\n\r\nStill, it's clearly a bug and should be fixed. It would normally be more serious, but fortunately until we see an actual crash in a release binary the impact is low.",
