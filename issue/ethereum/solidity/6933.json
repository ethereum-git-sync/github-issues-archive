  "body": "<!--## Prerequisites\r\n\r\n- First, many thanks for taking part in the community. We really appreciate that.\r\n- We realize there is a lot of information requested here. We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.\r\n- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:\r\n\t- [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)\r\n\t- [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)\r\n- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.\r\n- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\n<!--Please shortly describe the bug you have found, and what you expect instead.-->\r\n### Bug\r\nSimple functions that do a single arithmetic operation and assignment, and have no branches in their code can have different gas costs, depending on what functions have been called before.\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\nFunctions with no branches in their code, always cost the same amount of gas, independent of previous function executions of the contract.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version: 0.5.1\r\n- Target EVM version: Constantinople\r\n- Framework/IDE: Truffle\r\n- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: Ganache (Constantinople chain)\r\n- Operating system: Ubuntu 18.04\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease provide a *minimal* source code example to trigger the bug you have found.\r\nPlease also mention any command line flags that are necessary for triggering the bug.\r\nProvide as much information as necessary to reproduce the bug. -->\r\n\r\n### Project configuration\r\nStarting from a fresh truffle project, add the following contract `Counter.sol`:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\npragma solidity ^0.5.1;\r\n\r\ncontract Counter {\r\n    uint public count;\r\n\r\n    constructor() public {\r\n        count = 1;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function divide(uint8 factor) public returns (uint) {\r\n        count /= factor;\r\n        return count;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function add(uint8 value) public returns (uint) {\r\n        count += value;\r\n        return count;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdd a second migration:\r\n```javascript\r\nvar Counter = artifacts.require(\"Counter\")\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = function(deployer) {\r\n    deployer.deploy(Counter);\r\n};\r\n```\r\nAnd edit the compilers object in `truffle-config.js` to the following:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ncompilers: {\r\n  solc: {\r\n    settings: {\r\n      evmVersion: \"constantinople\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nConfigure ganache to use the Constantinople hardfork, and then deploy using `truffle migrate`.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\nAfter deployment in Ganache, the following commands were executed in the truffle console:\r\n```\r\nlet instance = await Counter.deployed()\r\ninstance.add(10) // gasUsed: 27187\r\ninstance.divide(100) // gasUsed: 13625\r\ninsatnce.add(10) // gasUsed: 42817\r\n```\r\nWhere the two add calls had drastically different gas costs.",
