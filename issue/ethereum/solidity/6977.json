  "body": "## Description\r\nCompiled contract functions sometimes have additional parameters randomly added in from other functions. In the most recently discovered example I have, a third parameter was added to a two-parameter function, leading a migration to fail (`Invalid number of parameters. Got 2 expected 3!`).  On inspecting the ABI in the JSON file for that contract (in `\\build\\contracts\\`), I could see that both this function and the one before it were incorrectly expecting a third input, each copied up from three functions further down in the smart contract file. (There was no such parameter in any other preceding function or event).  These extra parameters were also found in the other representations of the contract in the same JSON file below the ABI. \r\n\r\n## Workaround\r\nDeleting the `\\build\\contracts` directory and recompiling the **exact same Solidity code** usually works, or at least changes which function will trigger migration failure due to having been compiled with the wrong number of variables.  The deletion step is usually necessary because `truffle compile` will not necessarily recompile the smart contract if its source code has not changed.\r\n\r\nThe observed instance immediately preceding this bug report was the same smart contract but a different function than the one immediately preceding [this bug report](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/issues/2114) on a separate issue.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n- Compiler version: solc: 0.5.9+commit.e560f70d.Emscripten.clang and maybe others\r\n- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): Default\r\n- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Truffle\r\n- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: Doesn't matter, but Ganache\r\n- Operating system: Win 10 Pro\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\nUnfortunately, I do not have detailed steps to reliably reproduce the issue.  Simply compiling the same code twice in sequence, **with no change to the Solidity code at all**, produces different results.  \r\n\r\nTherefore, I believe this is a bug in the compiler instead of in the language.  Maybe there is some issue with how things are being stored in memory, and only getting cleared when memory free-space is needed (instead of when the data is no longer needed?).  However, my limited mental model for how the compiler works is that there is an iterative loop over the functions, which does not mesh with the observation that extra parameters are being copied *up* from a *later*-defined function.\r\n\r\n",

Therefore, I believe pretty strongly that the issue *cause* is happening *during compilation*, even though the *problematic symptoms* don't become obvious until a slightly later step in my workflow.

I modified my local instance of Truffle (adding code [here](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/blob/c5d5b7d600d99d7ff7a8304b4b660475d41d91b4/packages/truffle-compile/index.js#L133)) to set up some crude checks on the compiler output (counting inputs of some functions, looking at just the ABI portion of the output) to dump the compiler-input version of a contract if the checks fail.  The checks are based on (a) roughly parsing the input `solcStandardInput`, meaning the test would be useless if the input Solidity was modified incorrectly prior to being passed to the compiler, **AND** (b) some regularities in the input parameters of the certain functions in specific smart contracts under test, which *should* pick up the issue previously observed even if certain parts of the compiler input are corrupted.  \r\n\r\nI ran 100 recompilations in quick succession and did not observe the issue in that set, consistent with past experience of this as an intermittent bug.  \r\n\r\nI will leave the checks in there and try to keep an eye on it so that if it does dump a contract, I can compare at least the function(s) failing checks to the original.  If the contract passed as input to the compiler matches, I'll assume the problem is in the Solidity compiler.  If the corruption is visible in what's passed to Solidity, I'll assume the problem is in how Truffle prepares that contract for input to Solidity.  In either case, I'll post here.",

    "body": "I suspect addressing [Truffle issue 1650](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/issues/1650) might also yield some clues helpful for addressing this one, especially for any potential solver who, like myself, currently lacks a primary code author's deep understanding of just how the compilation code works. \r\n\r\nBased on that issue, it seems like the compiler is somehow reading the existing compiler output and simply performing modifications, perhaps based on some imperfect assessment of what's changed in the source file, instead of recompiling and overwriting.  When files are occasionally and unpredictably read-locked (e.g. for an automated backup process), this modify-instead-of-overwrite choice can produce erroneous results, such as the one observed in that issue, and with lower probability, maybe even this one.  Because the problem observed here is pulling parameters from elsewhere and nearby in the file, it seems like there might be a problem with read pointers getting misaligned.  The intermittent nature of the problem suggests the possibility of an externally-caused contributing factor.\r\n\r\nWhen originally reporting these issues, my code was inside a OneDrive for automatic backup, where Windows had automatically uncontrollably moved it along with most other user documents.  This may have increased the likelihood of observing the issues, if the random reads for backup purposes were a contributing factor.  (It's still a bug if they were; that should be handled better.)\r\n\r\nIn a separate issue, OneDrive reverted to 2 months prior, which meant the loss of 2 months of work except for the fact that I'd manually made a separate copy elsewhere.  Thanks to that backup, I lost only about a day of work, as well as trust in OneDrive for its ability to perform the core intended function.  The code is now out of OneDrive at least until the next time Windows clamps down on user control to automatically and uncontrollably move things back in.   \r\n\r\nI *suspect* I have not observed the present Issue because of the above-described efforts to avoid recompilation, and because the bug is intermittent.  Statistically, it is not surprising that I haven't observed it.  However, if this issue is made more likely by unpredictable read locks leading to the development of read pointer mismatches and exposes vulnerabilities of the present design, that could also help explain why I haven't observed it recently.
