Since this affects 0.4.25 (fixed for 0.5.0) we should provide some guidance. We considered pushing the macOS binary built on Circle as a Homebrew bottle and then change the formula, so it would try to download this per default. If the download fails, it could still try to build from source.",

If we maintain previous versions of binaries for cask, then they need to be hosted somewhere. The 'normal' path supports versions, the cask path also does, and there's also the 3rd option of creating our own tap, where you can kind of do what you want, within reason.\r\n\r\nWe could potentially offer more than one option I guess. If I look at my cask list it's typically applications with a GUI (ethereum-wallet, mactext, ganache etc), or applications with a lot of complexity and non-typical dependencies for macOS (dotnet-sdk, some other C# applications). So in theory, solidity probably shouldn't be a cask.\r\n\r\nI know that doesn't necessarily make the process easier, and I'm a little unclear about how other Ethereum ecosystem packages relate to each other (with regards to builds etc), but maybe it's better to figure out the underlying issues and make sure we set proper dependencies etc?",
