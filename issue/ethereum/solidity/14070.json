  "body": "Dear Solidity Compiler Engineers\r\n\r\nI hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inquire about the Solidity compilation process, specifically regarding the use of YUL intermediate language.\r\n\r\n1.  I am curious to know whether the Solidity compiler always uses YUL during the compilation process, and what role YUL plays in the overall process.\r\n\r\n 2.  Additionally, I am interested in understanding how the Solidity compiler generates bytecode after completing the lexical, syntax, and semantic analysis phases. I have spent a significant amount of time analyzing the function call relationships in the source code, but have been unable to fully grasp the process.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I do not have your email or other contact information, so I am creating this issue to make my inquiry.\r\n\r\nI greatly appreciate any help and information you can provide on these topics. Thank you for your time and consideration, and I look forward to hearing back from you soon.\r\n\r\nPS: I would like to clarify that my inquiry is not related to the attached files. I apologize for including them, as they were required to submit this issue on GitHub.\r\n[README.md](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/files/11059994/README.md)\r\n\r\n\r\nBest regards\r\n",
