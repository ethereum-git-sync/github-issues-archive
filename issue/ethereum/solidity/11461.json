    "body": "There isn't. It's a limitation of how contracts are executed by the EVM. You're performing an external call (`DELEGATECALL` in this case), which works more like running a separate process on the computer than calling a function inside the same program. The contracts do not share memory, stack, etc. In case of a `CALL` they don't even share storage, though `DELEGATECALL` is different in that regard. They way they communicate is that one serializes the arguments into an area in its own memory and then the other can see that area of memory as calldata and deserialize input from it, following the ABI rules. Calldata is readonly in EVM so you cannot write anything back to it.",
