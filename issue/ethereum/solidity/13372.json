    "body": "Hi @fulldecent !\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this is what you are looking for, but please let me know:\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.18/internals/layout_in_memory.html#layout-in-memory\r\n\r\n```\r\nThere are some operations in Solidity that need a temporary memory area larger than 64 bytes and therefore will not fit into the scratch space. They will be placed where the free memory points to, but given their short lifetime, the pointer is not updated. The memory may or may not be zeroed out. Because of this, one should not expect the free memory to point to zeroed out memory.\r\n\r\nWhile it may seem like a good idea to use `msize` to arrive at a definitely zeroed out memory area, using such a pointer non-temporarily without updating the free memory pointer can have unexpected results.\r\n```",
