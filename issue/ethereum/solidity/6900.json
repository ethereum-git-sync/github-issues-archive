I don't remember exactly what the state was, but if you would like to replace `jsoncpp` with `nlohmann/json`, I could support you. ",

    "body": "> Regarding comments I'm not sure - should we allow them even though they are actually not valid json? I know that json-cpp only supports them in a weird way as well (whether a comment is fine depends on whether it's key-comment-comma or key-comma-comment, if I recall correctly).\r\n\r\nI would say there is no point supporting comments when they are not a valid JSON feature. IIRC we have them disabled as much as jsoncpp allows disabling them.\r\n\r\nAlso apparently nlohman-json now supports CBOR integration: https://github.com/nlohmann/json#binary-formats-bson-cbor-messagepack-and-ubjson\r\n\r\nThis means we could in theory replace our code or at least replace it in the tests. However this is not a pressing issue as our small CBOR code works well and as intended.",
