For example, when using bitmasks, it's more readable to write `0b00111111` than `0x3f`. It probably makes sense to include support for octal literals as well.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nI'm not familiar enough with the codebase or the language to give a good specification. But binary literals should be supported wherever hex or decimal literals are.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nShouldn't be backwards incompatible.\r\n",

    "body": "*Is* it, though :-)? You could conversely say that this issue is an excellent example of why we need a stale bot.\r\nThere is no question that this issue is a valid request. There are no issues with introducing binary literals and they are clearly useful for some purposes. So the only issue here is bandwidth for the actual implementation: we get *a lot* of feature requests that are equally valid, but we also have limited resources and are trying to work on large agenda items that, longer term, will significantly improve the language overall, compared to which valid feature requests like this one unfortunately have to suffer.\r\nBeyond that we try to reserve github mostly for issues that are fully specified and staged for implementation in a finite amount of time, while for anything else we prefer a discussion in [the forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org/) first, which is a good place to collect more community support for a language feature, after which we can make an informed demand-weighted decision on which features we should spend our resources on besides our larger scale roadmap items (unfortunately, not *all* feature requests can be handled shortly).\r\nA comment, by the way, still counts as activity and the stale bot should be removing the stale label now.\r\n\r\nIs that an understandable explanation for the reasoning behind this policy and having a stale bot?",
