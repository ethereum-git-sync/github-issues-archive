  "body": "## Abstract\r\n\r\nThere is no way to declare an integer using a binary literal.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nIt is easier to use binary literal notation for several use cases. For example, when using bitmasks, it's more readable to write `0b00111111` than `0x3f`. It probably makes sense to include support for octal literals as well.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nI'm not familiar enough with the codebase or the language to give a good specification. But binary literals should be supported wherever hex or decimal literals are.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nShouldn't be backwards incompatible.\r\n",
