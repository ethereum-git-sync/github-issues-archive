    "body": "Having read your reddit post, I do not see what bug you are talking about. The way to call revert from Solidity is `revert()` as it is a function, not a language keyword.\r\n\r\nOne can reference and assign a function without ever calling it, e.g.:\r\n```\r\nfunction () {\r\n  var a = revert; // reference and assign\r\n  revert; // reference without assignment\r\n\r\n  a(); // execute\r\n  revert(); // execute\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe referenced issues deal with providing warnings if an empty statement is encountered. That will provide a warning for `revert;`.",
