  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\n`encodeCall` fails when using a function selector of an overloaded function.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version: 0.8.17\r\n- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): 0.8.17\r\n- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Hardhat\r\n- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: Hardhat internal environment\r\n- Operating system: Windows and Mac (tested on both)\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\nAttempt to compile the following code. The error occurs because safeTransferFrom is an overloaded function.\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nimport \"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/IERC721.sol\"; // OpenZeppelin v4.6.0\r\n\r\n(bool transferSuccess, bytes memory transferResult) = address(_erc721Address).call(\r\n    abi.encodeCall(IERC721(_erc721Address).safeTransferFrom, (_ownerAddress, vaultAddress, _erc721Id))\r\n);\r\n\r\n// Error: Member \"safeTransferFrom\" not unique after argument-dependent lookup in contract IERC721\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nI've looked around but could not find this issue mentioned in the repo. I can start working on a PR if the issue looks valid.",
