    "body": "@cameel looking at this issue, I also noted that [build_emscripten.sh](https://github.com/r0qs/solidity/blob/develop/scripts/ci/build_emscripten.sh) creates the `emscripten_build` folder under the solidity directory tree as root.\r\nAs far as I could see, the docker instance needs to run with root user because of [this line](https://github.com/r0qs/solidity/blob/develop/scripts/ci/build_emscripten.sh#L44) to install lz4. The volume is also mounted under the `/root` directory in the emscripten container.\r\n\r\nSince the `build_emscripten` script will run as root in the container to execute the apt-get, the git commands in the script will be performed by a different user, and git will detect the changes in the ownership from the current user when traversing files, which will trigger the issue.\r\n\r\nI do not know why the `lz4` need to be installed in the build script and cannot be directly installed in the [solbuildpackpusher docker image](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity-buildpack-deps/blob/master/docker/Dockerfile.emscripten).\r\nMy proposed solution is that we move the installation of lz4 to that image, letting the script only responsible for building emscripten and not installing dependencies, and change the `docker run` command to run as the current user and mount the volume under the emscripten user, like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndocker run -v \"$(pwd):/home/emscripten/project\" -w /home/emscripten/project \\\r\n    --user \"$(id -u):$(id -g)\" \\\r\n    solbuildpackpusher/solidity-buildpack-deps@sha256:f1c13f3450d1f2e53ea18ac1ac1a17e932573cb9a5ccd0fd9ef6dd44f6402fa9 \\\r\n    ./scripts/ci/build_emscripten.sh \"$BUILD_DIR\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe also need to update the WORKSPACE variable [here](https://github.com/r0qs/solidity/blob/develop/scripts/ci/build_emscripten.sh#L46)\r\n\r\nThis will fix the permissions issues without requiring to change the `safe.directory` configuration. The emscripten user is already created by the base image (emscripten/emsdk) used in the solbuildpackpusher.\r\n\r\nLet me know if this sounds reasonable and I can open a PR with the fix.",

I do think it's better to avoid using `root` in docker images when possible, it's just that that's the easiest way for people to set it up so that's probably why our image does it.\r\n\r\n> I do not know why the lz4 need to be installed in the build script\r\n\r\nIt is installed in the image. See #13424. The one you're looking at looks like an old repo created by @aarlt that we ended up not using. Or is it actually used somewhere? We should either delete it or keep it up to date with our current images, which are in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity-buildpack-deps.\r\n\r\nI don't remember why we install it both in the script and in the image (pinging @Marenz) but this is a very recent change.

    "body": "According to the github documentation it is possible to `allow specified actors to bypass required rules` when using branch protection. And the actor can be a github app but currently it cannot be a github action.\r\n\r\n```\r\nYou can only give push access to a protected branch, or give permission to create a matching branch, to users,\r\nteams, or installed GitHub Apps with write access to a repository. People and apps with admin permissions to a \r\nrepository are always able to push to a protected branch or create a matching branch.\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, there are some suggestions of possible workarounds here: https://github.com/community/community/discussions/13836\r\nBasically, we can: 1) build a github app and grant it access to bypass the pull request rules or 2) have a user who has admin permissions to create a PAT, use it as a secret in the github action. As it will have admin permissions it can bypass the restriction.\r\n\r\nOption 1 seems to be the right direction to go: https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/25305#discussioncomment-3247401\r\nBut maybe this can also work: https://github.com/ridedott/merge-me-action",
