  "body": "While going through *solidity* [documentation](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html) I came across a term 'the owning contract' which i didnt understand.\r\n\r\n> A contract in the sense of Solidity is a collection of code (its functions) and data (its state) that resides at a specific address on the Ethereum blockchain. The line uint storedData; declares a state variable called storedData of type uint (unsigned integer of 256 bits). You can think of it as a single slot in a database that can be queried and altered by calling functions of the code that manages the database. In the case of Ethereum, this is always **the owning contract**. And in this case, the functions set and get can be used to modify or retrieve the value of the variable.",
