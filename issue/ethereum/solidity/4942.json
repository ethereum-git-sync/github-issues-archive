This exists for linux and I believe also exists for Windows. \r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\n1) Create way to generate a distributable binary for Mac. (If there is already a way, then please create the documentation).\r\n1) Distributable means download this file only and not need to install other deps.\r\n1) Upload the distributable binary as part of the releases https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n-- \r\n\r\nNote: Currently we only have binaries that seem to require libz3.\r\n",
