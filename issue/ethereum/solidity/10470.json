  "body": "Maybe a bit of an exaggeration as an issue title ;-), but IMHO we introduced a few inconsistencies in the standard-json interface lately, most prominently https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10064#issuecomment-737117081.\r\nI think we should either revert https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10064, since I think the \"metadata\" argument behind it doesn't actually justify it, or come up with a plan to actually move standard-json towards something for which the metadata argument does hold (i.e. move everything that doesn't end up in metadata ``settings`` out of standard-json ``settings`` e.g. into ``options`` as suggested in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10064#issuecomment-737122018).\r\n\r\nRelated: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9583#issuecomment-737102636",

    "body": "Neither ``outputSelection``, nor ``stopAfter`` really influence metadata (well, the latter or arguably both maybe in that there *won't* be metadata, if stopped early, but that's a bit of a stretch). So I'd say for consistency we'd either need to move those *out* of ``settings`` or we should move ``modelCheckerSettings`` back in. I'd actually even prefer moving all of it out to ``options`` (@leonardoalt also seems to like that, ref https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10064#issuecomment-737135890) - but for that we'd probably need to introduce some deprecation mechanism now and only remove the legacy way later - resp. it would be more breaking than just moving the newly added one, that's the main concern about that idea...",
