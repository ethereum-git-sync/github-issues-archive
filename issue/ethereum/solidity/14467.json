Its a bit painfull, but its ok\r\n  - the target does not revert, but the returned data are not long enough for doing `abi.decode`. This is bad\r\n- Low level call doesn't limit the return data, and is vulnerable to the \"returnbomb\" attack.\r\n\r\nSaid otherwize, if I want to look for an `owner()` in a way that will never revert, regardless of the target address, I have no choice but to go heavily into assembly. That is a simple usecase that solidity does not cover.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nThere are multiple possible solutions:\r\n- change the \"try catch\" behavior so that \"not enough return data for decode\" can be catched.\r\n\r\n- change the `call` and `staticcall` operation by adding a new parameter that is the maximum return data, so that the return bomb is contained.\r\n```solidity\r\ntarget.staticcall{returnsize: 0x20}(abi.encodeCall(IERC5313.owner, ()));\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nTBD",
