  "body": "## Abstract\r\n\r\nFix the try catch pattern.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nThere are many ways to perform an evm call and decode the result:\r\n\r\n#### simple call\r\n```solidity\r\naddress owner = IERC5313(target).owner()\r\n// do stuff with owner\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### try catch\r\n```solidity\r\ntry IERC5313(target).owner() returns (address owner) {\r\n    // do stuff with owner\r\n} catch {\r\n    // process error\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### low level call\r\n```solidity\r\n(bool success, bytes memory returndata) = target.staticcall(abi.encodeCall(IERC5313.owner, ()));\r\nif (success & returndata.length >= 0x20) {\r\n    address owner = abi.decode(returndata, (address));\r\n    // do stuff with owner\r\n} else {\r\n    // process error\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**None of them is safe to call, is you want to make sure that the operation does not revert and that errors can be catched properly!**\r\n\r\n- Simple call will revert is anything wrong happens, that is ok.\r\n- Try catch will revert if\r\n  - the target has no code: that is something we can check before doing the try catch. Its a bit painfull, but its ok\r\n  - the target does not revert, but the returned data are not long enough for doing `abi.decode`. This is bad\r\n- Low level call doesn't limit the return data, and is vulnerable to the \"returnbomb\" attack.\r\n\r\nSaid otherwize, if I want to look for an `owner()` in a way that will never revert, regardless of the target address, I have no choice but to go heavily into assembly. That is a simple usecase that solidity does not cover.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nThere are multiple possible solutions:\r\n- change the \"try catch\" behavior so that \"not enough return data for decode\" can be catched.\r\n\r\n- change the `call` and `staticcall` operation by adding a new parameter that is the maximum return data, so that the return bomb is contained.\r\n```solidity\r\ntarget.staticcall{returnsize: 0x20}(abi.encodeCall(IERC5313.owner, ()));\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nTBD",

This post details the current state of the `try`/`catch` syntax and aims to collect feedback regarding the evolution of this feature in the future.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, your suggestion to fix the `try`/`catch` pattern (revert from decoding when return data is too short) is covered by a few other open issues listed below:\r\n- #11886\r\n- #13869\r\n- #12725\r\n\r\nConsidering the overlap with other open issues, we will be closing this issue and encourage you to participate or keep an eye out for the developments in the [forum discussion](https://forum.soliditylang.org/t/call-for-feedback-the-future-of-try-catch-in-solidity/1497).",
