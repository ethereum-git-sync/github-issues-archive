    "body": "To summarize the current state of this: we want to switch from the namespace being called ``Module`` to calling it ``Solidity`` with 0.7.0.\r\n\r\nWe'd like to get some input about this from everybody who uses ``soljson.js``, though. If you let ``solc-js`` load ``soljson.js`` directly (which might be the case when running on node-js), then we can deal with the renaming inside ``solc-js``.\r\nBut if you manually pass the ``Module`` global defined by ``soljson.js`` to the ``solc-js`` wrapper, then this renaming will require support on your end (which is the likely case for using ``soljson.js`` within the browser).\r\n\r\nDoes anybody pre-define some emscripten-specific fields in ``Module`` like ``Module[\"onabort\"]`` before loading ``soljson.js``? This will even break when using node-js and solc-js and you would have to e.g. define ``Solidity = Module`` on your end for it to continue to work with 0.7.\r\n\r\nSo our main questions are: do you all agree that this is a reasonable change? Will it cause problems for you? Are you prepared to support this in time for 0.7 being released (which *might* happen in about two weeks time already)?\r\n\r\n",

Now.. my guess is that loading remotely in the browser may require all previous compilers to have the \"Solidity\" namespace.",

    "body": "@ekpyron I had this problems in the past where other web assembly components have been registered and use Module as the main namespace, when loaded they will \"compete\" with each other overwriting their space. This has made it impossible to integrate with both. In my context I have seen this (although it might been resolved now as they might have also changed their namespace) with: mono-wasm (.net runtime), unity3d (unity engine) and other projects..
