But if Whiskers is the right way to do that, I am not too sure.\r\n\r\nMy initial motivation was to improve readability of error messages by using semantic colouring, something that would be a convenient argument for using fmtlib (part of C++20's std::format), so that passing custom types to the error formatter could be auto-colorized & pretty-printed without additional effort on the caller side.",
