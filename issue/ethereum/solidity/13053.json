After checking in Remix, I realized the compiler verifies that the assigned value is of the same contract type, so why is this sentence necessary?\r\n \r\n## Pull request\r\n\r\n<!--Please link to your pull request which resolves this issue.-->\r\n",

    "body": "The paragraph just above is talking about conversions, including a conversion through `address` and this sentence essentially warns you about situations like this:\r\n```solidity\r\nERC721 nft;\r\n...\r\nIERC20 token = IERC20(address(nft));\r\n```\r\nThis could be valid if you know that your deployed `ERC721` also implements `IERC20` but the compiler cannot verify that and it could just as well be a mistake.\r\n\r\nI agree that this sentence could be clearer.
