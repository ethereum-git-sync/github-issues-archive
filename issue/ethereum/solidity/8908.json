We have seen this with Swarm, although the CBOR is flexible and this has not caused any issue.\r\n\r\nAn additional benefit of using IPFS/Swarm is it gives an indication where the JSON should/could be found. However at the same time it can be seen as a statement of commitment to either of those systems.\r\n\r\nThe proposal here is to introduce a third option: a raw keccak256 or sha256 hash.\r\n\r\nSince the JSON contains a keccak256 hash of each source, that may be the more natural choice here.",
