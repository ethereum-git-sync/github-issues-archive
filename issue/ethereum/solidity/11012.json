Each one has a page with examples of good and bad code, rationale, etc. I'm not sure if we want to go that much in depth but if we did, I think this is a good example to follow. Or maybe this would work better in a form of a wiki maintained by the community?\r\n\r\nIf we prefer something more compact, we could also revive the FAQ section in the docs.",

Open source-ed-ness is not the issue. Code can validated by third parties at specific revision levels. If you are building a project that will be subject to an audit, an auditor might rely on the findings of already audited code. But if one subsumes said code, then any modification negates said audit, making your audit more time consuming and expensive. So there are entirely valid reasons to need this ability...even more so in the realm of smart contracts where the notion of audit is de rigueur.\r\n\r\nEver owned a farm?

    "body": "Here is another use case for me knowing better about whether I need the warnings or not:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncontracts/mock/implementations/DelegatableMock.sol:59:26: Warning: Unused function parameter. Remove or comment out the variable name to silence this warning.\r\n    function votePowerAt(uint blockNumber) public view override returns(uint256) {return 0;}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have a mock contract. I use it for testing. I know that the variable is unused, thank you very much, but I want that it way. Could I add code to make the warning go away? Sure. But why should I have to? I'd be fine with a hint placed over the line, or specifiable on the command line, acknowledging that help was provided, and I declined to accept it.",

The problem is that we should not write smart contracts in the way that we use trucks as in your example: I would prefer if smart contracts engineers were knowledgeable enough and trucks simple enough such that in case of problem with the truck, the engineer can repair every single aspect of it because she just understands it 100%.\r\n\r\nI'm afraid of a situation where someone writes smart contract code without understanding all its dependencies trusting that the auditor will find any flaws that are present.\r\n",
