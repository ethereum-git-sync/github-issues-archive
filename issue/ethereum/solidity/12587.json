  "body": "## Abstract\r\n\r\nAdd native support for dynamic `immutable` arrays, with a length defined at construction time (up to a maximum) and automatic bounds checks.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\n`immutable` is a fantastic feature, allowing for highly efficient configuration access without forcing developers to use hardcoded constants, making testing and deployment much easier and enjoyable. However, there is zero support for any kind of arrays. \r\n\r\nWhat I describe can be manually implemented today in solc >0.7, but it leads to a very large amount of error-prone boilerplate. No alternative exists for gas-efficient access to these values. You can look at [production code using this pattern here](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/7ff72a23bae6ce0eb5b134953cc7d5b79a19d099/pkg/pool-weighted/contracts/WeightedPool.sol). Using the proposed features in such a contract would reduce sour code size to less than a third of the original length, while also increasing auditability and maintainability.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\n'Dynamic' may be a confusing term. What I mean is that the contents and length would be dynamically defined at construction time. Read access with bounds check using the `[]` operator and `.length` would both be supported. This feature set is essentially the same as that of memory arrays, except memory arrays can have their contents mutated.\r\n\r\nTruly dynamic immutable arrays would be quite an undertaking as the length of the runtime code would be dependent on construction arguments, but I'd argue that going that far is unnecessary. In all applications I've seen, there is a compile-time known maximum array length.\r\n\r\nThe proposed feature could therefore work as follows:\r\n - the user declares an immutable array with a maximum length N (e.g. `uint256[] private immutable(50) foo`)\r\n - the compiler allocates runtime code equivalent to N+1 immutable values, for each element plus the total length\r\n - during construction, both `foo.length` and `foo[i]` can be used to write (not read) to the array. For simplicity, we could allow for each value to be written multiple times and perform no bounds check (other than `.length <= N` and `i < N`).\r\n - during runtime, `foo.length` returns the array's length and `foo[i]` performs bounds check with `foo.length`.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nThis is a new feature using brand new (as of today invalid) syntax, so there should be no backwards compatibility implications.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Extra\r\n\r\n### Code samples\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, this can be implemented today using standard Solidity. See for example how one might declare and use an up to 10 tokens array:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nuint256 private immutable _totalTokens;\r\n\r\nIERC20 internal immutable _token0;\r\nIERC20 internal immutable _token1;\r\nIERC20 internal immutable _token2;\r\nIERC20 internal immutable _token3;\r\nIERC20 internal immutable _token4;\r\nIERC20 internal immutable _token5;\r\nIERC20 internal immutable _token6;\r\nIERC20 internal immutable _token7;\r\nIERC20 internal immutable _token8;\r\nIERC20 internal immutable _token9;\r\n\r\nconstructor(IERC20[] memory tokens) {\r\n    uint256 numTokens = tokens.length;\r\n    require(numTokens < 10);\r\n    _totalTokens = numTokens;\r\n\r\n    _token0 = numTokens > 0 ? tokens[0] : IERC20(0);\r\n    _token1 = numTokens > 1 ? tokens[1] : IERC20(0);\r\n    _token2 = numTokens > 2 ? tokens[2] : IERC20(0);\r\n    _token3 = numTokens > 3 ? tokens[3] : IERC20(0);\r\n    _token4 = numTokens > 4 ? tokens[4] : IERC20(0);\r\n    _token5 = numTokens > 5 ? tokens[5] : IERC20(0);\r\n    _token6 = numTokens > 6 ? tokens[6] : IERC20(0);\r\n    _token7 = numTokens > 7 ? tokens[7] : IERC20(0);\r\n    _token8 = numTokens > 8 ? tokens[8] : IERC20(0);\r\n    _token9 = numTokens > 9 ? tokens[9] : IERC20(0);\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction getTokenIndex(IERC20 token) public view returns (uint256) {\r\n    if (token == _token0) { return 0; }\r\n    else if (token == _token1) { return 1; }\r\n    else if (token == _token2) { return 2; }\r\n    else if (token == _token3) { return 3; }\r\n    else if (token == _token4) { return 4; }\r\n    else if (token == _token5) { return 5; }\r\n    else if (token == _token6) { return 6; }\r\n    else if (token == _token7) { return 7; }\r\n    else if (token == _token8) { return 8; }\r\n    else if (token == _token9) { return 9; }\r\n    else {\r\n        revert(\"Invalid token\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is of course very error-prone and hard to maintain, but it is the best way to get the desired behavior. With the suggested feature, we get the exact same bytecode size and performance using the following code:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nIERC20[] internal immutable(10) _tokens;\r\n\r\nconstructor(IERC20[] memory tokens) {\r\n    _tokens.length = tokens.length;\r\n    \r\n    for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokens.length; ++i) {\r\n      _tokens[i] = tokens[i];\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction getTokenIndex(IERC20 token) public view returns (uint256) {\r\n  for (uint256 i = 0; i < _tokens.length; ++i) {\r\n    if (_tokens[i] == token) {\r\n      return i;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  revert(\"invalid token\");\r\n}\r\n```\r\n \r\n",

For now I moved it up in our design backlog, which will hopefully lead to us discussing it in one of our calls next week.\r\n\r\nThe main problem is that the implementation of this won't be trivial and I guess probably either @chriseth or I would have to do it and I'm not sure when we'll find the time.\r\n\r\nConceptually, the main question I think is whether we want to enforce an \"assign once and do not read\" logic for dynamic immutable types like we do for immutables of value type.\r\nIt would probably in fact be easier to *implement* this, if we were to treat the reference-type immutable just like a ``memory`` variable during the constructor and in that sense allow reassignments and reads from it. However, it'd be counterintuitive for them to be called ``immutable`` while they can be reassigned, even if only during creation (@chriseth objected that to such plans in the past IIRC).",

Having dynamically sized data in the middle of the bytecode would make symbolic analysis of such bytecode even more annoying (perhaps even impossible?) than it already is.\r\n\r\nHere are some things that are already difficult to deal with when symbolically executing (given the existance of dynamic constructor args and static immutables):\r\n\r\n- Determining when we have executed past the end of the bytecode\r\n- Building a mapping between bytecode indices and opcode locations (for source maps)\r\n\r\nThese can currently be worked around as long as dynamic data exists at the end of the bytecode, in this case we can produce an index beyond which all bytecode is known to be a symbolic value, and error out if we attempt to execute past this index (symbolic execution of symbolic opcodes is not a tractable problem). I'm not sure how I would handle this if code could contain arbitrary pieces of symbolic data with an unknown length at any location in the code.\r\n\r\nside note: EIP-3540 cannot come soon enough...",
