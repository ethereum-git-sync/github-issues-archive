Note that external functions of a contract cannot be called while it is being constructed.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, we talked a bit about notices in general and one idea I liked was that notice should not necessarily be about severity but about how much confidence we have that it's not a false-positive. We want tools to provide easy way for users to filter out notices so if a certain suggestion has a reasonable chance of being unnecessary, it could be turned into a notice and users could be encouraged to review notices but not assume that valid code never produces them.",

It's users who treat them as errors, because they don't want to see any console output when they compile. I don't see how this new severity level would fix that, unless these notices are hidden by default. The most reliable way to make them hidden by default would be to make a new separate compiler output that can be opted-in, as opposed to making them part of the same errors list where warnings are found now, where they will just get printed to the console in mostly the same way.\r\n",
