This is why the version is currently reported as `0.6.3-develop.2020.1.28+commit.c8994d9e.Linux.g++` instead of `0.6.3-develop.2020.01.28+commit.c8994d9e.Linux.g++` (the leading zero in the month is removed).

So I agree with @Marenz in that in particular the line here https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1074/files#r367942424 should be reverted, resp. removed (while the leading zero should still be removed from the date).",
