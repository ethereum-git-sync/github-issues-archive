But we could consider adding support for that now - however, maybe using separate files with only one set of expectations each may be less error-prone, I'm not sure.\r\n\r\nIf we decide to go for multiple expectation sections we could add support for ``pragma``'s there as well - this way the experimental 0.5.0 tests could have had the form:\r\n```\r\n...\r\n// ----\r\n// Warning: ...\r\n// ----\r\n// PRAGMA: experimental \"v0.5.0\"\r\n// TypeError: ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis could be of some help for future breaking releases.\r\n\r\nNot really related to this issue, but actually it may even make sense to have a distinguished separator for semantics tests and allow both syntax and semantics expectations in the same test contract, so that we can automatically track warnings in semantics tests as well (this would prevent the current situation of having a lot of deprecated syntax in the end-to-end-tests in the future). So:\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\n// ----\r\n// Warning: ...\r\n// ====\r\n// f(uint, bool) -> 1, true\r\n// -> 0x1234\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm not sure whether it is wise to over-complicate the test case syntax - it may be better to keep things simple or we end up needing tests for the test infrastructure itself :).",

    "body": "Currently ``soltest`` takes a ``--evm-version`` argument that globally sets the evm version to be used with all tests. In SolidityNameAndTypeResolution.cpp, for some test, the test expectations depend on the evm version that is currently set (i.e. different expectations for different evm versions) - still the tests are only run for a specific globally fixed evm version in each run of ``soltest``, not for multiple versions.\r\n\r\nThe evm version that is set using ``--evm-version`` is relevant for a lot of the non-extracted test cases.\r\n\r\nIf we now want to specify the EVM version in the expectations of the extracted syntax tests, then this would override the ``--evm-version`` argument for these tests (I don't think it makes sense to only run extracted tests if the evm version specified in the expectation matches the ``--evm-version`` argument; also specifying multiple expectation blocks with multiple ``EVMVERSION:`` statements and only running one of them depending on the ``--evm-version`` argument may be misleading).\r\nI guess it makes sense to still fall back to the EVM version set using ``--evm-version`` for all test cases that don't explicitly state a version in the expectations.\r\n\r\nI still think it makes sense to move the EVM version to the extracted test expectations, but we have to be aware that is somewhat inconsistent with the way ``soltest`` currently works (i.e. running with one specific, globally fixed evm version).\r\n\r\nI considered suggesting to remove the ``--evm-version`` argument to ``soltest`` altogether and instead to run all tests with a specific set of evm versions, but I think keeping the argument makes sense - we probably don't want to run all tests for multiple, resp. all evm versions in every invocation of ``soltest``, but it still makes sense to be able to run all tests with different default evm versions.
