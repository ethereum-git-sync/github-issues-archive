I will post an update once I have a timeline available to share!\r\n> We are also looking into ways to support this new hardware in our non-dedicated host solution, though we're still researching this and are unable to provide any concrete details at this time.\r\n\r\nThis is probably because [AWS started offering M1 recently](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/12/amazon-ec2-m1-mac-instances-macos/). The \"dedicated host\" option AFAIK means using the [VM service](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/vm-service/) which basically runs CI on your own Amazon AWS account rather than on CircleCI infrastructure. That looks like a lot of hassle compared to our current setup but should be doable once they release it. Not sure if we want to get into that though.\r\n\r\nGithub [did make Big Sur generally available](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-08-16-github-actions-macos-11-big-sur-is-generally-available-on-github-hosted-runners/) in August but there's no mention of M1 so I'm assuming that's still all on x86.",

You can already use the compiler on M1 this way with e.g. Hardhat or Truffle.\r\n\r\nIs there an easy way to cross compile `solc` to apple silicon from x86 linux?",
