  "body": "## Abstract\r\n\r\nAccording the discussion with @chriseth at the FV hangout, it may happen that a contract that compiles with the new Yul-based optimizer does not compile when disabling that optimizer. The reason seems to be a new compiler/optimizer pass that spills stack variables to memory. As far as I understand, when disabling the optimizer, this pass is currently not run and contracts may not compile due to lack of stack space. It would be great if this pass could always be run, independently of other (optimization) passes, to make sure the optimizer can always be disabled if needed.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nUsers should have the option to disable the optimizer. For instance, it seems that without optimization more debug information is preserved and users may want to disable the optimizer when testing/debugging/verifying their code before deployment.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nWhen a user can compile a contract with the new optimizer they should also be able to compile it when disabling the optimizer (e.g., through existing flags/options).\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nThis should not break backwards compatibiliy. In fact, it seems like the current (Yul-based) compilation pipeline breaks backwards compatiblity.\r\n",

    "body": "Responding to https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14149#pullrequestreview-1466030939 but I'll post here for better visibility.\r\n\r\n> One thing we could still check (no need to add tests for it, but just to confirm locally at a few random example cases) is that this won't negatively affect source mappings (given concerns like https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12980#issuecomment-1568278894)\r\n\r\nTo be honest, not sure what to check for so I compared the current source maps with those from 0.8.20.\r\n\r\nIt's actually pretty hard to find non-trivial code to compare because most of our bigger test snippets do not even compile via IR with no optimization before my PR. This includes stuff from `test/libsolidity/semanticTests/externalContracts/`, `test/benchmarks/` and even `test/libsolidity/semanticTests/various/erc20.sol`. So in those terms, whatever source map we get is a clear improvement over not having a source map at all :)\r\n\r\nIn the end I compiled all syntax and semantic tests in a loop and for comparison I selected a few of those that produced the biggest source maps.\r\n\r\nOverall, a vast majority of differences looks like just jump annotations (`i`, `o`, `-`) being moved around. It's hard to say if there's more of them before or after - I suspect they're just at different locations. If I filter that out I see very few other differences (see diffs below). Interestingly, the code with minimal optimization seems to actually have a little more annotated locations (though the difference is not big either way).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Diffs\r\n\r\nDiffs of the output from `solc --via-ir --combined-json srcmap-runtime`, filtered to put each source reference on a separate line and remove the jumps and empty lines.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\nThe exact filters used:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\njq --raw-output '. | select(.contracts != null) | .contracts[].\"srcmap-runtime\"' |\r\n    sed -e 's|$|\\n---\\n|g' |\r\n    sed -e 's|;|\\n|g' |\r\n    sed '/^$/d' |\r\n    sed '/^:::[io\\-]$/d'\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n###
