    "body": "Here's something related: tests on solc versions < 0.6.0 require boost < 1.71.0 to pass. That's because boost 1.71.0 fixed `boost::multiprecision` to respect `std::uppercase` when written to a stream as a hexadecimal number (https://github.com/boostorg/multiprecision/pull/130, https://github.com/boostorg/multiprecision/issues/129). Earlier boost versions were hard-coded to print hex numbers in uppercase.\r\n\r\nSome of our tests relied on that bug - e.g. in solc 0.5.0 test case `Assembler/all_assembly_items` fails . In solc 0.5.13 most of our code was changed to use `std::uppercase` (#7567) but the one affecting that test case seems to have only been included in solc 0.6.0 (#7619, not sure why, maybe it was only included in `breaking`?).",

    "body": "I'm pretty sure that the problem to investigate here (not being able to build 0.4.x with boost 1.69.0 and having to downgrade it to 1.60.0) is what I described in my comment above.\r\n- boost 1.70.0 fails due to the problem with `multiprecision` described above.\r\n- boost 1.65.0 works with all solidity versions between 0.3.6 and 0.6.8. Most likely with newer too.\r\n- For many solidity versions boost 1.63.0 works too, though I don't remember if I tried it specifically with 0.4.26. It worked with at least some 0.4.x versions. I switched to boost 1.65.0 at some point.\r\n- I was not able to try anything below that. boost 1.60.0 cannot be installed directly from homebrew core any more (`Error: boost@1.60 has been disabled because it is a versioned formula!`) and when checking out the formula from an earlier revision it fails too because it depended on something that has been moved/removed. I was only able to build versions 1.63.0 and up.\r\n\r\nAlso note that solc versions below 0.5.0 were not using boost unit test properly which results in `duplicate symbol` errors when linking (#3845). It was fixed in #4572 and the fix can be easily backported to earlier versions. I think affects all boost versions though.\r\n\r\n@chriseth @axic is there anything more to investigate or should we close this issue?",
