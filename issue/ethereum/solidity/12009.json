  "body": "## Abstract\r\nThe compiler does not complain if you use a contract or an interface in places where a fully qualified library name is expected. Such a reference can never work and should be reported as an error.\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n```bash\r\necho 'contract C {}' | solc - --libraries \"<stdin>:C=0x1111111111111111111111111111111111111111\"\r\n```\r\nThis does not produce an error even though `<stdin>:C` refers to a contract and not a library.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\nEach fully qualified library name used in `--libraries`/`settings.libraries` that actually exists and refers to something else than a library should be reported as an error. For example in the above:\r\n```\r\nInvalid link reference: '<stdin>:C'. Not a library.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf possible, this should work that way not only for contracts but also for other names matching the reference. E.g. structs, enums, errors, events.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\nThe code that previously compiled fine with such references will no longer compile so it's a breaking change.",
