    "body": "@leonardoalt could you provide a repro for the profiler run? I'd love to take a jab at this.\r\n\r\nA few questions:\r\n\r\n1. Why aren't nested function call expressions unnested -- design choice, or legacy? It could've enabled more CSE for nested expressions, e.g.,\r\n```solidity\r\n        let expr_9 := checked_add_int256(convert_rational_by_to_int256(expr_7), var_a_2)\r\n        // ...\r\n        let expr_15 := checked_add_int256(expr_9, convert_rational_by_to_int256(expr_7))\r\n```\r\nRegardless, it might be worth to support such nested CSE (by looking up such nested/unnamed values & replacing them with newly inserted variable definitions). I uncovered this pattern from a very simple program:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract C {\r\n    function foo(int a) pure public {\r\n        int a = 2 + a;\r\n        int b = a + 2;\r\n        int c = a * b;\r\n        int d = a * b;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. For the commented inefficient search, any thoughts on using value numbering (simple hash) to look up variable by syntactic value? We could potentially also cache `valueOfNumberLiteral` in the `SyntacticallyEqual` object, and reuse this object in the comparator for the `unordered_map`.\r\n\r\n3. For the same program from (1), any thoughts on supporting CSE for commutative algebraic ops? Should be pretty easy to implement with (2).\r\n\r\n4. Is it really worth looking up values for literals (Number, Boolean, String)? Is it to avoid redundant string alloc? I can't seem to make a program that shows this.",

It could've enabled more CSE for nested expressions, e.g.,\r\n\r\n@StrongerXi They will get \"unnested\" by the `ExpressionSplitter`. The `ExpressionJoiner` would invert the operation. But it's a good question on how often this should be applied. You can look at https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/d5a78b18b3fd9e54b2839e9685127c6cdbddf614/libyul/optimiser/Suite.cpp#L254 and https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/d5a78b18b3fd9e54b2839e9685127c6cdbddf614/libsolidity/interface/OptimiserSettings.h#L44 on how it's being used.\r\n\r\n> For the commented inefficient search, any thoughts on using value numbering (simple hash) to look up variable by syntactic value?\r\n\r\nSounds good. Would be nice to benchmark this change, and we'd accept this if it can improve the performance.\r\n\r\n> For the same program from (1), any thoughts on supporting CSE for commutative algebraic ops? Should be pretty easy to implement with (2).\r\n\r\nAgain, sounds good. For commutativity, we have mostly been relying on https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libevmasm/RuleList.h. If your proposal improves the performance of the optimizer or optimizes more code, we'd be happy to merge it.\r\n\r\n> Is it really worth looking up values for literals (Number, Boolean, String)? Is it to avoid redundant string alloc? I can't seem to make a program that shows this.\r\n\r\nAlso sounds good. I also found all the string manipulation a bit awkward. Maybe you can have a Yul dialect that only has number literals (u256) and perform all operations there.",
