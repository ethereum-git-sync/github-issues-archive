  "body": "OpenZeppelin is currently working on a base-64 library (https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2884) and it turns out that our optimizer is not yet good enough to get to the level of hand-optimized assembly in that case. We should add this code as a test case so that we can use it to evaluate our optimizer improvements.\r\n\r\nIn the PR and its comments you'll find versions of the library with and without inline assembly. Add them both as test cases. I think I'd put them in [`solidity/test/libsolidity/semanticTests/externalContracts/`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/tree/develop/test/libsolidity/semanticTests/externalContracts), which would allow us to see gas usage in both cases. Add some expectations with known good base-64 input/output to make sure the code works correctly (the one I originally posted in comments there was actually buggy).\r\n\r\nIt might also be helpful to have these as command-line tests with `--ir-optimized` ouptut to be able to see changes in the generated Yul.",
