They were already disabled in asan runs.\r\n\r\nThe reason is that we get memory leaks in Z3/spacer.\r\n\r\nWe should still investigate these leaks eventually, respectively instead of adding ``--no-smt`` to the test runs, selectively disable reports from spacer-allocated memory.\r\n\r\nI'm also not sure if linking against the gcc-compiled static z3 library in these clang-based test runs is sane, so we can also see what happens if we use a clang-based static z3 build instead.",
