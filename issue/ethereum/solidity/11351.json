Other tools, like Brownie, probably break in that situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "We have set up ARM builds on another project, but it is rather computationally expensive as it is running in an emulator. I wonder how big of a slowdown that would be for running soltest within that emulator, because without running tests we can't be satisfied it actually works, which reduces its usefulness.\r\n\r\nAnd as you said, macOS still works out of the box. We are waiting for CircleCI to release support, which they may do this year :sweat:\r\n\r\nHowever I really wonder why would projects start doing an ARM Linux build, which is not really used outside of RaspberryPI PC builds? Why not just wait for proper macOS build environments, as that is the target people actually have? Do you know of an example project which already does this?",

Arm is an architecture that is quickly gaining traction for server workloads. Organizations choose Arm because of its faster performance, which results in faster workloads and significant cost savings compared to x86-based architectures. An essential piece of migrating workloads to Arm is having Arm support in your CI system. If you are on a usage-based plan, including the Free plan, you may request access to the Arm preview. We are making two arm64 resources available: arm.medium and arm.large.\r\n>\r\n> To request access, customers must fill out an access form that is linked in the preview docs below.",

    "body": "That looks nice. This is only for the latest version though, isn't it? I don't see any workarounds that would probably be required to build earlier versions. I mean, if none are needed then great, but I needed a ton when I did builds for macOS earlier (see how gnarly [`random-macosx-build.yml`](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/blob/gh-pages/.github/workflows/random-macosx-build.yml) is :))\r\n\r\nBut anyway, if you're interested in upstreaming this, I don't think we'd accept binaries but if @nikitastupin is willing to refactor this script to work in a similar vein to [`random-macosx-build.yml`](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/blob/gh-pages/.github/workflows/random-macosx-build.yml), we'd run it in our CI and build them ourselves.\r\n\r\nOne important thing is that the script must run our test suite on the built binary to verify it's built correctly. At least to the extent that these older versions allowed - the oldest ones didn't and later ones could run only part of the test suite without setting up a node. The action you linked to does not do this and this part is actually what added a lot of complexity in the macOS case. I think it's crucial though.\r\n\r\nIf you do this, you can submit the script in a PR to [solc-bin](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/) and I'll help reviewing it. Here's my PR for macOS: https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/pull/53 for reference. See in particular https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/pull/53#issuecomment-700149493, which explains the specific workarounds needed - most of which hopefully will not be needed on Linux.\r\n\r\nOnce the binaries are built, I'll submit them in a separate PR, which will trigger the bytecode comparison check ([`t-bytecode-compare.yml`](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/blob/gh-pages/.github/workflows/t-bytecode-compare.yml)). This will ensure that the bytecode produced by the binaries is identical with other platforms, at least to the extent covered by our tests.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is only about rebuilding existing versions though. Another part of this task is to add the new platform to our release process. This is fairly straightforward and the blocker here was simply lack of support on CircleCI's part. If you want to submit a PR for that part, it would basically be this:\r\n1) Add a CircleCI job similar to [`b_ubu_static`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/.circleci/config.yml#L788-L803) but running on ARM.\r\n    - I think we'll also need equivalents of `t_ubu_soltest` and `t_ubu_cli` jobs for this platform.\r\n2) Update [`ReleaseChecklist.md`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/ReleaseChecklist.md).",
