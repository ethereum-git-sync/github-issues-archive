    "body": "Docker by default will not pass standard input to the container it runs. You need to add the `--interactive` flag if you want it to:\r\n```bash\r\ndocker run --interactive ethereum/solc:0.8.5 --standard-json < ./src/Compiler/001/config.json\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy the way, if you're just running it manually (i.e. not as a part of some server orchestration where you'd want to inspect the dead container if it crashes), it's a good idea to the `--rm` flag to avoid leaving a stopped container every time you do it (see `docker ps --all`).\r\n\r\nAlso, if you want to be able to interact with a program from the terminal (typing text, etc.) instead of giving it a file you should also add `--tty`. You won't need that with `solc`, because it never requires interactive user input but might be handy if you ever need that for other programs. For example I'm used to doing `docker run -it --rm ...` when running containers because most often that's what I need.\r\n\r\nThis is not a bug in the compiler so I'm closing the issue but feel free to ask if you some other problems :)",

    "body": "Try this:\r\n```bash\r\ndocker run \\\r\n    --rm \\\r\n    --volume \"$PWD/src/Contract:/project/src/Contract\" \\\r\n    --workdir /project \\\r\n    ethereum/solc:0.8.4 \\\r\n        --standard-json src/Compiler/001/config.json \\\r\n        --allow-paths /project | jq --indent 4\r\n```\r\nExplanation:\r\n- When you run the docker image, it does not have access to any directories in your filesystem so it cannot access the files in your working directory. You can use `--volume` option to mount a directory inside the container. Here I'm making `src/Contract` available as `/project/src/Contract` in the container. You can use any path on the container side - does not have to match your local path (though obviously you'll have to adjust JSON if you change it).\r\n    - I used `$PWD` because docker requires an absolute path and I don't know what's that your side. You can just insert the full path directly if you prefer.\r\n- You're using a relative path in your JSON file and relative paths are relative to the working directory of the compiler. And since the compiler is in a container, its working directory is not the directory you're running docker from. Actually, I'm not sure what the working directory is (I'd have to check if we're setting it in `Dockerfile` to something specific) but you can just use `--workdir` option to change it to anything you need. Here I'm setting it to `/project` because in the container it's the directory that contains `src/Compiler`.\r\n    - If the files you are compiling are all inside your working directory, you do not need `--base-path`.\r\n- You need to use `--allow-paths` to tell the compiler that it's fine to load files from within `/project`. If you use `solc` without `--standard-json`, the directories containing all files you specify on the command line are automatically added to allowed paths so you do not have to worry about it unless you import something from outside these paths. But in `--standard-json` mode by default no paths are allowed. In that mode you typically provide source code directly using `content` key. You're using `urls` instead so you need to explicitly allow paths used there.\r\n- Also, now that you have the input JSON file in a volume you can drop `--interactive` and just give `solc` its path instead redirecting standard input.\r\n- Just in case you're not aware: you can use `jq` to get more readable JSON output. There's the `--pretty-json` option but that does not affect Standard JSON. This will likely change though: #11507.\r\n\r\nAlso, an unrelated question: I see you switched from 0.8.5 to 0.8.4. Was it by chance because you ran into https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11522 or some other reason?",

It does have some quirks around `--base-path` and importing from external libraries that we're currently working to iron out (see #11408 and #11409 if you're interested) but it's still more convenient than writing JSON by hand. The path-related docs you have probably seen (https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/path-resolution.html) are a part of that effort. They're still pretty fresh and any feedback is welcome so if there's anything you think could be explained better, feel free to open an issue or submit a PR (or even just comment on specific lines in the original PR: #11442).\r\n\r\nBut to be honest most people do not use the compiler directly. They use it through a framework like Truffle, Hardhat or Brownie or an IDE extension like vscode-solidity. The framework typically downloads and manages compiler binaries for you. Under the hood these frameworks use Standard JSON.\r\n\r\n> and for the switch to 0.8.4, it's just that i'm not alone on this, and we agreed to work on the current stable version, since 0.8.5 does not (at least for the moment, regarding the changelog) give us some utility things.\r\n\r\nOK. Makes sense. I'm asking because I'm interested in how widespread that issue is. I.e. are users running into it often in practice. Everything indicates that it is and we're actually planning to release 0.8.6 with a fix pretty soon.",

If it's complaining only about files you import then it's working as designed.\r\n\r\nBy default you can only import files that are in the same directory as the files you specified on the command line (or its subdirectories). In your case that's files inside `src/Contract/`. If you want to import from any \"side\" directories you have to use `--allow-paths` to tell the compiler that you're doing it on purpose and it's not some malicious library trying to include something from a random directory on your disk.",
