  "body": "## Abstract\r\n[yulopti](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/test/tools/yulopti.cpp) is a simple tool for executing [optimizer step](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/internals/optimizer.html#optimizer-steps) sequences step by step.\r\n\r\nCurrently it only supports raw Yul input (example: [`medium.yul`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/test/libyul/yulOptimizerTests/fullSuite/medium.yul)). It would be convenient if it supported Yul objects as well (example: [`subObjectAccess.yul`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/adc58c67b432ada0d7a4fc68f3de610ba78358c0/test/libyul/objectCompiler/subObjectAccess.yul)).\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nThe compiler never produces raw Yul as output. When invoked with `--ir` or `--ir-optimized`, the Yul code is always wrapped in an object. The object part needs to be stripped for it to be usable with yulopti.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n- Use `ObjectParser` for parsing Yul objects (see how it was done in yul-phaser: #8513).\r\n- yulopti should optimize all objects present in the file, including nested ones.\r\n- (optional) add a command-line flag for selecting a specific object via a dotted path (e.g. `--object x.y.z`)\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\nThis is an internal tool. We don't guarantee backwards-compatibility.",
