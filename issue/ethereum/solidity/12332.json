  "body": "Error messages reported when you try to overload a modifier say that you cannot use the same name but do not say why. I think they should outright say that the cause of the error is that modifier overloading is not allowed. At least until we actually implement it (#72).\r\n\r\n### Example 1: straightforward overloading\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract C {\r\n    modifier m(uint x) { _; }\r\n    modifier m() { _; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```\r\nError: Identifier already declared.\r\n --> test.sol:3:5:\r\n  |\r\n3 |     modifier m() { _; }\r\n  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\nNote: The previous declaration is here:\r\n --> test.sol:2:5:\r\n  |\r\n2 |     modifier m(uint x) { _; }\r\n  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Example 2: overloading by inheriting from two bases\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract A {\r\n    modifier m() { _; }\r\n}\r\ncontract B {\r\n    modifier m(uint x) { _; }\r\n}\r\ncontract C is B, A {}\r\n```\r\nThis case is especially misleading because the message suggests that you should override the modifiers in the derived class but they aren't even virtual.\r\n\r\n```\r\nError: Derived contract must override modifier \"m\". Two or more base classes define modifier with same name.\r\n --> test.sol:7:1:\r\n  |\r\n7 | contract C is B, A {\r\n  | ^ (Relevant source part starts here and spans across multiple lines).\r\nNote: Definition in \"A\":\r\n --> test.sol:2:5:\r\n  |\r\n2 |     modifier m() { _; }\r\n  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\nNote: Definition in \"B\":\r\n --> test.sol:5:5:\r\n  |\r\n5 |     modifier m(uint x) { _; }\r\n  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n```",
