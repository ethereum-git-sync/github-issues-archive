  "body": "Error messages reported when you try to overload a modifier say that you cannot use the same name but do not say why. I think they should outright say that the cause of the error is that modifier overloading is not allowed. At least until we actually implement it (#72).\r\n\r\n### Example 1: straightforward overloading\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract C {\r\n    modifier m(uint x) { _; }\r\n    modifier m() { _; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```\r\nError: Identifier already declared.\r\n --> test.sol:3:5:\r\n  |\r\n3 |     modifier m() { _; }\r\n  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\nNote: The previous declaration is here:\r\n --> test.sol:2:5:\r\n  |\r\n2 |     modifier m(uint x) { _; }\r\n  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Example 2: overloading by inheriting from two bases\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract A {\r\n    modifier m() { _; }\r\n}\r\ncontract B {\r\n    modifier m(uint x) { _; }\r\n}\r\ncontract C is B, A {}\r\n```\r\nThis case is especially misleading because the message suggests that you should override the modifiers in the derived class but they aren't even virtual.\r\n\r\n```\r\nError: Derived contract must override modifier \"m\". Two or more base classes define modifier with same name.\r\n --> test.sol:7:1:\r\n  |\r\n7 | contract C is B, A {\r\n  | ^ (Relevant source part starts here and spans across multiple lines).\r\nNote: Definition in \"A\":\r\n --> test.sol:2:5:\r\n  |\r\n2 |     modifier m() { _; }\r\n  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\nNote: Definition in \"B\":\r\n --> test.sol:5:5:\r\n  |\r\n5 |     modifier m(uint x) { _; }\r\n  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n```",

    "body": "Great! But actually if you later want another issue, I can probably suggest a better one :)\r\n\r\nWe really need to rethink what gets labeled as `good first issue`. For now we've been often putting it on simple issues but when they're unrelated to what we're doing at the moment, their reviews either distract us away from roadmap work or the PRs sit unreviewed for a long time. We should review what's labeled and start selecting more relevant issues for this label. So if for some reason you really want to take this specific one, that's fine, but I could actually find you something that's more aligned with what we do currently :)",
