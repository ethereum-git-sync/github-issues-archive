This will simultaneously ensure we don't break the builds.\r\n- We run bytecode comparison between static and non-static builds.\r\n\r\nIn the longer run, we may reevaluate if we move away from ``dlopen``ing Z3 together with @leonardoalt (either by full static linking suffering the binary size increase, or by moving to calling z3 as binary via smtlib roundtrips causing suffering *for* @leonardoalt)\r\n\r\nPinging @cameel in case I missed anything.\r\n",

    "body": "We *did* note down the plan for this for the upcoming release somewhere, but I cannot find it :-). Maybe it just was in chat and nobody deemed it necessary to note it down here, we should avoid that :-).\r\n\r\nSo to reiterate: we won't go for a long-term fix for 0.8.19, but rather go for the following short term fix:\r\n\r\n- Restore our ubuntu 20.04 buildpak Dockerfile (no need for actually rebuilding it, we just bring it back for reference)\r\n- Change the ``b_ubu_static`` run to use the hash of that old 20.04 docker image - all other CI runs can remain on the 22.04 images.\r\n- That's basically it - now we have working release builds again. To make @cameel happy we can extend bytecode comparison to run between the ``b_ubu_static`` binaries and e.g. the ``b_ubu`` binaries to make sure they behave the same, but I'd even consider that optional.\r\n\r\nLet me know if anything's still unclear.\r\n",
