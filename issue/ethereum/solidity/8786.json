(See the extra `override` after `require`.)\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\npragma solidity >0.0.0;\r\n\r\ninterface ExtensionFactory {\r\n  function deployExtension(address _colony) virtual external;\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract OneTxPaymentFactory is ExtensionFactory {\r\n  function deployExtension(address _colony) override external {\r\n      require (1 == 1) override;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n1. This appeared while trying to upgrade [ColonyNetwork.](https://github.com/JoinColony/colonyNetwork)\r\n2. Low priority since solidity-upgrade is mostly an internal tool and fixing this isn't so important.",
