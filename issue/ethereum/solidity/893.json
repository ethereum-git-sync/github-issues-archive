    "body": "@bobsummerwill Are there examples of successful programming languages that waited to build a standard library until _after_ a packaging system was in place? I can't think of one, but my experience is limited to Perl, JavaScript, Java, and Ruby. I suggest biting the bullet and \"blessing\" some standard components in order to make Solidity a more productive programming environment.\n\n@axic That fine line is extremely hard to find. But in my experience, successful languages tend to cross that line by putting too many _auxiliary_ functions into their standard library. This leads to an annoying amount of std-lib bloat in hindsight, but was likely one of the reasons for the language's survival: early developers could depend on higher level abstractions and get down to the business of building even more powerful programs.\n\nJust my 2 ETH 😄 \n",
