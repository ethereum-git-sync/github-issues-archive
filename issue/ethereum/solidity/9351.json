    "body": "Ah, ok - I somehow expected it to need some magic standard-json produced by truffle or sth and not that it's just the plain contract file that works just as it is :-).\r\n\r\nBut yeah, I just tried this with https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10147 merged together with https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10015 and commenting out the one offending ``setupOwners(_owners, _threshold);`` line. EDIT: actually changing ``address[] calldata _owners`` to ``address[] memory _owners`` in GnosisSafe.sol:L57 in fact allows to keep the ``setupOwners`` thing uncommented. It's the byte array from calldata to memory copy that is unimplemented, but moving the entire function argument to memory works already.\r\n\r\nWith disabled memory guards I still get:\r\n```\r\n$ build/solc/solc --experimental-via-ir --bin --optimize ../safe-contracts/contracts/GnosisSafe.sol \r\nException during compilation: /solidity/libyul/backends/evm/EVMObjectCompiler.cpp(66): Throw in function void solidity::yul::EVMObjectCompiler::run(solidity::yul::Object&, bool)\r\nDynamic exception type: boost::wrapexcept<solidity::yul::StackTooDeepError>\r\nstd::exception::what: Variable param_13 is 2 slot(s) too deep inside the stack.\r\n[solidity::util::tag_comment*] = Variable param_13 is 2 slot(s) too deep inside the stack.\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut if I also force-enable the memory guards (even ignoring the assembly, i.e. instead of just reverting https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10047 forcing ``_useMemoryGuard`` to ``true`` there), then it actually compiles:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ build/solc/solc --experimental-via-ir --bin --optimize ../safe-contracts/contracts/GnosisSafe.sol \r\nWarning: This is a pre-release compiler version, please do not use it in production.\r\n\r\nWarning: SPDX license identifier...\r\n\r\n======= ../safe-contracts/contracts/GnosisSafe.sol:GnosisSafe =======\r\nBinary:\r\n608060405234156100...\r\n```\r\nOf course, I have no idea if what it compiles is actually correct ;-). But it at least looks like the stack limit evader stuff can theoretically work with this.\r\nAlthough unfortunately the inline assembly in those contracts actually allocates memory and all - so to properly support compiling this by default, we'd really need a proper yul-with-memory-objects dialect and rewrite the assembly parts of those contracts in that dialect.\r\n\r\nBut yeah - I was just curious about that, I'll be off again now :-). But I'm looking forward to see if there's any progress on that last missing feature and on https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10057 when I'm back in December ;-)!",
