  "body": "The following issue is a list of pull requests that introduced test exclusions in order to allow ongoing development of experimental Solidity in `develop`. Some features covered by tests had to be disabled (e.g. AST output, metadata, etc.) as they're not currently supported (at the time of writing this issue), and should thus be re-enabled once these features are supported. The purpose of this issue is to simply track these exclusions so they're not accidentally forgotten.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14524\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14536\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14722\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14727\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14727",
