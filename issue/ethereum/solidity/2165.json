    "body": "Hello everyone. As I've been referenced here, I might share a few thoughts how this is done in [solc-typed-ast](https://github.com/ConsenSys/solc-typed-ast). The most of the logic is concentrated in following directory: https://github.com/ConsenSys/solc-typed-ast/tree/master/src/ast/writing (mostly in `ast_mapping.ts` and `yul_mapping.ts`).\r\n\r\nWriting AST to source code is mostly trivial task, aside from few considerations:\r\n- **Version compatibility** - produced source code may differ for various compiler versions. We slightly (not completely) compensate that by allowing to pass target compiler version and checking if we need to adjust output to fit into requirements in the most cases.\r\n- **Source mapping** - for some of dependent packages like [Scribble](https://github.com/ConsenSys/scribble), there is a need to map produced source code fragments back to AST nodes. We produce complete map `node -> string`, but I guess there should be a way to have a workaround with `nodeId -> string` (as this is still mappable back and node ids are unique within the tree).\r\n- **Indentation / Whitespace** - AST representation removes any information about whitespace and indentation. First minimal thing is to separate identifiers by at least a single whitespace. For better readability we introduced simplified formatting components that allows to regulate indentation. It may also worth to postpone such functionality to linters.\r\n\r\nFor us, AST-to-source conversion been beneficial for the following reasons:\r\n- Testing AST and detecting bugs like\r\n  - #11196\r\n  - #11324\r\n  - #9552\r\n  - #7758\r\n- Tree/Source modification support allowing tools like [Scribble](https://github.com/ConsenSys/scribble) to exist. So I guess community will benefit from getting the feature.\r\n\r\nOfc, I do not think that all of the points above are related to the current scope of \"_just writing source from an AST_\". My intention here is to share some experience and ideas, also indicate some caveats of the feature alongside with possible benefits.\r\n\r\nRegards.",
