Sometimes, it is important to have a full run on the change because the CI run also creates binaries and might deploy them somewhere. If that doesn't work, we might be completely stuck on e.g. a release.\r\n\r\nI think the better way forward would be to move as much as possible away from travis. Circle seems to be much faster and also better with caching.",
