  "body": "### Description\r\nIn Solidity we distinguish between internal and external library calls by whether the function is qualified with a library name or not. Generally, a qualified call (`L.f()`) is external while an unqualified one (`f()`) is internal. The only exception are internal functions - in that case `L.f()` is an internal call.\r\n\r\nThis behavior should be preserved when the function is attached via `using for`. Whether the call is internal or external should depend on whether `using {L.f}` or `using {f}` was used. Currently this is not the case - there is no difference between these two directives.\r\n\r\n### How to reproduce\r\n\r\n#### Public functions\r\nAttached public functions are currently called externally (which is not allowed in libraries), even if unqualified in `using for`:\r\n```solidity\r\nlibrary L {\r\n    using {publicFunction} for uint;\r\n\r\n    function publicFunction(uint) public pure {}\r\n\r\n    function test(uint x) public pure {\r\n        x.publicFunction(); // Error: Libraries cannot call their own functions externally.\r\n        publicFunction(x);  // internal call\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n`x.publicFunction()` here should be an internal call as well and compile without errors.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Private functions\r\nAttached private functions are always called internally, even if qualified in `using for`:\r\n```solidity\r\nlibrary L {\r\n    using {L.privateFunction} for uint;\r\n\r\n    function privateFunction(uint) private pure {}\r\n\r\n    function test(uint x) public pure {\r\n        x.privateFunction();  // internal call\r\n        L.privateFunction(x); // Error: Member \"privateFunction\" not found or not visible after argument-dependent lookup in type(library L).\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n`x.privateFunction()` here should be an external call and produce a compilation error.\r\n\r\n#### External functions\r\nExternal library functions are currently not usable with `using for` (#13765) but after that's fixed (#13855), the following example is going to be inconsistent:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nlibrary L {\r\n    using {externalFunction} for uint;\r\n\r\n    function externalFunction(uint) external pure {}\r\n\r\n    function test(uint x) public pure {\r\n        x.externalFunction(); // external call\r\n        externalFunction(x);  // Error: Undeclared identifier. \"externalFunction\" is not (or not yet) visible at this point.\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n`x.externalFunction()` here should be an external call and produce a compilation error.\r\n\r\n### Specification\r\n- Given `using {f}`, `x.f()` should be equivalent to `f()`.\r\n- Given `using {L.f}`, `x.f()` should be equivalent to `L.f()`.\r\n- Make sure the fix does not break functions qualified in different ways. For example `M.f()`, where `M` is a module and `f()` is a free function should always be an internal call.\r\n- Calling the function in presence of conflicting directives (i.e. both `using {f}` and `using {L.f}` for the same type) should be an error.\r\n    - Unless the function is internal. Then it is allowed.\r\n    - To avoid introducing non-backwards-compatible changes, the error should be issued at the point of call. If the function is not actually called, it's not an error.\r\n    - Note that the conflict may exist only in some scopes, not everywhere. E.g. if there is a file-level `using {L.f}` and one library has `using {L}` while another does not.\r\n    - For the external case it would be fine to produce an error directly in the directive because such use currently an error (though this will change when #13765 is fixed).",

    "body": "Regarding the private variant, the alternative, non-breaking idea is to make private functions work the same way internal ones do. I.e. both `using {L.f}` and `using {f}` would work for them and `x.f()` would always resolve into an internal call. This one would also require making it possible to call private functions via `L.f()` inside the library that defines them, which is currently a compilation error.\r\n\r\nI think it's more likely that we'll choose this way so I'd suggest implementing that, keeping in mind that we might change that decision on the next design call.",
