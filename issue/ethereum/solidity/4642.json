    "body": "As far as I can tell, the way `x` and `*` are used in solc does not match their corresponding behavior in npm. In npm, `1.x ` denotes the range `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0-0`. The npm documentation says nothing about putting `x` variables inside range bounds, which solc allows. For example, I can compile a sol file that includes the line `pragma solidity >0.x.0;`; this is useless because I could just write `pragma solidity >0.0.0` instead.\r\n\r\nIt might be a good idea to prohibit the use of `x` and `*` in conjunction with `<`, `<=`, `>`, and `>=`.\r\n ",
