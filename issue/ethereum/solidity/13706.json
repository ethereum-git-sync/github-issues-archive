  "body": "The code checking if integers used in `pragma solidity` uses `unsigned int` as the underlying type and relies on its overflow behavior, which means that the range depends on what platform the compiler was built for: [`unsigned` can be 16- or 32-bit long](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/types).\r\n\r\nFor example this pragma may or may not be allowed, depending on the platform:\r\n```solidity\r\npragma solidity >=0 <=65536;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe code using such a pragma would pass source verification on some platforms but not on others.\r\n\r\nTo fix this we should use a type with a platform-independent size, either `uint16_t` or `uint32_t`.\r\n\r\nI think this is a bug, ~though it could also be seen as a breaking change~. EDIT: Actually not breaking if we use `uint32_t` - then all the code that used to compile would still compile.\r\n\r\n### Affected code\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/8df45f5f8632da4817bc7ceb81497518f298d290/liblangutil/SemVerHandler.cpp#L262-L271",
