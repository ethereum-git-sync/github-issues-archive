  "body": "I would really like to drop support for old boost, because we are adding workarounds for old boost versions (most recently some pragma cleanup in #4602).\r\n\r\nThe reason we are tied to boost 1.54 (released in 2013!) is the fact hat @chriseth wants to keep compilation supported on Ubuntu LTE versions and Trusty Tahr has 1.54.\r\n\r\nInteresting fact, Xenial has 1.58.0 and for that version we include a header to fix some bugs in `boost::multiprecision` (which Solidity makes a great use of): https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libdevcore/Common.h#L48-L55\r\n\r\nWould the following workaround be possible? We select a Boost baseline (1.67 IIRC to have all the workarounds removed) and if the system wide installation is lower than that, the we download & build are own version for static linking.\r\n\r\nI believe this should be possible with CMake, @chfast is that correct?\r\n\r\nAlso wondering about @ekpyron's view on this.",

    "body": "I think this would make a lot of sense. Maintaining compatibility with a broad range of versions of boost is always a pain and that's unlikely to get better in the future.\r\nWe could discuss which version of boost makes up a good baseline as a compromise between the needed amount of workarounds and the need to build a custom version on various distros. Maybe 1.67 is too much - statically linking hurts the binary size and having to download and build boost is some discomfort, so best not to force the majority of users to do so. 1.58 would be a good candidate if not for the ``boost::multiprecision`` bug, which is a strong argument against it.\r\n\r\nBy the way, in the long term I would still love to remove the dependency on boost altogether :). I think @christianparpart supports that, but even if we seriously consider that, it would be a major undertaking and maybe it makes more sense to wait until we can require C++17 - and I think @chriseth is rather sceptical.",

    "body": "Since this issue was referenced by @axic recently: in the meantime we solved the PPA build issue for trusty by re-using entirely static binaries built on newer ubuntu versions for the packages for trusty.\r\n\r\nSo in the meantime we're free to decide to bump basically to any minimum boost version that is available in *some* ubuntu release. Currently the newest option is 1.67 in cosmic. For any older ubuntu versions we can always decide to switch to static builds for the PPAs.\r\n\r\nWe can also decide to be more conservative and first keep compatibility with 1.58 for shared linking on xenial or with 1.65 for shared linking on bionic (I think it's reasonable to still fully support bionic for a while, so not to go beyond 1.65 for now as minimal requirement, but we can argue about choosing between 1.58 and 1.65, respectively shared or static PPA builds for xenial in the future).",
