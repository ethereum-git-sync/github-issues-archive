  "body": "<!--## Prerequisites\r\n\r\n- First, many thanks for taking part in the community. We really appreciate that.\r\n- We realize there is a lot of information requested here. We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.\r\n- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:\r\n    - [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)\r\n    - [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)\r\n- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.\r\n- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.\r\n\r\n*Delete the above section and the instructions in the sections below before submitting*\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nI find the following error message confusing, implemented in [libsolidity/analysis/ViewPureChecker.cpp](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libsolidity/analysis/ViewPureChecker.cpp), line 249.\r\n\r\n```\r\nFunction declared as view, but this expression (potentially) modifies the state and thus requires non-payable (the default) or payable.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is what you get if you try to modify state in a `view` or `pure` function, which is common for a beginner. This is thus one of those messages where the compiler acts as a teacher.\r\n\r\nI don't think every user has the mental model \"there are four mutability modifiers: non-payable, payable, view and pure\". It is [featured in the documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.11/grammar.html?highlight=non-payable#a4.SolidityParser.stateMutability), but not prominently or beginner-friendly. My own mental model up until now has been that payable/non-payable is one category of modifiers, and pure/view is another, even though I was aware that a pure or view function can't be payable. The mental model of these being four mutually exclusive mutability levels makes sense, but I just never acquired it before.\r\n\r\nGiven that, I think a more sensible, helpful error message would be one that is more instructive in *what needs to change* (Rust is really good at this):\r\n\r\n```\r\nFunction declared as <view|pure>, but this expression (potentially) modifies the state. Remove the <view|pure> modifier.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe question of whether a function should be payable or not is, to some extent, different, and would be addressed by other error messages if the user invokes `msg.value` or `callvalue()`.\r\n\r\nI know there is discussion about making mutability explicit on all functions (by requiring `payable` or `nonPayable`).\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version: 8.12\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract Foo {\r\n    uint private localVal = 0;\r\n    function read() public view {\r\n        localVal = 1;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```",
