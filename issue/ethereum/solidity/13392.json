Try installing it with `gem install octokit -v 4.25.1`\r\n  \toctokit requires Ruby version >= 2.7.0. The current ruby version is 2.6.0.0.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nAny run of buildpack-deps should trigger this. For example, https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13386\r\n",

My guess would be that there's ready-made alternatives with the same and/or similar functionality we could use as a replacement and which would lower our maintenance burden.",
