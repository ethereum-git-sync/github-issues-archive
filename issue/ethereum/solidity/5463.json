We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.\r\n- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:\r\n\t- [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)\r\n\t- [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)\r\n- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.\r\n- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThe release version of v0.4.25 is declared as a pre-release and contracts don't compile.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version: v0.4.25\r\n- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings):\r\n- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): n/a\r\n- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: n/a\r\n- Operating system: OS X, but doing this in `python:3.6` docker image\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nI'm installing the Solidity compiler with the following command:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone --recursive -b release https://github.com/ethereum/solidity\r\ncd ./solidity\r\ngit checkout tags/v0.4.25\r\ncmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DTESTS=0 -DSTATIC_LINKING=1\r\nmake solc && install -s solc/solc /usr/bin\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen compiling the following file:\r\n\r\n```\r\npragma solidity ^0.4.25;\r\n\r\ncontract ReadBool {\r\n    bool public flag;\r\n\r\n    function read_bool() public constant returns (bool) {\r\n        return flag;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`solc` complains with the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWarning: This is a pre-release compiler version, please do not use it in production.\r\nE           <stdin>:1:1: Error: Source file requires different compiler version (current compiler is 0.4.25-develop.2018.11.21+commit.59dbf8f1.Linux.g++ - note that nightly builds are considered to be strictly less than the released version\r\nE           pragma solidity ^0.4.25;\r\nE           ^----------------------^\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you see the commit matches the release version 0.4.25 as listed [here](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases):\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/224585/48821089-acd79480-ed0c-11e8-9933-4caab211df97.png)\r\n\r\nAny thoughts that could help me resolve this? Appreciate it!\r\n",
