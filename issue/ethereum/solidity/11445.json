    "body": "Thanks for the report! I can confirm that this still happens on 0.8.4 and affects the new codegen too:\r\n```\r\nInternal compiler error during compilation:\r\n/solidity/libsolidity/codegen/ir/IRGeneratorForStatements.cpp(1948): Throw in function virtual void solidity::frontend::IRGeneratorForStatements::endVisit(const solidity::frontend::MemberAccess&)\r\nDynamic exception type: boost::wrapexcept<solidity::langutil::InternalCompilerError>\r\nstd::exception::what:\r\n[solidity::util::tag_comment*] =\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem appears to be not the multiple inheritance by itself but the fact that `I.x()` (which has no implementation) comes before `A.x()` in the [C3 linearization order](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contracts.html#index-21). The code generator tries to replace `super.x()` with a call to it and fails because of the missing definition. I think it should be skipped and `A.x()` should be called in its place.\r\n\r\nBy the way, if you need a workaround for this bug, it's enough to change the order in which `B` inherits from other contracts. If you change it to `B is I, A`, the code will compile.",
