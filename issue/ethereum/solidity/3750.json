    "body": "Hi @vs77bb ,\r\n\r\nI'm trying to submit a request to Gitcoin Faucet, but it returns an error:\r\n\"The submitted github profile shows a pending faucet distribution.\"\r\n\r\nThe weird thing is that i haven't submitted a previous request. The only thing I did before was check the URL before going out of home.\r\nIs there a way to see if I really have a pending distribution?\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n",
