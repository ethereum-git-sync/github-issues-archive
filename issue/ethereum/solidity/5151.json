SO I tried two things that I have in a branch, and here's a gif where you can see my rough ideas in progress.\r\n\r\nI added:\r\n\r\n- RTD does have these expandable plus icons that let you see the structure of docs without having open them. Added them so you can see how they work.\r\n- With Sphinx and RTD you can create multiple groups of `toctree`s and manually determine the order. While the links under each of the sections I've created in the gif are not final, hopefully you get the idea.\r\n\r\nOK, and if you like both or either of these ideas, then I can work on the final changes.\r\n\r\n![2018-10-30_15-28-36](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42080/47726939-c892d200-dc5b-11e8-96b3-ddb610a22353.gif)\r\n",
