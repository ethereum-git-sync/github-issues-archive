However, it could save notable time by instead just parsing enough to get the contracts and function signatures which is all that is needed by the importer.\r\n\r\nCompilation time on some of my contracts is up to minutes because the import hierarchy is large.  I would really like to get this number down, and one way would be if imported contracts weren't fully compiled and instead were just parsed.",
