  "body": "## Abstract\r\n\r\nCompiler configuration should contain a way to provide a target features and a list of precompiles with corresponding addresses. For now it contains an option `target`, which is a hardfork ID and is using for hardcoded features detection.\r\n\r\nThe `target` option should accept a path to the feature json file, which contains flags like `supportReturnData`, `hasStaticCall`, `hasChainId`, etc, and a list of precompiles.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nSolidity should be a compiler for all Ethereum chains. Other chains could have another feature implementation schedule. So it's making Solidity a mainnet/coredev language and doesn't allow another usages of Ethereum and Solidity. \r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\n### Option `target`\r\n\r\nOption target should be:\r\n\r\n* one of a hardfork names,\r\n* a path to the features json file conteined FeaturesDescription,\r\n* a features object.\r\n\r\n### FeaturesDescription\r\n\r\nThis object contains `flags` and `precompiles`.\r\n\r\n### `FeaturesDescription.flags`\r\n\r\nFlags option contains the same options as presented in [EVMVersion.cpp:84](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/be0775da499415911b6be891e7ab60cc09e676c2/liblangutil/EVMVersion.h#L82):\r\n\r\n- `hasReturnData`\r\n- `hasStaticCall`\r\n- `hasBitwiseShifting`\r\n- `hasCreate2`\r\n- `hasExcodeHash`\r\n- `hasChainId`\r\n- `hasSelfBalance`\r\n\r\n### `FeaturesDescription.precompiles`\r\n\r\nThis is a precompiles configuration which is a dictionary which provide precompile name, its interface and an address.\r\n\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"sha256(bytes)\": \"0x00...01\",\r\n  \"ecrecover(uint32, uint32, uint8)\": \"0x00...02\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThus precompiles could contain custom set of functions. What could be helpful to implement and test some features before they lend into solidity itself. Whats therefore could speedup Ethereum development and is helpful for researches, experiments.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nIt's backward compatible feature request.",

And developers should be able to upgrade features independently. This is my case.\r\n\r\nWhat's about others' and gas cost. It seems like a common problem to other projects. EthereumJS team is working on a solution to upgrade gas cost and opcodes executables on the fly and it seems reasonable to have common standard for migration. I wish it to be more flexible.\r\n\r\nI see the most common problem here is that the whole process of development has several bottlenecks which reduce the final count of developers involved into the process. Every single feature should pass a long chain of discussions before it will lend into the project and other developers could use it. I think it could be improved with customisable compiler to let others touch features faster to analyse caveats and improve the final code before it will be written and merged by the core team.",
