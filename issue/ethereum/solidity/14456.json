  "body": "<!--## Prerequisites\r\n\r\n- First, many thanks for taking part in the community. We really appreciate that.\r\n- We realize there is a lot of data requested here. We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.\r\n- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:\r\n    - [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)\r\n    - [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)\r\n- Ensure the issue isn't already reported (check `feature` and `language design` labels).\r\n- If you feel uncertain about your feature request, perhaps it's better to open a language design or feedback forum thread via the issue selector, or by going to the forum directly.\r\n    - [Solidity forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org/)\r\n\r\n*Delete the above section and the instructions in the sections below before submitting*\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Abstract\r\n\r\nI propose that configuration related to the language toolchain live with Solidity, rather than with frameworks. This is inspired by the TypeScript ecosystem, in which `tsconfig.json` and `package.json` are canonical, and TypeScript tooling can just look at those for any project, whereas files like `.eslintrc.json`, `.prettierrc.json`, and `webpack.config.js` are optional and specific to the particular tooling, since they are only needed by the respective tools.\r\n\r\nMaybe I'm overcomplicating this proposal but I just want to see `solc --lsp` become viable.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nFramework configuration should live with frameworks; for example it would make no sense to put fuzzer settings in a `solidity.toml` file. However, Solidity configuration should IMO live in a Solidity configuration file, so that Solidity dev tooling can be framework-agnostic.\r\n* There are a number of competing LSPs [[1]](https://github.com/juanfranblanco/vscode-solidity) [[2]](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat-vscode) [[3]](https://ackeeblockchain.com/woke/docs/latest/language-server/). None of these care about framework features, yet all of them must implement framework detection and therefore there is a lot of redundant effort and logic that goes into simply reading the language.\r\n* `solc --lsp` is unlikely to be competitive with these LSPs, since it doesn't implement framework detection, nor should it (it should be framework-agnostic). Yet, it seems ideal for `solc --lsp` to be the future, with [responsive compilation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6b44kMS6OM) at the core of `solc` [[1]](https://matklad.github.io/2023/01/25/next-rust-compiler.html).\r\n* If you develop a new framework, you have to go upstream to a bunch of third-party IDE tooling before your framework becomes nice to adopt, otherwise Solidity just won't work.\r\n* It is probably annoying to go framework-less. Likely what you would do is accumulate a variety of shell scripts or Makefile that contain the command-line flags that you want to use, and these would be opaque to IDE tooling.\r\n* Tools like [`crytic-compile`](https://github.com/crytic/crytic-compile) should probably not need to exist. That seems like a symptom of something.\r\n* The [\"Solidity Compiler\" section of `foundry.toml`](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/config/solidity-compiler) should not need to exist\r\n\r\n### Possible counterpoints\r\nTechnically, projects like TypeScript and `rust-analyzer` do capitulate to the configurations of other tools in the sense that `\"moduleResolution\": \"nodenext\"` and `node_modules/` are a Node.js thing rather than a TypeScript thing (and Yarn PnP was punished sorely for not following this standard) and now we even have `\"moduleResolution\": \"bundler\"`; likewise, `cargo` is enshrined in `rust-analyzer` (but also `cargo` is developed under the `rust-lang` org and there seems to also be some interest in a `rustc` rewrite / [sharing with `rust-analyzer`](https://rust-lang.github.io/compiler-team/minutes/design-meeting/2019-09-13-rust-analyzer-and-libraryification/) for incremental compilation etc so maybe that itself is a learning).\r\n\r\nCounterpoint to this counterpoint: it's still the case that you can run a build tool like `tsup` completely separately from a package manager like `pnpm` (neither has to know about the other); but if you're using `forge` as your package manager then you should also be using `forge` as your build tool and your IDE tooling needs to know about `forge` etc... so Solidity's situation is definitely different from TypeScript or any other modern language.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\nSolidity would look for the nearest `solidity.toml`, unless a `--config` file is passed in. \r\n\r\nAny `solc` CLI args could also be specified in the `[solc]` section of `solidity.toml`, analogous to `tsconfig.json` `compilerOptions`. Especially analogous to \"moduleResolution\", \"baseUrl\", and \"paths\" (actually I agree with the outcome of #12603 that it shouldn't be `remappings.txt` - one remapping per library seems inefficient). include/exclude also very important for things like building the whole project, or loading the whole project for \"go to references\".\r\n\r\nValues passed in via the CLI take precedence over values specified in `[solc]`. One consequence of this is that frameworks can still be opinionated e.g. about auto-detection of remappings and `solc` version, by adding command-line flags as before, or by modifying the `solidity.toml` file so that framework-agnostic IDE tooling could pick it up.\r\n\r\nIf any non-`solc` sections are included in `solidity.toml`, they are ignored by `solc`. This is similar to how one may add plugin configurations in `package.json` (e.g. `husky`) or `pyproject.toml` (e.g. `tool.black`).\r\n\r\nOne should also be able to specify the `solc` version under `[solc]`, which would behave like [the \"engine\"/\"engineStrict\" field in package.json](https://www.marcusoft.net/2015/03/packagejson-and-engines-and-enginestrict.html); the `solc` binary would mostly ignore this field or at most print out a warning if the version doesn't match; the field would exist for the benefit of other tooling.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nIf `solidity.toml` doesn't exist, there should be no changes to `solc` behavior. Thus users would have to opt in to see behavior changes.\r\n",
