Thus HTTPServerError is better than HttpServerError.\r\n\r\nPlease strengthen this note to one of either:\r\n\r\n1. > When using abbreviations in CapWords (or mixedCase), capitalize all the letters of the abbreviation. Thus HTTPServerError is better than HttpServerError.\r\n\r\n2. > When using abbreviations in CapWords, capitalize all the letters of the abbreviation.
