  "body": "It now seems possible to build soljson.js with integrated Z3 support.\r\nThe resulting binary seems to work, but is significantly larger, i.e. ~~30MB~~ 19MB instead of 8MB.\r\n\r\nWe can either build with Z3 by default or - if the increased size is a major concern - publish a second version (maybe marked as experimental) with Z3 enabled.\r\n\r\nFor the build process, I think it would make sense to finally also create a docker file for the emscripten build that contains prebuilt z3 and boost.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps used to produce a working SMT enabled soljson.js:\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nI used the docker image we use for our CI runs as basis: trzeci/emscripten:sdk-tag-1.39.3-64bit\r\n\r\nI checked out the 4.8.7 tag of Z3 and applied https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/commit/e212159f4e941c78fc03239e0884f2f0454f581f to it.\r\nThen I was able to build z3 with emscripten as follows:\r\n```\r\nemconfigure python scripts/mk_make.py --staticlib --staticbin --single-threaded --x86 --prefix=/emsdk_portable/emscripten/sdk/system/\r\nemmake make -C build/ -j8\r\nemmake make -C build/ install\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen I changed ``find_package(Z3 4.6.0)`` to ``find_package(Z3)`` in ``libsolidity/CMakeLists.txt`` (providing an up to date native /usr/bin/z3 might make this unnecessary).\r\n\r\nThen ``scripts/travis-emscripten/install_deps.sh`` and ``scripts/travis-emscripten/build_emscripten.sh``, should build a soljson.js, but still without Z3 support.\r\n\r\nRerunning cmake in ``emscripten_build`` as ``cmake -DZ3_LIBRARY=/emsdk_portable/emscripten/sdk/system/lib/libz3.a -DZ3_INCLUDE_DIR=/emsdk_portable/emscripten/sdk/system/include`` and rerunning ``make`` builds ``soljson.js`` with Z3 support in ``emscripten_build/libsolc``.\r\n\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n--------\r\n- clean up this build process. We can try building using ``emcmake.py`` instead of ``emconfigure``, that way we might get cmake files that will help in ``find_package(Z3)``'s auto-detection.\r\n- pack the Z3 build (and while we're at it the boost build) into a docker image and switch the CI builds to it\r\n- have a look into https://github.com/cpitclaudel/cvc4.js/blob/master/vm/provision.sh and figure out if we can also enable CVC4 and what that means for binary size and if it's worth it.\r\n- decide if the soljson.js builds should have z3 integrated by default or whether we want separate builds\r\n- Check if any compile time options for Z3 are available that could reduce binary size.",

But I'd imagine another increase of approximately the same magnitude and since CHC only works for Z3, I'd choose that, if we have to choose only one.\r\n\r\n@axic Recently I heard someone talking about wasm supporting dynamic libraries... https://webassembly.org/docs/dynamic-linking/ sounds like it... do you know if that works well and is sufficiently supported by browsers and all? It'd be kind of fancy to be able to plug the solvers in at runtime as needed :-D... but yeah - I wouldn't go for that now, but we could actually think about it for the future...",

However if any of these functions pass a memory reference, then obviously that will point to an invalid area.\r\n\r\nIn the case of shared memory both instances share the memory space. Again, the instances have to be aware otherwise they will mess up memory for eachother.\r\n\r\nBoth cases depend heavily on the toolchain/compiler deciding what is best.
