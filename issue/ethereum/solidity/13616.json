Looks like it does not work with external PRs, due to permission issues. For example in [1184923](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/26748/workflows/45c1a6ca-bb58-40fe-ad72-4cc8681d1cf3/jobs/1184923) from #13595 you can see this error: \r\n```\r\nposting error message to github\r\n{\r\n  \"message\": \"Requires authentication\",\r\n  \"documentation_url\": \"https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/issues#create-an-issue-comment\"\r\n}\r\nERROR: Error message does not contain file path.\r\n```\r\nand there's no comment in the issue.\r\n\r\nIs there something we can do to fix it? The bug tracker is public so CI should not need any specific permissions/tokens to post a comment, even when it's someone not from the team triggering it.\r\n\r\nFixing this save us having to constantly point this out in external PR reviews.",
