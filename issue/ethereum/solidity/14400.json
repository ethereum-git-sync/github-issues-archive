  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nIf you have multiple functions with the same name but different parameters, they cannot be used as user-defined operators. Since, for instance, `isEqual(Signed, Signed)` is not a valid target for a user-defined `Unsigned.==` operator, I expect the compiler to be smart enough to select the correct function. Unfortunately it isn't, and there's no way to explicitly select the correct function (#3556).\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version: 0.8.20\r\n- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): default\r\n- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): hardhat\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\npragma solidity ^0.8.19;\r\n\r\ntype Unsigned is uint256;\r\ntype Signed is int256;\r\n\r\nfunction isEqual(Unsigned a, Unsigned b) pure returns (bool) {\r\n    return Unsigned.unwrap(a) == Unsigned.unwrap(b);\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction isEqual(Signed a, Signed b) pure returns (bool) {\r\n    return Signed.unwrap(a) == Signed.unwrap(b);\r\n}\r\n\r\nusing {\r\n    FixedPoint.isEqual as == // DeclarationError: Identifier is not a function name or not unique. (9589)\r\n\r\n} for Unsigned global;\r\n```\r\n",

    "body": "Yeah, well, it's a known limitation and was even mentioned in the [blog post introducing operators](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2023/02/22/user-defined-operators/). As you mentioned we have #3556, which already covers the underlying issue. We won't be adding workarounds just  just for the operator case.\r\n\r\nAs for #3556, we know it's a problem, and we're working on addressing it in the long term, but it probably won't be in the form of a direct fix. We have big design changes in the pipeline, including changes to how overloading works, and these will likely just make the problem irrelevant in the first place.",
