  "body": "In the inheritance section in Solidity docs, I note the following:\r\n>“It is possible to call functions further up in the inheritance hierarchy internally by … using super.functionName() if you want to call the function one level higher up in the flattened inheritance hierarchy (see below).”\r\n\r\nSo, if I’m reading this right, it says that super can be used to call a function one level higher up in the inheritance hierarchy. However, it seems to work at least two levels up (see example that I successfully tried in Remix below). Am I reading this wrong, do I not understand the specific order in the directed acyclic graph (DAG) of base contracts, or is Solidity Docs wrong?\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n/* SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED */\r\n\r\npragma solidity ^0.7.0;\r\n\r\ncontract SuperGrandparent {\r\n    \r\n    uint public x;\r\n\r\n    function setNumber ()\r\n    public\r\n    virtual\r\n    {\r\n        x = 1;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract SuperParent is SuperGrandparent{}\r\n\r\ncontract SuperChild is SuperParent{\r\n \r\n    constructor()\r\n    {\r\n    x = 32;\r\n    } \r\n    \r\n    function setNumber ()\r\n    public\r\n    override\r\n    virtual\r\n    {\r\n        super.setNumber();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n",
