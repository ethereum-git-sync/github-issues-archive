  "body": "Consider the following contract:\r\n```\r\ncontract C {\r\n    struct S {\r\n        mapping(uint=>uint) m;\r\n    }\r\n    S s1;\r\n    S s2;\r\n    function f() public returns (uint256) {\r\n        s1.m[0] = 23;\r\n        S memory tmp = s1;\r\n        // accessing tmp.m will result in an error, but we can still assign back to a storage struct\r\n        s2 = tmp;\r\n        return s2.m[0];\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIt compiles without warning and returns ``0``, although it very much looks like it should return ``23``.\r\n\r\nThe reason is that ``mapping``s cannot \"live outside storage\" and are thus silently ignored while copying the struct. Accessing ``mapping``s in memory structs causes an error. However, assigning back to a storage struct works and again silently skips the ``mapping``. IMO this results in counter-intuitive behavior.\r\n\r\nWhat are the benefits of allowing to assign storage structs with members that can't live outside storage to memory structs in general?",
