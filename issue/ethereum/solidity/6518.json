We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.\r\n- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:\r\n\t- [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)\r\n\t- [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)\r\n- Ensure the issue isn't already reported (check `feature` and `language design` labels).\r\n\r\n*Delete the above section and the instructions in the sections below before submitting*\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Abstract\r\n\r\nThere should be a Dockerfile for `lllc`.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nCurrently, there is docker image for `solc`, but not `lllc` which is also an executable placed in this repository.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThe technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The\r\nspecification should be detailed enough to allow any developer to implement the functionality.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nA new Dockerfile or add a new build target to current Dockerfile at https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/scripts/Dockerfile that is for `lllc`.",
