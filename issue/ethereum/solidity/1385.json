    "body": "Not really. Atleast I don't think so based on how you're describing it. The thing is that file is still going to be passed up, symbols and all. \n\nLets say I have a package, and inside this package are the contracts: \n\n```\ncontract A{}\n\ncontract B{}\n\ncontract C{}\n```\n\nThese are fairly common names. Someone decides to use my package. They also want to create a package that might have fairly common names `contract A{}`. When we try to compile them, we will get a duplicate name error. To resolve this, I am proposing that we enable users to determine what is the main `module` of their contract package set that will be the main one for reuse. This can be defined either/or as such:\n\n```\nexport C; //export contract C\n\n//or \n\nexport * for C; //exports all inherited symbols \n\n// or\n\nexport C as foo; //exports it under a different name\n\n// or \n\nexport * as foo; //exports all symbols in file under the name foo\n```\n\nThis could probably use some brainstorming but I think the idea is fairly clear now of what I'm trying to get at. \n",
