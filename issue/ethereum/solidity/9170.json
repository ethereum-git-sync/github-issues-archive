I guess it is just more verbose so people would dislike it?\r\n> But at least would probably be easier to read `cast<address payable>(..)` than `address payable(..)`.\r\n> If we do have cast<> as an unchecked casting, then we could later consider adding convert<> which does checks.\r\n> I wonder if we could use the cast syntax for multiple-step casting, i.e. `cast<uint128,int128,int16>(..uint256 input..)` or `cast<uint128 -> int128 -> int16>(..uin256 input..)` (similar to the mapping syntax)\r\n> But the other option we briefly discussed is explicit casting works like static_cast/reinterpret_cast and we could introduce truncation/conversion helper on the types, i.e. `bytes32.truncateFrom(<dynamic bytes>)`.\r\n> Instead of the multiple step casting I suppose there could be nicer helpers in the stdlib doing that?\r\n\r\nOn the meeting we also mentioned perhaps we should not name them `cast`, but rather `truncate` and `extend`, etc.",
