  "body": "### What\r\n\r\nThe via-IR pipeline, especially with enabled optimizer, is hard to process for tools, since it doesn't preserve as many fixed patterns in the bytecode as the legacy pipeline. We want to improve this situation in a forward compatible manner by providing tooling with adequate and sufficient debugging data to reconstruct the relations between Solidity code, Yul code and bytecode.\r\n\r\n### Why\r\n\r\nWe consider good tooling support a prerequisite for switching to via-IR by default, which we want to do as soon as possible to reduce our maintenance burden.\r\n\r\n### How\r\n\r\nWe initiated a debugging data working group (currently spearheaded by @gnidan and @jtohman), with the goal to get to a consensus among tooling about what debugging information precisely and in which format would be most helpful for tooling. We intend to support this process as much as possible, which will hopefully result in a specification of debugging data, which we will then generate from the compiler.\r\n\r\n#### Tasks\r\n\r\n- [Â ] Support the debugging data working group in defining the required debugging information and format.\r\n- [ ] Implement support for the resulting debugging data in the compiler, i.e. emit the debugging data.\r\n- [x] #12533\r\n- [x] #9590\r\n\r\n#### Older issues for consideration\r\n\r\n- [x] https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11043\r\n- [x] https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10935",
