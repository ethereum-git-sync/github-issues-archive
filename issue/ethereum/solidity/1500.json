Each time that a release is made, the version should be tagged into the docker image. \r\n\r\n2. If at all possible, it would be nice to have solc released on apk in alpine. \r\n\r\nThat is all. 1. should be more than doable (I'll help write the test script if I have to). 2. is a nice to have, but not required. \r\n\r\nLet me know what thoughts are surrounding this.
