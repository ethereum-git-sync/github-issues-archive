If that is the case, I'd encourage an initiative to not pull in untrusted code at build time.\r\n\r\nWith a little configuration I think you could do things like run less-trusted operations of the source code in automation more safely by not providing the access token with release upload permissions to those build steps (github actions allows you to be pretty granular with the repository secrets).\r\n\r\nThere are a host of possible ways to add additional assurances regarding the provenance of a built binary.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> Also, what is the attack scenario you are concerned about?
