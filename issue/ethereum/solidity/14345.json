We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.\r\n- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:\r\n    - [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)\r\n    - [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)\r\n- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.\r\n- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.\r\n\r\n*Delete the above section and the instructions in the sections below before submitting*\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\n<!--Please shortly describe the bug you have found, and what you expect instead.-->\r\n\r\nput on a test to make the SMTChecker formal proof verification the contracts recursively and it can't last for more than 200+ without **Solc error,** or the compiler hanging, on FAST hardware,\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version: 0.8.19 - last\r\n- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): any\r\n- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): plain solc\r\n- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: any\r\n- Operating system: any\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease provide a *minimal* source code example to trigger the bug you have found.\r\nPlease also mention any command-line flags that are necessary for triggering the bug.\r\nProvide as much information as necessary to reproduce the bug.\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n// Some *minimal* Solidity source code to reproduce the bug.\r\n// ...\r\n``` \r\n-->\r\n\r\nCheck more than 200+ contracts with SMTChecker (using Z3) recursively without hanging fast hardware, or outputting error.
