One analysis step that certainly has to be perform is to check which functions can have side-effects.\r\n\r\nOne optimization pass that I was not able to do in the old system was [loop invairant code motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop-invariant_code_motion) which should now be much easier.\r\n\r\nI think we should take a look at code generated from the compiler and look for obivous improvements we would do manually. One thing I for example would like to avoid is the array-out-of-bounds-check for code like `for (uint i = 0; i < a.length; i++) a[i] = 2;`.",
