This avoids the need of special rules (for example what is the value of an unspecified item after a specified one?).\r\n\r\n(Sparked by #4624)",

So putting it in the Icebox seems like the right thing to do too.\r\n\r\nOne minor downside to allowing arbitrary (and especially non-contiguous) values is that the runtime check becomes more expensive. That's only if the values are actually non-contiguous but this might not be obvious to users and they might be choosing values that just look good for one reason or another, not being aware of the extra cost.",
