    "body": "We discussed this on the call today:\r\n- We'd prefer not to introduce any new syntax for this at the language level.\r\n- Hardhat apparently already has a preprocessor plugin: [hardhat-preprocessor](https://hardhat.org/plugins/hardhat-preprocessor.html) so it does not need this feature.\r\n- We already have support for file-level constants, which get you pretty close to this. You then only have to have a system for providing values for these constants rather than a full-blown preprocessor.\r\n    - Conditions using such constants can be evaluated at compilation time, which means that if you use them in an `if`, the unused branch will be removed from your bytecode by the optimizer.\r\n    - Even manually changing values of these constants is not that much more tedious than supplying parameters to the compiler. The real problem is the use case where values come from tool's own configuration and that will require specific support in every tool no matter whether compiler accepts the values as parameters or rendered into the source code.\r\n- Overall this is something that would be better off done at the tool level because the amount of real work to do by the compiler here is very small and probably not worth complicating the interface. And it's actually redundant - instead of adding extra parameters to Standard JSON input, a framework can just do simple search and replace on sources included in it.\r\n    - The problem here is that if every tool introduces its own syntax for it, switching between tools becomes harder. For example using a framework and vscode-solidity would be hard.\r\n    - @axic proposed that we might be better off standardizing common templating syntax for these substitutions and letting each tool do the actual substitution on its own.",

    "body": "> This would affect build reproducibility and require support from tools like etherscan.\r\n\r\nTrue, that's something to consider. Though on the other hand constructor arguments also have the same problem and Etherscan did solve it by requiring you to specify them. So this is not an unsolvable problem.\r\n\r\n> Looking at the grammar, it seems that we're not using `#` for anything.\r\n\r\nJust wanted to note that if we go with this, we should not use `#` - it would interfere with the use of C preprocessor with Solidity (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10#issuecomment-1306228085).",
