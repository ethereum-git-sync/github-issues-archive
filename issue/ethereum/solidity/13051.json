I was able to reproduce it locally, though I had to force hardhat version to 2.9.6 and apply the chainId workaround as discussed in [euler-xyz/euler-contracts#119](https://github.com/euler-xyz/euler-contracts/issues/119#issuecomment-1133367182). I guess it still has to do with the problem in [ethers-io/ethers.js#2849](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/discussions/2849).",
