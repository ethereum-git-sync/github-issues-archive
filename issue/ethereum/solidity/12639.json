  "body": "- do the splitting earlier, so that the theory component can report a minimal set of infeasible clauses back to the boolean component\r\n- the theory component can synthesize simple boolean implications using bounds on variables: If we have literals `A: x <= 7` and `B: x < 8`, it can infer `\\neg A \\lor B`.\r\n- when the theory component finds a set of infeasible constraints, it might be good to run it again, removing each constraint to find a minimal set (because otherwise, we will likely run it again anyway)\r\n- because of this, the cache could actually be built such that it suffices to find an infeasible subset of the input\r\n\r\nCDCL very rough:\r\nlook at https://github.com/msoos/minisat-v1.14\r\nadd theory conflict analysis: return clause\r\nif we only have positive constraint literals, we can ignore anything set to false, won't be wrong but inefifcient",
