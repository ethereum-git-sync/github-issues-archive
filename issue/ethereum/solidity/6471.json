  "body": "## Description\r\nAt the moment, it appears that solc developers think that `solc --metadata` is the solution for contract verification of complex projects, while the Etherscan devs don't believe it will work in their environment.  Etherscan verification has become a critical piece of the smart contract ecosystem in Ethereum and making it easy for developers to validate complex contracts with Etherscan is important.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if the solc developers got in touch with the Etherscan developers and figured out what can be done to make it so it is easy for developers to take standard `solc` output and feed it to Etherscan for validation.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nOpinion on the UX of the current `--metadata` solution.\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that at the moment `--metada` spits out some hashes that point to files on Swarm.  However, last I checked swarm is not actually finished yet, I believe development of it has been put on hold, and I don't think many people actually run Swarm nodes.  On top of that, it means that the developer needs to publish to swarm, which means their build system needs access to a synced swarm node which can make building complicated.\r\n\r\nIt would be much simpler if there was an option to have solc spit out an input JSON that contained _everything_ necessary to reproduce the current build.  This would include inlined sources (post path resolution) so that someone could take this single JSON blob, feed it back into `solc`, and get out the exact bytecode that the first person got out.  Alternatively, `solc` could spit out a bundle that includes all of the necessary input files and input JSON necessary to do a deterministic build.  I very much prefer the single input-json output though, as it is much easier to just paste into a text entry box (even if it is long) than having to move a bundle around.",
