    "body": "Just looking at #13535: I would say adding `add(X, A)` to `sub(A, -X)` is not the right way. One thing we want to avoid in the expression simplifier is infinite loops, as it doesn't really backtrace or understand the history of replacements. So if there is a loop in the simplification rule, hitting it is wasting time.\r\n\r\nI believe Chris is referring to something more specific, which is the constant optimizer. Some expression have shorter bytecode size than others, which is useful when you are optimizing for bytecode. For example, `add(x, 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639935)` would have bigger bytecode size than `sub(x, 1)`. \r\n\r\nIMO, this should be done as a separate step or closely related to constant optimizer.",
