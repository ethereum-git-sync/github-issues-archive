We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.\r\n- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:\r\n\t- [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)\r\n\t- [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)\r\n- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.\r\n- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nSMTChecker crashes on mismatched SMT sorts when analyzing public getter of a state variable that is an array of structs.\r\n\r\nExample reported in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10986#issuecomment-783345346\r\n```\r\npragma abicoder v1;\r\npragma experimental SMTChecker;\r\nstruct Item {\r\n\tuint x;\r\n\tuint y;\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract D {\r\n\tItem[][][] public items;\r\n\r\n\tfunction test() public view returns (uint) {\r\n\t\t(uint a, uint b) = this.items(1, 2, 3);\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother example that checks also structs with members that are ignored by public getter.\r\n```\r\npragma abicoder v1;\r\npragma experimental SMTChecker;\r\n\r\nstruct Item {\r\n\tuint x;\r\n\tuint y;\r\n\tuint[] arr;\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract D {\r\n\tItem[] public item;\r\n\r\n\tfunction test() public view returns (uint) {\r\n\t\t(uint a, uint b) = this.item(0);\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n",
