  "body": "When calling `fooInstance.a(<address of B>)`, this code breaks with an \"out of gas\" error. Tested on both browser-solidity and on testrpc.\n\n```\npragma solidity ^0.4;\n\ncontract Foo  {\n    function a(Bar bar) {\n        bar.b();\n    }\n}\n\ncontract Bar {\n    function b() returns (uint[4] i) {}\n}\n```\n\nIf you change the `uint[4]` to `uint[3]`, the code runs as you would expect. It also appears to happen with any type of array, not just `uint`s.\n\nThis seems to be a regression that occurred in 0.4.0, because this problem does not occur on 0.3.5 or 0.3.6.\n",
