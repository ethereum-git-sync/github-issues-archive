We could download and execute solc-js in the ubuntu build and vice-versa, but that will trigger errors if we change something in the code generator. So unless travis supports some kind of complex build artefact generation paths, the only way I see is to do something like setting up a separate repository with separately triggered build process that downloads the artifacts from travis...",

    "body": "Ok, just spent a little more thoughts on this. This is how it could work: If all parallel travis runs are successful, a \"deploy\" step is run. This deploy step will copy the build artifacts to a special github repository. That repository has a travis setup that will take the binaries and test them against each other. The only question I still have is whether the deploy step has access to all binaries or only to the binaries that correspond to that build step and if it is the latter how to synchronize uploading to the other github repository. I guess there should be a simpler solution :-)",

We just need to find a way to `emscripten` soltest...so the tests would look like the following pseudo travis script:\r\n\r\n```\r\nBuild:\r\n\r\nWindows: gcc/clang\r\nUse windows specific script\r\n\r\nOS X: gcc/clang\r\nUse OS X specific script\r\n\r\nLinux: gcc/clang\r\nUse Linux specific script\r\n\r\nEmscripten: gcc/clang\r\nUse emscripten specific script\r\n\r\nDocs: whatever the docs generator does\r\n\r\nDocker:\r\nrun Docker build with soltest enabled\r\n\r\nRun:\r\n\r\n(inside a script obviously)\r\nsoltest\r\n\r\nDeploy: (this assumes all of them pass and that the branch that we want to merge to is either develop or release)\r\n\r\nprovider: script: (run both emscripten deploy and docker push)\r\n\r\nprovider: releases (github): push tarballs, zips, and dmgs\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nGranted...this is all easier said than done....requires quite a refactoring imo. \r\n\r\n",

    "body": "So I think I figured out why OS X was running so slow. The main problem centers around brew and the fact that we were upgrading all of Travis' brew suite...this led to insanely long times updating. I've fixed this but it's still fairly slow due to the cpp-eth dependency and how long this takes to build. I have an idea to make this thing run even faster for all builds. All we need is a properly pushed stable cpp-ethereum docker image. From there this becomes a trivial matter to solve.  It's also required for our docker deployment. So any chance we could get that up @chriseth ? After that it becomes a docker pull and we call the rpc of the cpp-eth image. Furthermore, it also enables us to test on multiple platforms and bypass travis' limitations. So...if someone has that it would be very appreciated. ",
