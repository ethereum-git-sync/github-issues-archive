We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.\r\n- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:\r\n\t- [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)\r\n\t- [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)\r\n- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.\r\n- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n I call `latestRoundData` from Chainlink aggregator and then covert the price to our own defined struct `Decimal` and it shows `Encoding type \"struct Decimal.decimal memory\" not yet implemented` error. as the following snippet,\r\n \r\n```\r\n// Decimal.sol\r\nlibrary Decimal {\r\n    struct decimal {\r\n        uint256 d;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// priceFeed.sol\r\nusing Decimal for Decimal.decimal;\r\n\r\n    function update(bytes32 _priceFeedKey) external {\r\n        AggregatorV3Interface aggregator = getAggregator(_priceFeedKey);\r\n        (\r\n            uint80 roundId,\r\n            int256 price, \r\n            uint256 decimals, \r\n            uint256 timestamp, \r\n            uint80 answeredInRound\r\n        ) = aggregator.latestRoundData();\r\n\r\n        rootBridge.updatePriceFeed(\r\n            priceFeedL2Address, \r\n            _priceFeedKey, \r\n            Decimal.decimal(uint256(price))),\r\n            timestamp, \r\n            roundId\r\n        );\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I add a dummy function with `Decimal.decimal` argument as the following \r\n```\r\nfunction dummy(Decimal.decimal calldata empty) external {}\r\n```\r\nand then everything goes well. Do you have any ideas? Thanks.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version: 0.6.7\r\n- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings):\r\n- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): oz\r\n- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: na\r\n- Operating system: Mac\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n",
