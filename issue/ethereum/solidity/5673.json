  "body": "In the example for Interfaces at https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.1/contracts.html#interfaces an enum is declared along with a version pragma of pragma solidity >=0.4.11 <0.6.0, implying that you could implement enums in interfaces in as early a version as 0.4.11.\r\n\r\nExperimentation has shown me that this feature was not implemented until 0.5.0. Furthermore there is nothing in the section about 0.5.0 changes mentioning this new feature. Not that I could find anyway. \r\n\r\nI know this is small but it caused me a good bit of confusion and I would like for others to not have to figure this out on their own in the future. I could happily make the change to the code example but I'm not sure where to make in the change in the section about 0.5.0 changes.\r\n\r\nShould I make the change to the code example and then make a pull request?",
