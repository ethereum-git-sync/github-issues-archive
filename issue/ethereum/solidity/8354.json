    "body": "Okay, so the reason why we want the user to see all the bases is the diamond inheritance. My idea would work fine for the example listed in the description of this issue but the case we're worried about is `A is B, C` + `C is E` + `D is E`. If we only list `override(B)` when defining `A.foo()`, user might not be aware that when there is a diamond in the hierarchy, `C.foo()` will get called as well. It's really sneaky because you can change whether it's called or not without changing anything in `A`. Modifying `C` not to inherit from `E` (both of which may be defined in a completely different file) is enough to disable the call to `C.foo()`. Cases like this make it harder to spot problems when auditing code.",
