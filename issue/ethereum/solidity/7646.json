As long as we *don't* introduce anything using dots within yul, so as long as we don't have ``i64.shl`` or use it in user-defined-conversion builtins, I'd say there are actually no dots in the grammar of \"standard Yul\" - and solidity inline assembly Yul would *add* them to the grammar of a specialized version of inline-assembly Yul...\r\nOr we could go the other way and make identifiers in the standard Yul grammar always explicitly allow paths and distinguish them from \"names\" in variable declarations, parameters and return values...\r\nBut yeah, I realize that I really haven't thought this through entirely, I'm not really sure about it :-).\r\n\r\n",
