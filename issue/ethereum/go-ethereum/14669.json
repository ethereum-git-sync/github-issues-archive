But calling sendTransaction during this time returns transaction hashes and these seem to just get lost in the ether.\r\n\r\n#### More background\r\nWe operate an ETH exchange and stopped withdrawals about 18 hours ago to prevent getting ourselves into a bigger mess and stop adding things to the queue. We had to upgrade and restart geth yesterday as 1.6.0 was refusing to sync and was losing peers. 1.6.5 is now syncing without issues.\r\n\r\nWhen sending transactions we use dynamic gas prices, using the recommended value returned by eth.gasPrice.\r\n\r\nEven after upgrading to 1.6.5 we see this behavior. Our node hasn't restarted since we upgraded to 1.6.5, we have txhashes returned by geth when calling sendTransaction, but `txpool.content.pending[sending_address]` returns `undefined`.\r\n\r\n#### More questions\r\n1. When is it safe to credit funds back to users? I understand it's theoretically possible that after calling `sendTransaction` the txs were broadcasted and are still in some other node's txpool\r\n2. How do we prevent this from happening in the future?\r\n3. What else can we do to help you debug this issue?",

    "body": "Thanks for the report. \r\n\r\n1. It's obviously not in `txpool.content.pending[sending_address]`. How about `txpool.content.queued[sending_address]`  ? If the tx is deemed non-executable, e.g. due to a nonce-gap, it would be wind up in `queued` instead of `pending`\r\n\r\nSome answers: \r\n1. If you sign a transaction `X` to a user `A` , with nonce `N`. And then \"lose\" that transaction, then that transaction can be used _in eternity_ , or until you create a new transaction `Y` that also has the nonce `N`, and is included in a block. The transaction `Y` can be to yourself, to clear that tx and 'burn' that nonce. \r\n2. You can keep a record of `nonce : transaction_info` , so you know which transaction has gone missing when you notice that there's a nonce-gap keeping the other transactions from executing. \r\n3. Provide details on how you submit transactions. \r\n  - Sync or async?\r\n  - Which rpc-method - `eth_sendTransaction` or `eth_sendRawTransaction` or `personal...` ? \r\n  - Do you suffer from nonce-gaps (which you should, if transactions get lost), or not (which implies that transactions are dropped and the next one get's the same nonce). \r\n  \r\n",

We actually monitor the length of `txpool.content.queued[sending_address]` and can confirm that we never see it increase, so this doesn't seem to be a nonce-gap issue.\r\n\r\nWe use `eth_sendTransaction` and I _believe_ that nonces are somehow getting rewritten by geth. We do not manage nonces ourselves, we let geth manage them for us. We do the `eth_sendTransaction` call synchronous.\r\n\r\nI have something that is repeatedly storing the output of `txpool.content.pending[sending_address]`. I have the output of 20 some transactions that appear on my dump but never made it into the blockchain. However, there are other, completely unrelated transactions, which did make it into the blockchain with the nonces of the 20 some transactions I have a record of.\r\n\r\nGeth was not restarted during this time (pid has been up for 77305 seconds at the time of writing).",

    "body": "As an update:\r\n\r\nWe had roughly 70 transactions that disappeared as described above (geth returned a transaction hash, the transactions appeared at some point in the `txpool` then they were replaced by other transactions with the same nonce). When we send transactions through the json RPC, we send the following way (pseudo code, but all relevant bits in here):\r\n```\r\ntx = {\r\n    \"from\": sending_address,\r\n    \"to\": destination_address,\r\n    \"gas\": 0xA410, // 42000,\r\n    \"gasPrice\": eth_gasPrice(), // use whatever geth recommends\r\n    \"value\": amount_to_send\r\n};\r\nhash = eth_sendTransaction(tx);\r\n```\r\n \r\nTo reiterate, **we let geth manage our nonces**.\r\n\r\nThe above code is called via a single threaded queue processing system that simply monitors the queue and pops elements when/if there are any transactions waiting to be processed. \r\n\r\nGiven that we had those 70ish transactions that needed to reprocess (and that we had already built the infrastructure to check for missing ETH transactions and to record nonces, etc...), I decided to write something that would try to send those 70ish transactions as quickly as I could figure out how to via the json RPC interface of geth using an asynchronous, non-blocking, process. 70 transactions is not a whole lot, but every single transaction ended up in the ethereum blockchain without an issue.\r\n\r\nThe only times we've seen this issue is when the ethereum network is under high stress.\r\n\r\nWe start `geth` with the following parameters:\r\n`--rpc --rpcapi \"personal,eth,web3\" --targetgaslimit 1000000 --cache 1024`\r\n\r\nHappy to try some more parameters before the next ICO and report further.",

When the logs are examined the nodes are happily syncing and downloading blocks -\r\n they even broadcast the occasional transaction - but for some reason the majority of transactions are going into a blackhole from which they are never broadcasted.\r\n\r\nHappy to collect more data / logs if they would be helpful in getting to the bottom of this. Currently we see this every 1-4 days and have taken to running a group of hot secondaries to quickly recover when this issue occurs. My wild guess would be that this is somehow related to transaction volume? Hence why it doesn't appear to be very common.",
