  "body": "Windows Defender just reported that it found the trojan \"**Win32/Rundas!plock**\" in an older version of geth.exe on my system. Downloading the zip file containing that very version (1.4.6, url:  https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/releases/download/v1.4.6/Geth-Win64-20160606144531-1.4.6-0f036f6.zip; sha-1: 906e489c8e0248efafc697b2080b250d7df5c706), Windows Defender makes the same report (deleting the file in the process, however). After wgetting the zip file into a temporary folder and manually pointing WD to its download directory, once again it reports having found a trojan. Also, I haven't checked any other download yet.\n\nSince I could not readily find any checksum of the zip file in the releases section of github, I cannot confirm the file has not been altered during the download; so I'm putting this out there for someone else to confirm or refute this (hoping for the latter, in which case I expect this issue to be closed).\n",
