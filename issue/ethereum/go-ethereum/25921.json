  "body": "After recent twitter talks about the \"Linagee Name Registrar\" contract (0x5564886ca2c518d1964e5fcea4f423b41db9f561) I happened to notice eth.namereg() is still available in geth and decided to check which contract it pointed to.\r\n\r\nIt points to 0xc6d9d2cd449a754c494264e1809c50e34d64562b in the code which seems to be an EOA and not an actual contract and thus does not act according to the ABI provided. There is 230+ eth that has been sent there total over the last few years..\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/1913b50111bd30dda5b43171c1f880f0127d40e1/internal/jsre/deps/web3.js#L6143",
