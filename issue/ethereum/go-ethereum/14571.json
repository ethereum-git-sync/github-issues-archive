The syncing process was just really slow, and then the closer it was getting to the current block, the longer each block processing was, even with high cache allocation.\r\nYou can try the --cache option (in Mb, so beware not overloading the system memory).\r\n\r\nThe amount of i/o geth generate is staggering: with a raid 0 it's constantly trashing the disks, whether it's syncing or already synced.

    "body": "similiar here. GETH 1.6.5 on Linux. \r\nCommand: geth --fast --chache=512 console\r\n(Some history here: https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/18709/geth-chaindata-copied-syncd-keystore-account-updated-balance-0-heavy-act?noredirect=1#comment20162_18709).\r\n\r\nI renamed my old chaindata directory, and created a new directory for chaindata, and started from scratch (at 0). It took 3 days to fully synchronize up to the latest blocks, with `du -h -s chaindata` showing ~24Gigs, and about 12.000 files. Heavy disk I/O until blocks was synced. Then disk I/O calmed down. Currently eth.syncing is showing:\r\n```\r\n  currentBlock: 3962216,\r\n  highestBlock: 3962334\r\n```\r\nI think I never found a status, were both numbers were the same (which is ok, given the nature of the ever increasing block count, right?). Maybe I have never tried often enough...  \r\n\r\nOnce the system had sync'd up to the lates block, I can see my CPU load average going down from roughly 3.something below 1, disk I/O is going down dramatically, and network traffic is going down dramatically. All in the range of my expectation. \r\nI had several \"error\" messages (failed to unregister, peer removal failed, geth.ipc->@: write:  broken pipe) but the process obviously continues. \r\nFunny thing is, that my **coinbase is still 0** (eth.coinbase),  whereas eth.account shows the correct address (and web explorers the correct amount). eth.defaultBlock shows \"latest\" (it did that from the very beginning), peerCount is always between 3 and 8. eth.blockNumber remains 0. \r\n\r\nObservation: During the first two days the **knownStates** showed ~ 4.5 mio, and similiar for **pulledStates**. Over the weekend I shut down the system, and restarted later during the week. These state figures were completly down, starting to count upwards from 0. It is unclear to me, what they are, and I couldn't find in the docs. My system now shows:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  currentBlock: 3962216,\r\n  highestBlock: 3962334,\r\n  knownStates: 1316924,\r\n  pulledStates: 1217542,\r\n  startingBlock: 3954831\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe geth console shows many, many lines like this:\r\n`> INFO [07-02|14:58:32] Imported new state entries               count=107 elapsed=2.109s    processed=1217649 pending=100558`\r\nwhere the numbers for **processed** increases, and the numbers for **pending** is varying between 50.000 and 150.000. I am now waiting for the figures for knownStates and pullesStates go \"up\" (I hear it can go to +8mio), and see what happens then. CPU, network and disk I/O remain low, and spikes from time to time, when a new block comes in. \r\n\r\nIf someone can point me to the right documentation, I'd be thankful. \r\nHey: code is no doc :-)\r\n",

Once I got close (within 200 blocks), `eth.syncing` stopped incrementing and lots of new logs were logged, like the one you mentioned.  \r\n\r\nI stopped and restarted at this point (you need to wait until you're close to the end to stop and restart or your progress will be lost) and finished syncing within the next few minutes.  This was on a brand-new high-end machine so older machines will likely take considerably longer FYI.\r\n\r\n",
