  "body": "Hi there,\r\n\r\nOver the past 2 days we've been getting geth node crashes right around the same time. They are all 1.9.9 (updated to 1.9.10 now so knock on wood might have fix it.) Is there a known issue or some kind of attack on the Ethereum network?\r\n\r\nThey are 4 nodes all on Linux boxes running a mix of Debian 9 and 10 64-bit and would crash within the same 30-60 minute timespan. Some have NVMe and some have SATA SSD storage. Then today they crashed again. These are all dedicated servers not VMs on the same machine or anything like that.\r\n\r\n#### System information\r\n\r\nGeth version: 1.9.9-stable-01744997\r\nOS & Version: Linux, Debian 9 and 10\r\n\r\nUnfortunately they are run under cron so don't have backtraces for them.",
