    "body": "It seems that without this, it's impossible to test (and therefore safely deploy) any contract which has a time-dependent aspect, i.e. almost any usage of the `now` function in Solidity. Is there another option for testing these cases?\r\n\r\nIt looks like this issue will be the case with the default tooling, but it may be possible to swap in another EVM, e.g. `pyethereum` into the test framework to cover these time-dependent test cases. However it's not clear that there's a good way to manipulate time in pyethereum either (though Python is fundamentally more malleable since it can be monkey-patched).",
