  "body": "Hi guys,\r\nI try to create an event listener for some ETH and BSC contracts, so I decided to be faster to create a node, one for ETH and one for BNB Chain, for the BNB chain a got no delay I have the event when the block is minted, but on my ETH node, I have a lot of delay! And I don't know why I would like to get the event of a new block when the block is minted... And I don't know why I received the information at block+1. Please check my screen to compare my \"Imported new chain segment\" time and the time when the block is mined it's always block+1.\r\n![Untitled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38420652/176430617-ed5bb177-dee4-4828-9be6-d6e509c02b6b.png)\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\n",
