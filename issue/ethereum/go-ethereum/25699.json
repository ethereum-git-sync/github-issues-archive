It could be critical for someone who fetching transactions using graphQL and could lead to double-spends. On 1.10.21 node version it is working as expected.\r\n\r\n#### Expected behaviour\r\nWhen querying for the transactions in block using graphQL we should receive event logs only for the corresponding transactions. \r\n\r\n#### Actual behaviour\r\nWe are receiving event logs for ALL transactions in block for EACH transaction.\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\r\nMake a graphQL query to the node: \r\n`{ \r\n    block(number:15484104) \r\n    { \r\n        transactions \r\n        { \r\n            hash \r\n            logs { account { address } topics data } \r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}`\r\n\r\n#### Backtrace\r\n\r\n````\r\n-\r\n````",
