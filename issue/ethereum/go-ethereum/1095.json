  "body": "Is it possible to run a node using geth that that does not download (or try to download) the blockchain, and only interacts with the network via `shh`? I'd thought to run a node like so:\n\n```\ngeth --shh --vmodule=sync=0,downloader=0 js my_shh_application.js\n```\n\n... but this still downloads the chain, and incidentally I was unable to receive messages posted by the node in this state (perhaps blocknumber too old or stale?) any thoughts or ideas?\n\n@tgerring suggested the following:\n\n> maybe delete your chain and use `--networkid`\n\nIs there a suggested or best practice for selecting networkid numbers. ie how large can they be, my first thought being a hashed topic as an id, but this doesn't help if there's no convention to prevent (mitigate) network overlaps, that is if Ethereum encourages new networkid for things other than testing.\n\nThat being said I believe it is a valid workaround, but would like to have these nodes participate in the **main-net**. I understand that they would not be processing the chain but they would still be contributing to and benifiting from using the larger more robust the **main-net** whisper network.\n- Is it possible to run `ssh` only nodes?\n- What are the Ethereum devs thoughts on `networkid` conventions?\n",
