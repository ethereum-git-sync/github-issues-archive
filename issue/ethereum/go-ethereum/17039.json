    "body": "@karalabe thank you for your reply.\r\nI understand what you mean by saying that the explosion of data volume is a more serious problem.\r\nBut this is obviously two different issues.\r\nThe sudden increase in the total amount of data can be calculated and cut for each account on an annual or quarterly basis.\r\nDiscard aged data on lightweight servers.\r\nUsers with query history requirements can pay to the history server for inquiry.\r\nBecause disk io is much faster than the speed of the network, it does not quite understand why it will become a bottleneck for TPS inefficiency.\r\n",
