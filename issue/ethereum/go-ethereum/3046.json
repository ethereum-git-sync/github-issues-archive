  "body": "Ever since I started using it many months ago, the only way for me to use the Mist wallet on my Windows 10 desktop machine has been to run geth first with (at least) the following switches\n\n--nat=none --rpc\n\n...then run the wallet. If I run geth without any switches, it gets as far as \"starting server\" and that's it. If I run the wallet on its own (where I think it runs geth first anyway) I get the same result but with the following error messages:\n\n![wallet_output01](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17661766/18859167/3bb295d4-84a4-11e6-89f2-469e6714af49.jpg)\n\nI have been doing it this way for months, after I read about someone with a similar problem to mine. Until quite recently - when the first memory leak bug happened, it has actually worked OK as long as I run geth with those switches first, then run the wallet. Since the latest two versions,  4.1.12 & 4.1.13 - if I use the --nat=none switch geth just spits out a few pages of what looks like programming code to me and then halts. I have been getting geth as binary files and I have noticed that up to 4.1.11 the filesize of geth was slowly increasing, but the newer ones are smaller. Is it possible that the developers have removed some functionality which includes that switch?\n\nI do have an installation of Linux Mint on a laptop and I have considered that maybe I should use geth and the mist wallet there since it's probably developed in Linux, but I have no idea how to transfer a wallet between different machines and operating systems, and I am far less confident using Linux than I am with Windows.\n\nI can run Parity in geth mode and then run the Mist wallet and it syncs but then I have another problem with the wallet not being able to send ETH, which I have send a fault notice about to the wallet repo.\n\nThe photos below are the output from (an admin level) Windows command line, after I run:\n\ngeth --nat=none\n\n![geth_output01](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17661766/18858895/14b898f4-84a2-11e6-8f70-0d543073b319.jpg)\n![geth_output02](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17661766/18858896/14bb89ba-84a2-11e6-8ab3-5a1ab7c70411.jpg)\n![geth_output03](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17661766/18858894/14b6b32c-84a2-11e6-81a8-a900101d2795.jpg)\n![geth_output04](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17661766/18858893/14b6a92c-84a2-11e6-99e8-b7274eefd5f4.jpg)\n![geth_output05](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17661766/18858897/14bd953e-84a2-11e6-9d9a-c5fa96fd6207.jpg)\n\nSInce I have multiple issues, and quite a lot of ETH (to me anyway - over 300) in the wallet - this is very stressful. I am actually mining ETH - not on the machine with this problem, and the account on the wallet is where my mining pool shares go.\n#### System information\n\nGeth version: 1.4.13\nOS & Version: Windows 10\n#### Expected behaviour\n\nI expect geth to connect to the network and start syncing\n#### Actual behaviour\n\ngeth spits out a whole lot of what looks like raw code to me (I'm not a programmer) and then stops.\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\n\nstart using latest version of geth (this started happening 1 or 2 versions ago).\n\nrun geth with --nat=none (and --rpc) switch appended to it - if I run it without --nat=none it runs but will not sync - I believe it cannot connect to other nodes. \n\n[backtrace]\n\n```\n```\n",
