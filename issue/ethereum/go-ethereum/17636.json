  "body": "Ref: NCC-EF-Clef-004\r\n\r\nAn attacker who has access to the public API of Clef (through an RPC interface exposed to\r\nthe internet for example) can quickly spam the process with requests that will need to be\r\nmanually handled, in order, by the end user.\r\nIf such an attack is performed, the end user will be incapable of going on with normal oper-\r\nations without restarting the process.\r\nIn addition, requests done over Ethereum’s RPC protocol are not encrypted. While most use\r\nmight eventually be published, the “account_sign” method (aimed at signing arbitrary data\r\nfor different purposes) might require secrecy.\r\n\r\nRecommendation: Add ways to encrypt the connection (via TLS) and to authenticate the client to the Clef API.\r\nAlternatively, delegate these tasks to a lower-layer protocol, but add documentation to warn\r\nuser against the dangers of exposing Clef’s API outside of their own machine. \r\n\r\n---- \r\n\r\nNotes: Clef is not and should not be used as a full internet-scale server. If used in such setup, the operator should place a load balancer/proxy in front to enforce e.g. rate-limiting and SSL termination. I'm not sure about implementing TLS support in Clef. But these limitations should definitely be documented. \r\nAs of now, we're very publically stating that all input and output on the external API is not considered secret. But at a minimum this should be clearly stated to the user. ",
