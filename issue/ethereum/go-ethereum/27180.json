We had a number of people try to bring some new order to the PRs issues with their own style labels, which we used for a while and then just abandoned because it's just too annoying to keep tagging and for the 5 people who bugfix it's obvious what the code touches by just looking at it.\r\n\r\n Currently we rarely use tags, usually to mark something that's interesting at a specific moment for some reason (e.g. `triage` to know what to talk about on meetings, or `fork xyz` to know which PRs belong collectively to some hardfork, etc).",
