If the default\n bundle file isn't adequate, you can specify an alternate file\n using the --cacert option.\nIf this HTTPS server uses a certificate signed by a CA represented in\n the bundle, the certificate verification probably failed due to a\n problem with the certificate (it might be expired, or the name might\n not match the domain name in the URL).\nIf you'd like to turn off curl's verification of the certificate, use\n the -k (or --insecure) option.\nError: Failed to download resource \"ethereum\"\nDownload failed: https://build.ethdev.com/builds/bottles/ethereum-1.4.5.el_capitan.bottle.21.tar.gz\nWarning: Bottle installation failed: building from source.\n==> Cloning https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum.git\nUpdating /Library/Caches/Homebrew/ethereum--git\n==> Checking out branch master\n==> go env\n==> make all\nLast 15 lines from /Users/kramer65/Library/Logs/Homebrew/ethereum/02.make:\n\nmake: build/flags.sh: Command not found\nfor cmd in `ls ./cmd/`; do \\\n         build/env.sh go build -i -v  -o build/bin/$cmd ./cmd/$cmd; \\\n    done\n/bin/sh: build/env.sh: /bin/sh^M: bad interpreter: No such file or directory\n/bin/sh: build/env.sh: /bin/sh^M: bad interpreter: No such file or directory\n/bin/sh: build/env.sh: /bin/sh^M: bad interpreter: No such file or directory\n/bin/sh: build/env.sh: /bin/sh^M: bad interpreter: No such file or directory\n/bin/sh: build/env.sh: /bin/sh^M: bad interpreter: No such file or directory\n/bin/sh: build/env.sh: /bin/sh^M: bad interpreter: No such file or directory\n/bin/sh: build/env.sh: /bin/sh^M: bad interpreter: No such file or directory\n/bin/sh: build/env.sh: /bin/sh^M: bad interpreter: No such file or directory\n/bin/sh: build/env.sh: /bin/sh^M: bad interpreter: No such file or directory\nmake: *** [all] Error 126\n\nREAD THIS: https://git.io/brew-troubleshooting\nIf reporting this issue please do so at (not Homebrew/brew):\n  https://github.com/ethereum/homebrew-ethereum/issues\n```\n\nSo first the problem is something with SSL certs, but I wouldn't know what I can do about that?\nThe second problem is that the files to build from source contain dos line endings. Normally I would use dos2unix to convert the relevant files, but I wouldn't know where these files reside.\n\nDoes anybody have any tips on how I can solve this? All tips are welcome!\n",
