  "body": "A big end-to-end test framework that starts up a light client on the testnet with an empty datadir, connects to it through RPC and performs a complex test sequence while logging response times and checking responses. This test sequence should include:\r\n\r\n- [ ] install a new block filter to follow the syncing process\r\n- [ ] do  some simple requests (like account balance) while syncing to test responsiveness\r\n- [ ] when synced, deploy a contract that generates log messages and also writes to storage\r\n- [ ] after sending transactions, retrieve the transaction pool until it's empty, then check results (retrieve contract code)\r\n- [ ] install a log filter for the contract\r\n- [ ] send transactions to the contract and expect log events from the filter\r\n- [ ] when all transactions have been mined, read the contract storage and check for the expected changes\r\n",
