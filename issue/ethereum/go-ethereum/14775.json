  "body": "#### System information\r\n\r\nGeth version: 1.6.6-stable  & Go Version: go1.8.3\r\nOS & Version: Windows 10\r\n\r\nSo I've been encountering a really weird issue with geth which I cannot reproduce correctly or figure out what is wrong. I've been playing around with Geth running an RPC server. \r\n\r\nBut before this I installed it fine and launched it correctly after putting a couple of commands and then terminating it I reopened it to my surprise it just hung and I could not terminate it unless I forceably closed it through task manager for example. It won't accept any key commands and will just hang. \r\n\r\nWhether it is doing something in the background I do not know because after around 10 minutes some default startup text appeared but I still could not do anything. This can happen after a couple of uses or just one use and it severely impacts development because I have to reboot my computer to be able to use Geth again. I've also tried letting it run for some time and it just closed.\r\n\r\n![a19kclqct4inunrqxmqxwg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11020750/27979442-0e36e98a-636e-11e7-98d4-1d9970f713fc.png)\r\n",
