  "body": "This is a also question, as i'm not sure if go does that already, but i had a discussion with Arkady and Gustav and was not sure.\n\nIf we have chain re-orgs and a block gets discarded/stalled due to a better chain, do we put the transactions from those block(s) back into the pool, as long as they weren't mined already in the new chain as well?\n\nIf not this could loose transactions, and puts the burden of resending transactions to the user, which is IMO the wrong approach.\n\nOnce submitted the node should make sure its keep as long in the pool until its mined at some point.\n",
