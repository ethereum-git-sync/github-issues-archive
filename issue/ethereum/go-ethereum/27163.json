  "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI am interested in working with the Go Ethereum (Geth) client and would like to customize it for my specific requirements, particularly in terms of validator rewards and staking. I understand that Ethereum 2.0 has transitioned to a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which introduces staking and validator rewards in the Beacon Chain.\r\n\r\n If there are any relevant files or functions (Validator Rewards) in Geth that could help me with this, please let me know.
