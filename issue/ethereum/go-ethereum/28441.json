Previously, `codeHash` consistently returned the hash of the empty string `0xc5d2460186f7233c927e7db2dcc703c0e500b653ca82273b7bfad8045d85a470` and `storageHash` returned the empty MPT root hash `0x56e81f171bcc55a6ff8345e692c0f86e5b48e01b996cadc001622fb5e363b421`.\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ curl localhost:8545 \\ \r\n      -X POST \\\r\n      -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\r\n      -d '{ \"method\": \"eth_getProof\", \"params\": [\"0x0010000000000000000000000000000000000000\", [], \"latest\"], \"id\": 1, \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\" }'\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Actual behaviour\r\n\r\nThe previous command returns\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\r\n  \"id\": 1,\r\n  \"result\": {\r\n    \"address\": \"0x0010000000000000000000000000000000000000\",\r\n    \"accountProof\": [\r\n      ...\r\n    ],\r\n    \"balance\": \"0x0\",\r\n    \"codeHash\": \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\",\r\n    \"nonce\": \"0x0\",\r\n    \"storageHash\": \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\",\r\n    \"storageProof\": []\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nThe previous command should return the correct hash for \"empty\" data:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\r\n  \"id\": 1,\r\n  \"result\": {\r\n    \"address\": \"0x0010000000000000000000000000000000000000\",\r\n    \"accountProof\": [\r\n      ...\r\n    ],\r\n    \"balance\": \"0x0\",\r\n    \"codeHash\": \"0xc5d2460186f7233c927e7db2dcc703c0e500b653ca82273b7bfad8045d85a470\",\r\n    \"nonce\": \"0x0\",\r\n    \"storageHash\": \"0x56e81f171bcc55a6ff8345e692c0f86e5b48e01b996cadc001622fb5e363b421\",\r\n    \"storageProof\": []\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "@rjl493456442  I don't think I understand your assessment for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n- This is otherwise a breaking change, that was introduced by @holiman fix #28357 in v1.13.4. Previously, `0xc5d24...d85a470`  and `0x56e8...63b421` were returned exactly as described in my issue. Therefore, this new behavior breaks applications that have relied on such results for the last 5 years.\r\n- More importantly, I believe that the new behavior is inconsistent with [EIP-1186](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1186) describing this API:\r\n  - > `codeHash`: `DATA`, 32 Bytes - hash of the code of the account. For a simple Account without code it will return \"0xc5d2460186f7233c927e7db2dcc703c0e500b653ca82273b7bfad8045d85a470\"\r\n    \r\n    The EIP does not mention the new *special* case of empty accounts having the null hash. Although it, admittedly, doesn't explicitly say the opposite either, it still mentions \"hash of the code\" and aims to be consistent with `eth_getCode`. In this case `eth_getCode` returns `0x0`. So my consistent interpretation of the EIP would be to return `keccak256(0x0)` and not some special value.\r\n  - And perhaps most importantly, `storageHash` was explicitly introduced in this API by the EIP to allow for Merkle (non-)inclusion proofs, stating \"All storage will deliver a MerkleProof starting with this rootHash\".  When this API is used as intended to prove the non-inclusion of a storage key, e.g. `0x0`, for a non-existent account, then this statement is technically no longer correct: The API returns an empty \"proof trie\" in `storageProof` that has a root hash of `0x56e8...63b421`. This no longer matches the supplied `storageHash` of `0x0000...0000`, and such a discrepancy usually indicates an invalid proof.\r\n\r\nOf course, it would be easy for an application using this API to introduce special handling to be compatible with the previous behavior, and it might even be useful in some cases to maintain the distinction between \"empty account\" and \"non-existent account\". However, this seems to me to be a geth-specific response that is not covered by the EIP, and thus could cause compatibility issues with applications or other node/protocol implementations.",
