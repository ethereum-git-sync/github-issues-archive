    "body": "IMHO bzzd should not have an account subcommand. The long term idea on my end is to remove reliance on the keystore from bzzd. Users should supply a key file or let bzzd generate the swarm account key. It already accepts a key file and you can use that to set up an instance in docker. \r\n\r\nI have similar feelings about attach: if you want to attach you can use geth attach or node.js. Adding bzzd attach just adds one more feature that we need to preserve. We already regret having geth attach.\r\n\r\nMerging executables is your choice but I kind of like the separation personally. \r\n\r\n",

I think that's mainly the idea.\r\n\r\n> I have similar feelings about attach\r\n\r\nAttach is useful for injecting commands in a running docker container. Right now for our testnet swarm on azure we include the geth executable in the containers for the sole reason of being able to inject commands with \"geth --exec='cmd' attach ipc:/path/bzzd.ipc \r\nWouldn't it be nice if we could do that without geth?",
