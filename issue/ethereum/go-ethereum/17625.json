  "body": "We have an layer2 infrastructure release coming and we were thinking about testing it with large amount of real users at scale and would require quite a lot of ETH for the purpose of better UX/look-and-feel(we can give each user 1000wei, but from a perspective of testing, 1ETH feels much better). However, Rinkeby test ETH requires social account verification and the amount each request can get is very limited. I was wondering if there is a way to submit a request to get a large amount of test ETH with real identity so our action is 100% accountable but we still get a lot of tokens for testing purposes. ",
