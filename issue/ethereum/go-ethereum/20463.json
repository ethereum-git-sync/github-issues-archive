  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nASIC resistance was a key feature in the white paper, and a primary reason why Ethereum became popular among the general public which drove a lot of its value.\r\n\r\nNow basically no one uses ethereum except for fringe people.\r\n\r\nWhy is the coin no longer ASIC resistant?\r\n\r\nEthereum just got delisted from a huge exchange and price keeps going down. Whatever strategy or logic behind having huge chinese ASIC miners on the network doesn't seem to make sense morally, logically, or even in reality.\r\n\r\nWhen will we have ASIC resistance?\r\n\r\nNo normal can use the coin or mine it anymore.\r\n\r\nLooking to hear that this will happen so or at least some intelligent thoughts as to why you think Ethereum should stay on this downward path.\r\n\r\n",
