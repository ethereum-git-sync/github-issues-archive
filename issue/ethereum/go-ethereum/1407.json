  "body": "It seems eth.resend example: https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/JavaScript-Console#ethresend just doesn't work anymore because you get an error \"not enough gas\" instead of going through and having to resend/correct it. (Wasn't able to get the demo shown in wiki running.)\n\nAlso, it uses required args in implementation, but optional args in the wiki. (Unless I am misunderstanding how this works...)\n\nPlease consider for removal on implementation on wiki. (Or fix up wiki or implementation to be consistent if this still has some limited usage.) Please also consider this issue as low priority, as I'd prefer everyone work on getting Frontier out the door before working on this! (But... wouldn't everyone?)\n",
