I'm thinking the CLI param would be something like \"--difficulty=1\", where the int value represents a constant, potentially low difficulty. The param would only effect local/private chain testnet nodes. The reason for this feature is: I'd like to be able to mine, and test DApp transactions locally without having to tax the hell out of my local GPU's.\n",
