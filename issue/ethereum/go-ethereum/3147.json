    "body": "OK. Did you try sending the same transaction with higher gas price? Again, you can find the last nonce that was mined into a block using `eth_getTransactionCount`. In the geth console, use `eth.getTransactionCount(address)`. \n\nGeneral advice: If the transactions are sent by software it is advisable to manage acount nonces explicitly so you can resend transactions as necessary.\n",
