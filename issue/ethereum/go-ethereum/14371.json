The reason that might be a nice choice is that it also acts as a data store for your blockchain and other nodes can sync with the bootnode too if noone else is available.",

    "body": "@boorac We've added a new tool to Geth 1.6 called `puppeth` which could help set up smaller scale private networks (as it's new, it might have some rough edges). That's how we're hosting the Rinkeby testnet for example (https://www.rinkeby.io/). Everything you see there (apart from the block explorer) was deployed and is maintained via `puppeth`. If you have a spare machine/vm to deploy the bootnode/stats server/faucet etc on, it might be an easy tool to use.\r\n\r\nIf you want to roll manually, I'd suggest using `puppeth` to create your genesis file and save it. Then you can init a full node via `geth --init genesis.json`, after which just start like any normal geth node. It will print it's enode address that you can use to set as `--bootnode` for others. Only take care that the IP address is correct (geth tries to display your external IP, which might be wrong in a private network setting, and it might also be `[::]` if it can't difure it out); just change that to whatever address your machine is reachable at.",
