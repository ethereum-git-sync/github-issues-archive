  "body": "#### System information\r\n\r\nGeth version: `geth version`\r\nOS & Version: Windows/Linux/OSX\r\nCommit hash : (if `develop`)\r\n\r\n#### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\n#### Actual behaviour\r\nAfter starting \"--fast --cache=1024 it starts using 4-6G RAM.\r\nThen some new entreis and receipts are downloaded.\r\nAfter a while it keeps \"imported new state entries\", counting down to 1500 and suddenly started at 3, 4 or 10,000 again.\r\nCleaned and tried again.. but same behaviour.\r\nSometimes i cant read the lines because of its speed, but then suddenly it \"hangs\" and pending increases couple of thousends.\r\nI have tried both on WD enterprise 4TB HDD (160MB/s with 2GB memory disk) and on Samsung PRO 850 1TB (with cache 1440MB/s), but same behaviour.\r\nProcessed grows to couple of millions, pending counts down and suddenly increases lot and counting down again.\r\nMeanwhile it askes 100% from the HDD/SSD...\r\nAt beginning it uses 40-60Mbps internet, but after while only couple of Mbps... while HDD /SDD keeps 100%.\r\nAlso couple of times \"dropping peer\" where the next state entry increases from for example 3000 to 6000.\r\n\r\nI tried 1.7 and this version sometimes shows duplicated database entries and pending decreases lot..\r\n\r\nBut even then... Its so vague what geth is doing... nor count, nor flushed, nor processed, nor pending nor retry seems the reason pending jumps and increases that much, or does it?\r\nWhat is pending and why its not just counting down, but jumping to everywhere big values?\r\n\r\nEdit: it seems like when count=\"small value\" situation above more stable. \r\nBut at the moment count=\"\" get bigger values, the situation above appears (\" pending=\" counting down.. pauses and then jumping to higher number and counting down again looping).\r\nWhen I do extra harddisk actions (like defrag) count gets smaller values and pending counts down like ti should.\r\nStopping it (geth gets whole hdd usage) count values increase tot 384 (fluctuating.. sometimes 2, sometimes 10, etc.) and then pending becomes very instable and jumps from 1000 to 12,000 etc.\r\n\r\nIt also seems like geth starts uploading after a while (maybe to other peers) while itself isn't in sync yet, also causing slowing down syncing and instable loops.\r\nAt this moment 1.7 needs lot more time (every step elapsed=\"\" takes couple of seconds) but pending isn't that instable. Also much calmer behaviour / stable behaviour.\r\nPending now is under 1500.. which never was. Sometimes situations appears pending increasing from 1298 to 4473 for example.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Backtrace\r\n\r\n````\r\n[backtrace]\r\n````\r\n`INFO [08-16|23:52:10] Deduplicating database entries           deduped=900000\r\nINFO [08-16|23:52:13] Imported new state entries               count=384 flushed=459 elapsed=3.216s    processed=17433 pending=15216 retry=0   duplicate=0 unexpected=4\r\nINFO [08-16|23:52:15] Imported new state entries               count=384 flushed=455 elapsed=2.15s     processed=17817 pending=14925 retry=2   duplicate=0 unexpected=4\r\nINFO [08-16|23:52:15] Imported new state entries               count=2   flushed=4   elapsed=0s        processed=17819 pending=14921 retry=0   duplicate=0 unexpected=4\r\nINFO [08-16|23:52:21] Imported new state entries               count=384 flushed=454 elapsed=5.312s    processed=18203 pending=14631 retry=0   duplicate=0 unexpected=4\r\nINFO [08-16|23:52:21] Imported new state entries               count=1   flushed=1   elapsed=0s        processed=18204 pending=14630 retry=1   duplicate=0 unexpected=4\r\nINFO [08-16|23:52:26] Imported new state entries               count=384 flushed=479 elapsed=5.216s    processed=18588 pending=14299 retry=0   duplicate=0 unexpected=4\r\nINFO [08-16|23:52:26] Imported new state entries               count=2   flushed=1   elapsed=28ms      processed=18590 pending=14300 retry=0   duplicate=0 unexpected=4\r\nINFO [08-16|23:52:27] Imported new state entries               count=384 flushed=563 elapsed=1.618s    processed=18974 pending=13842 retry=2   duplicate=0 unexpected=4\r\nINFO [08-16|23:52:52] Imported new state entries               count=384 flushed=256 elapsed=24.666s   processed=19358 pending=14330 retry=382 duplicate=0 unexpected=4\r\nINFO [08-16|23:52:52] Imported new state entries               count=2   flushed=1   elapsed=1ms       processed=19360 pending=14330 retry=0   duplicate=0 unexpected=4\r\nINFO [08-16|23:52:52] Imported new state entries               count=2   flushed=2   elapsed=1ms       processed=19362 pending=14328 retry=2   duplicate=0 unexpected=4`",
