  "body": "Hello,\r\nI would like to get a clarification what is the relation between geth and so-called beacon node after merge? If I understood it correctly, geth is exchanging information with beacon chain in now and it requires beacon chain for syncing?\r\n\r\nSo I picked the prysm beacon chain implementation as it looked the easiest to run, but I cannot make it work.\r\n\r\nMy folder structure is as follows:\r\n\r\n/home/eth\r\n    /.ethereum # data\r\n    /node # geth (1.10.24)\r\n    /node_beacon # prysm (3.1.1)\r\n\r\nI whitelisted all TCP, UDP ports required for running both and checked with MX Toolbox that ports are discoverable (RPC and P2P for both geth and prysm).\r\n\r\nI am running geth with following options:\r\n\r\n/home/eth/node/build/bin/geth --cache=4096 --http --http.api eth,web3,net,engine,debug,personal --http.addr 0.0.0.0 --http.port 12001 --port 30303 --datadir=/home/eth/.ethereum --allow-insecure-unlock --rpc.allow-unprotected-txs --authrpc.addr 0.0.0.0 --authrpc.port 8551 --authrpc.vhosts 0.0.0.0 --authrpc.jwtsecret /home/eth/node_beacon/jwt.hex\r\n\r\nI am running prysm with following options:\r\n\r\n/home/eth/node_beacon/prysm.sh beacon-chain --datadir=/home/eth/.ethereum --http-web3provider=http://127.0.0.1:12001 --rpc-host=0.0.0.0 --monitoring-host=0.0.0.0 --execution-endpoint=http://127.0.0.1:8551 --accept-terms-of-use --jwt-secret=/home/eth/node_beacon/jwt.hex\r\n\r\nAnd both services seem to start up and run fine, I do not get any errors. However, after they are setup it seems the geth waits for prysm while prysm waits for geth:\r\n\r\nThose are the logs:\r\n\r\nGeth:\r\n\r\nWARN [09-15|22:52:53.139] Local chain is post-merge, waiting for beacon client sync switch-over...\r\nINFO [09-15|22:50:49.891] Legacy sync reached merge threshold      number=15,537,419 hash=78c1c2..58cd79 td=58,750,256,312,486,924,353,244 ttd=58,750,000,000,000,000,000,000\r\n\r\nPrysm:\r\n\r\ntime=\"2022-09-15 22:51:18\" level=warning msg=\"Execution client is not syncing\" prefix=powchain\r\ntime=\"2022-09-15 22:51:22\" level=info msg=\"Waiting for enough suitable peers before syncing\" prefix=initial-sync required=3 suitable=0\r\n\r\nFrom the logs it seems to me that geth waits for prysm to start doing something, while prysm complaining the geth is not syncing anything? What am I doing wrong? It's really unclear to me how to setup both properly.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n\r\nI already asked this in https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/25778 but @karalabe closed the issue unjustly without providing real answer, just a gimmicks without even providing example of that gimmick! Don't close my issue without answering the question. The geth is no longer standalone node so it needs the beacon to work properly. I do not see any documentation how to do properly on geth side and following prysm documentation I ma left around hanging for not working sync. Answer the problem that was asked properly. You are just going closing all similar issues and yet, ppl have the same problem as me not able to find the proper answer. If you don't know just avoid this topic karalabe. Thanks!",

What's next, will you tell me, that you don't do any testing across those vendors and just hope geth works correctly? Or that you don't care about those vendors and henceforth your own users that will have to run those two together and would like an answer from ppl like you with more experience on the subject?

    "body": "> And why do I still have 0 peer connections after having ports open and checked and everything being run as according to documentation? \r\n\r\nAsk Prysm devs. Why do you expect me to know the answer why your setup or Prysm is off?\r\n\r\n> This is no issue related to prysm, but an issue related for running geth-prysm together. How do I know the bug is not on geth side?\r\n\r\nBecause Geth has absolutely 0 to do with the beacon client's P2P network. It's a completely different thing altogether. The beacon/consensus client needs to have it's own network connection to it's counterpart peers. Why it cannot do that for you, I have no idea. You should probably raise the log levels in your Prysm node and see what's happening. Or you know, ask the Prsym devs how you could debug it further.\r\n\r\n> What's next, will you tell me, that you don't do any testing across those vendors and just hope geth works correctly?\r\n\r\nThat is exactly true. Geth conforms to the spec and passes all the integration tests for it. We don't need to test how vendor Xs project Y works, because it's irrelevant. But in this specific case, your issue has nothing to do with integration, your beacon client setup if off somewhere, and you'll need to find it and figure it out. Based on your logs, the issue is that your beacon client does not have network connectivity. That's not on us.\r\n\r\n> I got really disappointed from you today.\r\n\r\nSorry for not offering you live customer support for a different open source project than the one your complaining about. Both of which you get to use for free.\r\n",
