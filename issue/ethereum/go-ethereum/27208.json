There appears to be no way to disambiguate these two cases.\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\r\nCheck https://etherscan.io/tx/0x5ca691b0415722b95b596b2cfd45cee7572540e456accd8478445e40c86ab778#statechange\r\nFor the frxETH token, we can see that two storage slots were changed- one increased and one is zeroed.\r\n\r\nWhen I check the trace output of this call:\r\n\r\n```\r\n❯ cat trace.json | jq '.result.pre.\"0x5e8422345238f34275888049021821e8e08caa1f\".storage'\r\n{\r\n  \"0x1a7ad90a4b0c412d59e4127bd2d2f5276514c60aee7c77da0d8c2b326ef7c489\": \"0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000ae7e214f3a3b33f4e37\",\r\n  \"0xb953595e5003b3f7c54e53b6f59502915a6d381e159e09dbe5056b4bfbdaca80\": \"0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002b2926891c6ddd518\"\r\n}\r\n\r\n❯ cat trace.json | jq '.result.post.\"0x5e8422345238f34275888049021821e8e08caa1f\".storage'\r\n{\r\n  \"0x1a7ad90a4b0c412d59e4127bd2d2f5276514c60aee7c77da0d8c2b326ef7c489\": \"0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000aea94a75c357a1d234f\"\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is only one slot in the `post` output, showing the slot that increased. The second changed slot (which was zeroed) is not included in the output. \r\n\r\nFrom https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/25422#issuecomment-1262779046 I can see this change was intentional, but I don't understand how it is trivial to fix this problem given that the output gives no indication as to why the slot is not included in `post`- it could either be unchanged by the tx or it could be zero'd",
