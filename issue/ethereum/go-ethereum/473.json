  "body": "I wanted to list the differences from SEC 1 that I found while working on ECIES for ethereumj.  SEC 1 says:\n- IV should be all zeros and should not be transmitted (see section 3.8 discussion about IV/ICB)\n- IV should not be part of MAC (message tag) computation\n- also noticed an extra hash of the MAC key in the go-ethereum implementation\n\nI believe that the reason SEC 1 recommends constant IV is that the ephemeral key is used only once, so use of a random IV is superfluous.\n\nThe changes don't seem to introduce any weakness, just curious about the motivation.\n\n( @romanman )\n",

    "body": "@romanman Hi! Apologies for the late reply - we've been so busy with other parts of Ethereum lately :)\n\nSection 3.8 in SEC 1 Version 2.0 specifies zeroed IV for TDES in CBC mode and for AES in CBC and CTR modes, but it does not specify what IV value to use for plain XOR CTR.\n\nThe Go implementation uses XOR CTR: https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/develop/crypto/ecies/ecies.go#L193\n\nYou're right that IV should not be transmitted as part of the ciphertext, as specified in SEC 1.\n\nWhile the IV value is not specified for XOR CTR, it's implied it cannot be random if it should not be transmitted as part of the ciphertext, as then the other party cannot know it.\n\nIf it's non-random, we can set it to the zeroed value defined for AES in CTR mode.\n\nIt's correct that IV should not be part of the message to take MAC over, defined as concatenation of ciphertext and \"SharedInfo2\" in section 5.1.3 step 8.\n\nThe extra hashing of the MAC key is indeed not specified in SEC 1 and can be removed.\n\nPull request: https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/847\n\n@fjl @subtly Please review - if this is correct C++ would also need to be updated to be compatible.\n\nSEC1: http://www.secg.org/sec1-v2.pdf\n",
