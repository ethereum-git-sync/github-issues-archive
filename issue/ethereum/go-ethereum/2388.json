I haven't considered the homestead transitioning in the simulator :D @obscuren has been working on modifying the `core` to allow configuring a few chain characteristics and also already started building a configuration capability to the simulated chain. Merging the first PR needs a very thorough review but after that's done, we can probably soup up the simulated chain in a matter of hours. Will keep you posted on when this gets a real fix :)\n",
