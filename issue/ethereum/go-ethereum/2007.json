    "body": "A transaction receipt is generated after the transaction had been processed. It contains things like the amount of gas used or the contract address which are calculated during processing. When you submit a transaction it takes some time before the transaction is processed and the receipt is generated. Until then null is returned as an indication that there is currently no receipt found for the given hash.\n\nIf you are on a private network make sure you are mining and the transaction enters and leaves the transaction pool. If you restart the node before the transaction is processed it's lost. If you are not make sure you are connected to the netwerk and have some peers.\n\nIn your example you are using a gas price of 0. I'm not sure if there are miners out who are accepting this but this is probably the reason your transaction is not being processed. I would recommend removing the gas price, the node will then use a default price which is currently 0.00001 ether.\n",

    "body": "> What is your expectation of what it should return when the transaction is not yet mined?\n\nI would expect `web3.eth.getTransactionReceipt` to return only when the tx was actually mined.\n\nHow can we know a transaction has been mined otherwise?\nHere is what I tested:\n\n``` javascript\nvar whenTransactionMined = function(tx, callback)\n{\n    var check = setInterval(\n        () => {\n            web3.eth.getTransaction(tx, (e, r) => {\n                if (r.blockHash != 0)\n                {\n                    clearInterval(check);\n                    callback(r);\n                }\n            })\n        },\n        5000\n    );\n};\n\nwhenTransactionMined(result, (block) => {console.log(block)});\n```\n\nWhen the tx is mined, r.blockHash is properly set.\nBut that's a very cumbersome way to deal with this.\n\nCan't we have some kind of event/callback oriented way to know when the tx was mined ?\n\nRegards,\n",
