  "body": "Geth version: `v1.11.2`\r\nOS & Version: Windows 11\r\n\r\n#### Expected behaviour\r\nSubscribing to only the **NEW** transaction hashes from ETH mempool\r\n\r\n#### Actual behaviour\r\nSubscribing to both **NEW** and **OLD** transaction hashes that are pending for hours/days\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\r\nrun func: gethclient.SubscribePendingTransactions()\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\nI used function client.TransactionByHash() to convert all the new pending tx hashes to *types.Transacton to scrape some info from them. I noticed getting rate limited immidiately. My RPC has limit of 330req/s, and the ETH TPS is currently around 11/12, so I was totally surprised. Then I printed out the subscribed tx hashes and manually checked them on Etherscan. Immidiatelly noticed most of the printed txs are pending since hours/days. From my understanding the function should only be subscribing to **NEW** txes, since the start of the subscription, not printing all pending txs including the old ones from the mempool. Any fix/explanation please? Maybe I am doing something wrong? Using context.Background(). \r\n",

The txpool sees significantly more \"intermediate\" transactions than what end up in the final block. By subscribing to pending transactions, you should get the entire stream of txs that are added to the pool, even those that will end up being dropped seconds later. This seems to be logical to me.",

If we then get another tx from the same account, and the new tx fills the gap, those queued txs will re-enter 'pending' and will be delivered on the subscription another time. \r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure the behavior observed here is related to activity at the tail end of the fee market. A lot of replacing/queueing will happen there.\r\n\r\n",
