  "body": "This issue is to suggest integration of go-ethereum into Google's [oss-fuzz](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz).\r\n\r\nIntegration would mean that Google would run the existing fuzzers free of charge continuously, and in case any bugs are found, a detailed bug report would be sent out to the maintainers.\r\n\r\nI can confirm that the existing fuzzers run fine on oss-fuzz's infrastructure, and I will be happy to commit my setup to oss-fuzz. All I need are the email addresses of the maintainers. These email addresses would be uploaded to a public list and can be changed at any time.\r\n\r\nWhile oss-fuzz is a free service, there is an implied expectation that found bugs are fixed, so that the resources spent on fuzzing go-ethereum will be put to good use.\r\n\r\nA list of projects being fuzzed through oss-fuzz can be found [here](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/tree/master/projects).",
