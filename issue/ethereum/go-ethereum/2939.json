This is annoying because if I have a line that's longer than the width of my terminal, Geth console will only display part of it, so I can't just copy paste and fix my error.\n\nSimilarly, for some reason Geth didn't retain a `contract.new` call for me. It was a huge line so maybe it hit some limit in some package and got discarded, but it's still an unfortunate thing we should fix.\n",
