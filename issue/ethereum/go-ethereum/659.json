    "body": "As discussed [here](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/583) `geth` isn't part of master yet. If you'd like to build from source (I'll put up a wiki page for this as well) you need to `git checkout develop && cd cmd/geth`. Now the tricky part is building because since you're building from `develop` you need to install all deps manually (it isn't so hard, just requires manual labour). The following step will fail but you need to do this first in order to get the list of deps: `godep go install`. You'll now see a bunch of error about a dependency not being installed. What you'll have to do is `go get <dependency>` for each that is missing. Once you've installed the deps do a `godep go install` again and it will install `geth`.\n\nIf that doesn't work, let me know. \n",
