This is spotted by testing / developing the .net api (Nethereum).\n#### Backtrace\n\n```\n[backtrace]\n```\n",

    "body": "What probably is happening is that you send the request to create the filter on different IPC connections. IPC connections are normally kept open unlike HTTP connections that are created and destroyed. Therefore filters are tight to the IPC connection, when the connection is closed the filters are removed too. If you create 2 filters over 2 IPC connections they would both have the filter id of 0x00 for that particular connection.\n\nSimple test is to send 2 requests over the same connection, you would see that the first request would lead to a filter id of 0x00 and the second to 0x01.\n\nThis behaviour is changed in develop where a random non guessable filter id is returned. For example:\n\n```\n{\n  \"id\": 73,\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"result\": \"0x9100a56460f9cbf8a2f33adccab89f7d\"\n}\n```\n\nThis prevents DApps to retrieves logs, or uninstall filters that they don't have created them self. After that filters are global and it works as you expects.\n",
