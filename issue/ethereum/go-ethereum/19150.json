  "body": "#### System information\r\nSwarm version: 0.3.11\r\nOS & Version: Linux Ubuntu\r\n\r\n#### Expected behaviour\r\nView uploaded swarm website correctly\r\n\r\n#### Actual behaviour\r\nWebsite does not display content correctly.  It looks like swarm is parsing the manifest incorrectly when trying to serve up the content.  For example, my site includes the html/css bootstrap directory, but swarm is serving everything in that directory as an unrelated image.\r\n\r\nHowever if I access the very same swarm addressed content (same hash) via swarm-gateway or `eth.show` then it renders fine. So i'm not sure what version of swarm they are running but I would guess an older version that doesn't have this issue.\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\r\nCreate a website with several directories with different content types,  like js, html, img, css. You can use the `bzz-list` method to visually see how different swarm providers are interpreting the same manifest differently.\r\n\r\nJust as an aside, i THINK the first time I accessed the content via my local swarm node it served correctly, then all subsequent attempts result in the bug, so perhaps its a cache issue.\r\n\r\n",
