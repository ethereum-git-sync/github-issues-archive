  "body": "#### System information\r\n\r\nGeth version: `1.5.5`\r\nOS & Version: Ubuntu Linux 14.04\r\nCommit hash : (if `develop`)\r\n\r\n#### Expected behaviour\r\neth_getFilterLogs returns all events in the blockchain for a given solidity contract (address).\r\n\r\n#### Actual behaviour\r\nFor a newly sync'd chain, sometimes the events are present sometimes they aren't. To clarify, the chain exists and it definitely has events in it from the given solidity contract. When a NEW geth client is started, and syncs with the chain, sometimes that client will be returned the events on the getFilterLogs call and sometimes it wont. I havent been able to narrow down further yet.\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\r\nNot exactly sure because I can't narrow it down.\r\n1. install a smart contract onto the chain.\r\n2. call a non-constant method on the contract that creates 1 or more events.\r\n3. verify that the method completed successfully\r\n4. Start up a new geth client (and wait for syncing to complete) and then run the following steps on the new client\r\n5. create a filter (eth_newFilter) by smart contract address to retrieve the events\r\n6. invoke eth_getFilterLogs with the filter created in 5.\r\n7. sometimes the events from 2 are returned sometimes they arent.\r\n\r\n#### Backtrace\r\nthere is none\r\n\r\n",
