  "body": "Apologies for skipping the issue template, but this isn't a bug with go-ethereum per se.\r\n\r\nDepending on `github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/eth` is pretty basic. Unfortunately, it pulls in a pretty heavy cgo dependency:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ go list -m github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum\r\ngithub.com/ethereum/go-ethereum v1.9.9\r\n$ go mod why gopkg.in/olebedev/go-duktape.v3\r\n# gopkg.in/olebedev/go-duktape.v3\r\ngitlab.com/vocdoni/go-dvote/chain\r\ngithub.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/eth\r\ngithub.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/eth/tracers\r\ngopkg.in/olebedev/go-duktape.v3\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor some quick numbers - most Go packages in a regularly sized project build in under two seconds on my laptop, and they mostly build in parallel with other packages. However, `go-duktape` takes a whopping 25s to build on the same laptop, supposedly because it has a lot of C code to build without any parallelism.\r\n\r\nWe could make this faster in the Go toolchain, by building cgo files in parallel (https://github.com/golang/go/issues/9887). However, I doubt that would help much. The vast majority of the duktape codebase is in a single C file clocking in at almost four megabytes: https://github.com/olebedev/go-duktape/blob/v3/duktape.c\r\n\r\nThe bottom line is that duktape is a heavy cgo dependency, and there currently isn't a way around it. Is it truly a core part of go-ethereum? Assuming that it is not, could it be removed from the dependency tree when one simply imports the \"core\" packages?\r\n\r\nIf it is absolutely necessary for the core packages, I think you still have other options:\r\n\r\n* Consider alternatives, such as pure-Go javascript engines (was performance a factor here?)\r\n* Use build tags to enable/disable `duktape`, similar to `math/big`'s `-tags=math_big_pure_go`\r\n* Allow building `go-ethereum` with `CGO_ENABLED=0`, which currently fails due to duktape not building",

    "body": "To further drive why the 25s sequential build time is painful: the project in question builds from scratch in a total of 40s or so, including link time. Given that the Go linker is going to get significantly faster soon, I assume the last chunk of linker work will get smaller. This will leave us with duktape being to blame for why over half of the build time is only using one CPU, being a bottleneck for the overall build time.",

    "body": "Duktape isn't necessary for your average Ethereum node, however it is used by transaction tracing. The reason we went with it is to allow anyone to upload their own .js tracing script instead of relying on us to build and maintain all the possible tracers in Go ourselves. And yes, you hit the nail on the head, it's used due to performance reasons (an order of magnitude faster than Otto).\r\n\r\nI don't think we can nuke it out altogether, but I think adding an optional build tag to disable it could be easy enough if someone knows what they are doing.

    "body": "The fundamental issue here is that package eth depends on eth/tracers, the only reason being that the `eth.Ethereum.APIs` callback function returns the tracer API handler. `APIs` is needed to satisfy the [`node.Service`](https://godoc.org/github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/node#Service) interface. \r\n\r\nTo remove the dependency, the path requiring the least amount of changes is refactoring eth/tracers into its own `Service`. This will require changes in cmd/geth to also register the new service with the `node.Node` instance. \r\n",
