  "body": "This test: https://github.com/ethereum/tests/blob/develop/StateTests/stSpecialTest.json#L2 has a transaction which costs only about 80k, but needs about 2GB of RAM and 18s in go.\nThe reason is the usage of a map to store JUMPDEST positions. In this test the code does 1024 recursive calls to itself. The code looks like: <1024 recursiv calls> STOP JUMPDEST JUMPDEST .... JUMPDEST (having 15k JUMPDESTS opcodes).\nCpp used a set for storing the JUMPDESTs, and needed 1.2 GB of RAM, we fixed it by using a vector of uint64_t instead (https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/pull/2032), although this slightly reduces the performance.\nThis was found by a bug hunter through the bounty program. Gustav knows the details.\n",

The caching scheme keeps the memory usage\nlinear even for more complex scenarios involving multiple contracts. \n\nWith the fix in place, your test executes in about half a second and uses around 700k of memory for the jumpdest locations. \n",
