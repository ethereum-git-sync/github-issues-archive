  "body": "#### System information\n\nGeth version: \n\n```\nGeth\nVersion: 1.4.8-stable\nProtocol Versions: [63 62 61]\nNetwork Id: 1\nGo Version: go1.6.2\nOS: linux\nGOPATH=\nGOROOT=/usr/lib/go-1.6\n```\n\nOS & Version: Ubuntu, kernel 3.14.32\nCommit hash : Ubuntu most recent package\n\nNot sure it is a bug, but I asked the question [on StackExchange](http://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/6654/endless-loop-emptying-an-account-with-contact-creations) and there is no other explanation yet.\n#### Expected behaviour\n#### Actual behaviour\n\nAs soon as I add ether to the account 0x22e1472e3486dd72f4d65e1f6ca7b2f49205fc26 it is emptied automatically with Contact Creations (with an empty contract).\n\nYou can see it with any explorer. Here is [my last attempt, as seen by Etherscan](http://etherscan.io/address/0x22e1472e3486dd72f4d65e1f6ca7b2f49205fc26):\n\n0x07b541ef53a5aa2d3e22cd8bc1a8cb4e2f982be0f76ed8f96dc7774de834cc84  1793620 22 secs ago 0x22e1472e3486dd72f4d65e1f6ca7b2f49205fc26  [Send]   Contract Creation  0 Ether 0.04400132\n0x797986800b4a66516f675387952eab5e87be051b38019b6ac55216b4dcb1c6a4  1793620 22 secs ago 0x22e1472e3486dd72f4d65e1f6ca7b2f49205fc26  [Send]   Contract Creation  0 Ether 0.04400132\n0xa63c1ce1d68c31e84f2107a5a5c6e936f0cfc45490e00676d675030ec931d5be  1793618 38 secs ago 0xc90cd1fa9940a4d4a07a37c53bb4f423fd286945  [Receive]   0x22e1472e3486dd72f4d65e1f6ca7b2f49205fc26  0.1 Ether   0.00042\n\nWhen the account is empty, contract creation of course stops, and resumes a few seconds after I add ethers. I tried:\n-    restarting geth\n-    running geth with --cache \"0\"\n-    checking with ps that no program was running on my machine, sending requests\n-    it does not come from RPC, since it is not enabled\n\nNone of these changed anything.\n\nThe contract creations have stable characteristics: 2300000 gas units, empty contract, data 0x5b620186a05a131560135760016020526000565b600080601f600039601f565b6000f3 But I don't know how to use these to investigate.\n\nSo, I certainly made a stupid mistake but my question is which one? How to investigate such a problem? Where is the ghost?\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\n\nIf only I knew...\n#### Backtrace\n\nNo crash, no backtrace\n",

    "body": "Out of interest did you run the code that was being proposed by the Slock.It guys when the DAO was being attacked? In fact looking at your transaction I now know you did.\n\nI have just hit actually the same issue with my account 0x81ea02f9f865d072cf75a123f83d25ac22d1dd8a and reading karalabe comment it suddenly dawned on me what happened. I had run that script on an account with a small amount of ethers so I knew I could run it multiple of times without worrying about it as it would just burn the ethers in that account. Of course forgetting exactly how the decentralised network works the transactions that didn't run, due to lack of ethers, stayed as pending transactions for weeks. As soon as I put the ethers into the same account they were goners. \n\nThis was the code we both ran \n\nfor (var i = 0; i < 100; i++) { eth.sendTransaction({from: eth.accounts[0], gas: 2300000, gasPrice: web3.toWei(20, ‘shannon’), data: ‘0x5b620186a05a131560135760016020526000565b600080601f600039601f565b6000f3’}) }\n\nHow do I know this? I checked both our transactions and in the data field you will see:\n\n0x5b620186a05a131560135760016020526000565b600080601f600039601f565b6000f3\n\nSo cost me 20 ethers for that piece of knowledge :)\n",

    "body": "@karalabe is this actually a bug? When you send ether to an account it seems to do something different, for example if account 0 has say 10 ethers but I add the value parameter as below:\n\nfor (var i = 0; i < 100; i++) { eth.sendTransaction({from: eth.accounts[0], gas: 2300000, gasPrice: web3.toWei(20, 'shannon'), data: '0x5b620186a05a131560135760016020526000565b600080601f600039601f565b6000f3', value: web3.toWei(1, 'ether')}) }\n\nIt adds all the 100 transactions to pending but once we run out of funds the transactions all get cleaned up; I guess because they fail due to insufficient funds (or the miners just remove them). Why does it act differently without the value parameter? So in other words why is the same check not being cleanup these transactions because the account does not have enough fuel to pay for them? We seem to have a different check going on for ethers than fuel?\n\nAlso if I'm a bad miner could I have kept the 90 transactions that did not work but are digitally signed to re-apply them to the pending pool when I see ethers appear in that account? Is there anyway other miners would know that these transactions have been rejected (I'm guessing that the nounce is updated so they would know).\n\nI'm just trying to understand when I can be sure that all my transactions have been consumed/cleared and when there is a chance some may still be sitting around to catch me out at some later date. Maybe the answer is you never know so you need to be very carful in putting out signed transactions \nas they could be applied weeks from now as happened in our case.\n",
