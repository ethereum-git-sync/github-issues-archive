  "body": "Each node operator should have the ability to refuse to relay transactions or blocks they do not individually wish to relay. This could be for moral, legal, or personal reasons.\n\n--refuseToRelay 0xADDRESS has two effects\n1. If a transaction alters the value of 0xADDRESS, it should not be relayed to peers\n2. If a block alters the value of 0xADDRESS, it should not be added to the chain, but not relayed to peers\n3. After X number of blocks have been added to a block that alters 0xADDRESS (assuming its on the GHOST chain) this refusal to relay expires. In essence, the node accepts its refusal was a failure\n\n--refuseToRelayOracle 0xADDRESS has the same effect as --refuseToRelay, however it watches a smart contract for a list of addresses which would be refused\n",
