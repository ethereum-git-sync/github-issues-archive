  "body": "As it currently exists, a previous comment of mine discusses the addition of some simple validators. I created this issue as a potential easy pickup for beginners to assist in the go etherium project.\r\n\r\nAs it stands, go-validator and similar packages provide an easier way to handle validation steps in an easy to understand, expandable, and customizable way for any struct with custom fields and functions for validation. Including some built in validators. \r\n\r\nThis issue, is an open epic for adding some number of validators elsewhere in etherium using this idiomatic golang library support to provide this value add for the go-etherium project. \r\n```\r\nfunc (r *Resolver) Block(ctx context.Context, args struct {\r\n\tNumber *Long\r\n\tHash   *common\r\n}) (*Block, error) {\r\n\t// Validate input arguments\r\n\terr := validateBlockArgs(args)\r\n\tif err != nil {\r\n\t\treturn nil, err\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabove is the validation function, using go-validate, which would then run the validation and return an error inline. \r\n\r\nThis is a much more go-thonic and sustainable way to do validation throughout etherium. This could compromise a substantial value add for other areas of the etherium project as well, providing more sustainable and expandable validation in many areas of the codebase.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @wsb1994 in https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/27876#issuecomment-1670004252_\r\n            ",
