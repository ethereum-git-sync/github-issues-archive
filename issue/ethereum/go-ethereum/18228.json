Now we have again a fragmented codebase, because if I include the GÃ¶rli one into puppeth, it will behave slightly differently than the ethash one, not just the changes functionality (e.g. updated libraries). Would be nice to have a single thing being maintained and compatible with both, perhaps via some config switch.\r\n\r\nA further complication is that https://aleth.io/ has been working on a brand new version of the stats server, so might as well be worth it to wait for that to arrive and get thm to make a generic one supporting both poa as well as pow.",
