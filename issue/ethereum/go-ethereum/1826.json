  "body": "While running pool i need to lower getwork target for smaller hashrate, due that POW verification is slow. With 150 workers it starts getting slower, and it creates more stale shares.\n\nI0920 22:16:07.186713   26582 worker.go:282] Invalid header on mined block: Block's nonce is invalid (= f460f5dea5bd35df)\nI0920 22:16:07.335001   26582 worker.go:282] Invalid header on mined block: Block's nonce is invalid (= c652bafc93e22129)\netc...\n\nWould be great to allow all threads process verification allocated dynamically. I have done this in python, and works much more efficient than here. But it's obvious that while running pool i need firstly point shares to geth and later check if getwork target has not been modified.\n",
