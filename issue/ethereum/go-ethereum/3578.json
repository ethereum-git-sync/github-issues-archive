  "body": "Come across this: http://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/10586/how-do-geth-and-parity-handle-notifying-clients-of-events-after-reorgs/10587 while searching for answer of the same question.\r\n\r\nCould you please provide the answer to that question?  I also suggest to document the expected reorg behaviour in the api spec i.e. https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC\r\n\r\nIn addition to that question, I also wonder what's the behaviour of block and pending transaction filters in case of chain reorgs: e.g. \r\n\r\n- will block filter return the same block hash again when it become orphaned (I assume not from the current api as, unlike log filter, it doesn't provide a 'removed' field.  Seems inconsistent.)?  \r\n\r\n- will pending transaction filter return the same transactions again when they are re-included in some new block in case of re-orgs?\r\n\r\nSame question posted to Parity: https://github.com/ethcore/parity/issues/4187",
