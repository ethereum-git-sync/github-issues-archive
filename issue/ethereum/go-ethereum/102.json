  "body": "To reproduce:\n\nAdd the following contract with the correct amount of gas and gas price, with sufficient funds to fund the creation. \n\n```\nthis.store[this.origin()] = 10**20\n\nexit compile {\n    var to = this.data[0]\n    var from = this.origin()\n    var value = this.data[1]\n\n    if this.store[from] > value {\n      this.store[from] = this.store[from] - value\n        this.store[to] = this.store[to] + value\n    }\n}\n```\n\nExpected result: contract is added\nActual result: nothing happens beside the contract being given an address in the logs. No transaction ever appear in subsequent blocks\n\nWhy i think it's a bug: If you omit gas on purpose, or set the gas price too low, a transaction is created and the creation fails, as expected. \n\nPlatform used: private chain between a GCE debian install and osx . \n\nReproduced on 2 different setups by 2 different individuals\n",
