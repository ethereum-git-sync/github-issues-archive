  "body": "I'm really really excited on how web3.js and Ethereum JSON RPC can change the web forever and I will start using to spread it to the world.\n\nI will be glad to know how I could make the communication with Ethereum client. It's because my application are served in SSL (https://www.harlan.com.br/) and the Ethereum runs locally without SSL. Did you guys pretend spread Ethereum only at Mist? Good luck with that! Will be a way more simple if the web application ask for permission on SSL SOCKET like https://local.ethereum.org:8489/ witch resolves at 127.0.0.1. It is on ROADMAP? How could I help? Where I can find the things I need to change in the source?\n\n![screenshot from 2016-01-13 14 56 22](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/195014/12301182/dab33432-ba05-11e5-8120-cb9741dc5ec5.png)\n\nhttp://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit-doc-1-5/wiki/FAQ_SOP\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing\n\nSomeone against that?\n\nhttps://github.com/aaw/maybe_tls\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/465e810c66ccee49410ea34d08102a82ce7b48a5/rpc/comms/http.go#L176\n\nBest regards,\nLucas Fernando Amorim.\n",
