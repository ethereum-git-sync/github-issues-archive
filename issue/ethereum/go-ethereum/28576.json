  "body": "The downloader package operates in two different modes currently: one driven by the engine API for post-merge networks and one driven by chain events for pre-merge networks. Whilst some code is shared, it's excessively annoying to tiptoe around two different models of concurrency.\n\nWe dropped ethash a while back and now that --dev mode switched to a simulated beacon chain and all Clique testnets have been spun down or merged, we can also drop Clique. This would permit us to completely drop the old event driven downloader and related functionality. Should help a lot with cleaning up and maintaining the code to/in a post-merge world.",
