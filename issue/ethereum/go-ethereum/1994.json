    "body": "I think the simplest solution that would work well for most people is simply to check whether \n\n``` go\nif balance - [pending txns: value + gas * price] < new tx value + gas * price {\n  // reject\n}\n```\n\nwith an added optional flag to disable this check. Does this sound feasible @fjl @obscuren @Gustav-Simonsson ? If so, I'd gladly add it as it's a fairly trivial change.\n\nEdit: Yes, it cannot cover gas refunds and contract transactions, but I don't think those cases are relevant to the issue we're trying to solve (preventing accidental transactions flooding the network).\n",
