  "body": "According to `Downloader.fetchParts()` documentation, that should be handled by the [cancel callback](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/eth/downloader/downloader.go#L985). However, although the `Downloader.fetchBodies()` method passes [`d.queue.CancelBodies` as the `cancel` callback](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/eth/downloader/downloader.go#L935), fetchParts itself doesn't seem to do anything with that callback. Same goes for `Downloader.fetchReceipts()`\r\n\r\nMaybe the logic for that has been moved somewhere else, but in that case you should probably remove the `cancel` callback from `fetchParts()`",
