After you made an initial fast-sync (to block `4008950`), it will later switch to block-by-block import, basically acting like a full-sync after `4008950`. So it's expected to be slower at that point. \r\n\r\nAnd for next time, please provide some data/logs about the import process, so it's possible to see if what you're experiencing as 'slow' is within the expected bounds, or if it's actually some bug here.
