Is this PR related? https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/18072\r\n4. Maybe is related with the comment of @karalabe  onthis issue https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/16406? \r\n5 Upgrading from 1.8.17 to 1.8.20 will solve this?\r\n6. In my opinion, seems like a race condition or something, since i have 2 chains, one running for 2 months, the other one for three months and is the first time this error happens \r\n\r\nThis are other related issues:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/16444 (Same issue but i dont have votes pending in my snapshot)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/14381#\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/16825\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/16406\r\n",

    "body": "We experienced a similar deadlock on our fork, and the cause was due to out-of-turn blocks all being difficulty `1`, mixed with a bit of bad luck. When the difficulties are the same, a random block is chosen as canonical, which can produce split decisions. You can compare hashes and recent signers on each node to confirm if your network is deadlocked in the same way. We had to both [modify the protocol](https://github.com/gochain-io/gochain/pull/166) to produce distinct difficulties for each signer, and [modify the same difficulty tie-breaker logic](https://github.com/gochain-io/gochain/pull/304) to make more [deterministic choices](https://github.com/gochain-io/gochain/pull/266).",
