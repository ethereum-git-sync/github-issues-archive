For all the CLI's we set `EnableBashCompletion: true` on the CLI's App struct. \r\n2. According to [urfave's docs about distribution of completions](https://cli.urfave.org/v2/examples/bash-completions/#distribution-and-persistent-autocompletion), users need to copy [this script](https://github.com/urfave/cli/blob/main/autocomplete/bash_autocomplete) to  `/etc/bash_completion.d/<cli_name>` and source it.\r\n3.  To solve distribution problem as mentioned in (2), we can do something like [cobra CLI](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) projects do as [documented here](https://github.com/spf13/cobra/blob/main/site/content/completions/_index.md#creating-your-own-completion-command) . Basically we create a subcommand `completions` which would output [completion script](https://github.com/urfave/cli/blob/main/autocomplete/bash_autocomplete), maybe copy it to `/etc/bash_completion.d/<cli_name>` and inform user to source it.\r\n\r\n\r\nAre you willing to implement this feature?\r\n\r\nYes ! Would really to do it. Please just let me know if this is a good idea and I'd work on  a PR.",
