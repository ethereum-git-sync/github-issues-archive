    "body": "@korjavin Hi, first for the main chain block selection, basically if two blocks have the same difficulty, each one has 50 percent chance to be selected. However for big mining pool, they prefer to select the block generated locally, so I think the reason for your block can due to 2 reasons: your block doesn't have enough luck OR during the reorg, the big mining pool selects their own block and mining the following works based on that.\r\n\r\nAnd regarding the block lost, if the uncle doesn't be included in the following 7 rounds, it will finally lose the chance to be rewarded. so `block lost ...` log is printed. And also, the big mining pool will prefer to select the uncles generated locally. I think it should be a reason for your block lost. And another reason might be the network connection. It means your uncle might doesn't arrive to the big mining pool nodes. ",
