  "body": "#### System information\n\nGeth version: 1.4.18-stable\nOS & Version: Ubuntu 14.04 (server edition, terminal only, no desktop)\n#### Expected behaviour\n\nCreate a private network using geth within a virtual machine (VirtualBox). Setup an account and start the mining process. Should be able to mine blocks every second or two. \n#### Actual behaviour\n\nHowever, mining hangs or is extremely slow. Hash-rate below 20 and is not able to mine blocks at all. \n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\n\nThe problem was related to a low allocation of RAM for the virtual machine. I used 800MB ram memory for virtual machine allocation. I reallocated 2GB of ram and mining worked perfectly.\n\nNot sure how to fix this issue. Maybe a warning during the mining process that the memory allocation is too low. This will save many people a lot of pain and frustration trying to figure out what is wrong. \n",
