  "body": "# Rationale\r\n\r\n**Why should this feature exist?**\r\n\r\nThis feature will improve the data availability for EVM chains and L2s using go-ethereum.\r\n\r\nFirehose is a new technology developed by StreamingFast working with [The Graph Foundation](https://thegraph.com/). The product provides previously unseen capabilities and speeds for indexing blockchain data using a files-based and streaming-first approach.\r\n\r\nFirehose is responsible for extracting data from blockchain nodes in a highly efficient manner. Firehose also consumes, processes, and streams blockchain data to consumers of nodes running Firehose-enabled, instrumented blockchain client software.\r\n\r\n**What are the use-cases?**\r\n\r\nFrom a blockchain core development team’s perspective:\r\n- Immediate support for [Substreams](https://substreams.streamingfast.io/), and its high-speed parallel processing engine.\r\n- Immediate integration into The Graph, through Substreams-based Subgraphs.\r\n- Immediate integration into the latest graph node which can feed directly from the Firehose.\r\n- Immediate support for dozens of sinks (think loading to PostgreSQL, MongoDB, CDC replication, Kafka, Flink, writing to buckets - for ingestion by BigQuery, AWS Redshift, Clickhouse, etc.).\r\n- Activates a community of developers that already know how to index blockchain data, and are going to be happy to discover your blockchain’s data model and activity.\r\n\r\nFrom users’ perspective:\r\n\r\n- The capability to quickly index and sift through your favorite blockchain’s history.\r\n- Stream its output with low latency.\r\n- Hook it to any data systems you have, trading bots, cross-chain bridges, databases.\r\n- All of it in an extremely reliable way.\r\n- Benefit from the anti-fragility brought by The Graph network.\r\n- Offer an army of indexers to service your network.\r\n\r\n# Implementation\r\n\r\n**Do you have ideas regarding the implementation of this feature?**\r\n\r\nRead StreamingFast [Docs](https://firehose.streamingfast.io/integrate-new-chains/new-blockchains) to integrate new chains.",

As far as I know, all the instrumented version does is [emit messages to stdout](https://firehose.streamingfast.io/architecture/data-flow#example-firehose-logs-messages) which get consumed by another process. The instrumentation should have very little impact on performance and storage (and should be easy to hide behind a flag). Though, I'm not an expert in how the instrumentation works and @maoueh would be a much better resource.",
