If not specified, the\noutput file name depends on the arguments and derives from the name\nof the package, such as p.a for package p, unless p is 'main'. If\nthe package is main and file names are provided, the file name\nderives from the first file name mentioned, such as f1 for 'go build\nf1.go f2.go'; with no files provided ('go build'), the output file\nname is the base name of the containing directory.\n\nThe build flags are shared by the build, install, run, and test commands:\n\n```\n-a\n    force rebuilding of packages that are already up-to-date.\n-n\n    print the commands but do not run them.\n-p n\n    the number of builds that can be run in parallel.\n    The default is the number of CPUs available.\n-race\n    enable data race detection.\n    Supported only on linux/amd64, darwin/amd64 and windows/amd64.\n-v\n    print the names of packages as they are compiled.\n-work\n    print the name of the temporary work directory and\n    do not delete it when exiting.\n-x\n    print the commands.\n\n-ccflags 'arg list'\n    arguments to pass on each 5c, 6c, or 8c compiler invocation.\n-compiler name\n    name of compiler to use, as in runtime.Compiler (gccgo or gc).\n-gccgoflags 'arg list'\n    arguments to pass on each gccgo compiler/linker invocation.\n-gcflags 'arg list'\n    arguments to pass on each 5g, 6g, or 8g compiler invocation.\n-installsuffix suffix\n    a suffix to use in the name of the package installation directory,\n    in order to keep output separate from default builds.\n    If using the -race flag, the install suffix is automatically set to race\n    or, if set explicitly, has _race appended to it.\n-ldflags 'flag list'\n    arguments to pass on each 5l, 6l, or 8l linker invocation.\n-tags 'tag list'\n    a list of build tags to consider satisfied during the build.\n    See the documentation for the go/build package for\n    more information about build tags.\n```\n\nThe list flags accept a space-separated list of strings. To embed spaces\nin an element in the list, surround it with either single or double quotes.\n\nFor more about specifying packages, see 'go help packages'.\nFor more about where packages and binaries are installed,\nrun 'go help gopath'.  For more about calling between Go and C/C++,\nrun 'go help c'.\n\nSee also: go install, go get, go clean.\nmake: **\\* [geth] Error 2\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\n#### Backtrace\n\n```\n[backtrace]\n```\n",
