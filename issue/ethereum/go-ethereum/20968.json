    "body": "I tend to agree with @holiman here.\r\n\r\nIt should most definitely not do the same thing as `--goerli`. If you want Görli, specify that. If you specified something different, it's to be expected that it will do something different.\r\n\r\nThe issue with printing a warning is what Martin mentioned, that it will be a never ending task of figuring out all the possible bad combinations people can dream up and try to be smart about them. Don't get me wrong, there are definitely flags where we can and already do more: e.g. we forbid setting insane cache limits that would OOM, we try to detect bad NTP configs, we reject invalid flags and RPC namespaces. However, these are things that many many people had trouble with, so they were worth the effort. The `--networkid` flag is not something people use, or if they do use it, they run their private network and need it for that. Nobody seems to be complaining about it really to warrant special casing.",
