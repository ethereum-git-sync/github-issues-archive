Once geth goes into State sync, there is no user feedback in the `eth_syncing` API, whereas the logs do have feedback:\r\n\r\n```\r\nINFO [08-24|10:13:03.126] State sync in progress                   synced=24.84% state=33.15GiB   accounts=36,914,230@8.21GiB   slots=119,992,027@24.30GiB codes=131,214@663.99MiB eta=3h15m24.538s\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if `eth_syncing` would be updated to have state sync information so we could pass that information to the users instead of being stuff at 99% synced (currentBlock/highestBlock)",
