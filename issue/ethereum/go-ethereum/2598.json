Checked that `NODE_PATH` was defined. Killed and re-started `geth`. There was no change. It has to be noted that the `node` repl can import the library, so it must be visible to `geth`, too.\n",

    "body": "@remyroy I believe the problems are different. \n\nIn my case, I had missed that `solc` is part of the C++ command line tools only, so of course I couldn't find it. It still looks odd to me, given that it looks like the C++ tools are being phased out or are close to it. \n\nMy current hypothesis is that the Ethereum people these days expect us to use the new NodeJS console only, while `geth` is intended to be used as a \"server\" only. AND, because the it's NodeJS, perhaps it can import the NodeJS Solidity compiler I was talking about in my original post.\n\nIf you agree with me, please close this issue, as it was a misunderstanding my side, not a real issue.\n",
