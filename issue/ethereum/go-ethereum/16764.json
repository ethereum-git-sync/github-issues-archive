  "body": "We run our own Geth node and a Golang client service which  subscribes to all log notifications with [`SubscribeFilterLogs()`](https://godoc.org/github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/ethclient#Client.SubscribeFilterLogs) (i.e. using an empty Filter: `ethereum.FilterQuery{}`)\r\n\r\nFrom time to time (4 or 5 times a day) we stop receiving notifications for a few minutes, after which we receive all of them in a burst. This leads us to think that Geth is accumulating them and sending them all together at once in a single burst. Geth doesn't output anything relevant to the logs while this happens.\r\n\r\nThe notification rate during the burst is huge (> 600 notifications per second) which sometimes leads to an `ErrSubscriptionQueueOverflow` error due to the log queue overflowing (reaching its 8000 notifications limit). \r\n\r\nWe have tried to mitigate this by setting a huge buffer size in the reading channel (10000) and making sure that the reading goroutine doesn't block. This reduces the overflows but the behavior is still undesirable.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of such an occurrence:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1005\" alt=\"39969986-fbdecfca-56db-11e8-89be-16d5d85be1f4\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2362916/40283854-7a71cd20-5c85-11e8-80a2-87b971926688.png\">\r\n\r\nWe instrumented the client's push and pop operations and added Prometheus metrics to generate the graph above.  Here are the (minimal) modifications we applied to the go-ethereum client in order to inspect the queue's pushing\r\n[0001-HACK-Exponse-log-notification-queuing.patch.gz](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/files/2020725/0001-HACK-Exponse-log-notification-queuing.patch.gz)\r\n\r\nDuring ~15 minutes (between ~22:27:50 UTC on 2018-05-12 until ~22:41) the client stopped pushing events to the notification queue, after which there is a huge burst of notifications.\r\n\r\nThis seems to suggest that Geth didn't send events over during 15 minutes (or maybe the client implementation somehow wasn't receiving them).\r\n\r\nAfter that, there is a huge peak of event processing (683 events per second on the receiving end) during ~2 minutes. The consumer (with a single goroutine) cannot cope with it (150 events per second), making the queue reach its buffering limit (8K events).\r\n\r\n#### System information\r\n\r\nServer\r\n```\r\n$ /usr/bin/geth version\r\nGeth\r\nVersion: 1.8.8-stable\r\nGit Commit: 2688dab48c9b8ae71b8d95c7678817eaa17f2b53\r\nArchitecture: amd64\r\nProtocol Versions: [63 62]\r\nNetwork Id: 1\r\nGo Version: go1.10\r\nOperating System: linux\r\nGOPATH=\r\nGOROOT=/usr/lib/go-1.10\r\n```\r\n\r\nClient Golang (vendored) version: `1.8.3`\r\n\r\n#### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nUniform delivery of Log notifications\r\n\r\n#### Actual behaviour\r\n\r\nBursty delivery of Log notifications\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\r\n\r\n1. Invoke [`SubscribeFilterLogs()`](https://godoc.org/github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/ethclient#Client.SubscribeFilterLogs) using an empty Filter: `ethereum.FilterQuery{}`.\r\n\r\n2. Launch a goroutine consuming the logs.\r\n\r\n3. Let it run for a few hours.\r\n\r\n4. The subscription returns a `ErrSubscriptionQueueOverflow` error due to the log queue overflowing \r\n\r\n",
