  "body": "I was looking through the Ethereum Go code of the transaction pool and looking at the pool limits.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/9619a610248e9630968ba1d9be8e214b645c9c55/core/tx_pool.go#L135-L138\r\n\r\nAccountQueue is usually set to 64, GlobalQueue is set to 1024. That means that from one account, there can only be 64 non-executable transactions at the same time in the pool. The 65th will be discarded. Is that correct?\r\n\r\nIs the behavior the same with GlobalQueue? Meaning, that if the pool size is already 1024, the 1025th will be discarded as well?\r\n\r\nWhat if I create (more than) 1024 / 64 = 16 accounts and spam the Ethereum network(s) with 64 non-executable transactions each. Won't this block other users for a period of time and make their transactions not be confirmed, or even worse, discarded?",
