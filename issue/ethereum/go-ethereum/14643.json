Syncing speed is 1 block per 5 sec.\r\nAlso leveldb, used by geth, has serious write amplification problems (essentially an SSD killer) when the same data is written tens of times in process of numerous compactions.\r\nAre other DBs considered for geth? The current one seem to be not well suited neither for HDD (too slow) nor for SSD (kills it quickly). Which might be a bigger problem when chain data keeps growing.",

I was syncing only 10 hours daily. I shoved in different fora but can't get any relevant information but one that you should use --fast mode. I thought I should give a try. After running geth for continuous 10 days I have to stopped it yesterday (see #14647). At last I export from geth (2468707) and import in parity and in 6 hours I have the best block.\r\n\r\nAs, I am not a geek, you may understand my frustration.\r\n\r\nMy opinion, do not use geth in fast mode.",
