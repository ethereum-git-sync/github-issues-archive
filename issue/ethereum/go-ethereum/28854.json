Probably useful information there. \r\n\r\nNormally, I'd guess that `0x6e4cc3e76765bdc711cc7b5cbfc5bbfe473b192e0x6` is an attacker who've found your node (public rpc, `0.0.0.0`), but according to the command above, you do not have `--insecure-unlock` enabled, which otherwise typically would be the easiest way to drain the wallet. \r\n\r\nThe address has zero funds on mainnet (an internet-crawler/drainer would probably have non-zero balance). \r\n\r\nI think you'll have to provide more info for us to be able to say anything meaningful.
