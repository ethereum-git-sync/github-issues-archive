    "body": "Hmm, ok. So some hard forks only change the EVM internals, but others also introduce behavioural changes to other parts of the code too (e.g. tx pooling). Whilst we do take care during a transition period to be able to operate in both \"old\" and \"new\" feature sets, eventually we need to start removing old modes of operation (that are not EVM related) as it's a significant burden to tiptoe around code that is not exercised any more.\r\n\r\nWe removed Ethash in a similar vein and will remove Clique too because those require the network to do forward sync whereas Ethereum mainnet nowadays operates on sync directed via the beacon chain (backwards). It is a huge piece of code everywhere to keep both modes of operation and track all the attack vectors and mitigations for both.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, transaction pooling is constantly evolving, we are introducing blob transactions now which requires a complete overhaul of the tx pooling and there's no reason to re-introduce old mechanisms into the new transaction pools that serve no purpose any more.\r\n\r\nMy only suggestion is that you need to keep up with the Ethereum hard forks on private networks too as our code base is constantly evolving to track the current network behaviour and we don't have the capacity to be indefinitely backwards compatible to all past versions of network that someone uses.",
