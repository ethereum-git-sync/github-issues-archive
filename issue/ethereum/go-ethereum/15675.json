This means that none of the fixes made since Aug 2016 have been reflected in the contracts being deployed by go-ethereum.\r\n\r\nThe `CompiledBin` used to deploy the chequebook was compiled with a version of `solc` that had a bug in the handling of the `ecrecover` call.\r\n\r\nI highly recommend looking at the process for updating contracts included in go-ethereum especially where a pre-compiled blob needs to be updated at the same time as the contract.",
