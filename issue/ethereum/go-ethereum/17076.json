  "body": "#### System information\r\nGeth version: 1.8.8-stable\r\nOS & Version: Windows 10\r\n\r\n#### Setup\r\nI have a private PoA network with one validator node (one node total in this simple network).  I tried using single quotes and double quotes for the parameter and it didnâ€™t matter.  I have a relatively high value for the gasLimit parameter in genesis.json (namely 6721975) and pass in a similarly high value for the `--targetgaslimit` parameter when starting geth.\r\n\r\nFor this example, I have no transactions being broadcast to the network, just mining of nothingness.\r\n\r\nIn another window, I use `geth attach http://<network IP and port>` successfully, and use `eth.getBlock(3).gasLimit` or similar to get block-specific gas limit information (in this case for block 3).  \r\n\r\nLooking at the gasLimit parameter of the block, I see that it's dropping with each block.  If I start with a much smaller gasLimit in the genesis block, the limit rises with each block.   The gas limit stabilizes at 4712388 (not 3141592, as in Issue #2185), a value which is found in [/params/protocol_params.go:28](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/cbfb40b0aab093e1b612f3b16834894b2cc67882/params/protocol_params.go#L28), set as the initial value of TargetGasLimit [six lines earlier](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/cbfb40b0aab093e1b612f3b16834894b2cc67882/params/protocol_params.go#L22).  \r\n\r\nIt looks like the value from the flag is supposed to be incorporated in SetupNetwork, [cmd/utils/flags.go:1181-85]( https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/3fb5f3ae11b1807ff071059276fb679a306339f5/cmd/utils/flags.go#L1184), called at [/cmd/geth/main.go:214](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/ed40767355b5f3964d134ae37d0eaf78d7083bc1/cmd/geth/main.go#L214).  \r\n\r\nIf there is some issue in the command to start geth, and this command-line flag follows that issue, this parameter is ignored.  The user can then see that `eth.getBlock(n).gasLimit` does not approach `--targetgaslimit` as `n` increases, but rather approaches 4712388, and this is confusing behavior. \r\n\r\n#### Expected behaviour\r\nIn geth startup, an INFO log message is generated printing the target gas limit for that node for that mining startup.\r\n\r\n#### Actual behaviour\r\nNo message is generated, so if the parameter used by Geth differs from what appears to have been passed in the geth start command, the user has some confusing debugging ahead.\r\n\r\nThe core enhancement request here is to add a line of logging at geth startup to indicate the value of the target gas limit parameter.",

    "body": "@karalabe As you suspected, I found that the root cause for the issue motivating my original post was an issue in the command, which had been copied and pasted into an e-mail client that has \"smart\" formatting and converted one of the double-hyphen pairs into a longer dash, which when copied and pasted into terminal pastes as nothing.  Omitting those double dashes caused that command-line flag and everything after it (including --targetgaslimit) to be ignored, with no error message, and behavior (in the case of --targetgaslimit, silently) consistent with the defaults.  \r\n\r\nI found that as the core cause of the problem shortly after the first post of this Issue and then edited to focus the request just on logging.  Having a log message output at the start showing the target gas limit in effect (whether using the default or one interpreted from the command-line arguments) would have made debugging a lot easier and faster.

    "body": "To be more specific, the parameter lacking the double hyphen was `ipcdisable`, which immediately followed `--mine`.  This came fairly late in a long command starting with `geth` and a space-separated list of `--paramname value` pairs, so seeing something like `--mine ipcdisable --gasprice \"1000000000\" --targetgaslimit \"6721975\"` seemed to fit that format.  (These are example values for illustration.)\r\n\r\nNo command errors jumped out based on a review of just the formatting, where `ipcdisable` appeared as a mode/value for the `--mine` parameter (it isn't, but that doesn't become clear until more detailed `geth` specific knowledge is more carefully applied), and that portion of the command did not get as much actively focused attention until later in the debugging process.  Startup log messages revealing that the `ipcdisable` parameter was getting ignored did help, once attention got to that issue, but it would have been solved a lot faster with a startup log message disclosing the value being used for `targetgaslimit`.",

    "body": "@adamschmideg Thanks for responding.\r\n\r\nNo, I don't see any evidence that the issue has been addressed.  I don't see that there's a new line of logging at geth startup to indicate the value of the target gas limit parameter.\r\n\r\nThat additional logging is the core of the request above and was [reinforced](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/17076#issuecomment-506805501) over a year later.  I even offered a code contribution attempting to address this specific issue and reinforced there the request for that additional log line.  \r\n\r\nEven if [other commits](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/17248) make it less likely people will encounter issues like what prompted me to find this one, there will still be cases where knowing what target gas limit parameter is in effect will be helpful.  Adding that one log line also seems like such an easy thing to do, probably even easier than the time spent on composing discussion responses like this one. \r\n\r\nI still think this would be a good idea to help someone better understand what is going on in the code and save hours of diagnostic debugging if that doesn't match their expectations. \r\n\r\nI also do not have the privilege of reopening issues in this repo (feel free to change that if you think I should) and think that opening dupes of issues closed with no clear reason would not be a good service to the repo/community.\r\n",
