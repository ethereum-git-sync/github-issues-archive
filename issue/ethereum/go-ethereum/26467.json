I am using `nat extip` configuration (Running on EC2 instance with Elastic IP attached). A similar configuration on Prysm works as expected.\r\n\r\nThe confusing part here is that the Prysm client with a similar configuration quickly finds peers and I'm able to see that part of those are \"inbound\" which means that external peers were able to detect the node and perform the connection. \r\n",
