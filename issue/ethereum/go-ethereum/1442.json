    "body": "Downloading the chain is not the issue, is problem is processing it. 3-9 hours is a very optimistic estimate. (i.e. throw a i7+ 4/8 cores at it, and maybe it will achieve that performance). On a moderately powerful computer it will take way more time. As far as I know, a t2.medium is not enough with the test net spam. Maybe if you get through all the junk to the head it will stay in sync, but it will take quite some time to get there. (e.g. on an older core 2 CPU (as far as I know more powerful than t2.medium) it took at least 1-2 days to sync up).\n\nSo, this isn't really an issue with geth, but rather the amount of junk we accumulated in the test network. Running full nodes will always be quite computational heavy, but hopefully after Frontier we can release eth/63 and enable light clients to join the network and not require so many resources. Until then however, please have patience :), and maybe throw a buigger instance at it while it finishes up syncing and then reduce it to see how much is just enough to keep in sync :)\n",
