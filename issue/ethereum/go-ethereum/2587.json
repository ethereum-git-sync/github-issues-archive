  "body": "_UPDATE: there is another roll-up issue #2569 that focusses in on the error / bugs seen in the fast syncing (`--fast` flag on initial synchronisation). To clarify, the issues I am seeing are present regardless of how the syncing was initiated_\n#### System information\n\n```\n$ geth version\nGeth\nVersion: 1.4.3-stable\nProtocol Versions: [63 62 61]\nNetwork Id: 1\nGo Version: go1.6.1\nOS: linux\nGOPATH=\nGOROOT=/usr/lib/go-1.6\n```\n#### Expected behaviour\n\nConsistent block synchronisation regardless of quality of network connection. Robust recovery from loss of connection. Suitable messaging to user for sync failure.\n#### Actual behaviour\n\nI live in rural New Zealand and work over ADSL (barely) \"broadband\" that is highly contended that leads to dropped connections, slow connections and high latency. The latter seems to cause considerable issues with Geth finding and retaining peers. So if I loop `net.peerCount` I can get across 10 second requests to the func: [0, 3, 10, 1, 1 , 1, 8, 8, 3, 3, 0, 0, 1...] and so on. After a period of low to zero peers the client no longer continues to sync (no log entry beyond the `Synchronisation failed:` message). Restart client and synccing re-starts... rinse and repeat\n\nOccurs on both Windows 10 and Ubuntu 16.04 geth clients. The latter is also mobile (laptop). Same results, worse in busy areas (again a contention ratio issue).\n\nIf I run the same on Digital Ocean droplet, steady peer count, and no stalls and full (not `--fast`) sync in a couple of hours.\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\n\nRun node on poor network connection - need either 3G mobile in busy area, or a high contention-ratio ADSL.\n\nI'd like to add to this - for information. Geth seems very sensitive to unreliable networks or high contention networks. I get stalling / hanging when at home or on 3G / 4G mobile.\n\nThis is an issue as it tends to mean that only low-latency, low-contention ratio connections work and this will undermine the goal of meshing and potential usage in non-developed locations.\n",

Did not start/stop/resume.**\n\nDid some syncing using the [Network Link Conditioner](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/?name=Hardware%20IO%20Tools%20for%20Xcode%207) running at various different settings. Starting at just **Very bad internet** which basically means that there’s a 500ms delay, limited 1mbps and 10% packet loss. Using this setting the node wouldn’t sync. Switching to **High Latency DNS** obviously didn’t pose much problem. Switching to **Very Bad Internet** again almost instantly dropped all peers and didn’t resume (it also threw in a _Rolled back 2048 headers_). Switched to **3G** mode now (780kbps / 330kbps) the download eventually resumed but it is literally crawling forth, exactly what you’d expect of a 3G network.\n\nConsidering you're living in NZ with [very little nodes](https://www.dropbox.com/s/oe5qgz4uidzlvhr/Screenshot%202016-05-23%2010.30.27.png?dl=0) near you this would be somewhat expected.\n\nWhat would help us if you'd run the node as `geth --vmodule=p2p=6,downloader=6` and let it run for a while, paste the contents in a [gist](https://gist.github.com) we can take a better look at your issue.\n",

I know this (trust me); that's not the point. The point is the fragility for connections like this. If it takes days to sync, that's okay - that's what my `bitcoind` node took: _days_. But once synced it is robust and doesn't require me to start all over again as I seem to have to now with the `geth`. I'd hope that once synced the maintenance to keep the node up-to-date is minimal and even a connection like mine can keep up and remain synced.\n</sensitive>\n\nThanks for looking into this.\n",
