I found that altho the linux geth can list the key, it cannot decrypt using the password that was used on the windows machine. \r\n\r\nI then genned a new keystore file on the Linux system and copied it on to the Windows system, and found that windows can access and decrypt both the windows and linux genned keystore files correctly.\r\n\r\nIs there a problem with passing a window's genned keystore file to linux?  Where as passing a linux genned keystore file to Windows, works fine.",

Is the problem easily reproducible on your systems ? Can you try to reproduce it also with different passwords ?\r\n\r\nAre you sure the keystore file is not already much, much older? What's the date in the file name (UTC--...), is it just a few weeks/months back or much older?\r\n\r\nYou didn't really answer the question about sharing the (original) keystore file, do you think that is possible/acceptable ? As said, you can problably also contact @holiman privately and make sure that the account with that specific address has no funds left (was emptied). It's important that the file is the original file, not the \"updated\" one (that works anyways on all systems).\r\n\r\nDid you try to run the \"update\" also on the linux machine (with the original keystore file) ? Did that always fail?",

    "body": "I'm interested what the devs think about your finding that the \"update\" on windows fixed the problem. Maybe they know how exactly the update could have \"fixed\" the keystore file (as far as I understood the update mechanism only worked on windows, right?).\r\n\r\nIn general I would say that a problem in most cases is (or at least should be) somehow reproducibe (with same setup and inputs etc). If it's not reproducible there might be further details that are missing etc and it needs to be tested/redone in a different manner.\r\n\r\nAre you sure that the keystore file is of the new format and contains these:\r\n```\r\n\"cipher\":\"aes-128-ctr\"\r\n\"kdf\":\"scrypt\"\r\n```\r\nI'm not sure what else changed between the different keystore formats, maybe @holiman etc has an idea what exactly the update could have fixed (besides converting between the old and newer formats, if as you said the format/version should be the newest one).\r\n\r\nI think that without having the keystore file and without being able to reproduce the problem (neither the devs, nor me, nor you) we can't really do much here.\r\nYou could in theory debug the \"update\" mechanism and see where exactly the linux version fails and where and why the windows version continues with the \"update\" without error message, but this of course needs some debugging skill and testing on both platforms etc (and most importantly we would need the original - not modified - keystore file which didn't work on linux).",
