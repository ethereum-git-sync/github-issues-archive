  "body": "Based on where the discussion of fixed point numbers are going (I'm going to try to take some time to get them finished up), it would appear they are most likely to go in a decimal format. Considering that this is not a part of the standard library, I've done some research on what should be considered for areas such as abigen for accuracy of interaction with them when they are set up. It might be early, but I figure this ought to be documented. Anyways, I figured I'd suggest this open source implementation be brought into the vendor. Let me know if anyone disagrees with this. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/shopspring/decimal",
