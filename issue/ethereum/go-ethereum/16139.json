  "body": "Hi there,\r\n\r\nI would like to add `go-ethereum` as a dependency of my Golang webservice Dockerfile.\r\n\r\nTo do that, I've the following Dockerfile : \r\n\r\n```\r\nFROM golang:latest AS builder\r\n\r\n(...)\r\nRUN go get github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum\r\n\r\n# Add my own source code\r\n(...)\r\nRUN go build -o main <MY_PROJECT_PATH>\r\n\r\nFROM alpine:3.7\r\nRUN apk update && apk add ca-certificates && rm -rf /var/cache/apk/*\r\n\r\nCOPY --from=builder <MY_PROJECT_PATH>/main .\r\n\r\nENTRYPOINT [\"./main\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, when I start my container, I've this error : `<MY_SERVICE> exited with code 127`. Meaning my compiled program is trying to call an unknown command.\r\n\r\nNote that before the addition of go-ethereum, my congif was working.\r\n\r\nI tried to compile geth and copy the binaries like in your [Dockerfile](https://hub.docker.com/r/ethereum/client-go/~/dockerfile/) but it doesn't change the result.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaybe I forgot a step, but I don't see which one. Can you explain me how to include `go-ethereum` in my project ?",
