  "body": "Recently timeouts were added to the HTTP RPC server in #16859 and some arbitrary timeouts were chosen with a call for feedback.\r\n\r\nFor local hosts the timeouts are mostly fine, but if you run a node on a server [ReadTimeout](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/rpc/http.go#L170) is much too low, as it's reliant on the client speed rather than the server. This is specifically an issue when trying to send large batched requests to get block or transaction information, which causes unnecessary timeout errors on slower connections.\r\n\r\nI would recommend setting ReadTimeout to at least 15-30 seconds, and possibly also increasing WriteTimeout to 30-60 seconds to accommodate the large responses specifically from log requests which can often be in the megabytes. IdleTimeout is fine.",
