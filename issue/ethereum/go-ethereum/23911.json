    "body": "Sorry, but this is really not a ticket demonstrating a bug in geth. For one, it's a configuration problem with setting up an nginx reverse proxy. \r\nSecondly, saying \"it's not working\" doesn't really help. Instead of saying \"it's not working\", you need to dive in a bit into _how_ it is not working. \r\n\r\nAre the requests not forwarded to geth? Or are they not served? Or are they served but with errors?\r\nIn order to figure this out, some ideas come to mind, \r\n\r\n- Check the nginx logs\r\n- Check the geth logs\r\n- Do a packet capture on the geth-host / port (`8545`) to see if the requests are coming in, \r\n- Open a 'random' web-server on `8545` and see if the forwarding works, \r\n\r\nIf you are able to narrow down the problem, and indeed it appears to be something which is broken/changed in geth, feel free to reopen this ticket.
