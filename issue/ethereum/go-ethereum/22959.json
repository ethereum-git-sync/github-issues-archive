  "body": "I’d like to apologise for my behaviour. \r\n\r\nIt’s true that I’m not owed anything. The team is busy and I certainly appreciate the work they do. I said many unkind and exaggerated things in anger. Although I may have had reason to be frustrated at the lack of support, I was also quick to rush to judgement. There were many ways to ask for help I needed, or I could have simply accepted the team was busy, or expressed my frustration politely.\r\n\r\nI’d just like to respond to peter’s latest comment in https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/22945, not stir up any more drama. I really dislike drama. \r\n\r\nI certainly didn’t think my code was up to standard, neither for a review nor a benchmark, and expressed the need for some help for running more benchmarks/testing to diagnose any remaining issues. \r\n\r\nI appreciate that running from a synced node turned up the OMM issue which I have diagnosed. I had run all of the tests locally and did not think to run a synced node as a testing procedure, as this is not really described anywhere - so I think it’s unfair to say I didn’t bother. I would have certainly done so if I had been told that’s the standard procedure and was what I needed to do as the next step. \r\n\r\nThat being said, there are many things I could have improved about the way I communicated in prior correspondence. I’ll certainly try in the future to be more deliberate about communicating clearly and respecting others’ bandwidth and time. I should be cognizant of this as a form of professional competence. \r\n\r\nAll in all, I’d like to apologise for stirring up unkind feelings for no good reason. That being said, I would have felt less ignored if the team had at least said some encouraging words or responded with a “will check out later, here’s what you could do in the meantime”. I understand that the team didn’t see it as a productive direction, but I think I had shown at least something non trivial worth following up upon. Up till that point I didn’t expect or think I deserved any response. It’s just that I had felt I had been given the cold shoulder for weeks, and the frustration had been building up. But I guess I could have expressed my frustration more politely or just bumped the issue, knowing that it’s par for the course.\r\n\r\nUp till that point, I had not established any amicable working relationship with the team, or any reason for the team to trust me or take any work I did seriously. I ought to humble myself and think kindly of others in such situations where it’s easy to misunderstand and to think the worst. I ought to have more faith that if you give a good effort and act professionally and pertinently, others will respond in kind. If not, it's beyond your control and there's no gain in making worse a bad situation.\r\n\r\nI’m sorry that my rashness has caused unhappiness. I’ll strive to improve moving forward. I wish the geth team best of luck and I hope they will meet their upcoming challenges with London hard fork and Eth2 with success.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nJon\r\n",
