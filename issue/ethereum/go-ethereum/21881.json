    "body": "As some guideposts for others trying to debug this:\r\nThe dumpgenesis command was added in [PR #20191](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/20191), and it looks like  a [merge commit](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/commit/711ed74e091f2ada6e2aa84e5e62b9696b589d8a) was included starting in v1.9.11.\r\n\r\nThat PR had a post-merge [comment](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/20191#issuecomment-595134049) \"Question: shouldn't this function also dump a custom genesis?\" which never got a response.  Maybe the correct response is \"it should but it currently doesn't.\" \r\n\r\nThough I haven't tested it in any detail, I suspect [this line](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/3ef52775c4756b7cbdc28b807eb4600127a9a873/cmd/geth/chaincmd.go#L262) (`genesis := utils.MakeGenesis(ctx)`) is returning nil, causing the next few lines to return `core.DefaultGenesisBlock()`.  Having a look at the [function](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/23524f8900bceb0c921b61cbf6f51f38325e2971/cmd/utils/flags.go#L1795) I think is being called, I see a switch statement which looks like it might only return non-nil if the network is one of the predefined test networks.\r\n\r\nThe code does not make me think this would be likely to work as OP expects, though the documentation does. \r\n\r\nThanks for reporting!",

    "body": "[This comment](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/21881#issuecomment-731500286) was intended for other geth developers, based on a comment in the code stating the opposite. \r\n \r\n>when in Private Network, selected chainId=1, or/and networkid=1,\r\n\r\nIn general, you should not be using a custom/private genesis/network with chainId/networkId = 1. That id is for mainnet, and it's reasonable to expect the mainnet genesis coming back from that.  \r\nHowever, from the OP and comments above this Issue is understood to be limited to where the genesis block has a chainId not belonging to mainnet or a known public testnet, and you're running geth with the command line flag for this other networkId/chainId.  When that is true, as it seems to be for you, I agree that you should get the private-net genesis back per documentation and reasonable expectations but that by looking at current code I don't think you would.",
