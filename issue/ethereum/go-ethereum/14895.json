The syncing would always be fine and I would be able to catch up after being offline for a few days within 20-30 minutes. However, my SSD no longer has room. So I set up a symlink from the ~/.ethereum/chaindata folder to /blockchain/ethereum/chaindata, which is a separate HDD mounted at /blockchain. I copied the chaindata folder to that location, and geth/Mist recognize the blocks there. However, now when I sync, it syncs VERY slowly. Due to security reasons, I do not want to move the whole datadir to the HDD. \r\n\r\nI have also tried running the geth client with --cache=1024, 2048, 4096. None of these options help. I recognize that ethereum can be intense with its read/writes, however I don't see why it should be this slow to sync blocks. I am connected to plenty of peers so I am unsure why this is happening.\r\n\r\nI have done the same process with Bitcoin and it works completely fine. I do NOT want to use a different mode of syncing, as I would like to host the whole history of the chain, I don't believe that should have to be a workaround.\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\r\nSetup a symlink from the ~/.ethereum/chaindata folder to a separate HDD.\r\n\r\n#### Backtrace\r\n\r\n````\r\n[backtrace]\r\n````\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9204264/28950879-5589e3dc-7895-11e7-9d47-bf725cb85909.png)\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Very similar scenario for me except that I did the symlinking to an HDD long before having serious issues.  What really did me in was I went on vacation the first full week of August and my laptop sat in it's bag... when I returned I was expecting a lot of syncing being needed but it NEVER catches up...  This weekend was a long weekend for me so I figured it would be the solution because I was able to start the sync on Friday afternoon and let it run clear until this morning.... last night I was still extremely far behind and blocks are being generated faster than my node is syncing them.  What is really perplexing to me is that geth is only using around 10% CPU on average but my HDD is pegged.....    I did some experimenting with cache sizes last night and I've found that if I use a higher cache size like 2048 the process never wants to quit even if I tell it to shutdown.....\r\n\r\nI'm using the ethereum wallet package for 64bit linux (installed from deb) with the latest version and I'm using the geth that is packaged with it which is 1.6.6-stable-10a45cb5 and the system is running Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS with an i7-4760HQ CPU and 8GB of RAM.\r\n\r\nAgain, I moved everything over to my HDD and added the symlink probably a month before I went on vacation and I didn't have any issues if I left ethereum closed for a few days and opened it up -- it always seemed to catch up within an hour or so but after I returned from vacation on August 13th it's been a nightmare....  This weekend it was running for more than 3 days straight without interruption and it came nowhere close to catching up.\r\n\r\nThis HDD access thing is of the biggest concern.... why is it pegging my HDD while not really using much CPU and even less bandwidth....  And a valid solution isn't going to be move it to an SSD because it was working on the HDD acceptably before and after seeing how much drive activity is going on I wouldn't want that much wear on a SSD.",

Then you could operate the latest blocks on a small portion of your SSD and relegate the majority of the chain to a large HDD.\r\n\r\nBlockchain size is up to 420GB.

    "body": "As of earlier this week, we merged https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/15857. This should considerably improve the syncing experience. Some notes: \r\n\r\n* It fixes some bugs in the p2p/networking, which previously caused peer churn and caused sync to stop. \r\n* It does in-memory pruning of state, and considerably lessens the state-growth after fast-sync has completed. \r\n\r\nWe're hoping that this will resolve _most_ issues with sync, but users with HDD instead of SSD may still experience problems. I'll close this ticket, since it's becoming rather old -- originally reported on `Geth/v1.6.7-stable-ab5646c5/linux-amd64/go1.8.1`. For sync problems with latest master(not yet released), please open a new ticket. ",
