  "body": "I have been trying to get geth (1.8.1) to sync in full archive mode with the following flags:\r\n--gcmode=archive --syncmode=full\r\n\r\nGeth version: v1.8.1\r\nOS & Version: Linux \r\n\r\nI tried it on several different server configurations, the last try was on a machine with 96gig of RAM and 2TB SSD. It seems to get kind of stuck after a week... At least the progress slows down that I do not expect it to finish within the next months.  A plain fast sync is no problem and finishes within less than a day. But I need the archive data.\r\n\r\nAny hints on how to get a geth node fully synced in archive mode?\r\n\r\nFor my application I do not need all historical states, lets say the last 1 million blocks would be enough.\r\nAny hints on how to force geth to do a fast sync to e.g. block 4m and then continue in archive mode?\r\n",

There geth client outputs a status update every 8 seconds (from looking at the source on github) and there are spans where I only confirm 1 block, and others were I confirm 5-8 in those seconds. Not sure if the slow patches are because of the increased interest in Eth from Nov '17 to Jan '18, or cryptokitties, or if it's just what peers have available for me to confirm but yeah, blocks i'm adding per hour is pretty variable and never very large.\r\n\r\nI'm using an overpowered VM on GCP, SSD and a lot of idle cores with a `--cache=8192`. Geth never pushes my load average over ~1.8 no matter the settings, so honestly more than a dual core machine doesn't even seem to matter.\r\n\r\nI don't suppose there's anything that can be done to speed up an archival sync? I've restarted the client before to see if I can get better peers or something but that doesn't seem to do much. Would opening an external port like 30303 help?",
