And we're thinking about removing the key management from geth completely and move it to the client (e.g. mist).\n\nIn fact, I was looking into this because I wanted to make it more secure. So I was pretty surprised that you have to run your geth in unlocked mode for the wallet to work. I think this is pretty insecure. So what exactly are the plans for making this more secure? How would mist help here?\n\nI am asking because I am working on a project making web apps more secure, where they can have secrets only trusted codebase can have access to. I wanted to look into how we could apply this to Ethereum wallets, as an example, but I see that there is no good story here at all, which we could then improve upon.\n",
