It would be useful in several scenarios, especially development on a private chain, to have the miner run only when transactions are pending. When the transaction pool is empty, the miner should automatically turn off and wait for more transactions.\n\nSuggest to enable this functionality by default for `--devmode` flag in addition to exposing it as a discrete CLI flag.\n",
