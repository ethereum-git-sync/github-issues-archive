    "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nlegacy and non-legacy transactions store the chain ID for replay protection in a different way.\r\n\r\nFor legacy transactions, the chain ID is encoded into the tx V value. This scheme, which is defined by EIP-155, was implemented because the protocol authors did not want to change the structure of transactions at the time. It is possible to derive the chain ID from any transaction from V.\r\n\r\nFor non-legacy transactions, [the chain ID is simply part of the transaction data](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/d6f49bf764c48e9415b168e701b6dc26566a675c/core/types/access_list_tx.go#L47). This makes it unnecessary to add it into V.\r\n\r\nI hope this answers your question.",
