  "body": "This is probably an [enhancement] but I don't have enough rights to label it as such . \n\nRegistrar, and in fact, any 'utility' contract shouldn't be hardcoded as part of the console API - please give the users an option to .setRegistrarContractAddress or similar. This is of course to avoid - through network effects - having just the one 'registrar' contract on the Ethereum network, which itself should stay featureless.\n\nInterfaces like the coin API are a great idea - maybe we could do something similar here?\n",
