I've spun a new v1.9.2 node and I notice after sync the VM runs on roughly 60-80% CPU (Azure D4s v3 - 4vCPU, 16GiB mem) \r\n\r\nPrevious version (1.8.x) sat on 40-60%, is anyone else getting this or is it by design? \r\n\r\nThanks.",

We often see peers that are way behind on syncing, and aren't making any forward progress on syncing the blockchain. We have a script set up that will drop any peers that are more than a certain number of blocks behind *and* don't have their TD increase over a 5 minute period.\r\n\r\nWhen we implemented this peer management script, we saw a significant decrease in the CPU utilization. It seems that these peers that are way behind and not making forward process are causing an uptick in CPU usage.",
