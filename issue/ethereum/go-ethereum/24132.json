  "body": "We should look into implementing [EIP 4361](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-4361.md) in Clef:\r\n\r\n> Sign-In with Ethereum describes how Ethereum accounts authenticate with off-chain services by signing a standard message format parameterized by scope, session details, and security mechanisms (e.g., a nonce).\r\n>\r\n> The goals of this specification are to provide a self-custodied alternative to centralized identity providers, improve interoperability across off-chain services for Ethereum-based authentication, and provide wallet vendors a consistent machine-readable message format to achieve improved user experiences and consent management.\r\n\r\nThis should already work out of the box (since it's just signing a text message), however: \r\n\r\n\r\n-   The full message MUST be checked for conformance to the ABNF above.\r\n-   Wallet implementers SHOULD warn users if the substring \"wants you to sign in with your Ethereum account\" appears anywhere in an EIP-191 message signing request unless the message fully conforms to the format defined in EIP-4361.\r\n-   Wallet implementers MUST prevent phishing attacks by matching on the domain term when processing a signing request. For example, when processing the message beginning with \"service.org wants you to sign in...\", the wallet checks that the request actually originated from service.org.\r\n-   The domain SHOULD be read from a trusted data source such as the browser window or over WalletConnect (EIP-1328) sessions for comparison against the signing message contents.\r\n- Wallet implementers MAY construct a custom Sign-In With Ethereum user interface by parsing the ABNF terms into data elements for use in the interface. The display rules above still apply to custom interfaces.\r\n\r\nReference implementation + testcases here: https://github.com/spruceid/siwe \r\n\r\n",
