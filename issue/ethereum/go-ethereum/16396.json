  "body": "for obvious reasons, it's very important that users do verify and can trust the geth releases.\r\n\r\na couple of issues with the current situation:\r\n\r\n* git tags are not PGP signed in the go-ethereum git repo\r\n* PGP keys of the devs have few or no signatures. you should at the very least sign each other's keys.\r\n* i suggest that not only tags, but all commits should be signed.\r\n* the [release page](https://ethereum.github.io/go-ethereum/downloads/) lists keys with only the last 8 digit of their fingerprint -- don't ever do that! there's an ongoing attack on the PGP web of trust where someone is brute-force searching for shadow keys that have the same last 8 digits in their fingerprint, and then replicates the entire web of trust, cross-key signatures included. he owns the private keys, and looking only at the last 8 digits of the fingerprint it looks the same as the genuine keys and web of trust. you can read [more here](https://threatpost.com/of-gpg-collisions-and-ux-security/109713/)\r\n* Viktor's key listed on the release site has expired\r\n\r\ni wrote a short summary on [how to generate and handle long-lasting keys](https://github.com/attila-lendvai/gpg-keygen). it's not been updated for a while, but it will be soonish if all goes as planned.",
