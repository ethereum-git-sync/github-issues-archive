  "body": "G'day everyone,\r\n\r\nGiven a contract address, it would be great if geth exposed an API that gave you the transaction hash for the contract deployment.\r\n\r\nWe’re trying to build a generic ethereum blockchain explorer that’s able to decode transactions for known contracts.  The only way to know which ABI to use for a given contract address is to ask the user (annoying) or scan through the entire chain until you find the associated contract deployment and look it up based on the code that was deployed.  We were hoping to make this blockchain explorer a simple single-page app that you can just point at any geth URL which makes scanning through the entire chain impractical.\r\n\r\nSomething like this:\r\n```\r\n> eth.getTransactionFromContract('0x9999999999999999999999999999999999999999')\r\n\r\n{\r\n  blockHash: \"0xaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\",\r\n  blockNumber: 12345,\r\n  from: \"0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff\",\r\n  gas: 4700000,\r\n  gasPrice: 0,\r\n  hash: \"0x1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111\",\r\n  input: \"0x123...\",   //<-- Contract code\r\n  nonce: 0,\r\n  r: \"0xbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb\",\r\n  s: \"0xcccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc\",\r\n  to: null,\r\n  transactionIndex: 0,\r\n  v: \"0x11\",\r\n  value: 0\r\n}\r\n```",
