  "body": "Sorry, I realize this is something of a mess but this issue should be logged somewhere. I will look into this cleaning up. I copied and pasted directly from the go-ethereum channel but Gitter may have some export functionality I am unaware of.\n\nWhen trying to mine I am encountering the error\" I0510 00:37:05.925616 18500 backend.go:371] Cannot start mining without etherbase address: no accounts found\n\" However I have imported the ethwallet.json file generated from the pyethsaletool. I also see something about using a coinbase wallet. How does a coinbase wallet relate to the one generated by the pyethsaletool?\nDoesn't a coinbase wallet hold bitcoin?\nobscuren an hour ago  \nif you’ve successfully imported your ethwallet.json file that should be fine. If you type eth.accounts in the console (run with geth console) what does it show you?\nvinc456 an hour ago  \n['0x29558c79b32865d1d21b5ebc942d995dd20e3ccd', '0x51185a57571f17e8c517255efeb76979aa7f85db', '0xdbdbd435cb5227e868ef4405559b1693b85b80c9' ]\nobscuren an hour ago  \nand when you type admin.miner.start() it says can’t mine without account?\nvinc456 an hour ago  \ntrue\nobscuren an hour ago  \neven after restarting the client?\nvinc456 an hour ago  \nThat is the output of admin.miner.start()\nI've been using geth, not geth console. I'm not sure what you mean by restarting the client.\nobscuren an hour ago  \ni meant just stop / start geth\nvinc456 an hour ago  \nI just opened a new instance of geth console , typed admin.miner.start() and the console prints \"true\"\nobscuren an hour ago  \noh\nthat’s good\nvinc456 an hour ago  \nI might have been a tad impatient, it looks like it's generating a DAG for epoch 0 now.\nI'll let it run for a while and hopefully it'll be able to mine ether. I am still thoroughly confused about the pyethsaletool wallet vs a coinbase one. Are they equivalent? The pyethsaletool generated some kind of intermediate bitcoin wallet and had the following warning:\n\"Note that the Ether sale is over, so any purchases made using this method are essentially donations to EthSuisse. This code is only kept online for the benefit of other projects and for individuals wishing to learn how the encryption on their wallet works\"\nDoes that mean that I should create a coinbase one and use that instead? That way I can keep mined ether instead of donating it.\nvinc456 an hour ago  \nI could take the bitcoin wallet address from coinbase and replace the \"btcaddr\" pyethsaletool generated ethwallet.json. But that could also break things. Anyways will fiddle around once the DAG is generated/complete.\nobscuren an hour ago  \nSo you don’t have to use your sale wallet\nin fact i would recommend not to\nif you need an account do one of the following:\ngeth account new\nstart geth console and type admin.newAccount()\nThe pre sale wallet can be used once frontier is released\nvinc456 37 minutes ago  \nI created a new account but still have the following errors when attempting to mine: I0510 00:56:58.276759 18876 backend.go:371] Cannot start mining without etherbase address: no accounts found\nFatal: Cannot start mining without etherbase address: no accounts found\nDoes this look like a problem with the account, the wallet, or something else altogether?\nobscuren 36 minutes ago  \nyou’re not by any chance starting thi client with —datadir /a/b/c/path ?\nvinc456 36 minutes ago  \nNope, no options are being passed.\nobscuren 36 minutes ago  \nwhat does geth account list output?\nvinc456 35 minutes ago  \nWelcome to the\nFRONTIER\nPrimary #0: {29558c79b32865d1d21b5ebc942d995dd20e3ccd}\nAccount #1: {307788eb6c6c02c1c9c404ce7ffbd66ae72aeb78}\nAccount #2: {51185a57571f17e8c517255efeb76979aa7f85db}\nAccount #3: {dbdbd435cb5227e868ef4405559b1693b85b80c9}\nobscuren 35 minutes ago  \ncurious\nvinc456 34 minutes ago  \nubuntu@eth-test-1:~/geth$ geth account new # seemed to create a new primary\nWelcome to the\nFRONTIER\nYour new account is locked with a password.

I'm not a bitcoin miner so I don't have a good grasp of how wallets are used. I didn't realize that creating an account also created a wallet. Yes that is correct.\nNot meant to be used after the ethersale.\nhad ended.\nHave a good night.\n",
