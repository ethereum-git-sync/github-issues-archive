This restriction was documented before the launch of the network and almost immediately after the getTransactionReceipt was described for the first time. Afaik there is nothing wrong here.\r\n\r\nI believe the light client has no concept of pending state. If we add support for pending receipt `eth_getTransactionReceipt` would behave different for a full and light client which is confusing.\r\n\r\n@zsfelfoldi, @fjl, can you elaborate a bit on this?\r\n\r\n\r\n",
