  "body": "Hello,\n\non Arch Linux (x86_64) with Go 1.4.2 geth crashes very frequently when I do a fresh sync to a data dir on my SSD. \n\nI cloned the repo and ran \"make all\" on the latest commit on the develop branch yesterday. It started to initialize a data dir in my home directory and block chain synchronization started. After about 30 minutes geth crashed. Thinking that the latest development snapshot might be unstable I  git checkout the v0.9.36 tag. Ran make clean and make all and restarted geth. It started syncing but it crashed again after a while. I restarted numerous times, but never managed to sync for very long. Sometimes it just crashed after it imported the first 256 blocks. I also have the feeling that the crashes are more frequent from block 300K on. No I'm at ~600K and can't run geth for more than a minute.\n\nHere is the crashlog:\nhttps://gist.github.com/blackout24/26c7ee561047f8e070b7\n\nThis is the crashlog after that it only managed to run for 9 minutes:\nhttps://gist.github.com/blackout24/6492e3d186c823b4449f\n",

    "body": "Hi,\n\nthis is interesting I have always wondered why some of my swap space filed up, even though I never noticed that I had dramatically increased RAM usage while running geth.\nMy PC has 8 GB of RAM and 2GB of ZRAM SWAP. When I start geth and let it sync the RAM usage is  under 2 GB and doesn't really grow, but I noticed that there are 500 MB in swap probably from this out of memory condition. With the stuff I usually do (even compiling big projects) with my PC swap basically is never used. I have vm.swappiness = 60 which is the default.\n\nI use the stock Arch kernel config:\nhttps://projects.archlinux.org/svntogit/packages.git/tree/trunk/config.x86_64?h=packages/linux\nMy current version is  4.0.7. \nI'm using go installed via the package manager. It is build and packaged like this:\nhttps://projects.archlinux.org/svntogit/community.git/tree/trunk/PKGBUILD?h=packages/go\n I'll try a manual installation. \n",

    "body": "Since Arch builds the go package from source according to the PKGBUILD I downloaded the tarball distribution. Before that I removed the go package. I extracted the tarball in my Download directory and exported the new PATH and GOROOT variables in my current terminal session. I cleaned my existing go-ethereum build and ran \"make geth\". I'm now using the v0.9.38 tag.\n\nIt still crashed. \nhttps://gist.github.com/blackout24/10f991748ee5186248f1 \nI also monitored my RAM usage with the Gnome System Monitor while it crashed, but I didn't even see a spike in RAM usage when it crashed. Maybe it happens so fast that the system monitor interval (1 s) doesn't pick it up.\n\nI enabled the race detector and the log seems to be the same as the old one:\nhttps://gist.github.com/blackout24/53a0ca82f825ce5d7da7\n\nEDIT: With Gnome System Monitor at 250ms RAM usage clearly slowly but steadily climbs and climbs until everything is full. Maybe there's a memory leak somewhere? I'm wondering why this didn't happen when I sync to my HDD 3-4 days ago. Maybe because everything was just slower?\n",

    "body": "I did use the official prebuilt tarball distribution when it crashed in the reports above. \nI'm monitoring the resource usage now after boot up. I use 800 MB on an empty desktop. When I run geth it slowly climbs to 1.6 GB used and now seems pretty stable at that number. However my system is constantly swapping small amounts. It's now up to 300 MB already after maybe an hour.  \n\nI think this might be related to the IO and and the VFS in Linux that might be doing some caching. This would explain, why I did not have problems syncing to my HDD which is probably just too slow to require that. This would also explain why crashes became ever more frequent, because swap never was empty after geth crashed so with the next try it filled up faster.\n\nI even lowed vm.swappiness to 10 so it should only swap to avoid an out of memory condition, but it' still swapping.\n",
