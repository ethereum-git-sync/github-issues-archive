  "body": "During the whole block fetching mechanism, in certain cases, the `ReceivedAt` field of a block is tracked incorrectly due to reasons explained below. \r\n\r\nOn new block announcement, the header is requested [here](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/eth/fetcher/block_fetcher.go#L474), which ultimately uses request one header as mentioned [here](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/eth/protocols/eth/peer.go#L339). When the dispatcher flow completes and response is received, we track the time in the response as mentioned [here](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/eth/protocols/eth/dispatcher.go#L242). On receiving the response [here](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/eth/fetcher/block_fetcher.go#L486) back in the channel, the time used to pass in the `FilterHeaders` function is `time.Now().Add(res.Time)` where `res.Time` is what we set before in the dispatcher. According to this logic, I believe it sets a future time by adding the delay of p2p request to current time. The logic here should just use `time.Now()` or `time.Now().Sub(res.Time)` instead. When we process the headers and create block objects, we set the same time as set above in the block's `ReceivedAt` field as mentioned [here](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/eth/fetcher/block_fetcher.go#L606), thus incorrectly tracking the time and updating metrics using that incorrect time. \r\n\r\nThe `FilterBodies` function on the other hand uses a correct time i.e. `time.Now()`. Hence, to be specific, wrong field is *only* set when the body is empty as we don't try to fetch bodies in that case. \r\n\r\nThe fix for should be pretty simple: use `time.Now()` or `time.Now().Sub(res.Time)` instead over [here](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/eth/fetcher/block_fetcher.go#L486) as the last parameter. \r\n\r\nTL;DR: The time used to set the received at field in block is wrongly set as the initial function uses wrong time value. \r\n\r\nIf this turns out to be an issue, I can raise a quick PR fixing this. Thank you!\r\n\r\nEDIT: the tag was auto chosen to \"docs\". I'd put it under \"bug\" but have created a generic issue as we it's not yet finalised if this is an issue yet. ",
