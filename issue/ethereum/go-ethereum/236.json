Should this include superseeded forks?\n  Im asking cos these numbers are pretty meaningless, apart from maybe their rate of change is informative of processing burden and/or network health.\n- flag for downloading: the problem is, in the model i have there is no such thing as downloading as something different from keeping in sync which is normal operation. I could indicate if there are no active fetching processes, this may be useful to indicate network issues but if online with 12 sec blocktime idleness aint gonna happen.\n\nApart from this info, the blockpool could provide a lot more (useful?) data, see below a few ideas. This leads me back to @fjl 's idea that each protocol has its own peer pool/peer selector. The blockpool could also keep (or give info to) a permanent record of peer usefulness (activity rate, best peer rate, etc) which in the future could feed into a reputation scheme driving peer selection (beyond kademlia principles). \n\nAPI:\nblah:\n\n``` go\nfunc (self *BlockPool) NumberOfBlockHashes() int\nfunc (self *BlockPool) NumberOfBlockHashes() int\nfunc (self *BlockPool) Syncing() bool\n```\n\nor better:\n\n``` go\ntype Status struct {\nBlockHashes int // number of hashes fetched this session \nBlocks int // number of blocks fetched this session\nNewBlocks int // number of new blocks (received with new blocks msg) \nInsertedBlocks int // number of blocks inserted/connected to the blockchain \nValidBlocks int // number of blocks inserted and actually valid\nLongestChain int // the longest chain inserted since the start of session (aka session blockchain height)\n\nPeers int // cumulative number (or full list) of all different registered peers since the start of this session\nActivePeers int // cumulative number (or full list) of all different peers that contributed a hash or block since the start of this session\nLivePeers int // live peers registered with the block pool (supposed to be redundant but good sanity check \nBestPeer []byte //Pubkey\nBestPeers [][]byte // the cumulative list of all peers that at some point were promoted as best peer (peer with highest TD status) this session\nBadPeers [][]byte // number or list of all peers that violated the protocol (invalid block or pow, unrequested hash or block) \n// etc etc\n}\n\n// and the API is the extendibe:\nfunc (self *BlockPool) Status() *Status \n```\n",
