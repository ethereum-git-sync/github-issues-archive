  "body": "## Feature request\r\n\r\nWhen used in private chains, there's a need to demonstrate ether in lower-latency settings. The main requirement for the ~17second mining time seem to be connected to the fact that \"12.6 seconds is the time it takes for a new block to propagate to 95% of nodes\" [[1](https://medium.facilelogin.com/the-mystery-behind-block-time-63351e35603a), [2](http://www.tik.ee.ethz.ch/file/49318d3f56c1d525aabf7fda78b23fc0/P2P2013_041.pdf)].\r\n\r\nIn a small e.g. 10 node network, with small latency (e.g. lower than 100ms) there's no reason to not mine more frequently. There's a proposed solution [here](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/a/10634) about freezing the difficulty to the one in Genesis Block. This would likely translate to nop'ing the `calcDifficultyHomestead()` method [here](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/d429a92f09e476c431830cef48690dc3784153c7/consensus/ethash/consensus.go#L382). Another alternative might be to change parameters [here](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/762f3a48a00da02fe58063cb6ce8dc2d08821f15/params/protocol_params.go#L82) and especially `DifficultyBoundDivisor`.\r\n\r\nI would like, if possible, some discussion on the subject, someone trying a proposed solution and demonstrating it with - for example - a small 5-node docker-compose - based cluster. The solution should be proved to be reasonably stable i.e. able to run successfully for e.g. a few hours.",

One of the problems I've seen when I quickly tried something similar in the past was that it was slowing down as the time went by (i.e. difficulty raising) or periodical freezes. This was even when it was mining empty blocks. So overall if the network seems stable running any contract for sometime it should be fine. If you have anything in a shared repo, I could also try it/have a look.",
