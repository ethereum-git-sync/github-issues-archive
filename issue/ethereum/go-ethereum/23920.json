Limiting this to 128kb (far below the block gas limit) introduces a cap on the max TPS a zkrollup can do with on chain data availability.\r\n\r\nWhat are the use-cases?\r\n\r\nIncreasing the cap to 512kb would allow a zkRollup like Aztec to bundle ~500txs in a single block instead of 112.\r\n\r\n# Implementation\r\n\r\nDo you have ideas regarding the implementation of this feature?\r\n\r\nI would like to ask the community to opine on the effects of increasing this cap, and if this may cause problems for geth client, other clients or the network in general?\r\n\r\nAre you willing to implement this feature?\r\n\r\nAztec would be willing to contribute development resources to implement this feature.\r\n\r\n",

My guess would be that we'd need to wait until there's actual use that we can see the effect of, and then gradually go from 128 to whereever in smaller increments. Yes, this would take time, but it's easier to react to a small clog than to have to update the entire network because it just went belly up and we need to undo a release.",

    "body": "Hi @karalabe Yep, Aztec is already constrained by the 128kb limit.  We are currently maxed out at 112 transactions per rollup.  I can send across a local transaction payload if that would be helpful with much higher call data? Below is our main-net transaction.\r\n\r\nDue to the way the rollup works, our circuits need to increase in powers of 2. This next circuit size would be ~224 transactions which is ~200kb of call data. Would an initial increase to 256kb be feasible?\r\n\r\nMain-net tx with ~100kb of call data. \r\n\r\nhttps://etherscan.io/tx/0xa21724a4b64f50e84cbebfcafbcd662538eff3e4c453e0c925eae306b9a06ef3",

Raising the limits but the network not using it is dangerous because you don't see how it may be abused by an attacker (not using it all the time I mean). That's the rationale why we're a bit hesitant. ",
