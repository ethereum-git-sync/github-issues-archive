  "body": "Live tracing as the chain progresses in one thing, but what do we do with the results? We can store it in our database or a freezer instance, but that's going to be a very non trivial amount of data. Whilst we *can* argue that anyone running traces should know about it, but it has some implications:\n\n- We don't want DApps to end up forcing users to run with some tracers enabled because they rely on it.\n- Keeping the traces seems a lot less optimal vs having it post-processed by some external indexer and then discarded.\n\nThere are of course advantages in persisting the traces, but it's forming a can of worms with indexing, deleting, querying, etc; and Geth needs to walk a fine line in what it adds vs what it outsources/delegates.",
