  "body": "#### System information\r\n\r\nGeth version: `1.7.1`\r\nOS & Version: iOS\r\n\r\n#### Expected behaviour\r\nI expect the Geth framework to work both when added to a podfile and to a podspec file. Third party frameworks that depend on Geth should be able to add Geth in the podspec file as a dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Actual behaviour\r\nGeth cannot be added to podspec file, complicating creating frameworks that use Geth. The error ````pod lib lint <name of third party framework>.podspec```` encounters is: \r\n\r\n````\r\n- ERROR | [iOS] unknown: Encountered an unknown error (The 'Pods-App' target has transitive dependencies that include static binaries: (/private/var/folders/bc/q3fvxvx12bz89_y5wl2kysv80000gn/T/CocoaPods-Lint-20171010-28205-tjowza-Swifthereum/Pods/Geth/Frameworks/Geth.framework)) during validation.\r\n````\r\n\r\nThe root cause is that Geth.framework is a static framework, not a dynamic framework, limiting the use of Geth on iOS considerably.\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\r\n- Create a new framework ````pod lib create MyLibrary```` and choose ````Swift````, ````Yes````, ````none````, ````no````\r\n- Edit the ````MyLibrary.podspec```` file and add the line ````s.dependency 'Geth', '~> 1.7.1'````\r\n- run ````pod lib lint Swifthereum.podspec````\r\n\r\nNote that lint will fail with the error listed above.\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "I've spent a some time today digging into the build scripts and the [gomobile docs](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/mobile/cmd/gomobile).  \r\n\r\nSetting the ````-dynamic```` argument of ````libtool```` linker should produce a dynamic framework. This is equivalent to setting ````Mach-O Type```` to ````Dynamic Library```` in the ````Linker```` section of the Xcode build settings.\r\n\r\nI haven't been able to compile the geth framework using gomobile manually yet, but I do see a ````build flags```` argument which suggests those will passed on to the xcode build environment. Can someone confirm that is the case and we can pass custom arguments to the xcode linker?",
