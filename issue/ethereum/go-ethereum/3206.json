Instead the console output started to show every block was getting downloaded starting from #2.\n\n I discussed this on reddit and was asked to report it here as a bug. I attach a picture of the console outputs I got:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/23082678/19737877/87d9c4fa-9bb5-11e6-8c6b-a43513a1ff76.png)\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/23082678/19737886/8fae6c62-9bb5-11e6-8dd7-021ddd7feb2a.png)\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\n\n~/Library/Application Support/Mist/binaries/Geth/unpacked/geth --cache 1024 --fast console\n#### Backtrace\n\n```\n[backtrace]\n```\n",
