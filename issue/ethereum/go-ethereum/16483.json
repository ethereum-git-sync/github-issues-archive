  "body": "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI'm sorry that I know this is not a `develop` issue, technically.  But I do wanna get some authoritative answer, or help will be wonderful.\r\n\r\nAs we know, geth send eth by `sendTransaction`, it has `from` `to` and `amount`, it is an one-to-one transaction.\r\nCan I get a way of one-to-many(many-to-many) transaction like `sendmany` in bitcoin-core?  As bitcoin-core can draw bitcoin form all address in the local wallet automatically, it is actually a many-to-many transaction.\r\nJust for saving miner-fee when I have huge transactions.\r\n\r\nThanks.",
