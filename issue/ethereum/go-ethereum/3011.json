This is normal behavior and should normally not lead to a node that stops synching.\n\n2 days ago there was an security problem that causes geth nodes to crash. You have the patched version but during that time the number of nodes dropped significantly. That might explain why you had synchronization issues 2 days ago. Is your node still not synchronizing?\n",
