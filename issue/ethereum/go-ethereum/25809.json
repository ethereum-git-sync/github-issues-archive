I'll give a quick try to summon them here though @terencechain @potuz\r\n\r\nThis particular timeout being reported in this issue arises when prysm is being used with a feature flag to discard execution payloads from its database. When a peer requests an historical batch, we requests the payloads by hash from geth to reassemble the full blocks and serve them to the peer. I have a few disjoint comments, so I'll leave them here in decreasing order of importance\r\n\r\n- The PR linked above by @lukaszsamson should help in this particular timeout, I think it is safe to close this issue as \"not a geth issue\" as it's prysm that is setting the deadline here. \r\n- These timeouts do not affect client performance in any way, the clients will fail to honor a batch request and one peer may downscore them slightly, it should not be noticeable at all.\r\n- We are seeing a lot of users experiencing a different timeout on `NewPayload` during regular sync, these are more serious as these timeouts do affect client performance and we believe that the fix in master that Marius is referring to does help with this as all users reporting these timeouts also report either state healing or database compaction logs from geth. Please ping us if you need help with Prysm logs for these kinds of reports. \r\n- This particular timeout should dissapear when the engine api adds methods to requests blocks by range",
