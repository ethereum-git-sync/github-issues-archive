However, this is being cleared at the end of the function, which make sense, since it's an internal error, but it would be useful for having that info for a library that build on top of `geth` and wants to know this detail (my case).\r\n\r\n# Implementation\r\n\r\nThis feature doesn't imply any feature change to the `Interpreter.Run` function, but a refactor that will separate the body of the function, from the clearing of the error. The function could look something like this\r\n\r\n```go\r\nfunc (in *EVMInterpreter) Run(contract *Contract, input []byte, readOnly bool) (ret []byte, err error) {\r\n\t\r\n        in.CallRunBody(...)\r\n\r\n\tif err == errStopToken {\r\n\t\terr = nil // clear stop token error\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\treturn res, err\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would make `Interpreter.CallRunBody` available for developers not willing to clear the `errStopToken` error.\r\n\r\nI could do a PR for this, if this is something you would consider having in the codebase",
