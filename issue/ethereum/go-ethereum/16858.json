  "body": "When working with large numbers of keystore files it would be nice to be able to put all of them in a single file to prevent issues with scanning over a directory with lots of files.\r\n\r\nWhen it is starting and doing the initial scan of a keystore, there is no logging or indication that the process is healthy and just completing a long-running action. Some kind of progress logging would be appreciated. Ideally, the service would still respond over rpc/ipc and give a lightweight \"syncing\" reply to give a sign of healthiness and that something didn't go terribly wrong.",
