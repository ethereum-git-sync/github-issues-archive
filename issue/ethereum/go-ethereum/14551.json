  "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nThis is an improvement proposal, rather than a bug report. And I'm not a big Ethereum expert, so it might not be a great idea, but...\r\n\r\nCurrently I see a great usability issue in the fact that the blockchain is downloaded (synced) very slowly. For me it crashed a couple of times, which which in no way is helping adoption among not so technical users.\r\n\r\nSo why not push snapshots of the blockchain to a bittorrent DHT? People have done that with the Bitcoin blockchain - a snapshot is available for download from various places. \r\n\r\nBut manual download isn't ideal - my proposal is to include a small bittorrent client in geth (and other implementations), so that peers can use the ethereum protocol to push a particular snapshot to the DHT, and also \"advertise\" the same DHT key to newly joined peers.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if that can be secure enough, e.g. if malicious nodes won't have able to interfere and some clients end up with a fake blockchain, but I guess that can be remedied when the next block is received and it doesn't match.\r\n\r\nI know I'm a bit vague, but that's the general idea - have a bittorrent client in the ethereum client that pushes and downloads a blockchain snapshot (e.g. each day / week) to a bittorrent DHT.",
