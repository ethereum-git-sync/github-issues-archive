  "body": "#### System information\r\n\r\nGeth version: 1.6.1\r\nOS & Version: OS X\r\n\r\n#### Expected behaviour\r\nIn private network, When I send a lot of transactions to geth (around ~45k) at a time then all the transactions should propagate and all the other node's txn pool should have them.\r\n\r\n#### Actual behaviour\r\nIn private network, When I send a lot of transactions to geth (around ~45k) at a time then transactions start propagating properly but after a while I don't see transactions propagating. The other peers's txn pool doesn't show these transactions but the geth node that I sent the transactions too are there in the pool. \r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\r\n1. Create three nodes and connect them to each other.\r\n2. In Node B and C start mining.\r\n3. Send 50k transactions at a time to Node A from same account.\r\n4. Now after a while you will see that few thousands of transactions never get mined and are stuck in the txpool of Node A.\r\n\r\n",
