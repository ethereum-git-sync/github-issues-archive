    "body": "Notes from gitter discussion on the difference between URLs ending in / and ones that don't\r\n\r\n```\r\nwe had other problems where if we called localhost:8500/theswarm.eth the site\r\nwouldn't work while calling it as localhost:8500/theswarm.eth/ did work ...\r\nthe problem was that relative URLs in the html would be interpreted differently in both cases.\r\nThe solution was for swarm to always add a trailing / in the URL bar.\r\nSince then we cannot distinguish [between URLs ending in / and ones without] .\r\n[...]\r\nWe could change the default entry property in a manifest. Instead of saying what the\r\nempty path should resolve to, we say what the empty path should redirect to\r\n(another entry in the same manifest).\r\nSo that the empty path can redirect to /index.html\r\nof course a manifest could have an empty entry '' and an entry for '/' .... but I suppose that's ok\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo. **Suggestion:** The default (i.e. empty-key) entry in a Manifest should not resolve to a hash but to another entry in the manifest. The http interface should treat this as a 302 redirect. \r\n`{\"path\":\"\", \"target\":\"/index.html\",\"type\":\"redirect\"}`\r\n\r\n**Suggestion 2:** The default upload functions on the console and `swarm up` should add an entry for '/' which functions in (almost) the same way as the empty-path entry. [I say almost because here we don't need it to be a redirect, we just need it to load the other entry directly.] \r\n`{\"path\":\"/\", \"target\":\"/index.html\",\"type\":\"direct\"}`",
