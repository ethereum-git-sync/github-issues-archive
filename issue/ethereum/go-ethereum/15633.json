  "body": "Hi all,\r\nplease don't shoot me if this doesn't belong here, but as my stackexchange post isn't getting any real attention I thought some devs here might have a better insight.\r\n\r\nThe issue is more extensively explained here: https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/32367/incorrect-passworddid-geth-possibly-modify-my-utc-keystore\r\n\r\nIn short:\r\n\r\nI tried to do a transaction from my etherbase account and was prompted for my password. It said my password was wrong but I'm pretty sure it's one of my regularly used passwords..\r\nI've tried:\r\n- typo's\r\n- directly in geth console with (geth account update ...) or (personal.unlockAccount(....))\r\n- importing in MEW\r\n- CAPS Lock on, NUM Lock off\r\n\r\nAfter trying all of these, I started looking more in detail at the UTC Keystore and noticed the file name has the format: UTC--2017--06--04T.... So the file was created on the 4th of June 2017.\r\nBut Windows says the last modification date is the 19th of June 2017.\r\n\r\nI don't specifically recall changing my password, but wouldn't Geth change the file name when modifying the password? I really doubt I changed the password.. \r\n\r\nIf anybody has any useful information that might help, I'd definitely reward you!\r\n\r\nKind regards\r\n\r\n#### System information\r\n\r\nGeth version: 1.7.3\r\nOS & Version: Windows\r\n\r\n#### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nAccount unlocks after password is entered\r\n\r\n#### Actual behaviour\r\n\r\nAccount doesn't unlock\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\r\n\r\n/\r\n",

Perhaps check if the passwords you're trying have such characters, and try another-layout-version of them in the appropriate place. Others may have better/more correct suggestions. Good luck.",
