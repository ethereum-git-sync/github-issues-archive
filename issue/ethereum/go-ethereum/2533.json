And im on windows 10  was something on the output about their being blocks found and then it would disable fast sync.  cant remember exact details now.. I have had it corrupt the blockchain twice now.. Im back on a pool till its all sorted out.  Best Regards\n",

Yes, I am aware of the explicit requirement to start fresh when using  geth --fast.  \n\nI believe issue you're alluding might be similar to the one I reported few days ago at https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/2467.  After getting \"empty head header set\", last block# is reset and few minutes later fast sync says its complete, and disables itself.  Unfortunately, I haven't received any feedback on this issue and not sure if it actually is the root cause of my issues with fast syncing.\n",
