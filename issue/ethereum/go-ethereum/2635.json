  "body": "#### System information\n\nGeth version: `Geth/v1.5.0-unstable/linux/go1.5.1`\nOS & Version: Ubuntu 15.10\n#### Expected behaviour\n\ni was trying to run another node in a separate container in my computer to let one node with public blockchain and the other with a private blockchain to use it to test some contracts. \n#### Actual behaviour\n\nThe main blockchain seams that got a default configuration from other path settted before (private blockchain) but a new one only says \"p2p/discover/table.go:389] no seed nodes found\" all the time, how can i fix this new one with public and let him synchronize with public?\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\n\ni installed the main node as you mentioned in the wiki, at the begining it only synchronizes and it looked like it was mining but i let it mine over 2 days and no reward was received, then i set  another node with a private network and it mined succesfully but when i came back to the main node, it started to work with a private network. After that i just let it go the main node with a private blockchain and i tried to set another container to configure it with a public node and i tried to started and it just said all the time: \n\"p2p/discover/table.go:389] no seed nodes found\" \n\ni also tried with maxpeers 25, maxpeers 50, maxpeers 100 and it works in the same way\n",

    "body": "Hello,\nI ran into the same problem. I started a container adding  \"--verbosity 6\" and that pointed me into the direction of a network problem (at host level since the problem appeared in each new container).\n\nLong story short... I found this post:\nhttps://github.com/docker/docker/issues/2174#issuecomment-77102908\n\nYou might try the following to verify if something messed up your iptables, like it was the problem on my system:\n\nThe \"before\" test:\n`sudo iptables -L -t nat`\n\nRe-install docker:\n\n```\nsudo apt-get remove docker.io\nsudo apt-get autoremove --purge\nsudo apt-get install docker.io\n```\n\nRetest a container and see if it finds peers. In my case, this was happening.\n( `docker run -it -p 30303:30303 ethereum/client-go --verbosity 5` (or 6 if you are a fast reader ;) )\n\nThen the \"after\" test:\n`sudo iptables -L -t nat`\n\nThe difference is clear:\n\nNAT IP tables before the re-install with containers not finding peers:\n\n```\n$ sudo iptables -L -t nat\nChain PREROUTING (policy ACCEPT)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination         \nDOCKER     all  --  anywhere             anywhere             ADDRTYPE match dst-type LOCAL\n\nChain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination         \n\nChain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination         \nDOCKER     all  --  anywhere            !127.0.0.0/8          ADDRTYPE match dst-type LOCAL\n\nChain POSTROUTING (policy ACCEPT)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination         \nMASQUERADE  all  --  172.17.0.0/16        anywhere            \n\nChain DOCKER (2 references)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination         \n```\n\nNAT IP tables after the re-install with container now finding peers again:\n\n```\nsudo iptables -L -t nat\nChain PREROUTING (policy ACCEPT)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination         \nDOCKER     all  --  anywhere             anywhere             ADDRTYPE match dst-type LOCAL\n\nChain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination         \n\nChain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination         \nDOCKER     all  --  anywhere            !127.0.0.0/8          ADDRTYPE match dst-type LOCAL\n\nChain POSTROUTING (policy ACCEPT)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination         \nMASQUERADE  all  --  172.17.0.0/16        anywhere            \nMASQUERADE  tcp  --  172.17.0.1           172.17.0.1           tcp dpt:30303\n\nChain DOCKER (2 references)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination         \nDNAT       tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             tcp dpt:30303 to:172.17.0.1:30303\n```\n\nYou may just try to add the 2 missing rules.\n\nAs you, I did nothing special around my network. I didn't touch the iptables, nor a firewall. I simply started a container to connect to the production network, then I played with containers to build my private test network, next the \"thing was broken\".\n\nI'm currently looking into what could had have gone wrong. If I find find out what touched the iptables, I'll post it back here.\n\nHope this helps. \n",
