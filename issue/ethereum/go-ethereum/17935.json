  "body": "During the recent Constantinople chain split on the Ropsten testnet, users experienced difficulty fast syncing to the correct chain. In a fast sync, geth will download all block headers, and then start fast syncing to the chain with the highest Total Difficulty. If the highest TD chain has an incorrect block prior to the fast sync block, geth will \"skip\" past it, leaving the client on an incorrect chain.\r\n\r\nIt would be useful if geth accepted a blacklist of block hashes that the chain _must not_ have (or alternatively, a whitelist of block hashes that the chain _must_ have), with an argument such as as `--blacklist-blockhash`. Then clients could fast sync without worrying that they will end up on the incorrect chain.\r\n",
