I tried using eth_NewFilter but that seems to only return contract info. Something like NewFilter should be possible for getting transactions belonging to a specific set of accounts (receiver OR sender both) and it should follow NewFilter logic so only certain history can be requested.\n\nIf this is already possible please advise on how.\n",
