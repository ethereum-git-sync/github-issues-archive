  "body": "#### System information\n\nVersion: 1.5.0-unstable-4f4e1026\n#### Expected behaviour\n\nMiners should include uncle blocks in the pending block (i.e. the block that they are currently mining) immediately. As soon as an uncle block is received, the pending block should be updated to include it.\n#### Actual behaviour\n\nMiners only include uncles in the pending block 50% of the time, depending on the outcome of the coin flip on [core/blockchain.go#L784](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/4f4e1026f50860b05a61fe4b5d53d6933f62f549/core/blockchain.go#L784). If the coin flip is less than 0.5, then the pending block is updated to include the uncle block, and will thus be included in the first mined block. But if the coin flip is greater than 0.5, then the pending block is not updated, and the uncle will not be included until the second mined block.\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\n\nThe following logs were produced by adding additional debug prints to [core/blockchain.go and miner/worker.go](https://gist.github.com/cdetrio/20ff720929e1c599ef0aeed8c872ce72):\n\n```\n### Correct behavior: two blocks at #2054709 are received and coin flip < 0.5, so ChainHeadEvent is triggered.\n### second block at #2054709 is included as an uncle in #2054710\n\nI0811 18:01:05.897392 core/blockchain.go:988] imported 1 block(s) (0 queued 0 ignored) including 5 txs in 21.403651ms. #2054708 [071245a2 / 071245a2]\nI0811 18:01:05.897465 core/blockchain.go:1128] postChainEvents recieved ChainEvent. check if event.Hash == self.LastBlockHash.\nI0811 18:01:05.897474 core/blockchain.go:1131] event.Hash == self.LastBlockHash. posting ChainHeadEvent to eventMux.\nI0811 18:01:05.897519 miner/worker.go:238] update() received ChainHeadEvent with block #2054708 and hash 071245a2 and uncle count 0\nI0811 18:01:05.897544 miner/worker.go:242] update() case ChainHeadEvent. invoking commitNewWork.\nI0811 18:01:05.897554 miner/worker.go:468] commitNewWork()\nI0811 18:01:05.898777 miner/worker.go:564] commitNewWork() invoking work.commitTransactions().\nI0811 18:01:05.915772 miner/worker.go:606] commit new work on block 2054709 with 7 txs & 0 uncles.
