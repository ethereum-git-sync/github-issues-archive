  "body": "Good morning all,\r\n\r\nIve been studying the source code the other night and I want to be sure I understood correctly the peer lifecycle.\r\n\r\n1. Peer gets discovered by p2p level protocol. ?? `which handler/file manages that`\r\n2. Peer is ready for protocol handshake and `runEthPeer` is invoked in `eth/handler.go`\r\n3. Peer is connected and local node starts to exchange information with it.\r\n4. is there any other step that I am missing?\r\n\r\nI want to calculate statistics for each connected peer and constatly update them as the peer communicates with my node, in order to detect ddos and spam based on custom metrics.\r\n\r\n ",
