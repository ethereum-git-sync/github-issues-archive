  "body": "I've noticed that `xgo` has not been updated to recent go releases, and thus cross-compiling on OSX via `make geth-linux-amd64` builds with go 12.x, and yet the binaries on the EF website are all built using Go 1.13.x.  What is the current best way to build a branch for compatibility testing before sending a PR?\r\n\r\nI see that travis is using `build/ci.go install` but I don't believe that path supports cross-compiling; is cross-compiling no longer fully supported?",
