See my comment at https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/17696 . \r\n\r\nI also think it would make sense that the same person implemented both of these. \r\n\r\nAnd if you're a professional Go-coder, I don't think it matters much if you're not familiar with geth/ethereum, normally. However, these two (eips 191 and 712) will require quite a lot of discussion and coordination with other actors in the space, like metamask, MEW, web3.js/web3.py people etc. So for this particular one, it is probably a lot easier for someone who knows the ecosystem a bit.

    "body": "@holiman Thanks for the response.  I didn't see the other issue. If I read EIP-712 correctly, I was expecting a couple hours of work to implement the object -> bytestring conversion, then reuse existing signing code to sign the resulting bytes. Since the signing part isn't done yet (I assumed https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/signer/core/api.go#L378 was the implementation you wanted because I didn't know about the EIP-191 ticket), I guess it makes sense to have the same person do both (even though the object -> bytestring translation is pretty self-contained IMO). And since I'm curious, what sort of coordination is required for this? I assumed that the EIP serving as the source of truth would be sufficient, but like you said, I don't know the ecosystem.\r\n\r\nPS: If you want PaulRBerg to do this one as well, you might want to have him apply for it on gitcoin, and mark this issue as not \"Open\" on gitcoin so that you don't get any more spurious applications.",

It's quite a big PR, so I have been putting it off a bit. \r\nI think it needs some more work before it will be committed. \r\n\r\nIf anyone wants to help out, it would help to have additional eyes on the implementation. In particular, how it handles bad or outright malicious inputs. It should never `panic`, and it should also handle erroneous input correctly (i.e detect the error and not actually make a signature). \r\n\r\nTo this end, it would be good with a set of test vectors for signed data, both valid and invalid data.
