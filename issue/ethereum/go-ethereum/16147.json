    "body": "Syncing Ethereum is a pain point for many people, so I'll try to detail what's happening behind the scenes so there might be a bit less confusion.\r\n\r\nThe current default mode of sync for Geth is called fast sync. Instead of starting from the genesis block and reprocessing all the transactions that ever occurred (which could take weeks), fast sync downloads the blocks, and only verifies the associated proof-of-works. Downloading all the blocks is a straightforward and fast procedure and will relatively quickly reassemble the entire chain.\r\n\r\nMany people falsely assume that because they have the blocks, they are in sync. Unfortunately this is not the case, since no transaction was executed, so we do not have any account state available (ie. balances, nonces, smart contract code and data). These need to be downloaded separately and cross checked with the latest blocks. This phase is called the state trie download and it actually runs concurrently with the block downloads; alas it take a lot longer nowadays than downloading the blocks.\r\n\r\nSo, what's the state trie? In the Ethereum mainnet, there are a [ton of accounts already](https://etherscan.io/chart/address), which track the balance, nonce, etc of each user/contract. The accounts themselves are however insufficient to run a node, they need to be cryptographically linked to each block so that nodes can actually verify that the account's are not tampered with. This cryptographic linking is done by creating a tree data structure above the accounts, each level aggregating the layer below it into an ever smaller layer, until you reach the single root. This gigantic data structure containing all the accounts and the intermediate cryptographic proofs is called the state trie.\r\n\r\nOk, so why does this pose a problem? This trie data structure is an intricate interlink of hundreds of millions of tiny cryptographic proofs (trie nodes). To truly have a synchronized node, you need to download all the account data, as well as all the tiny cryptographic proofs to verify that noone in the network is trying to cheat you. This itself is already a crazy number of data items. The part where it gets even messier is that this data is constantly morphing: at every block (15s), about 1000 nodes are deleted from this trie and about 2000 new ones are added. This means your node needs to synchronize a dataset that is changing 200 times per second. The worst part is that while you are synchronizing, the network is moving forward, and state that you begun to download might disappear while you're downloading, so your node needs to constantly follow the network while trying to gather all the recent data. But until you actually do gather all the data, your local node is not usable since it cannot cryptographically prove anything about any accounts.\r\n\r\nIf you see that you are 64 blocks behind mainnet, you aren't yet synchronized, not even close. You are just done with the block download phase and still running the state downloads. You can see this yourself via the seemingly endless `Imported state entries [...]` stream of logs. You'll need to wait that out too before your node comes truly online.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Q: The node just hangs on importing state enties?!**\r\n\r\nA: The node doesn't hang, it just doesn't know how large the state trie is in advance so it keeps on going and going and going until it discovers and downloads the entire thing.\r\n\r\nThe reason is that a block in Ethereum only contains the state root, a single hash of the root node. When the node begins synchronizing, it knows about exactly 1 node and tries to download it. That node, can refer up to 16 new nodes, so in the next step, we'll know about 16 new nodes and try to download those. As we go along the download, most of the nodes will reference new ones that we didn't know about until then. This is why you might be tempted to think it's stuck on the same numbers. It is not, rather it's discovering and downloading the trie as it goes along.\r\n\r\n**Q: I'm stuck at 64 blocks behind mainnet?!**\r\n\r\nA: As explained above, you are not stuck, just finished with the block download phase, waiting for the state download phase to complete too. This latter phase nowadays take a lot longer than just getting the blocks.\r\n\r\n**Q: Why does downloading the state take so long, I have good bandwidth?**\r\n\r\nA: State sync is mostly limited by disk IO, not bandwidth.\r\n\r\nThe state trie in Ethereum contains hundreds of millions of nodes, most of which take the form of a single hash referencing up to 16 other hashes. This is a horrible way to store data on a disk, because there's almost no structure in it, just random numbers referencing even more random numbers. This makes any underlying database weep, as it cannot optimize storing and looking up the data in any meaningful way.\r\n\r\nNot only is storing the data very suboptimal, but due to the 200 modification / second and pruning of past data, we cannot even download it is a properly pre-processed way to make it import faster without the underlying database shuffling it around too much. The end result is that even a fast sync nowadays incurs a huge disk IO cost, which is too much for a mechanical hard drive.\r\n\r\n**Q: Wait, so I can't run a full node on an HDD?**\r\n\r\nA: Unfortunately not. Doing a fast sync on an HDD will take more time than you're willing to wait with the current data schema. Even if you do wait it out, an HDD will not be able to keep up with the read/write requirements of transaction processing on mainnet.\r\n\r\nYou however should be able to run a light client on an HDD with minimal impact on system resources. If you wish to run a full node however, an SSD is your only option.",

    "body": "Thanks for that thorough write-up, karalabe.  I'm going to have to take some time to read it carefully.  I am currently running a full sync with SSD with periodic ZFS snapshots for rollback in case of failure.  The log is littered with periodic reports of checksum mismatches, broken chain ancestry, synchronization failures, canceled downloads, dangling trie nodes, empty head header sets, actions from \"bad peers\" that are ignored, receipt downloads canceled, and probably many more messages of which I am unsure of the precise meaning, provenance or severity.  I don't know what is merely a warning that I can safely ignore and what is a problem that should raise alarm.  Very simply, the reports don't provide me with strong assurance that it is functioning properly and that I may trust the integrity of its operation accordingly.  Compounding that problem are the periodic crashes that also shake my confidence.  I am craving unambiguous reports from the process that indicate in clear simple language that it is getting on with the process and making progress, having verified cryptographic integrity, regardless of whether it can tell me how long it has left to run.\r\n\r\nBeyond that, if I may, could you indulge me by possibly answering the following question succinctly?\r\n\r\nWhat is the minimum requirement for me to operate geth in such a way that it will show my account balances and enable me to perform transactions with my ethereum ledger balances?  Is --light operation sufficient?  If such is the case, what are the risks?",

    "body": "@karalabe  I think this is a bug. To a user/developer \"syncing\" is not only block syncing, but also trie (states) syncing. When `eth.syncing` returns `false` it should be done syncing, all syncing. Especially since the output of `eth.syncing`, when it returns a non-false value, also shows the knowStates and pulledStates values, thereby suggesting that trie (states) syncing is also part of it.\r\n\r\nCurrently it `eth.syncing` returning false means you should try if a non-zero balance is actually non-zero, and if that is not the case you can use the logs to see if there are still `Imported new state entries` messages, which means the trie is still syncing. You cannot even use `eth.syncing` to see the absolute progress, because that now returns `false`. Also the progress hard to interpret as --as far as I know-- the total number of states is not shown. This maybe worth a feature request, because having the rough total number of states allows one to show a progress as a percentage.\r\n\r\nI would opt for filing a bug specific for `eth.syncing`'s misleading behaviour, so that it can be fixed (there are MANY questions on this topic, obviously leading to much user frustration, and it is not often well explained). In the meantime we can explain some workaround for this by tailing the logs for `Imported new state entries` messages, and waiting at least 3x longer then the block sync to complete for the trie to be synced as well.\r\n",

    "body": "Interesting thread. Thanks! 220GB.. WOW!\r\nYes, looks the the eth.syncing is really confusing. a \"false\" is no guarantee at all it is synced. It just indicates there are new state entries to import.\r\n\r\nWill post result later: Currently defrag the partition. I will add a dedicated partition for the chaindata.\r\nYes it is still importing states.\r\nMy chaindata is at abut 70GB and increase very slow now in size.  So seem there is some \"day\" to go...\r\nOne time I had more than 150GB but I've deleted all due to a recommendation concerning the subject.\r\n\r\nAnother question is: How many peers are you all connected to? What is the typical amount of peers? I used to have up to about 10 peers (after resyncing system-time on a regular basis using NTP client as a scheduled service) but it became less now with 0 to 3 (using net.peercount).\r\n\r\nBandwidth usage never was really high and nodes not more than 10. My ISP (cosmote/OTE) won't block that all all. When connecting to other swarms like bit-torrent or IPFS I have hundred of nodes immediately.\r\n\r\nAre there known firewall issues? Did not find anything about. Even forwarded 30303 from my \"Mikrotik\" and see incoming connections in the log with some traffic.",
