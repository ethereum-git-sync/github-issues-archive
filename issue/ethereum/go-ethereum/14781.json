Nope same thing\r\nUse Mist. Nope same thing\r\nIts because you need an SSD. Oh a hard drive will get within 100 blocks but to get all synced up you HAVE to have an SSD. I dont think so.\r\nStart geth then open your wallet. Nope same thing.\r\nI've tried everything I could find on the net to sync the blockchain and nothing has worked. I've gotten only as close to 48 blocks of being synced then all geth does is import new state entries (does that have anything to do with syncing the chain?) and drop peers. The worst part of the whole experience is nobody has an answer for this problem, I have seen so many other people posting the same problem and they never get an answer that fixes the problem. So, I'm beginning to wonder if the chain was designed to only have so many nodes and stop new people from creating new nodes.\r\nA solution will be greatly appreciated or at least someone acknowledges that there is a problem and they are working on a solution.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30041008/28011363-aab4e8f6-6527-11e7-9f13-1e8934cbda00.png)\r\n",

It then switches to importing state entries, and imports 70,000,000 or so in a couple more days. Now it is just kinda not doing nything.\r\n\r\neth.syncing shows that the synced blocks are within 100 blocks of the highest block. The numbers will go up as the blockchain goes up, but my synced block will always be ~100 from the highest know. My balance also still shows 0 locally, but I have a balance via lookup on a blockchain explorer, so i know that it has not finished syncing.\r\n\r\nWe really need an answer to this.",
