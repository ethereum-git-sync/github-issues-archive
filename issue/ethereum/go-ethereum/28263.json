We want to use the vmenv.Call method to replay transactions locally, using geth as a go library, and need the full chain state on a given block to do that.\r\n\r\nIf you don't need proofs for the data you receive you can take a look at the `prestateTracer`. You can do something like:\r\n\r\n```terminal\r\ndebug.traceTransaction(<txhash>, { tracer: 'prestateTracer' })\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt will give you the prestate for a tx. Now if you repeat for all txes of a block in order and keep the earlier versions for each account then you have yourself a prestate for the block.\r\n\r\nNote that we are implementing `eth_getRequiredBlockState` which gives you all the information to re-execute a block locally together with the state proofs.
