  "body": "#### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nWhen methods are removed, or parameter strictness is increased, the developer community should get some period of `warning` before the breaking behavior is introduced.\r\n\r\n#### Actual behaviour\r\n\r\nRecently geth stopped tolerating hex values with a zero prefix. This is to spec, but was still a breaking change, that broke some consumer software without notice.\r\n\r\nThe compile methods were removed after an EIP, but developers not following the EIP were surprised to suddenly find methods they relied on missing, breaking some consumer software without notice.\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\r\n\r\nRemove a method without notice, or introduce any other sort of more restrictive behavior on the API.",
