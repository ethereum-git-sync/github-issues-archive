Constantly being 10,000+ blocks behind on Geth is as useful as not running a node at all.  OR, run Parity (which actually updates and works) with huge security flaws and a worthless team who knowingly doesn't give a crap about said security flaws. \r\n\r\nThe truth is that it is pretty pathetic that the Ethereum team can't produce a viable piece of software.  This whole \"you need an SSD to run it\" is garbage.  You shouldn't need to replace your hardware.  Geth should actually not suck.  I run Geth on a dedicated, new install Windows 10 machine, and at best I have 2 peers.. usually 1 or 0 peers.  I try to sync my blockchain, but the closer it gets to being fully synced the slower it runs until I get about 10,000-5,000 block behind current block, and then it falls back to 10,000-20,000 blocks.  How is it that Geth is such a garbage application? Running 1.7.3-stable-4bb3c89d.\r\n\r\nI've been trying nonstop for 2 weeks now, and blockchain still won't full sync.  No matter what I try it won't fully sync.  Honestly and sadly, in spite of their complete disregard for peoples' account security, Parity sounds like a better solution for keeping your node in sync, but the worst idea possible for keeping your money.\r\n> eth.syncing\r\n{\r\n  currentBlock: 4658748,\r\n  highestBlock: 4665813,\r\n  knownStates: 0,\r\n  pulledStates: 0,\r\n  startingBlock: 4654092",
