It should deploy my contract and use the parameter to init a variable.\r\n\r\n#### Actual behaviour\r\nIt throws abi: go.Universe$proxyerror: `` abi: cannot use invalid as type string as argument and won't deploy the contract.\r\n\r\nAlso, if I try to do args.get(0).getString() after setting the string, it will crash. I tried doing that since I wanted to check if it actually set the string in the interface, but it doesn't work...\r\n\r\nMy code is like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nInterfaces args = Geth.newInterfaces(1);\r\nargs.set(0, Geth.newInterface()); args.get(0).setString(companyEmail);\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\r\n1. Create a contract with a constructor argument (for example, a string)\r\n2. Generate the java class with abigen for the contract.\r\n3. Try deploying the contract on Android. When you pass a string to the constructor it will generate the exception mentioned above. \r\n\r\n\r\n",

I noticed that while debugging if I called args.get(0).getString() or something, it crashed my application. With this strategy I actually retrieved the value while debugging and deploying worked (Although I got an out of gas exception).\r\n\r\nYou could try the same strategy with the getters and setters, however I'm not sure it will work and my memory is a bit rusty since it's a while ago. I hope it works for you, because the next issue I ran into was a out of gas exception on the contract, and if you don't have to deploy it via mobile it hopefully works OK. Good luck, and lemme know if it works :)",
