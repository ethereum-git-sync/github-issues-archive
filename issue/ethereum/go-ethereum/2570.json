Great. The blockNumber ticks up as expected.\n\nNow, I'd like to be able to logout and go away and get on with things.\n\nI am using `screen`\n\nI do `Ctrl+A` followed by `D`. I can tail `~/geth.log` and I can see the blockNumber incrementing.\n\nI logout. However, when I tail the `geth.log` file several hours later, it keeps getting stuck:\n\n`I0513 05:53:21.227568 eth/downloader/downloader.go:274] Synchronisation failed: no peers to keep download active`\n\nThe Amazon firewall is wide open. I have `ufw` (Ubuntu's firewall) switched off.\n\nI have no idea what's going on. I have spent hours at this.\n\nI wonder is Amazon traffic shaping or blocking UDP on this port? I have the Amazon security wide open - all IP addresses, all tcp, all udp connections allowed...\n",

The updates are working their way through. I'm on stable branch on both Ubuntu and OSX/homebrew.\n",

    "body": "I suggest you lower your peer count and leave it at the default. More peers does not mean better connectivity.\n\nYou can image your node like this: put it in a room with 300 other nodes, each of those nodes are telling the same story, just at different intervals. Your node has to interpret ever 300 stories and as you can imagine that would take considerable amount of time and effort. At some point you'll be so busy following up on all the stories you're starting to lack behind with the interpretation (because you're too slow to catch up on all 300) and so you must ask them to wait. Nodes don't like waiting because being stalled by someone means they won't be able to communicate further, and the longer you do this, the more likely you'll get dropped.\n\nThis might be a reason why you're seeing connectivity drops. Please remove the `--maxpeers` and let us know if that solved anything.\n\nAdditionally, 300 peers on a 3G network is a bad, bad idea. Your 3G network might also be an issue. Try running geth with `geth --vmodule=p2p=6,downloader=6` and upload the logs once it starts to stall again. \n",
