It would be helpful if it could log progress, say every 10000 blocks or so just to have an idea of how far along it has moved.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the help text for the `export` option does not mention anything about the gzip support that exists in the code.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to PR for this, doesn't seem like a very big change.",
