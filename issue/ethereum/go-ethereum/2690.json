We put this issue here, in order to propose this development to be done and add it into our roadmap.\n",

    "body": "Sharing a database among several active nodes might work, but some edge cases come to mind. You can try implementing the Database interface in package ethdb and see how it goes.\n\nI think what you're after is some kind of read-only RPC server that can execute contract calls and that you can send transactions to. Is that right?\n\n> My users asked me to have nodes with full synchronisation, I couldn't find yet a clear document explaining me what I'm really losing if I just do a --fast sync.\n\nYou 'lose' the computed state of very old blocks. This state is almost never useful in practice unless you want to access contract storage from the past. We are looking into implementing 'state pruning' which will delete this state unless you explicitly ask to keep it.\n",
