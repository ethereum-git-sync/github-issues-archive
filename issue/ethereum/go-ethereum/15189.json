  "body": "Yesterday I was procrastinating and ended up running:\r\n`sudo clamscan --recursive --infected --exclude-dir='^/sys|^/dev' /  > clam.out`\r\n(Basically scanning all my machine for infected files using clamav)\r\n\r\nTo my surprise it found a shit ton of ldb files which contained a signature for this virus:\r\n`Geth Win.Trojan.Anaphylaxis-1`\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if it's \"normal\" for the blockchain to contain virus signatures and I assume it's just a false positive introduced to fuck with people.\r\n\r\nI downloaded the whole thing about 1~1.5 months ago when I was messing a bit with eth, so I can't exactly reproduce the steps that lead to this.\r\n\r\nI'd be curios to know how someone could actually end up having these kind of \"corrupted\" files and whether or not this is a widespread phenomenon ? Any literature on the subject would be interesting to read, I thought I sort of knew how the etherium block chain worked but apparently not. The only semi-related topics on the subject I was able to find are old (earliest are from 2016) and don't go into much detail, they simply \r\n\r\nEither way, I'm reporting this as a \"bug\" with the client but since I don't understand it's root it may well not be a bug with geth and it may well not be a bug at all... In which case I'm all the more curios about how this is possible.\r\n\r\n(Alternatively this could be a problem with the viruse signature db I have for clamav, in which case I may be in the wrong place)\r\n\r\n#### System information\r\n\r\nGeth version: 1.7.0-stable-6c6c7b2a\r\nOS & Version: 4.12.13-1-ARCH #1 SMP PREEMPT Fri Sep 15 06:36:43 UTC 2017 x86_64 GNU/Linux\r\n\r\n#### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nDownload blockchain db files without a virus signature.\r\n\r\n#### Actual behaviour\r\n\r\nDownloaded blockchain db files with a virus signature.\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\r\n\r\nI don't know, however, looking at my .histfile which goes quite a while back, these are all the commands I get when I grep for geth:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo pacman -S geth\r\ngeth\r\ngeth --datadir /home/trom/.ethereum\r\ngeth --datadir ~/.ethereum\r\ngeth --datadir ~/.ethereum\r\ngeth --datadir ~/.ethereum\r\ngeth account new\r\ngeth --mine --minerthreads=3\r\ngeth --mine --minerthreads=3\r\ngeth --mine --minerthreads=3 --fast\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Backtrace\r\n\r\n I don't have a backtrace. It didn't crash.\r\n",
