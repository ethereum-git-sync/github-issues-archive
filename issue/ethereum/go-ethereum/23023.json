    "body": "This isn't a problem with go-ethereum, hence the closed issues. What you're asking is how to guarantee a transaction will be mined by a remote miner or enter a specific txpool (i.e. etherscan's). You can't, it's probabilistic. Every miner is free to configure their own gas price minimums. Miners will prioritize higher priced remote txs and have finite space in their tx pools and will discard the lowest priced remote txs when it fills up.\r\n\r\n> So anybody knows how long i should track transactions and what the tracking is?\r\n\r\nYou will probably want to track the transactions until 1) you see they are included in a block or 2) you see they were not included in a block within the amount of time that you wanted them to be, in which case you resubmit the tx with a higher gas price (but, importantly, the same nonce).\r\n\r\nFrom your [previous comment](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/14669#issuecomment-854757512) \"What sence to return tx data of transaction never created.\" The transaction is created when you submit it, you are the one creating it, whether or not the transaction is included in a block is another thing. And one reason it makes sense to return the tx data at this stage is that it aids you in tracking it. You can use the tx hash returned to see if it is included in a block or not. You can [subscribe](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/rpc/pubsub) to `newHeads` and check new blocks for your tx hash.\r\n\r\nTo complicate things further Ethereum has no real \"hard\" finality, so seeing a tx in a block at head doesn't guarantee it will remain there. Chain reorganizations can and do occur (small ones quite frequently), although practically speaking you can generally assume these won't go below a certain depth. This is why exchanges and other services usually wait for ~12 confirmations before accepting a tx as \"final\". So depending on what you are doing you may want to not only ensure the tx is included in a `newHead` but also ensure that that header makes it to a certain depth in the chain before considering the tx as mined. I'd recommend ensuring it makes it off the tip of chain, at least.",

    "body": "N confirmations in blockchain world means that there are N blocks mined on top of the one containing your tx. Since there's a global set of miners, in PoW chains it can happen that some miners miner on top of one reality while other on another. Probabilistically they converge fast.
