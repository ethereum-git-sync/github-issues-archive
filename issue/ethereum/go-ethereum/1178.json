But why retry then? And why not try other peers for it?\n\nThe problem usually sorts itself out when importing pulls a next batch of blocks, probably that's why we haven't noticed it yet. Should look into this in detail.\n",

Since block propagation is currently set to 100% of your peers, this may be the network burden you are seeing (you receive the same block from all your peers and send it to all). We have a potential protocol update to reduce this traffic a bit, though it's not considered a bug, rather a place for optimizations.\n\nStill, as a full node of the network, your node will be both downloading as well as uploading blocks to other nodes, so there will always be some traffic.\n",

Looking at the logs it imports block 528132 repeatedly, thats why I posted it, I get the impression thats its imported the same info, instead of doing it just once 130Mb/day is okay but 130Mb/hr is just way to expensive down here.

    "body": "As I wrote in my previous post, blocks are propagated to 100% of your peers, meaning, that a new block crosses every network connection once at least. With your scenario of a 20KB block (note, there are actually 50KB ones too) and 4 peers, that's 80KB/unique-block.\n\nMany times in the network the same block is found by multiple miners, alas with varying difficulty. So if a miner finds a better block soon after a previous miner found the same block, the better one will overwrite the older one. If we assume that this happens 2-3 times for every block, that-s 160-240KB/block.\n\nThe average block time currently according to https://stats.ethdev.com/ is 7 seconds, so the above block propagation would amount to 1.35-2.05MB/minute, or 82-123MB/hour. This is without considering block synchronizations that remote peers download from you.\n\nOf course the above numbers are way off, I've just written them up to demonstrate that having such a network traffic can actually be valid and not a bug. With the new proposal I mentioned, block propagation bandwidth should be reduced significantly, without impacting propagation speed. But the exact numbers will probably still be implementation dependent. However, this is a completely separate issue from the one opened in this thread, so let's not diverge further away.\n",
