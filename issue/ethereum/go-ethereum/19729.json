    "body": "Hey! Anonymous routing is not a bad idea in itself, but we definitely don't have the capacity nor sanity to reimplement I2P ourselves. Given that it's a Java project and it's not even as stable as Tor, I don't see this ever happening.\r\n\r\nWe might consider integrating tor itself, did some work towards that in https://github.com/ipsn/go-libtor, but even that is far out and needs serious cross platform work.",
