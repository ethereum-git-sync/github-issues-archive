    "body": "Geth does have a call tracer if you specify `{tracer: 'callTracer'}` as a second option to the various trace methods. Tracing a single transaction is fine if you know what you're looking for, but if you by any chance want to trace the entire block, then doing it one tx at a time results in N^2 executions, because each trace needs to recompute its prestate from the start. In that case it's more optimal to trace the entire block in one go.\r\n\r\nGeth does not auto-trace txs currently however, so there's no way to simply retrieve traces.",
