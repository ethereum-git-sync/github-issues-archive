    "body": "@jdevoo Good to hear it. I'm guessing you're on an HDD. The database is quite huge and our data layout wasn't optimized for HDD access patterns. We're working on reorganizing the data to make it faster on HDDs and also on state pruning, but that will be slated to our next major release. The current 1.4.6 meant to sort out any networking issues so that we can have a stable data stream for everyone.\n\nYou might also try backing up your `chaindata` folder and redoing a fast sync. It should make it a ton smaller (4GB) and hence make processing way way faster for subsequent blocks.\n\n@kingteddy @anton44eg Please try with Geth 1.4.6. It's the latest release specifically addressing sync stability. I'll close this issue. Feel free to open ones against our latest release if some issues still persist.\n",
