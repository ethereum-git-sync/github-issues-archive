The other option, of course, is polling.  When a new block arrives the client will then fetch logs for that block and check to see if the block included any transaction that the client previously submitted and are waiting to be mined (this is where transactions list is needed).  Along with that, the client keeps a local chain of blocks that it has seen to deal with disconnects, node outages and re-orgs (this is where the hash is needed).",

That being said, I believe that block `hash` is available to light clients, so this could be included?  Technically the `hash` isn't part of the header _or_ the body, so it doesn't seem like it would violate the \"header only\" bit (it is metadata outside the scope of block contents) by adding it?",
