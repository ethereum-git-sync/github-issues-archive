  "body": "One more crazy idea that might work: If there is no softfork and no hardfork it will be sort of like a race between the attacker and the whitehats who will call split and splitdao+exploit first (if I understand it correctly). But could we not make sure we always win this race by preparing the transaction ahead of time, and coding the ethereum client of the miner to include the whitehat transaction in the first possible block, always before a possible blackhat one. That way the attackers funds are basically just as frozen as in the original softfork scenario right? We could even have miner reject blocks (in the unlikely event) that included the blackhat transaction before the whitehat transaction. Its like a stalker attack, and the attacker might give up, and it will give us a lot of time to have community discussion about the hardfork.\n",

    "body": "Actually I disagree it has the same issue exactly, since it will always include the whitehat transaction first. So it does not need to scan for the blackhat one. \n\nWhen it comes to rejecting blocks that include the blackhat transaction first then yes maybe it requires running the transactions in the block. But the block also requires a valid proof of work, so it is not cheap to spam for ddos, and it only penalizes miners that did not include the softfork. \n",
