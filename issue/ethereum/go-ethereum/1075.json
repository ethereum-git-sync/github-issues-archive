That is imho too much for fetching some 64K of data. The reason we disconnect after 5 secs is that if your connectivity is otherwise good, but you have a shitty peer, then just switch over to somebody faster. The side effect is that if **your** connection is very weak, then you may have an issue hooking into the network.\n\nCould you please check you internet connection, bandwidth, latency, etc, so maybe we can figure out what the best solution would be if there is indeed a problem to solve on our part.\n",
