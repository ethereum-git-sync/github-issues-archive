When comparing the transaction `x` against the \"global\" list of _all_ transactions (pending and queued), the algo decided that in order to fit `x`, it would have to eject `y`. \r\n\r\nAnd then it noticed that `x` is not executable (future), whereas `y` is executable (`pending`).\r\n\r\nSo the message is mostly correct, but the true correct explanation would be more long-winded, like \r\n\r\n> rejecting future transaction, because accepting it would lead to ejecting an executable transaction  ",
