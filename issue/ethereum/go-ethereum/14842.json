  "body": "We only have `sendRawTransaction` api to send a transaction now. For each transaction, we process it, broadcast a `TxPreEvent` event, and broadcast to peers. If we send a lot transactions, it will cause bad performances because too many `TxPreEvent` and messages to peers.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I propose to add `sendRawTransactions` api which can send many transactions at a time. Then, we modify `TxPreEvent` struct to\r\n\r\n```\r\ntype TxPreEvent struct{ Txs types.Transactions }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, we just send a `TxPreEvent`, and a `TxMsg` to handle these transactions.\r\n\r\nPlease refer to my PR.\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/14841\r\n\r\n",
