All transactions after that are pending, because we are on a late block.\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\n\nOnly happened once after the migration to 1.3.5 last week.\n#### Backtrace\n\n![capture](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5642000/13851580/0cad4884-ec5f-11e5-800a-c14744e7fcf1.JPG)\n\n```\n[backtrace]\n```\n### Fix\n\nI couldn't find a way to force the re-sync from geth.\nSo have to restart the container, and lost on the way all pending tx.\nLooking for a way to avoid this in future.\n\nThank you for your help!\nGreg.\n",
