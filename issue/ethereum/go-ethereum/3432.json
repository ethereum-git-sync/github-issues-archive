Right ?\r\n\r\nYes, indeed.\r\n\r\nI have a proposal for a zero miner feature that would be useful solely for (trusted) private networks where the miner would strive to always push difficulty to zero while maintaining 15 sec block times. The idea would be that it should allow mining without eating up even a single core, and also if someone would need ether it would be trivial to mine a few blocks instantly without pushing up the difficulty :) ",
