    "body": "I was eventually able to get some peers recently by asking in the #ethereum IRC channel and being given a admin.addPeer('enode://...') command. It took a while after that, but eventually I was connected to 10-15 peers. It seems that the bootstrap code wasn't finding any non-full peers for me.\n\nHow is the \"--maxpeers\" thing meant to work? Suppose there are 100 peers, each with --maxpeers=25. Each will eventually connect to 25% of the nodes, leaving all 100 nodes \"full\" and unavailable for new peers to connect to. Bitcoin has the concept of \"incoming\" and \"outgoing\" connections. Each peer will only attempt to make a certain number (8 by default) of outgoing connections, leaving the rest of its 'maxpeers' allocation available for other peers to connect to. Is there any similar scheme in ethereum that attempts to ensure it's always possible for new nodes to find non-full peers?\n",

We're running a private chain and this is an issue.  Here's a 1hr sample of the errors (where background.log is the geth output with verbosity=6), during which no peers were successfully added: \r\n\r\n```\r\n$ grep failed background.log | sed 's/.*://g' | sed 's/- .*//g' | sort | uniq -c | sort -r -n\r\n  15485  use of closed network connection\r\n   2654  not found\r\n   1940  Too many peers\r\n    979  Genesis block mismatch\r\n    650  EOF\r\n    249  Useless peer\r\n     37  i/o timeout\r\n     37  An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host.\r\n     18  expected handshake, got 6\r\n      9  shutting down\r\n      2  NetworkId mismatch\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe \"not found\" is when the node was not found in the local DB, so that's actually a count of new peers that were attempted.  You can see the large majority of new peers have too many peers, and many of the others are just not from our network.  Not sure why there are so many \"use of closed network connection\".",
