I run i7-5700HQ 16gb ram. I get a few uncles here and there but have not seen any ether in my account. Am I doing everything correctly or am I doing something wrong? Also wanted to know what would be the best way to mine with my laptop? I also have a good GPU it is a GeForce GTX 970M. Picture shows my mining with CPU. Thanks in Advance for help and advice.\r\n![untitled1111](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/27564927/25304800/e2bc679a-2744-11e7-81b5-5993eea83356.png)\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "The current network hashrate is 22.3TH/s. If you check `eth.hashrate`, you'll see your own hashrate. With a CPU, your hashrate will be on the order of magnitude of 250KH/s. That means you have a chance of finding 1 block out of every 89200000 (i.e. one block every 42.4 years). TL;DR; forget mining with a CPU on the mainnet. CPU mining is only useful for test and private networks where you don't care about security, just want to test Ethereum.\r\n\r\nIf you want to GPU mine, I'd suggest using https://github.com/Genoil/cpp-ethereum, since that received a lot of tunings compared to the stock `ethminer` since there was no particular reason for the EF to keep pushing the limits on the miner, when there's a fully capable mining community to do that. Even for that though, you probably want to join a pool as even a very very powerful desktop GPU can only crunch at about 25MH/s.",

    "body": "Greetings,\r\nI've been testing solo mining on my desktop and setup geth server and mining software. After a few minutes I've got a message \"Successfully sealed new block\" with seal hash and block hash. But my address on etherscan shows 0. Am I doing something wrong? I've seen other miner's logs having a second string after that one saying: \"block reached canonical chain\". Does it mean not all blocks reach the chain? I didn't get that second message.",
