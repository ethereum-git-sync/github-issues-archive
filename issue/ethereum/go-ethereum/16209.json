  "body": "**Goal**: Running a dedicated full node is not easy.  As chain grows over time, filesystem considerations become more important.  We should try to document some common optimisations or issues so users can be more successful as full nodes.\r\n\r\n**Example Issue 1**: geth creates many files:\r\n```\r\n$ find /geth/geth/ -type f | wc -l\r\n126789\r\n```\r\nOver long term, this can cause issues depending on filesystem and FS creation parameters.  For example, ext4 inode exhaustion may occur for many users depending on mkfs parameters and OS defaults.\r\n\r\n**Example Issue 2**: Most geth files are \"large\" (>1MB for ldb).  Default filesystem parameters for common FS like NTFS or ext4 expect small files.  Changing bytes-per-inode on ext4 or cluster size on NTFS is easy and can help\r\n\r\n**Proposal**: We should add documention page for creating and running full nodes, including best practice to setup filesystem for geth chaindata storage.  It would be great to give equations like number of chaindata blocks to inode count for bytes-per-inode.  I would help if we like this idea but need to know where best to put information (like wiki or sample scripts)\r\n\r\nRelated:\r\n* https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/15704\r\n",
