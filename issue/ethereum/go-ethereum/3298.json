    "body": "What you are asking for is really hard to implement. As @karalabe mentiond, if you expose the RPC interface anyone can simply overload the node with RPC requests. The RPC is robust within its design parameters, that is not publicly accessible.\n\nThere are 2 alternative solution:\n1. Use a firewall/proxy and use ACL and/or throttle the number of requests.\n2. Use a local light client (experimental support since 1.5) with your DApp.\n\n> In our case I think that someone was able to execute arbitrary code (we got a port scanning abuse message) in the ethereum-go docker container. But this is just an educated guess, as I have no proof for this. I just saw that the thread in the container logged weird errors.\n\nGeth doesn't allow execution of arbitrary code, it will allow execution of smart contract code. The EVM has limited support for interacting with the OS (e.g. write storage) but this happens in a controlled way. If you have strong suspicions and preferable clear indications that its possible to exploit the RPC interface and execute arbitrary code please send a bug bounty report.\n",
