  "body": "as seen in dump https://gist.github.com/zelig/003203cd282e191a3476 which happens due to 2 addBlock calls causing invalid PoW\n@fjl comments:\n- Peer.run has already received some error or disconnect and is waiting for Peer.readLoop to exit. \n- The read loop is waiting for the protocol to read a message. \n- The protocol is waiting for Peer.run to accept the disconnect.\n- But second Disconnect won't return because Peer.run is past the point where it waits for a message on Peer.disc\n\nThe general issue is that it's not safe to wait for the protocol without a timeout. The code in peer.go currently assumes that the protocol will always accept messages rather quickly.\nIt will be less of a problem later when we have concurrent message dispatch (RLPx chunked messages).\n\n``` go\ndefault:\n        // it's a subprotocol message\n        proto, err := p.getProto(msg.Code)\n        if err != nil {\n            return fmt.Errorf(\"msg code out of range: %v\", msg.Code)\n        }\n        // ======= this should be a select and exit the loop if the protocol doesn't\n        // accept after 5 seconds.\n        proto.in <- msg\n    }\n```\n\ndisconnect by returning from the protocol loop instead of calling Disconnect will fix the specific issue of stalling the blockpool. @zelig \n",
