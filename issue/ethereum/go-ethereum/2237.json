  "body": "When connected to a domain, everything in the `Roaming` application data folder will be synchronized to the network on logout.  At the moment, this means the entire blockchain will attempt to be copied over the network on logout.  Most domains setup Roaming quotas to prevent user applications from destroying the network, in this case using Geth will cause the the user to be unable to sync their roaming profile on logout which can have significant negative side effects on other applications that depend on roaming profile syncing.\n\nThe correct location for this sort of thing would either be `%PROGRAMDATA%` if you want to allow multiple users on a shared machine share the data (all users will be able to read and write) or `%APPDATA%/Local` if you want only the current user to be able to access the data.  `%PROGRAMDATA%` is a better choice for very large files like this if you have some other security mechanism in place to ensure that file tampering isn't a problem since it means each user doesn't have to download their own entire block chain.  However, if verifying the entire blockchain is not easy/cheap, then `%APPDATA%/Local` is the correct choice.\n\nPerhaps there is some way to have Geth store the blockchain in `%PROGRAMDATA%` and only store some kind of verification hash in `%APPDATA%/Local` that would allow them to quickly identify whether or not the blockchain has been tampered with?\n\nReference: http://superuser.com/a/150014/401511\n\nCode: https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/bzz/common/path.go#L91\n",
