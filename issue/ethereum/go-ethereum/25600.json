  "body": "**Note** This bug report is somewhat speculative, I am not 100% certain that the description here is correct. \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nI think I know why this PR (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/25588) does not make any difference. \r\n![Screenshot 2022-08-25 at 08-44-34 Single Geth - Grafana](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/142290/186594071-4fbbfb52-4272-4471-abe7-8c0c79e8c0ec.png)\r\nThis is the machine charts. A few observations can be made: \r\n\r\n- There is always 128-150 pending (outstanding) requests\r\n- The `Snap trienode handle` times are most commonly in `3-7s` bucket, but quite often up to 20 seconds. \r\n\r\nSo if all our responses have already arrived, handling them will take ~`1280` seconds, or 21 minutes. So once we get to actually handle them, they will have timed out in the snap layer, although they were fine in the p2p packet tracker layer. \r\n\r\nThis is wasteful: we are making requests at a higher rate than we can handle, and thus ignoring responses and refetching stuff. We need to adjust the mechanism so that we do not request more than we can handle -- alternatively, fix the timeout management so that we do not time out deliveries which have already arrived and are just waiting in the queue.

    "body": "In `sync.go,` every time the loop runs, we will assign/issue another trienode heal request. So once an item has ben lying on the queue for ~15 minutes, we issue and send out a new request. It may be served quickly by the remote peer, but will not be handled until after it has timed out, 15-20 minutes later. \r\n\r\nA better model in this case would be to tune down the `128` pending ones down to maybe `10`. The node in question has ~300 peers -- I guess this problem doesn't normally occur unless the node has a lot of peers.\r\n\r\nOBS: this is a consequence of disk IO speed, not network lag.",
