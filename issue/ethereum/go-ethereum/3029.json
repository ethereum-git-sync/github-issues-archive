Then i have applied 'debug.vmodule(\"downloader=6\")' command and created a GIST with the shorted log:\nhttps://gist.github.com/iFA88/3b4ffa9e15c16c34c000d8c5f2bf4f26\n\nI use Geth/v1.5.0-unstable-c8d6efd6/linux/go1.7 on debian Jessie.\n",

    "body": "I am having a very similar issues. I believe it is to do with these attacks. Normally my node runs fine (like no issues for a month), but with these attacks it is even slower than yours. Right now the node is 17 hours behind the network...\n\nFrom the looks of it these attacks are causing \"~50,000 disk fetches needed to process the transaction\" (https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/09/22/transaction-spam-attack-next-steps/). Which is the massive issue for my geth node as it is running in Azure using the persistent network disk which I believe is really slow for many disk read and writes... Still trying out a few things like using the local non-persistent disk, just to see if it helps. If you deleted the data directory and use fast sync I believe you could skip those transactions but if it happens again you will be in the same place... That is what I did in the pervious attack.\n",
