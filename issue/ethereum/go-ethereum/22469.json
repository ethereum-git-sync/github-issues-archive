  "body": "#### System information\r\n\r\nGeth versions: `1.10.1-stable` and `1.9.25-stable`\r\nOS & Version: Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS (5.4.0-54-generic) and macOS Big Sur 11.2.2\r\n\r\n#### Expected behaviour\r\nWhen chain tracing via the Json RPC under 1.9.25-stable, the results of the processed transaction are returned immediately and I can instantly process them further. This does not happen under 1.10.*\r\n\r\n#### Actual behaviour\r\nUnder 1.10.*, the results are no longer immediately returned. It seems geth is regenerating the state snapshots first (?) before returning any result. This is kind of undesired when tracing large chain segments, as it may take hours before returning any result.\r\nAlso, using htop I can observe geth's RAM usage growing while the historical state is regenerated. When the tracing range is large enough (e.g. block 0x0 to block 0xfffff) geth starts taking up my computer's entire memory before having finished state regeneration, and thus my system is becoming unresponsive before any result is returned.\r\n\r\nThis does not happen under version 1.9.25-stable. I can still observe a slight raise in memory usage, but nowhere as fast as in 1.10.1-stable. Results are returned to e.g. netcat immediately and i assume the regenerated states aren't kept in memory(?)\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\r\n* Start geth using e.g.: `./build/bin/geth --rinkeby --maxpeers=0`\r\n* Connect via netcat to UDS socket: `nc -U geth.ipc`\r\n* Issue command e.g. `{\"id\": 1, \"method\": \"debug_subscribe\", \"params\": [\"traceChain\", \"0x0\", \"0xfffff\", {\"tracer\": \"4byteTracer\"}]}` (when using a too small block range you might not notice the difference)\r\n\r\nDoing these steps in both versions will result in the different behaviors described above.\r\n\r\nI am unsure whether or not this is a bug. If this is intended behavior I would be very glad for some help on how to do chaintracing with custom JS tracers for the entire chain in the newest version. Also there seems to be another problem with JS tracers timing out instantly on most transactions, but I think that belongs into another issue... \r\n\r\n",
