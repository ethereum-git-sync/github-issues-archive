Doing something like `geth doctor`  would print out if:\r\n- the disk drive is fast enough\r\n- if peers can discover your node (opened port, etc)\r\n- cpu core perf, if enough cores and bw is enough\r\n- network speed test\r\n\r\nThis is inspired by Flutter, many people had problems running / installing it in the initial releases, and the devs created a beautiful plan called `flutter doctor` that makes sure the users system is good. Later, many companies, like Microsoft (Chromium) adopted this for internal devs too.\r\n\r\n# Implementation\r\n\r\n**Do you have ideas regarding the implementation of this feature?** \r\nI believe there are many go-lang libs for system profiling that we can use, I don't know from the top of my head.\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to implement this feature?** \r\nMaybe ....",

This will help so many users who onboard geth",
