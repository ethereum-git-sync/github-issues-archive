I expect it to get synced in a reasonable time. I tried both with and without `--testnet`\n#### Actual behaviour\n\nThe sync goes fast and than it becomes extremely slow. \nOn testnet I have seen it go very fast to the block ~1.2M (with ~1.5M as head). On public net it went to ~1M (with ~2.2M as head). Actually I think I'm facing two separates problems.\n#### Testnet\n\nOn testnet I can see I'm still going forward, but the speed it proceeds makes me sad. I'm doing roughly 2 blocks/s. \n\n```\n> eth.syncing\n{\n  currentBlock: 1506000,\n  highestBlock: 1567910,\n  knownStates: 0,\n  pulledStates: 0,\n  startingBlock: 1461690\n}\n> net.peerCount\n24\n```\n\nSo, it seems it will complete in ~12 hours which will make it a total of 4 days to download the chain. \n#### Public net\n\nHere as I mentioned before, the sync was very fast until the level of ~1M. After few hours it became really slow and now it's stuck completely:\n\n```\n{\n  currentBlock: 1235819,\n  highestBlock: 2172210,\n  knownStates: 7418,\n  pulledStates: 1041,\n  startingBlock: 1235796\n}\n> net.peerCount\n7\n```\n\nIt doesn't move from here and will likely never finish.\nBelow is tail of my log output:\n\n```\n$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-staging.yml logs --tail 10 -f geth_public \nAttaching to admin_geth_public_1\ngeth_public_1          | I0831 08:24:06.388282 eth/handler.go:295] Peer bf63aae5026da2e6 [eth/63]: timed out DAO fork-check, dropping\ngeth_public_1          | I0831 08:24:06.498048 eth/downloader/downloader.go:274] Unregister failed: peer is not registered\ngeth_public_1          | I0831 08:24:38.644946 eth/downloader/downloader.go:274] Unregister failed: peer is not registered\ngeth_public_1          | I0831 08:24:58.095294 eth/handler.go:295] Peer bf63aae5026da2e6 [eth/63]: timed out DAO fork-check, dropping\ngeth_public_1          | I0831 08:24:58.095445 eth/downloader/downloader.go:274] Unregister failed: peer is not registered\ngeth_public_1          | I0831 08:25:49.934401 eth/downloader/downloader.go:1437] imported 384 state entries in 2m18.780812796s: processed 1041, pending at least 6336\ngeth_public_1          | I0831 08:25:49.940736 eth/handler.go:205] Removal failed: peer is not registered\ngeth_public_1          | I0831 08:25:49.940820 eth/handler.go:205] Removal failed: peer is not registered\ngeth_public_1          | I0831 08:25:49.941125 eth/handler.go:205] Removal failed: peer is not registered\ngeth_public_1          | I0831 08:25:50.351681 core/blockchain.go:751] imported 5 receipt(s) (0 ignored) in 414.177851ms. #1235819 [2ab1b91e… / d6f8f1aa…]\n\n```\n### This I've already tried with no avail\n- I read about problems with possible system clock delay.

What do you think ?\n\n### testnet chain\n\nIt's still proceeding steadly at about 2 blocks/s. I can see no worrying messages in the console. So it seems to work, it's just very slow.\n",

    "body": "Update: I've been investigating the issue and it seems my machine gets ~80% CPU wait. I've the geth nodes configured to keep their data dir on EBS volumes. The default EBS drive has the IOPS limit of 100. Now that I look at iostat I can see the following:\n\n```\n$ iostat -d -c -x\nLinux 3.16.0-4-amd64 (ip-172-31-13-3)   08/31/2016  _x86_64_    (1 CPU)\n\navg-cpu:  %user   %nice %system %iowait  %steal   %idle\n          12.76    0.00    1.18   80.58    3.39    2.09\n\nDevice:         rrqm/s   wrqm/s     r/s     w/s    rkB/s    wkB/s avgrq-sz avgqu-sz   await r_await w_await  svctm  %util\n...\nxvdg              0.50    11.51   64.71   18.22  1862.91  1903.06    90.83     6.84   82.44   33.61  255.88  11.21  92.95\n```\n\n(I removed the drives which are not essential)\n\n`xvdg` is the drive I used as a datadir for testnet, the one which proceeds the sync at the steady pace of about 2 blocks/second. `iostat` shows that at this pace it already uses `82 IOPS (64r + 18w)`. \n\nSumming up, I think the issue is in a way `geth` uses disk operations, instead of using OS caching. \n`iostat` shows that it makes 2-4 times more read than write operations during sync. My got feeling is that it should be something easy to fix by making sure that whatever it needs is available in memory rather to read,re-read and re-re-read all the time.\nI'm not convinced this can be called a bug... it's probably something geth team will want to optimize some day.\nAs for now I guess I will just try to stay patient....\n",

    "body": "Yes, the database trashing is a known issue. Fixing it is not so simple though as we need to completely change the database layout for a lot of things. Part of them have already been done and merged into develop quite some time ago. Part still needs to be done (if we find the time for it). You could try running an instance based on `develop` and see how that performs. (note, you probably don't want to update an existing instance to it now as it will update the database schema, making a downgrade impossible afterwards).\n",

I have their snapshots stored on EBS and hopefully I will never have to re-do the first-sync operation again. \nIf someone stumbles upon the same issue, my advice is to not use EBS for the datadir during first sync. Instead you should use the ephemeral storage (the one physically attached to the machine) and only copy the result to EBS after the first sync is finished. \nI think we can close this issue.\n",

It turns out that `geth` requires _much_ more than that. \nThe solution was to use faster type of storage during the first sync, than stop `geth` and move the folder to the target drive.\nI doubt that you have the same problem  - if you're not a programmer I find it unlikely that you are fiddling with EBS volumes... \n",
