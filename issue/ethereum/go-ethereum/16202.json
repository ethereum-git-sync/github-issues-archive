  "body": "Hi there,\r\n\r\n#### System information\r\n\r\nGeth version: 1.8.1\r\nOS & Version: Windows 10\r\nHardware: Personal laptop with 256GB SSD used for storing the chaindata folder, 16GB RAM and a Pentium i7.\r\n\r\n#### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nDid a clean install of Mist right after the Iceberg update. Resynced from scratch hoping to be all setup after a few hours (it took 3-6 hours with geth 1.7.x, which I did several times because my SSD is also my system disk so I've got only around 100GB left which means I had to do a fresh \"fast\" sync every two weeks).\r\n\r\n#### Actual behaviour\r\n\r\nGeth seems to be unable to switch to --syncmode \"full\". Stop downloading blocks somewhere around 100 blocks before the last block, stop for an hour, start downloading the chain structure, download a dozen new blocks in \"fast\" mode, stop for an hour, Loop.\r\n\r\nSee the attached log file from one of my last runs which lasted 2 days. Hope it will help to find where the problem is.\r\n\r\nIt seems that I get in sync with the network with a some bugs when launching geth from a console forcing --syncmode \"full\" (see attached print screen) but when I reopen Mist I come back into the syncing loop I described above and all the full blocks I downloaded with geth only seem to be gone (see the other attached log below).\r\n\r\nClosing/reopening Mist or geth multiple times was also unsuccessful.\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\r\n\r\nI got no idea but as it seems not everyone is having the same matter, I'll bet it's pretty random.\r\n\r\n#### Backtrace\r\n\r\n[Geth log from a two days try](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/files/1761551/node_old.log)\r\n\r\n![geth_prtscr](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36866679/36715006-a45f69e4-1b94-11e8-9d79-371f161d3c5d.png)\r\n\r\n[Geth log from my latest try](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/files/1761707/node.log)\r\n\r\n",

Looking at your log is seems like you don't connect to anymore than 2-3 peers at a time.\r\n\r\nOnce I changed my firewall settings, my node started syncing MUCH faster. Although now I am still 65 blocks behind the mainnet.\r\n\r\nIn the article for Iceberg's release (https://blog.ethereum.org/2018/02/14/geth-1-8-iceberg%C2%B9/), the author said that they were able to complete a fast sync in ~3 hours using an m4.2xlarge instance. Could you guys (devs) tell me what command line options you used for that test? I am running on similar hardware and my geth node has been 65 blocks behind the mainnet for the past 2 days.",

    "body": "I'm having a very similar issue with 1.8.1-stable on Ubuntu running on AWS. I've tried both restarting geth and letting it pick back up, and blowing away the whole chain and trying fresh - and I've tried both a few times each. My logs always end up eventually looking like [the excerpt in this gist](https://gist.github.com/mikerowehl/d070b220c8baf49b0afe92d90128d1fe). I'm not sure I'm reading that right, but it looks like the number of pending state entries gets down to 0 and then pops back up to a few tens of thousands. There's dropped peer notices in there, but looking at the code it seems like those would just happen whenever a node goes offline. Not something to worry about?\r\n\r\nWhen I'm trying to fast sync I have plenty of peers, but eth.syncing always shows a sync status and the eth.blockNumber is always 0:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> net.peerCount\r\n25\r\n> eth.blockNumber\r\n0\r\n> eth.syncing\r\n{\r\n  currentBlock: 5175777,\r\n  highestBlock: 5175842,\r\n  knownStates: 22952,\r\n  pulledStates: 11345,\r\n  startingBlock: 5175723\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat console output is from right after I had restarted geth, which is why the knownStates and pulledStates values are so low. It has been running for about 7 hours with the numbers up around 92 million, but not finishing. So I tried restarting the process again.\r\n\r\nThis is on a pretty decent AWS machine (t2.xlarge) with a gp2 SSD and 30303 TCP and UDP open to the world. I've seen posts where people say they've used a lot less horsepower to sync, so I assume that's not the problem. But how can I tell?\r\n\r\nI'm able to do a light sync on machines with the same setup and have no issues. But syncmode fast I haven't been able to get to complete yet.",

I was always a few blocks behind it seems with eth.blockNumber staying at 0 similar to @mikerowehl . I feel like this might have to do with the parameters I was using to run geth. Since 1.8 release I've been starting geth with a similar command:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngeth --ipcdisable --verbosity 2 console\r\n```\r\n\r\nI tried just starting geth with all default parameters\r\n\r\n```\r\ngeth\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd I got a synced database with **eth.blockNumber == 5177567** now. I restarted geth with my original parameters and it seems like the issue is solved. I can see that eth.blockNumber is slowly growing and matching public blockchain explorers.\r\n\r\nA temporary workaround for this issue might be to start geth with all the default parameters until you get a fully synced database and restart it with your own parameters once that is done.",

    "body": "So, fast sync works by downloading all the blocks and only verifying the proof-of-work, and then it downloads the state trie separately. The state trie grew enormous in the last year, so downloading that takes a **lot** longer than downloading the blocks.\r\n\r\nThe reason all of you are seeing that geth is stuck, is because it already has all the blocks, but it still busy downloading the state. Unfortunately Ethereum's trie design doesn't allow knowing in advance how much state data there is, we only operate on cryptographic hashes and finish when no more references are missing. This is why we can't show a progress bar.",

We have many customers that are deploying private networks using geth 1.8.1 and are running into this same exact issue - syncing to a network with a few hundred blocks shouldn't take a day. It's transient and doesn't happen on all deployments, but I'd say ~60% of deployments fail to sync with logs that are exactly like the OP.\r\n\r\nIf the solution mentioned above of making sure your firewall settings are set up so that you can connect to 20+ peers is the only way to sync properly, then clearly this won't work for private network models where we very commonly have 3 to 5 nodes running.\r\n\r\nI believe that something was changed in the sync code in 1.8.0 or 1.8.1 that is causing this issue. Our current workaround is locking our deployments to 1.7.2 - this seems to work fine, but obviously we'd like to upgrade when syncing works.",

Next, spin up a new VM, place the non-mining node's enode URL into `~/.geth/static-nodes.json`, and run it with the same options as above. This is a bit contrived because the 4th node will only have one peer, but it should repro. As I said above, the issue is transient, so if it doesn't happen on the first deployment, delete the chaindata folders on the 4th node and try again.",
