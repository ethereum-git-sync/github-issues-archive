  "body": "# Rationale\r\n\r\n - Why should this feature exist?\r\nto all filtering TXs by the From address.\r\n - What are the use-cases?\r\nI want to monitor all failed transactions for a given address. the bloom filter allows filtering by log topic , but I also want to filter by from address. My current implementation uses a subscription to the head and then uses a bloom filter to filter blocks only that contain a given event. then I am interested only in the failed transactions that were created by a given address. Looked through the code, but couldn't find how to get the From address for a given TXs. \r\nHere is the code\r\nhttps://github.com/krasi-georgiev/telliot/blob/profit-tracker/pkg/tracker/profit/profit.go#L339\r\n# Implementation\r\n\r\n - Do you have ideas regarding the implementation of this feature?\r\nYes, just expose the from data with a function\r\n - Are you willing to implement this feature?\r\nYes",
