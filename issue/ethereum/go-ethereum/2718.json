Kept it running, no visible problems.\n\nAll 4 CPUs at 90-100%, 80% of 1.7GB memory used.\n\nNo problems.\n\nThen, I stopped geth with supervisorctl in order to download a large file on my PC.\n\nAfter restarting, it's now only consuming 5-10% CPU and 40% of system memory. AND still working absolutely fine.\n\nSo the 'problem' is this - geth continues to consume large amounts of system resources after completing the initial sync, unless restarted.\n\nIs there any way it can detect it's at 99%+ and 'idle down' on its own?\n",
