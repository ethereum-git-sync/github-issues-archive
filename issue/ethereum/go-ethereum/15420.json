I get an acknowledgement in the logs that the TX has been sent: \r\n`INFO [11-03|15:46:38] Submitted transaction                    fullhash=0xf1adc980e6c720e0d7a13b9680ab43d6e76a78bbe682c1151d04238694eb771b recipient=0x55b0D36c3a605f8420eBf51B56b9561C84554B36`\r\n\r\nAt one point, I wasn't getting the acknowledgement, but noticed I got an error \"The replacement transaction is undervalued\". So I bumped up the gas. Now, I get the TX acknowledgement (above), but never see it logged in etherscan with the sender or receiver. I also notice that the transaction will be pending for around 30 minutes before it eventually vanishes (I'm assuming it gets rejected). I don't know of any way to see the logs of what happened to the tx, so I'm in the dark.\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\r\nSend a party-to-party TX using geth and check etherscan for the result.\r\n\r\n#### Backtrace\r\n\r\n````\r\n[backtrace]\r\n````\r\n",
