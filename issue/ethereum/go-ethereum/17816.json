  "body": "## Current Behavior\r\n\r\nGeth does not currently provide any encryption methods\r\n\r\n## Wanted Behavior\r\n\r\n[EIP 1024](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/1098) describes cross-client encrypt/decrypt methods that enable public key encryption across ethereum clients, for example a sender could encrypt data with their MetaMask wallet and the receiver could decrypt it with geth.  MetaMask has already implemented [this](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-sig-util), Parity version is in progress,  and it would be awesome to have a geth implementation as well. The underlying crypto library being used is NaCl elliptical curve encryption library, the curve being used is curve25519.\r\n\r\nHere is the specification:\r\n\r\n```const nacl = require('tweetnacl')\r\n\r\n/**\r\n* Returns user's public Encryption key derived from privateKey Ethereum key\r\n* @param {Account} receiver - The Ethereum account that will be recieving/decrypting the data\r\n*/\r\nweb3.eth.getEncryptionPublicKey(receiver.address) { /* implementation */ }\r\n\r\n/**\r\n* Encrypts plain data.\r\n* @param {string} encryptionPublicKey - The encryption public key of the receiver \r\n* @param {string} version - A unique string identifying the encryption strategy.\r\n* @param {Bytes} data - The data to encrypt\r\n* @param {Number} padding - The number of characters to left-pad the data with (optional)\r\n* @param {Function} callback - The function to call back when decryption is complete.\r\n*/ \r\nweb3.eth.encrypt(encryptionPublicKey, version, data, padding, callback) { /* implementation */ }\r\n\r\n/**\r\n* Decrypts some encrypted data.\r\n* @param {Account} receiver - The account that will decrypt the message\r\n* @param {Object} encryptedData - Encrypted payload, the data to decrypt\r\n* @param {Function} callback - The function to call back when decryption is complete.\r\n*/\r\nweb3.eth.decrypt = function decrypt (recievier.privatekey, encryptedData, callback) { /* implementation */ }\r\n```\r\n\r\n##Definition of Done\r\n\r\nYou have successfully completed this bounty, when:\r\n\r\n1. A developer can request an accounts encryption public key\r\n2. A developer can encrypt any arbitrary data with using elliptical curve25519\r\n3. A developer can decrypt any arbitrary data encrypted with their accounts encryption public key\r\n4. These methods are compatible with MetaMasks encryption methods listed (here)[https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-sig-util]\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I will try to finish in a week\n\nLearn more [on the Gitcoin Issue Details page](https://gitcoin.co/issue/ethereum/go-ethereum/17816/1340).\n\n\n**2) [cpurta](https://gitcoin.co/profile/cpurta) has applied to start work _(Funders only: [approve worker](https://gitcoin.co/issue/ethereum/go-ethereum/17816/1340?mutate_worker_action=approve&worker=cpurta) | [reject worker](https://gitcoin.co/issue/ethereum/go-ethereum/17816/1340?mutate_worker_action=reject&worker=cpurta))_.**\n\nLooks pretty straight forward in adding the those functions to the ethclient package and writing the tests for those. Looks like Geth currently does not support curve25519 so I am curious if it would be acceptable to find a package to perform the crypto. Or if that will need to be implemented from scratch and added to the crypto package and then called from there. \n\nIf accepted I should be able to have the functionality stubbed out within about a day. Tests can also be stubbed out until the crypto question is addressed. If the elliptic curve crypto needs to be written from scratch that will take me a few days to implement and test and then be used by the new RPC methods. Overall I think that I can have this near completed within a weeks time.\n\nLearn more [on the Gitcoin Issue Details page](https://gitcoin.co/issue/ethereum/go-ethereum/17816/1340).\n\n",

Now, while we have this library sent by the contributor, it is key for us to be able to use it in go-ethereum, as an RPC method.\r\n\r\nFor this task to be completed, it is only needed for the methods to be exposed, and of course write a little test inside geth (that's what the dev team is going to ask for the changes to be included inside `master`)\r\n\r\nExposing methods in geth is not that hard, here is an example in a fork we are working:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/MetaMask/go-ethereum/blob/9eb464b44f059c3b8d1337d7a5f5f8e38697b4b3/eth/api_slicer.go#L44\r\n\r\nAlso. You may want to include your additional dependencies using this guide, so, with the command `make geth`, the builder is able to actually compile the fork: https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Developers'-Guide#managing-vendored-dependencies\r\n",

    "body": "I'll add my note from the PR here too. This feature doesn't really fit with go-ethereum for the following reasons:\r\n\r\nThe proposed (JavaScript) API is a string-based wrapper around NaCl. The Ethereum blockchain doesn't use curve25519 for anything and there is no tooling for this curve in the codebase so far. Supposed we'd offer it anyway, where should it go? The (now closed) PR added it to ethclient where it doesn't belong because ethclient is a client for the RPC API. Should it be on the server side then? Not really because these functions don't need server-side state, it's a pure computation. Would you send your private key to a server only to have it decrypt something with that key for you?\r\n\r\nIf you must have that string-based API in Go the best option is to put it in a separate library. @bakaoh has already done this and should claim that bounty for it. I have no idea how GitCoin works, does he get the bounty if I close this issue?",
