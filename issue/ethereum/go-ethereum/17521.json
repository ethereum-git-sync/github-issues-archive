    "body": "Generally there are a lot more nodes that are firewalled and thus only make outgoing connections, but not incoming ones. Looking at your logs, my hunch is that you don't have port forwarding set up either and thus have a hard time finding peers. If you set up port forwarding in your router to pass port 30303 to your machine (and make sure your Ubuntu doesn't firewall it), you should have a very fact network join time.",
