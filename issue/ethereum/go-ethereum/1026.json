  "body": "Hey.\n\nFor a while been trying to figure out why my geth (v0.9.21.1) has been behaving oddly wrt contract creation. I was able to reproduce the problem. When I get \"Intrinsic gas too low\" error from the console, contract creation doesn't work anymore.\n\nHere is what happens:\n\n1) I send a transaction with a very large contract. It then returns:\n\n```\nError response: Intrinsic gas too low\nInvalid JSON RPC response\n    at InvalidResponse (<anonymous>:-49900:-8845)\n    at send (<anonymous>:-94858:-8845)\n    at sendTransaction (<anonymous>:-87064:-8845)\n    at <anonymous>:1:1\n```\n\n2) Then, trying to send a much, much smaller contract, it returns the address (implying there were no \"gas cost\" issues). It does not return the extra information usually found when a transaction is fully pushed to pending.\n\n```\nI0517 21:21:37.568305   11470 xeth.go:935] Tx(4555727985a25647eb3a6b9e3fb2f87078105d994bfad74ee00122cde32b6c2a) created: e4b9912df349c3ae1982d105e17fc0122da00fd5\n'0xe4b9912df349c3ae1982d105e17fc0122da00fd5'\n```\n\n3) Then, checking eth.pendingTransactions(), it shows nothing. The transaction doesn't happen, and does not even get included in the tx pool.\n\n4) Any future contract creation transactions don't work (haven't tried normal transactions (ie sending funds)).\n\nWhen I turn geth off and back on again, and I skip step 1, and go directly to step 2 (using the smaller contract), it works correctly. I get an address back, and when I then do eth.pendingTransactions(), it is in there. I mine and do a getCode, it works and I can interact with the contract.\n\nSo: there seems to be a problem related to something breaking or halting, causing any new contract creation transactions to never actually work (even though the console makes it look like everything is fine). I'm unsure what is causing this, and if it could be related to other errors as well.\n",
