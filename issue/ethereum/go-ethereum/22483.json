  "body": "In 2017 , when i first stated to mine ETH, i made a wallet in wallet.ethereum.org (i stopped briefly after, i have around 2.2 ETH in that wallet) Now in 2021 i tried to go to wallet.ethereum.org but the website seems to be down... and according to some instruction i have to transfer it to MEW using JSON or Keystore , which i don't have anymore.... The only thing i have is the public address, a username and a password,(key icon) address 0x......... Is there anything i can do with this to access my ETH wallet?\r\n\r\nIs there someone that can guide me through this?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance.\r\n",

On mainnet, it's here: https://etherscan.io/address/0x1ae42d3054b8079ff0694e7b43c230394afc2426 , holding `0.069 Ether` (about $122 USD) . However, it has never had `2.00 ether` on mainnet.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been used on ropsten (testnet) aswell (https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0x1ae42d3054b8079ff0694e7b43c230394afc2426 ), where it currently holds 23 ropsten ether. \r\nFrom what I can tell, it has never been the coinbase of a block (so never received a mining reward). \r\n\r\nI suspect that the screenshot you have is from interacting on the testnet, not from mainnet. \r\n\r\nRegardless, without finding the keystore file, somewhere on your harddrive, those $122 USD are lost :(",
