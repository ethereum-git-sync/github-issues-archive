  "body": "Not sure where I need to ask this question, but please bear with me, now that the scalability topic is a hot topic, I had to research Ethereum especially that everybody is calling it the next big thing and I came across this in the wiki: \n _\"Ethereum is likely to suffer a similar growth pattern, worsened by the fact that there will be many applications on top of the Ethereum blockchain instead of just a currency as is the case with Bitcoin, but ameliorated by the fact that Ethereum full nodes need to store just the state instead of the entire blockchain history\"_\n\nSo what does the last sentence technically means, and how will Ethereum perform now at this state if we get 10 times the amount of transactions that Bitcoin have today ?\n",
