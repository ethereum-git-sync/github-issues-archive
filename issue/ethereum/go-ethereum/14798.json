  "body": "I am developing a service and I would like to allow users to deposit Ethereum as well, however, having worked solely with Bitcoin and its clones, I am a bit lost over here.\r\n\r\nplease forgive my ignorance, I've googled around to see how can someone achieve this in the best way, came across issue #1897, followed other suggestions and the best one was to create a wallet contract and catch logs for tx events, this seemed to be the best approach to cover for bitcoin's listtransactions, the only issue now is that I tried to create this on tesnet, and the fee for creating such wallet contract seems to be high, it did cost me more than [0.07 ETH](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/tx/0x5c344c0de23bdf30cba5f0fbcf3788b679f989e2f078dee83037ecfac76e4c7c).\r\n\r\nnot sure how to solve this at this point, how do exchanges and services handle this? is there any other way to watch for the incoming transactions without having to create contracts and pay such huge fees each time a new user register or ask for a new address?\r\n",
