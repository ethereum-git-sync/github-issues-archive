  "body": "Hy there,\r\n\r\nunfortunately I can't install geth on ubuntu. I followed the steps from the installation section but when I am executing 'sudo apt-get install ethereum' it states that no package with this name can be located. I added ethereum and ethereum-dev repositories via 'sudo -E add-apt-repository ppa:ethereum/ethereum' and 'sudo -E add-apt-repository ppa:ethereum/ethereum-dev'. Then I executed 'sudo apt-get update'. In the list of repositories the two ethereum repositories shows up, but when installing package ethereum can't be located.\r\n\r\nI also tried to re-installing the ca-certficates 'sudo apt-get install --reinstall ca-certificates'. Unfortunatley nothing changed.\r\n\r\nHas anybody an idea, what the problem could be? I would like to install geth via ppa and not downloading and building it.\r\n\r\nMany thanks and greets\r\nPeter",

    "body": "Ah, that's the kind of info that matters indeed ;) The problem is that the PPA only contains i386 and amd64 releases. The Raspberry PI 3B+ is on the lower limit of what is able to reasonably run `geth` (see https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+raspberry for a non-exhaustive list of issues) I'm planning to spend some time in Q3 getting more powerful ARM boards like those at friendlyElec to work, in which case adding it to the PPA would make sense. Until then, it's only going to cause trouble for us maintainers and help exactly zero user.\r\n\r\nIf you still want to try it, don't build on the rpi itself (it probably wouldn't work). You should cross-compile on your desktop machine and then move the standalone binary to your rpi. The instructions to do so are: https://geth.ethereum.org/developers/Cross-compiling-Ethereum and the method is straightforward.\r\n\r\nI'm closing this issue, as no arm binaries will be added to the PPA in the forseeable future.",
