So while faster marshalling could help, removing the overhead helps even more, I have been able to trace the monster txs (almost 500k steps for the larger ones) under 1 GB RAM after commenting out what I did not need, but those were ad-hoc changes.\n\nBetter than JSON-RPC notification would be ways to request just a subset explicitly (cf. https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/2550).\n\nWhen the trace is for human analysis, you can only look at a subset anyway, and the rest can be fetched piecemeal when (and if) needed, provided you have some form of index or summary of the whole trace.\nFor automated analysis (my particular use case), I only look at the trace for some opcodes and depths. So in both cases, having all of the data at once is unnecessary, and the interesting tidbits can be anywhere in the trace.\n\nSo it is probably not as much a streaming problem as it is an \"on demand\" one.\n",

    "body": "In case someone else faces the same problem, for the stack log, the simplest \"fix\" is to change in eth/api.go, formatLogs function, from\n\n`formattedStructLogs[index].Stack[i] = fmt.Sprintf(\"%x\", common.LeftPadBytes(stackValue.Bytes(), 32))`\n\nto \n\n`formattedStructLogs[index].Stack[i] = fmt.Sprintf(\"%x\", stackValue.Bytes())`\n\nthis removes the zero padding in the json for the stack values, which is easy to add back on the client side if you need it, and can drastically helps with json size without losing data.\n\nAnother more minor but still effective change is to concatenante the Op and Error fields, which allows removing the (typically empty) Error field from the json, untangling the concatenation is simple to handle client-side.\n",
