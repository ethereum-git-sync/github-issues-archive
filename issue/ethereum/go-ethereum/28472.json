For a couple of years now, all new Macs have been natively Aarch64-only, with any x86 support via emulation. Therefore, if Geth release binaries are to remain most useful on macOS, there would be some benefit in targeting Apple's now-primary, and presumably in the medium-term future, only platform with supported release builds.",
