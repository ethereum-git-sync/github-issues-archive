  "body": "(This issue is a protocol layer issue, not a geth issue. I hope this is the right repo for it)\n\nLet's call the current account/address scheme \"v1 addresses\", e.g. [0x78ff59159fafb4a337fd158fcf8d9603a7c6f03a](https://www.etherchain.org/account/0x78ff59159fafb4a337fd158fcf8d9603a7c6f03a).\n\nThe v1 address scheme is faulty because it is [missing a checksum](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/3vxhul/eli5_how_do_a_simple_user_work_around_the_no/), and this can cause users to lose money.\n\nI propose that a new v2 address scheme is designed, that is a \"mask\" or translation of v1 addresses, in a way that includes a checksum. Eventually, v1 addresses should be completely deprecated from all Ethereum clients, and the clients should only use v2 addresses (all v1 addresses should be invalid addresses when typed into a client).\n\nInitial proposal for v2 addresses:\n\n> v2addr(v1addr) = Concat(\"E\", v1addr, MD5(v1addr)).\n> // MD5 and not something stronger because there's no cryptographic need here. Any fast hash will do, it doesn't have to be secure.\n\nThere is an easy to compute one to one translation from v1 addresses to v2 and vice versa)\n",
