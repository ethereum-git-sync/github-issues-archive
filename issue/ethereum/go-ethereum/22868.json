(geth was deactivated for 2 weeks, but when it was active before, everything was working fine).\r\n\r\nI didn't do any changes with my query code.\r\nI already tried to use the actual server ip, but that didn't change anything.\r\nI checked port 8545 with \"ufw status\" with the following response: \"8545/tcp (v6) ALLOW Anywhere (v6)\"\r\nChecking the port with sudo ss -tulwn | grep 8545 shows no response. \r\nBut that shouldn't be the problem, since it was working that way before.\r\n\r\nI tried in my server console \"curl https://domainname.com\" which is working. \"curl 127.0.0.1:8545\" did response with Failed to connect. ServerIP:8545 did response with Failed to connect as well.\r\n\r\nWhat could be the problem? Is there some setting i missed to change after the update?",
