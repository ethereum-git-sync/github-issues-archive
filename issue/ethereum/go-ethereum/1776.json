    "body": "I'm confident the scripts I posted offer compelling solutions to close out this issue. The remaining question is what to target, either maximum compatibility back to WinXP SP3 32-bit (Powershell 2) or a more recent Win7 64-bit (Powershell 3).\n\nAlthough the maximum compatibility script will work on all versions of Windows, it does not appear that the 32-bit binary works despite the build not failing. Is it worth preserving compatibility worth it in this case or would it be be better to drop support for non-working builds and target the future?\n\nThe main differences are in supported version of Powershell. PS 3 allows for built-in unzip and downloader, whereas with PS 2, we add \"unzip\" as a dependency and relegate downloads to the .NET CLR (as integrated in Powershell). Both of these are only used for setting up the initial build dependencies. Once satisfied, neither of these issue matter.\n",

I have _not_ tried to build 32-bit on Win7 or higher (if this is even available).\n\nRight now, the most robust script is the second Gist linked at https://gist.github.com/tgerring/79f018954aadfb3f406e. It runs on all supported Windows versions and some that are already EOL'd. My nomination would be to PR it to the build directly until we can concretely say a move to PS3+ makes sense\n",

    "body": "Yeah, I hear you, @tgerring.\n\nI added **We only support 64-bit builds** in many places in the C++ instructions - http://www.ethdocs.org/en/latest/ethereum-clients/cpp-ethereum/index.html#installing-and-building - but I have really been surprised at how many requests for 32-bit support we get.\n\nThis kind of language ...\n\"\nWe only support 64-bit builds.\n\nIt may be possible to get the client working for Windows 32-bit, by building from source and disabling EVMJIT and maybe other features too. We might accept pull-requests to add such support, but we will not put any of our development time into supporting Windows 32-bit builds.\n\"\n\nI guess it boils down to support cost.    If it \"just works\" and we can just run some more automated builds then maybe it's worth considering.    If it's a pain in the arse then sod it.\n\nIn my mind it's much like the profusion of Linux distros.   I would love to just say \"you're on your own\" for all those, but with just a bit more effort we can win some people over, but it's mainly letting them self-support and not hindering them from doing that.   \"Hey!   Maybe you could write a Wiki page for how to build for your distro?\"\n\nMaybe we just need some mechanism for enabling \"Windows/Linux 32-bit people\" to collaborate on supporting this stuff for themselves?    Or not!\n",
