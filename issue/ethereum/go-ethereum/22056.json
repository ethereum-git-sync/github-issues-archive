    "body": "Happened to me when I upgrade to Geth 1.10.1 from 1.9.25 on Ropsten. The 1.9.25 was fully synced at time of doing the operation. \r\n\r\nI first stopped the running 1.9.25 instance. Took a GCP volume snapshot. Created a new container with a new disk created using the snapshot I just took and started the 1.10.1 instance.\r\n\r\nAt launch, Geth 1.1.0.1 took around 10m even before initializing the `IPC` file. While doing this, htop showed heavy disk usage, around 160Mb/s (I don't recall exactly if it was more on the read or the write side). \r\n\r\nAfter ~10m, the node started the `IPC`, connected to the network and synced around 10 blocks, then entered the database compacting stage. This ran for around 5h until I gave up.\r\n\r\nHere the `leveldb.stats` on the 1.9.25 instance\r\n\r\n```\r\n Level |   Tables   |    Size(MB)   |    Time(sec)  |    Read(MB)   |   Write(MB)\r\n-------+------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------\r\n   1   |         50 |      99.27759 |      35.00957 |     814.65889 |     771.45813\r\n   2   |        647 |     999.75740 |      46.79872 |    1487.34292 |    1485.75268\r\n   3   |       4844 |    9097.79491 |     325.22367 |    5466.02774 |    4459.89624\r\n   4   |        539 |     400.50786 |       0.00000 |       0.00000 |       0.00000\r\n   5   |      68207 |  136884.92513 |       0.00000 |       0.00000 |       0.00000\r\n-------+------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------\r\n Total |      74287 |  147482.26288 |     407.03196 |    7768.02954 |    6717.10706\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd here the same on the 1.10.1 after running 5 hours (in fact, after having forced kill it):\r\n\r\n```\r\n Level |   Tables   |    Size(MB)   |    Time(sec)  |    Read(MB)   |   Write(MB)\r\n-------+------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------\r\n   0   |      74352 |  148558.54873 |       0.00000 |       0.00000 |       0.00000\r\n-------+------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------\r\n Total |      74352 |  148558.54873 |       0.00000 |       0.00000 |       0.00000\r\n```\r\n \r\nSeems it was trying to compact this gigantic amount of L0 tables. The `LOG` file in the `chaindata` folder seems to agree:\r\n \r\n```\r\ncat LOG | grep com\r\n23:06:01.461484 table@compaction L0·74352 -> L1·0 S·145GiB Q·1243574076\r\n```\r\n \r\n And for some level of estimation of the time it would have take:\r\n \r\n ```\r\ncat LOG | grep com\r\n23:06:01.461484 table@compaction L0·74352 -> L1·0 S·145GiB Q·1243574076\r\n23:08:28.748009 table@build created L1@8383020 N·9976 S·2MiB \"\\x00\\x00\\x00..'\\xc6P,v268503960\":\"\\x00\\x01\\x10..\\x86t\\xd9,v591541816\"\r\n...\r\n04:27:32.131617 table@build created L1@8384256 N·9834 S·2MiB\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo from my (limited) understanding of levedb, it compacted 1236 tables (8384256 - 8383020) in ~5h so ~247 tables/h and I imagine probably 12 days (74532 / 247 / 24 ~= 12). The compaction read throughput it really really low, like 150Kb/s to 300Kb/s in both read & write. A single CPU core was maxed out at 100% during the whole time.\r\n\r\nNow, why I turned having that amount of L0 tables, I have no idea. No sure what happened to cause this. I'll redo a round of restore + restart to see if I can avoid the switch to all L0 tables.\r\n\r\nI upgrade other nodes (4 in totals) in-place (i.e. without a volume snapshot + new disk) correctly without problems, not sure what volume snapshot part caused this.",

I now early stopped the Geth process, then ran `geth db stats`, which waited around ~8 minutes before returning a result.\r\n\r\nI better monitored the disk usage this time, I can say the bulk of I/O was read operation around 360MB/s (which probably tops the cloud provider disk throughput) with some infrequent write operations but with high peaks.\r\n\r\nThe problem is probably on our side though, I think at least, something must have changed.

[edit] It looks like it could be exacerbated by failure to shut down properly.  My ethereum folder is on a RAID 6 with only 4/5 disks present; the filesystem is ext4 and is mounted with journal_data .  Replaying the journal took a very long time on powerup.  My system is a raspberry pi running ubuntu amd64 with only 3.3G of userspace ram and 8G of microsd swap.\r\n\r\nI tried downgrading from 1.10.4 to 1.10.1 and this did not resolve the issue.\r\n\r\nMy node was still syncing when the power failure happened.  It was doing a normal sync, after previously trying it for a day or two doing a fast sync.  It was running into occasional crashes and I had it on a scripted loop to auto-reboot.",

I used to `nohup` and `&` to run the process in the background and exit my ssh connection without it stopping. I was monitoring it with `htop`, and there was no process running related to geth, and barely any processor power was being consumed. So I concluded it probably stopped. Restarted and now it seems to be humming along again.",
