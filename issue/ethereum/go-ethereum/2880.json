    "body": "@fjl that sounds very good. \n\nI'm testing out the Go bindings and in the example [here](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Native-DApps:-Go-bindings-to-Ethereum-contracts#deploying-contracts-to-ethereum) there seems to be some races to be aware of due to the sleep:\n\n```\naddress, tx, token, err := DeployToken(auth, backends.NewRPCBackend(conn), new(big.Int), \"Contracts in Go!!!\", 0, \"Go!\")\nif err != nil {\n    log.Fatalf(\"Failed to deploy new token contract: %v\", err)\n}\nfmt.Printf(\"Contract pending deploy: 0x%x\\n\", address)\nfmt.Printf(\"Transaction waiting to be mined: 0x%x\\n\\n\", tx.Hash())\n\n// Don't even wait, check its presence in the local pending state\ntime.Sleep(250 * time.Millisecond) // Allow it to be processed by the local node :P\n\nname, err := token.Name(&bind.CallOpts{Pending: true})\n```\n\nI'm doing two transactions from the same account after each other and right now the nonce is the same for both which means once tx will be invalid once the other is mined.\n\nHow will the concurrency work after the change to use the transaction pool? Will multiple transactions from the same account increment the nonce without any tricks with sleep etc.?\n\nAlso when is this change planned to hit develop?\n",

    "body": "OK, thanks @fjl.\n\nI think the Go bindings are really cool and was also wondering a bit how they were meant to be used in various situations e.g.:\n1. single account calling multiple functions on a single contract (resulting in transactions)\n2. single account calling multiple contracts (resulting in transactions)\n\nIn addition, the two above could be done concurrently from e.g. different goroutines. As the underlying mechanism from the calling go code right now calls out to the backend over RPC to get the transaction count or later the tx pool nonce there is a race. Hence, I assume concurrent transactions for the same account is not supported. Right?\n\nHowever, for 1 & 2 it would be possible to keep track of the nonce in the client code, maybe in the TransactOpts by the underlying backend? Or something along those lines so that a caller using the same account would automatically get the nonce incremented without a need to ask over RPC. This opens of course up other points such as keeping the local value in sync. Has this been thought about? I'd be interested to understand what's been considered. \n",

    "body": "HI All\r\n\r\nAs an update. My queuing strategy broke down when sending large number of transactions at a time (~2000 at once). \r\n\r\nI don't program in go, but it sounds like I am going to have to break out the compiler and try and fix this issue myself. I have to say, as a professional developer of 20 years experience, it is extremely poor form of the maintainers of geth to leave this issue unresolved. It shows they are not serious about Ethereum becoming a serious, business grade platform. \r\n\r\nRegards\r\n\r\nGavin :)",
