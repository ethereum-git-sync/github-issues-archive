After upgrading both to geth 1.8.9 finally the addPeer command seems to work so that they know each other (see issue #16781)\r\nI would just assume, that if a node does not get any updates from an external node, it would a least get all available blocks from the other local node. Nevertheless I observed just within the first hour of upgrading and restarting both nodes, that once one node was even 30 blocks behind the other one.\r\n\r\n#### Backtrace\r\n\r\n````\r\n[backtrace]\r\n````\r\n",
