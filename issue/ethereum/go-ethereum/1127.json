    "body": "Currently the network fell into a million little pieces, that each isolated itself from everyone else. Most probably the only way to reboot it is to have enough peers find each other. Even then those that won't update (most of the current network) will keep screwing up the updated nodes. Eventually it will tilt and the old ones will phase out, but we need more fresh nodes in the system. The boot nodes are syncing but they had to restart from scratch due to the fork and will take a bit more until they catch up. Just please keep your node running :) With the above PR fix :)\n",

Then my chain lags behind and doesn't get updated for 50 or so blocks, but eventually does get sync according to data on stats.ethdev.com.\n\nI will turn on a few more nodes with the above PR fix to help smooth out the network.\n",

    "body": "The reason you get blocks in chunks is because eth has two ways to distribute blocks: download from someone (this one runs when a new peer connects to you, or otherwise every 10 sec as a sanity check); or receive it as a broadcast from one of your neighbors. However since you're broadcasting a new block to only sqrt of your peers, if almost everyone is a bad peer, they'll just act as black holes. And thus you need to wait either until you get luck and receive the block (by which time there will probably be a gap in your chain so you too drop it). Downloading can again be screwed up if you try to pull from an invalid node as you have to pull a hash chain and then detect the issue and drop the peer (then the next bad peer, next bat peer, etc).\n\nThis is the reason that if there are many more bad peers than good peers, then your node has a very tough time finding someone with valid data.\n",

Just for the sake of completeness, the issue was if a bad peer was detected, my code called a `removePeer` method, thinking it would disconnect said node. However that function only ignored the peer, not disconnected, so it screwed up my downloader logic which assumed that it will have to reconnect if it wants to talk to us again.\n",
