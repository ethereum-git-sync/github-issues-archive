  "body": "What I did is make an application that signs transactions offline then sends them via sendRawTransaction, everything works great besides that I have to trick geth each time by storing a dummy wallet in the keystore folder as UTC--time--address. If I dont I get the \"account does not exist or balance too low\" error. For the moment, I got past this with this dummy file trick, but I wish sendRawTransaction wouldn't check if the wallets exists in your keystore because it might just someone else's wallet and I can act as a gateway.\n\nIf you dont mind, I can even make it myself and make a pull request regarding this if it's cool.\n\nAndi.\n",
