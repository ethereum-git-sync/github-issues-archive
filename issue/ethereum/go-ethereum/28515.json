  "body": "**Background:** My assignment involves deploying a private Ethereum chain with three nodes, utilizing the Clique consensus algorithm. The three nodes also serve as validators responsible for signing. I've created three virtual instances on GCE, set up three nodes using Geth, and managed node passwords with Clef. The addresses of these three nodes are recorded in genesis.json, appointed as validators, and assigned a certain amount of tokens.\r\n\r\nHowever, I made a mistake when creating the second node, resulting in the loss of the second node's password. Consequently, the second node is unable to perform its signing duties.\r\n\r\n**Questions:**\r\n\r\n1. Can I continue to seal blocks with only two signers? (I've attempted this, and it seems not possible. Nodes 1 and 3 both inform me that they need to wait for other nodes. My understanding is that, based on the Clique algorithm, at least three nodes are required to start sealing new blocks.)\r\n\r\n2. Can I create a new node and use `clique.propose(address, auth)` to grant the new node signing permissions, allowing the blockchain to seal new blocks? (When attempting to add a new node to the chain with two existing nodes, I encountered the following issue.)\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   WARN [11-12|21:04:40.719] Post-merge network, but no beacon client seen. Please launch one to follow the chain!\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n3. This is an unrelated question, but I would appreciate your help. While reviewing the documentation, I found the following command:\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   geth --datadir ./ddir --signer ./clef/clef.ipc --mine\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   If I execute it directly, I get the following error:\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   ERROR[11-12|21:11:34.675] Cannot start mining without etherbase    err=\"etherbase must be explicitly specified\"\r\n   Fatal: Failed to start mining: etherbase missing: etherbase must be explicitly specified\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   This confuses me because the POA algorithm doesn't require mining. Should I add an `etherbase` or just remove `--mine`? What is the difference between the two?\r\n\r\n",
