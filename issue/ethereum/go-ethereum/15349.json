My txpool contains transactions with nonces from 19422 through 19934. Calls to `PendingNonceAt` should return 19935. In the javascript console, calls to `eth.getTransactionCount(address, 'pending')` should return 19935.\r\n\r\n#### Actual behaviour\r\n\r\n`PendingNonceAt` and `eth.getTransactionCount` are both returning 19422.\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\r\n\r\nI'm submitting nearly 5000 transactions as quickly as possible while not mining. For awhile `PendingNonceAt` and `eth.getTransactionCount(address, 'pending')` continue to return the expected nonce values but seemingly randomly they will change behavior. I can't determine exactly what triggers the behavior but it appears to be happening quite often in my tests once a \"large\" number of transactions have collected in txpool (large meaning at least 500 but sometimes it'll work as expected until ~2000 or more transactions are pending).\r\n\r\nResuming mining will eventually straighten things out but stopping mining again can recreate the behavior.\r\n\r\n#### Backtrace\r\n\r\nNo error is thrown\r\n",
