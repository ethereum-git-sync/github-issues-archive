  "body": "Our UPnP lookups currently only query potential devices. However since we query a broadcast address and devices reply from physical addresses, OS firewalls can block out the replies causing UPnP to fail. By listening in on the UPnP multicast streams ourselves too we can actually discover devices based on their periodic (20s) announcements, and then can communicate directly without being blocked by the firewall.\n\n``` go\nfunc main() {\n    srv, reg := ssdp.NewServerAndRegistry()\n\n    update := make(chan ssdp.Update)\n    reg.AddListener(update)\n    go srv.ListenAndServe()\n\n    for {\n        event := <-update\n        if event.Entry.NT == internetgateway1.URN_WANConnectionDevice_1 {\n            fmt.Println(reg.GetService(internetgateway1.URN_WANConnectionDevice_1))\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNot sure yet how complicated implementing this is as we need to rework the NAT/discovery a bit, hence the memo, not to forget this.\n",
