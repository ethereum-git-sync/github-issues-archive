  "body": "hello, why my wallet on web shows main account, the default is the account of the index 0,but\r\nwhy I  geth account new , there is not main account, and the address is equal with each other,\r\nI want to create 100 new address, and when an address received the eth coins, can auto-move the main address or a constant address, but it can't cost gas.  because I found when I have to many addresses, and others send coins to the addresses, I found that it is difficult to administrate, and transfer to one address, it will cost much gas, for exmaple, 50000 * 0.0005 ETH/per = 25 ETH/per. Thank you ",
