    "body": "Hi, Thanks Karalabe!\n\nI am going to close this...\n\nI decided against setting up a private network and decided to fallback to using the --testnet flag. The issue of syncing blockchains between nodes for a private network I thought might add another communications layer complexity or security vulnerability...\n\nHowever, my steps for going about blockchain exportation was through using the IPC socket via a node.js application:\n\nThe admin.exportChain('./blockchain.bin') method was used to export the chain; \n\nFrom their the nodes fetched the file from an http endpoint => /api/blockchain/export;\n\nThe exported blockchain file was then imported using the Ethereum JS console command admin.importChain('./blockchain.bin');\n\nThe block would throw the error at block number where the exported blockchain file ended; throwing invalid block.\n\nIf someone is looking for help on this later they might try geth export <file> 0 (n-1 block number)\n\nBut I have not tested this.\n\nThanks!\n",
