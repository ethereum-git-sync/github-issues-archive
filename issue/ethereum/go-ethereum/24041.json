  "body": "There are TODOs in all the call related implementations, like this: https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/core/vm/instructions.go#L583-L589. It is memory/speed optimisation for the 0-value case. \r\n\r\nBased on my understanding the reason is that the code in `core/vm/evm.go` relies on `big.Int`. Would it be a large change moving that to `uint256.Int`?\r\n\r\n*Update:* Indeed that would be a big change. Either the conversion can be shifted to `core/vm/evm.go`, or a total overhaul would include changing `StateDB` and the tracer too. This sounds like a large effort, only worth if the speed difference between `big.Int` and `uint256.Int` is significant enough.",
