  "body": "Hi. I, like many folks, am new to ethereum and geth usage, so take this with a grain of salt. However, I think the contract tutorial (which has been fairly helpful) is out of date. When I tried to follow the instructions to the letter, for instance, inputting this to the console:\n\nvar greeterSource = 'contract mortal { address owner; function mortal() { owner = msg.sender; } function kill() { if (msg.sender == owner) suicide(owner); } } contract greeter is mortal { string greeting; function greeter(string _greeting) public { greeting = _greeting; } function greet() constant returns (string) { return greeting; } }'\n\nI would always get:\n\n\"undefined\"\n\nEven \"var x = 1;\" would return \"undefined\". \n\nAfter scratching my head for a while, I removed the \"var\" portion of each command and it all worked. I'm not sure why this would be the case or what changed since the docs were written, but it would appear they need to be updated.\n\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Contract-Tutorial\n",

(I just wanted to point out to that you can test in Chrome and see that it has a consistent result there too.)\n\nWay too much discussion on the matter: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22844840/why-does-javascript-variable-declaration-at-console-results-in-undefined-being#answer-22844864\n(tl;dr: because ECMA says so)\n",
