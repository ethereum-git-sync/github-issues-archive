    "body": "For the record, the reason Go passes bcJS_API_Test.json is due to https://github.com/ethereum/tests/wiki/Blockchain-Tests-II specifying\n\n```\nIf the client concludes that the block is invalid, it should verify that no blockHeader, transactions or uncleHeaders object is present in the test. The client is expected to iterate through the list of blocks and ignore invalid blocks.\n```\n\nGo fails parsing of the block RLP because the RLP is missing, thus it concludes the block is invalid, and checks for existence of blockheader field, which is missing. It then concludes that the block parsing is expected to fail, and considers the test successful.\n\nThis type of behavior can be avoided by directly specifying the expected test outcome with a finite set of results, e.g. \"result\" : \"rlp_parsing_fail\" instead of using presence of fields as the indicator. That would also make it much easier to see at a glance what the expected outcome of the test is.\n",
