  "body": "Hi. I create my own mining pool with geth. For getting of work i use RPC method getWork. Before getting work i start miner with `miner.start(0)`, first geth generates DAG files and after i can take a new work. But Geth miner in this working threads configuration about once every 2 seconds writes in console `Commit new mining work` and `getWork` received to me new work asset(new POW-hash), but it useless for me, cause it receives me new mining work that overwriting the already valid work for current block round.\r\n\r\nHow can i stop generating a new mining job for current block round?\r\n",
