It was fixed in 1.14.2.\r\n\r\nLooks like we are running go 1.13.8:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# geth version\r\nGeth\r\nVersion: 1.9.12-stable\r\nGit Commit: b6f1c8dcc058a936955eb8e5766e2962218924bc\r\nGit Commit Date: 20200316\r\nArchitecture: amd64\r\nProtocol Versions: [65 64 63]\r\nGo Version: go1.13.8\r\nOperating System: linux\r\nGOPATH=\r\nGOROOT=/home/travis/.gimme/versions/go1.13.8.linux.amd64\r\n```\r\n> Another thing that could help, is when your node enters into this strange high memory use, dangerously close to being killed, please run a `debug.stacks()` from a Geth console.
