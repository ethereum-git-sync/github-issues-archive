  "body": "We track our archive node's gasPrice with a 5 minute interval, and today's spike hit 500 gwei and is staying there...\r\n\r\nLooking at the trajectory and speed at which it was increasing, it was much faster than any of the other previous gas price jumps with the DeFi markets recently.\r\n\r\nHaving the per-5-minute job suddenly stop at 500 gwei, and return exactly 500 gwei each time for the past 3.5 hours is unusual.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ geth --verbosity 0 attach --exec eth.gasPrice\r\n500000000000\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I figured I would ask the topic question before making an official bug report.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time.",
