  "body": "# Rationale\r\n\r\nWhy should this feature exist?\r\nMore and more people are getting scammed this way. They see the scam tokens, they want to remove it the from the wallet and when doing so they accept the contract without even noticing and get their wallets drained.\r\n\r\nWhat are the use-cases?\r\nMain use cases is to “keep your wallets clean” without interacting with token contracts.\r\n# Implementation\r\n\r\nDo you have ideas regarding the implementation of this feature?\r\nImplementing should be hard, we need to bypass contract approval only if we decide to directly burn said tokens by sending them to null address. So, it shouldn’t affect anything and is more like a “opt out” feature.\r\n\r\nAre you willing to implement this feature?\r\nI would if I could, I’m not a programer, I don’t know how to code. i’m rising awareness as this seems to be a huge problem nowadays.",
