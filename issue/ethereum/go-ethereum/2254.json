  "body": "This is a proposal for a fundamental API change in package p2p. \n\nThe API for protocol (\"eth\", \"shh\", ...) implementations is vaguely similar to the net/http server API. Protocols are registered to the server and provide a callback function for new sessions. The server drives connectivity without any input from protocols and launches protocol sessions in fresh goroutines after the connection has made it through the handshake.\n\nThis approach works well enough for protocols that don't care about their peer set, but can be a show stopper in other cases. The connectivity required by \"bzz\", \"les\" cannot be implemented in this model,\nthey need:\n- Node discovery handled by subprotocols e.g.\n  - \"bzz\" wants to connect to nodes in its Kademlia table\n  - \"les\" wants to connect light clients to full nodes, which are registered under a topic hash in discovery.\n- Listen-only, Dial-only protocols\n- Access to RLPx discovery tables, which are currently hidden within package p2p internals.\n  - required for topic lookups\n- Separate optimal peer counts\n  - \"bzz\" wants a specific number of peers\n## Proposed API\n\nInstead of registering protocols with `Server`, it is rechristened `Network` and functions like a socket.\n\n``` go\npackage p2p\n\ntype Network struct {\n    *discover.Table\n    ...\n}\n\ntype Protocol struct {\n    Name   string\n    Version uint\n    Length int // maximum message code, to be removed after RLPx v5\n}\n\n\ntype Listener interface {\n    Accept() (Session, error)\n    Close() error\n}\n\ntype Session interface {\n    MsgReadWriter\n    Close() error\n\n    Node() discover.Node\n    RemoteAddr() net.Addr\n    LocalAddr() net.Addr\n}\n\nfunc (*p2p.Network) Listen(p Protocol) (Listener, error) { ... }\nfunc (*p2p.Network) Dial(p Protocol, n *discover.Node) (Session, error) { ... }\n```\n\nProtocols no longer need to be registered before the server is started.\nInstead, each procotol can receive connections by invoking `Listen` once, then\nwaiting for connections by calling `Accept` on the listener in a loop.\nWhen the listener is closed, the protocol will no longer be offered to other nodes\nbut existing sessions stay established.\n\nIf a protocol wants to dial a particular node, it can do so through `Dial`.\nThe connection will be attempted and the session for that particular node returned\nif the attempt is successful. If the dialed node speaks other protocols for which `Listen`\nwas invoked previously, the corresponding listeners will also output this connection (except\nfor the dialing protocols own listener of course).\n\nThe new API requires that protocols keep track of the `p2p.Network` instance, otherwise they\ncannot dial. In order to keep protocol implementations testable, a mock implementation \nof `Network`, `Listener` and `Session` will be provided in package p2ptest. There will also be a few\nnew helper functions in package p2p implementing the random connectivity used by \"eth\" and \"shh\".\n",

    "body": "what immediately comes to mind is what happens when I close the session exactly. \nThe protocols often make assumptions that this means  'disconnect' please confirm it means exactly that. \n\nHowever, as discussed previously protocol-speficic session management is better be supported on devp2p level. In other words we should have a way to close a protocol session without either closing the listener for the entire protocol or disconnecting the peer network session.  I think clarifying this would be very important. \n\nI dont remember  what happens now if we receive msgs with protocol offsets not allowed as per the intersection of the two peers' protocol caps. If we just ignore them, then we could in theory just have a per-peer dymanic caps setting. But even then protocols would be prudent to implement their specific disconnect messages to let their peers know why there is no longer business. \nBut here I think it is better to delegate managing this to devp2p. My proposal is that Close() takes a disconnect reason, standard devp2p-level disconnect reasons will cause peer disconnect, while if the reason implements ProtocolLevelDisconnectReason (an error interface protocols implement) than it just causes the protocol connection to shut down. The next question is how peers correctly communicate this.\n\nThis would actually require an explicit change in devp2p, namely allowing a field with subprotocol error that encodes which protocol closes its session. Technically it is backwards compatible with peers who would just sadly disconnect the network session if they receive a subprotocol error. \nThis relates to the other issue. That subprotocol errors are not properly detailed, they are under the same code, so protocol level communication about the disconnect reason is either not done or need to be reimplemented at the protocol level. Therefore it would be great to allow types of subprotocol errors. One way to do this is to allow yet another field, but it is not necessary if higher not used codes are interpreted by the protocol (which is not encoded).\n\nAnother way to do this is to allow repeated devp2p handshakes. This means if i close a protocol session only, devp2p would renegotiate a handshake with the new proto caps. this has the advantage that it is only a semantic change in devp2p and backward compatible with the old versions who would simply close the network session upon this event (correct old behaviour). \n\nI dont mind if this will only be in version 2, \nmy 2 wei, let me know what you think\n",
