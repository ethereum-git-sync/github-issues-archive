I have implemented an EVM-to-eWASM bytecode translator that can generate eWASM smart contracts from EVM bytecode directly with correctness. Developers can use the most of EVM infrastructures to develop and interact the eWASM contracts, e.g., Web3. \r\nCheck [https://github.com/Kenun99/ethsema](https://github.com/Kenun99/ethsema) for more details. \r\nCurrently, the eWASM fork of go-ethereum is out-of-date. It is important for Ethereum2.0 to develop a new eWASM client.  \r\n\r\n\r\n**Q: What are the use-cases?**\r\nRun eWASM smart contracts.\r\nWe can integrate EthSema (https://github.com/Kenun99/ethsema) to convert EVM smart contract to eWASM just-in-time and execute eWASM bytecode.\r\n\r\n# Implementation\r\n\r\n**Q:Do you have ideas regarding the implementation of this feature?**\r\nA:We need to make go-ethereum to provide a new virtual machine to execute smart contracts. \r\n\r\n**Q:Are you willing to implement this feature?**\r\nA:Probably.",

    "body": "> It is important for Ethereum2.0 to develop a new eWASM client.\r\n\r\nEwasm is not part of the official roadmap for Eth2. The last discussions on that topic revolved around the idea of using ewasm for the other shards. But since then the roadmap has changed and those other shards which are going to be introduced in phase1 are kept data-only, no execution. Closing the issue for now. It can be re-opened if at some point execution shards were back on the table for eth2.",
