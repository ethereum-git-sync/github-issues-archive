    "body": "The closest way to do that is to sync `syncmode=full` from genesis. Once you reach `8M`, you need to stop the node, and then use `gcmode=archive`. That will make it so that you will prune most of the data up to 8M, but from 8M onwards you will have every state. \r\n\r\nIt is theoretically possible to do a snap-sync to block 8M, but it would require that you modify geth to target a particular block (and not move the pivot along the way), and it would also require that you find an archive node which has that state available, which is very _very_ unlikely.
