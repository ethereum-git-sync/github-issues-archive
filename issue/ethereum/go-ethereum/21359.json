    "body": "Usually in ethereum mainnet, the average mining time is around 15s. But during this \"LONG\"'\r\nprocedure, lots of new transactions with higher gas price will arrive but they have to wait\r\na few seconds to be included even the price is higher than the txs in the mining block.\r\n\r\nSo we have this idea to re-create the mining block with configured interval(`--miner.recommit`).\r\nIn this way, we can always try to fill the mining block with the highest price txs.\r\n\r\nThe upside is quite obvious\r\n- the mining pool can get a higher revenue\r\n- it's fairer for users who send the high price transaction\r\n- it's basically no overhead for switching the mining block in the miner side\r\n\r\nThe default interval is 3 seconds. You can choose the value by yourself. \r\n",
