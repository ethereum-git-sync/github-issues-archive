  "body": "Apologies in advance as this is not a bug report but rather a protocol question - I have been unable to get an answer for this using other usual channels so I'm out of ideas.\r\n\r\nPéter Szilágyi, in his talk in Taipei, claims that totalDifficulty can be spoofed:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=575&v=qJA6J0mP73w\r\n\r\nHow is that possible? Can the variable only be verified if all block headers are downloaded from the spoofed chain and would that produce a fraud proof?\r\n\r\nFor completion, the same question on Stack Exchange:\r\nhttps://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/60860/spoofing-of-totaldifficulty-variable\r\n\r\n@karalabe - maybe jump straight to the source :)\r\n",
