  "body": "Hi there,\r\n\r\nOur uncle rate is around 10%, much higher than the overall average 5%.\r\nThe main mining node is running on a VM with 8C 32G RAM, 1T Local SSD with 147510 IOPS, 10M bandwidth.\r\nWe have several synced nodes running all over the world connecting to the main node as static nodes. Most of them are running on VM with 2C 8G, but just 'cloud disk', a little better than HDD though.\r\n\r\nThe Geth is the newest version 1.9.20. Command line I use is:\r\n./geth --datadir \"dir-to-localSSD\" --ethash.dagdir \"dir-to-localSSD\"  --syncmode \"fast\" --cache=16384 --mine --miner.threads 0 --http -http.addr 0.0.0.0 -http.port xxxx --http.api eth,web3,personal,net --maxpeers 80 -miner.etherbase \"0x1234567890\" --miner.recommit 6s --miner.extradata \"ABC\"\r\n\r\nWe have been working on this for months, but, really frustrated, no much progress for now. \r\nI know issues here are mostly for bugs, but I got no answer somewhere else such as Discord. \r\n\r\nPlease share some experience, thanks in advance.\r\n",
