  "body": "# Rationale\r\n\r\nHello team,\r\n\r\nFirst, a big thank you for this great work, you rock. I was wondering whether you'd like to appreciate [GitHub CodeQL code scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/about-code-scanning) for this repository. This is free for public repository and can be useful to detect vulnerabilities in the code. \r\n\r\nAs an example, I have forked the repo, enabled code scanning and found about 12 medium-to-high vulnerability in the whole C/Javascript/Go codebase. Of course, these vulnerabilities should be reviewed by security specialist to ensure they are not false-positive, but we never know!\r\n\r\nI can share more details about these findings in private if needed.\r\n\r\nI'm working at GitHub so I would be happy to help you if you're interested, it's pretty quick to setup and it would improve the overall security level of geth. \r\n\r\n# Implementation\r\n\r\nCode scanning must be enabled by a repo admin in the repo settings.\r\n\r\nThen, a GitHub Actions workflow file must be created for CodeQL, e.g. one like that:\r\n\r\n```\r\nname: \"CodeQL\"\r\n\r\non:\r\n  push:\r\n    branches: [ \"master\" ]\r\n  pull_request:\r\n    # The branches below must be a subset of the branches above\r\n    branches: [ \"master\" ]\r\n  schedule:\r\n    - cron: '43 7 * * 5'\r\n  workflow_dispatch:\r\n\r\njobs:\r\n  analyze:\r\n    name: Analyze\r\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\r\n    permissions:\r\n      actions: read\r\n      contents: read\r\n      security-events: write\r\n\r\n    strategy:\r\n      fail-fast: false\r\n      matrix:\r\n        language: [ 'c', 'go', 'javascript' ]\r\n\r\n    steps:\r\n    - name: Checkout repository\r\n      uses: actions/checkout@v3\r\n\r\n    # Initializes the CodeQL tools for scanning.\r\n    - name: Initialize CodeQL\r\n      uses: github/codeql-action/init@v2\r\n      with:\r\n        languages: ${{ matrix.language }}\r\n        # queries: security-extended,security-and-quality\r\n\r\n    # Autobuild attempts to build any compiled languages  (C/C++, C#, Go, or Java).\r\n    # If this step fails, then you should remove it and run the build manually (see below)\r\n    - name: Autobuild\r\n      uses: github/codeql-action/autobuild@v2\r\n\r\n    - name: Perform CodeQL Analysis\r\n      uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v2\r\n      with:\r\n        category: \"/language:${{matrix.language}}\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe could further secure the development lifecycle by setting this workflow as a required check in the branch protection rules of your main branch.",

I believe CodeQL is great and less prone to false-positives than some other industry-leading solutions, however it's impossible to guarantee it will never produce false-positives. \r\n\r\nI've just invited you to be a collaborator on my fork, where you'll be able to see the security alerts so you can have a better idea.",
