  "body": "## Summary\r\n\r\nWhen downloading geth via [the downloads page](https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads), the link to download \"FOR LINUX\" makes the assumption that you must mean linux-amd64.\r\n\r\nThis kinda implies that the only way to run geth on Linux is on amd64. While I acknowledge that further down the page there are options to download for other chipsets, this implication does have some effect.\r\n\r\n## Proposed solution\r\n\r\nChange it so it says \"FOR LINUX AMD64\"\r\n\r\nThis can do a tiny amount to begin to raise awareness of alternatives to amd64, such as arm64 and potentially RISC-V one day, as we seek to evolve Ethereum towards a more open hardware stack.",
