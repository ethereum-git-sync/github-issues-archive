  "body": "Hi, sorry this may be a dumb question but i need to be sure before i mess things up.\r\n\r\nI have a bare metal server with virtualization software. I made a VM and it's running my geth node. I wanted to make another VM so i can sync a backup node since i have plenty of space, memory and CPU, but i know the critical thing for running the node is the disk writing speed, I have 6GB/s SSD on RAID 10, now the dumb question... if I run the second node even that it's on a separate VM, it's in the same physical server... will the writing speed maintain 6GB/s for both nodes or would I be reducing like 3GB/s for each node?\r\n",
