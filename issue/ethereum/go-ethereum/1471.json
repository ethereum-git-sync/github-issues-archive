  "body": "Steps: \n- Use Geth to mine (with Ethminers)\n- Wait till everything is working nicely\n- Pull ethernet for around 1m\n\nResults:\n- Geth mine on its own chain. Forever, it never recovers.\n\nExpected results:\n- Geth sees the heavier chain 'outside' and switching to mining that main, 'real' chain.\n\nI had raised this before but it's now a real problem so close to Frontier as the work around is restarting the client just in case every hour so that no more than an hour of work can be lost at any given time.\n\nI was able to reproduce this manually (by pulling the aforementioned plug), but also had it happen to me several time when my ISP went down (which happens a lot where I am).\n\nPaste bin: http://pastebin.com/jGb5W5Ry\n(my router logs indicate I lost internet at 23:26, which matches the above). \n",
