  "body": "I received the following error on two mining geth nodes (my laptop and server), which crashed geth in both cases:\n\n```\n*** Error in `geth': free(): invalid pointer: 0x000000c29cda6008 ***\nSIGABRT: abort\nPC=0x7fbbcc88fcc9\nsignal arrived during cgo execution\n```\n\nI posted the full log at https://gist.github.com/tinybike/0985b8ede7e350052136.\n\nI'm running the latest geth Ubuntu build available from the PPA.  @fldrog also reported experiencing this error.  (Immediately following the error, http://eth-netstats.herokuapp.com/ reported 0 mining geth nodes -- possibly they all crashed? -- and 2 mining eth nodes.)\n\nI restarted geth (without the miner) and it ran smoothly.  After re-building the DAG, it's running ok again with the miner on; will update this issue if this error happens again.\n",
