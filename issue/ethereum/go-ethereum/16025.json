  "body": "I recently attempted to use the [Rinkeby faucet](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/) in FF58 on Windows 10, and after completing the CAPTCHA I got the following error: \r\n\r\n>insufficient funds for gas * price + value     \r\n\r\nThis matches the string for ErrInsufficientFunds at [core/tx_pool.go](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/762f3a48a00da02fe58063cb6ce8dc2d08821f15/core/tx_pool.go):63. \r\n\r\nI retried and it successfully reported \"Funding request accepted\" on the retry, so the issue may be intermittent and hard for any one individual to reliably reproduce.  All requests from 13 hours back appear to be stacking up so the requests may not be going through.\r\n\r\nI'm reporting here based on this repo apparently being the right place for Issue #15645, but please redirect if it's not posted in the right place. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
