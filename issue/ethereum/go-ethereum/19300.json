  "body": "I'm trying to automate checking if my wallet is unlocked. To do that I'm using the `--exec` option in `console` mode:\r\n```javascript\r\npersonal.listWallets[0].status == \"Unlocked\"\r\n```\r\nThe thing is, I can't just get the `stdout`, so I wanted to return `0` or `1` from the `geth` process depending on whether the wallet is unlocked. But it turns out that:\r\n\r\n1. The `exit` command does not take an argument.\r\n2. I cannot use the `process.exit` method usually available in NodeJS.\r\n\r\nSo my question is. How can I change `geth` exit status depending on result of my JS script?",
