  "body": "When creating a new account with `geth --datadir=xyz account new` (to eventually make a custom genesis block and private network), this method creates and inits a live chain inside the provided datadir. This is annoying because users then try to init their chain with their custom genesis, which fails, requiring to manually delete the old chain (which most people don't know how). \r\n\r\nThe solution is quite straightforward, none of the `account` subcommands should create their own chain database (or I'm guessing entire p2p node), since there's no need.\r\n\r\nSide effect issue of this: https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/15354\r\n\r\nHint for implementers: we want to get rid of these calls https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/cmd/geth/accountcmd.go#L294 and replace them with one that only creates a keystore, but not an entire network stack (or alternatively, one that avoids starting up `eth` inside the stack).",

I do not find the scenario as noted in this issue to be true.\r\n\r\nIf I run `geth --datadir=xyz account new` I only get a keystore directory created. No data directory is created.\r\n\r\nLooking at the code that was referenced it does go through and create a node struct in memory to reference in terms of getting configuration values but until an init is run the data directory is not being created and no init is run. I'll double check on other account command calls but certainly is the case on `account new`\r\n\r\nFunnily or sadly I didn't verify this was the case out of the gate. I refactored the code so that it would not call `New()` on `Node` and build the stack definition for the node when running the account command(s) but would create the needed config info for accessing the proper datadir and have access to the `AccountManager` under `Node`  then as I dug in deeper I could not find how even calling `New()` would have created the db directory. When I hopped back out to a cmdline and ran the command sure enough no database dir.\r\n\r\ntagging @karalabe \r\n\r\n![geth account results](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5179219/32381816-0b8c2ad2-c08a-11e7-9beb-4c414892f691.png)\r\n",
