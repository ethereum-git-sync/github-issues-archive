This happens with `geth --dev` and the same when setting up a new private network with clique and a period > 0.\r\n\r\nThe below screenshot shows the memory usage after just one block.\r\n\r\n![gethhighmem](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23406/40569019-aae88b90-607e-11e8-9556-715120405a25.png)\r\n\r\n#### System information\r\n\r\nGeth version: 1.8.8\r\nOS & Version: macOS 10.13.2\r\n\r\n#### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nThe virtual memory usage should be low.\r\n\r\n#### Actual behaviour\r\n\r\nThe virtual memory usage is high (520GB).\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\r\n\r\n1.  Run `geth --dev`\r\n2. Check virtual memory usage",
