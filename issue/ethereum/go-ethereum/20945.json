    "body": "So, a few things. As Ligi mentioned, the Geth team cannot really help as we maintain the client, but we don't maintain the Ledger hardware wallets, nor track its firmwares, so not much we can do.\r\n\r\nThat said, you might want to double check which firmware you updated from and to which to. Ledger changed their default derivation path a couple years back, but the old should still work if you explicitly request it.\r\n\r\nNow, the other thing is that updating a hardware wallet is always a bit risky, because things can go wrong. That is why they always say to expect a failure and ensure you have you seed words written down. If you do however, then you can always regenerate the same address you had before, so you should be safe even if the device got bricked.",
