    "body": "There's no such functionality in the Ethereum protocol to allow rewarding less than the fees specified by the user. Making that change would seem a non-trivial work since you'd need to handle that at various locations (tx execution, mempool, etc). Maybe you could hack it in by modifying the EVM setup when starting to execute a transaction + the end when the rewards are allocated to the miner, but it's gonna get messy. It's not something we would add to the protocol or go-ethereum implementation.",
