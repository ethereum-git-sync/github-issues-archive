I currently have the external ssd ready to go but GETH i not very GUI Friendly, its CLI intensive, nothing against CLI, it just makes it more complex for the average person\r\n\r\nWhat are the use-cases?\r\nDownload ETH blockchain to external SSDs and probably have a lot more nodes around the world, thus increasing decentralization.\r\n\r\n# Implementation\r\n\r\nDo you have ideas regarding the implementation of this feature?\r\nAre you willing to implement this feature?\r\n\r\nI can't I am not technical enough.",
