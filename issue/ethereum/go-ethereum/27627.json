  "body": "I'm curious why these are asymmetric: https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/rpc/websocket.go#L38-L40\r\nIt seems to me writing and reading should have similar timeouts- an external service communicating with geth over a websocket will suffer the same limitations writing over the socket as reading from it, no?\r\n\r\nBeyond that, I wish they were configurable on an instance of `websocketCodec` and that configurability was bubbled up into [ethclient](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/ethclient)\r\n\r\nI run a service that holds open an event subscription, and while I've dealt with needing to reconnect gracefully, it happens a bit too often for my linking, so it'd be nice if it could be tuned.\r\n\r\nethclient itself doesn't need the options, as it exposes its underlying [rpc.Client](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum@v1.12.0/rpc#Client)... which has nice support for custom http timeouts via `DialHTTPWithClient`, but no support for custom websocket ping timeouts/intervals\r\n\r\n# Rationale\r\n\r\nWhy should this feature exist?\r\n\r\n- It will improve the flexibility of the ethclient library\r\n\r\nWhat are the use-cases?\r\n\r\n- Not all hardware is created equal, and a 5/30 second write/read timeout may thrash on certain platforms \r\n\r\n# Implementation\r\n\r\nDo you have ideas regarding the implementation of this feature?\r\n\r\n - yes, perhaps similar to how an http.Client can be passed in, a websocket.Conn can be exposed up to the rpc.Client abstraction upon creation, or a partially instantiated one can be passed down\r\n\r\nAre you willing to implement this feature?\r\n\r\n... yeah ok",

I'm not sure.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nAs for implementing the change I think it could make sense to add more websocket configuration parameters to `rpc.clientConfig`. Right now we accept a dialer from the upstream package, but since the keep-alive functionality is in our websocket-jsonCodec wrapper, it isn't expressive enough. Based on #21126 I don't think we will expose the websocket conn outright.\r\n",

One possible fix would be to hold open a mutex until the pong is received or times out, which can delay a write that will ultimately succeed, but should only be a problem on mostly-idle connections.\r\n\r\n",
