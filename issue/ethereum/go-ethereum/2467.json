  "body": "#### System information\n\nGeth version: `1.3.6`\nOS & Version: Windows7 64bit\nCommit hash : \n#### Expected behaviour\n\nblockchain should download in a few hours.\n#### Actual behaviour\n\nIv been trying to sync blockchain on Geth for the past four days now and have only managed to get to block 900 k. Though initially i enjoyed download speeds of a few second per 256 blocks, speeds have dropped to more than two min per 256 blocks over the last two days. Also download keeps breaking off every 20 min or so and i need to restart to resume sync. This continues for a couple of hours a day and then download stops altogether for the remaining hours of day with error - no peers to resume download activity. Im left to wait another 24 hrs before i see some txn activity again.\n\ni have tried everything from syncing system clock with time.nist.gov, enabled port forwarding to 30303, turned antivirus and firewall off etc.. but all in vain.\n\nexperiencing this issue on --rpc, --fast & console commands.\n\nPlease help!\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\n#### Backtrace\n\n```\n[backtrace]\n```\n",

    "body": "Good news is that im synced to last block now. I did this via regular download on geth 1.3.6 using --rpc and it took forever(16 days to be precise). I tried everything including trying to add active fully synced enodes manually and nothing helped push the pace. The only significant observation I made was that majority of the syncing took place between 3.30 AM - 8.30 am everyday western standard time. Download speeds ranged between 17 sec - 1min per 256 blocks. \n\nFast sync helps too though you need to make sure you have a stable internet connection and a fast cpu. Any breaks while downloading the state side transactions and you'll have to start over again. Make sure not to interfere in the process until you see the message - 'fast sync complete. auto disabling'. Ppl i know have synced successfully using --fast sync and it took them no longer than a day.\n\nHope this info helps. \n\nGood luck!\n",

    "body": "Hi,\n\nI am trying to download Ethereum blockchain for the past week, and every attempt has failed for one reason or another.   Last two attempts appear to have corrupted chains perhaps due to \"empty head header set\" error(see logs below.)   After getting this error, block count has gone down back to 1, and subsequently \"geth --fast\"  gets automatically disabled.  Downloading subsequent blocks gets progressively slower, taking anywhere from 2 minutes to 30 minutes to process next block.\n\nWould someone from the geth team please have a closer look at following logs.

My problem arises after 80% of the chain is downloaded as expected, and then some corruption occurs around ~700K to ~900K range.\n\nFollowing is the outcome from last nights run.  There were three \"empty head header set\" log entries previous to the fourth entry at 09:13:15.631645 which seems to have renumbered the blockchain from 923850 to 505355.
