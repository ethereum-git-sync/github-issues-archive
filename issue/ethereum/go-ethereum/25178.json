  "body": "This request is relevant for private/consortium networks only.\r\n\r\n# Rationale\r\nThe Quorum project has written IBFT 2.0 and QBFT implementations for geth, but so far I couldn't find a PR to merge that code upstream in the official geth. Are there any reservations against such a PR?\r\n\r\nWhat are the use-cases?\r\nDAML (daml.com) requires a consensus algorithm with immediate finality (e.g. IBFT 2.0 and QBFT). AFAIK only Hyperledger Besu's implementations are officially supported. However there's also an implementation for geth, which has been developed by the Quorum project. I don't know if Quorum is interested in DAML support, but I think it should be done upstream anyway to keep the differences between Quorum's geth and the official geth as small as possible.\r\n\r\n# Implementation\r\nhttps://github.com/ConsenSys/quorum/tree/master/consensus/istanbul",
