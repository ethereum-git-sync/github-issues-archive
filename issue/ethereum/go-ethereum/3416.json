  "body": "#### Background\r\n\r\nThe method [`sendTransaction`](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC#eth_sendtransaction) returns the 32 byte transaction hash after submission. \r\n\r\nIn some cases, there have been problems with transactions not being sent; either they have been stuck waiting in pools, or simply dropped due to nonce-errors. As a result, exchanges and other parties who does a lot of transactions are forced to either\r\n\r\n1. Keep track of nonces themselves, and utilize `sendRawTransaction`\r\n2. Check various pools to see if the transaction is pending, and if not, simply make a new transaction (and hope that the value is not being sent twice). \r\n\r\nThere are two ways to make this flow better: \r\n\r\n1. Change the return data of `sendTransaction`, so it returns either transaction as a json-structure, _or_ the `rlp`-encoded signed transaction (compatible with `sendRawTransaction`) . \r\n2. Create a new method `makeTransaction`, with the same input as `sendTransaction`. This should return `rlp`-encoded data which can be submitted with `sendRawTransaction`. \r\n\r\nA benefit with the second approach is that it decouples the account-handling from the network-handling; if the long-term plan is to phase out `sendTransaction`, it would make sense to move `makeTransaction` into a separate standalone account-handling-application. \r\n",
