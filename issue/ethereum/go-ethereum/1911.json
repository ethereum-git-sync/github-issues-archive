This should be compatible with geth as both are based on the same spec: https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Web3-Secret-Storage-Definition\n\nWe tested compatibility cross Go, CPP and Python for this spec awhile back, but it looks like some minor incompatibility is now present. Probably just some encoding, I'll look into it and see if we need to patch it up.\n\nMeanwhile, you can modify this value (each decrement should halve the memory usage of Scrypt): https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/crypto/key_store_passphrase.go#L49\n\nSetting it to e.g. `1 << 12` should bring down memory usage to 4MB.\n",

    "body": "@datajerk It configures the KDF used (Scrypt) to use less memory. This weakens the KDF which is not a problem unless weak passwords are used. If strong enough passwords are used you can configure it even lower to avoid it's overhead entirely.\n\nIf password protection of keys is not needed, one can also use the plaintext keystore by changing `NewKeyStorePassphrase` to `NewKeyStorePlain` in this line: https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/cmd/utils/flags.go#L543\n\nThe reason we haven't exposed this as a cmd line flag has been to avoid users accidentally storing unencrypted private keys and because the main usage of the keystore has been as a user wallet.\n\nI think with a plaintext keystore it may still ask one to unlock accounts, but any password can be entered as it will not be used.\n",
