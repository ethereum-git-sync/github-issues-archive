  "body": "**version**: v1.10.26\r\nWhen developing against `geth` run in dev mode, I found `eth_getLogs` lags by several blocks annoyingly in dev mode, which I reckon is somewhat related to `sealingLogAtDepth` param hardcoded to 7 in `miner/worker.go`. But I still have a hard time to figure out how that affects log retrieving and hope to find some guidances here. Thanks in advance!",
