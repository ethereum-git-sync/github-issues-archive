    "body": "Unfortunately this was only the end of the stack trace, the top is the interesting part. Leveldb sometimes does a compaction round which can take a few minutes depending on how much data you allow it to cache before writing to disk (4GB is quite a lot). My best guess is that compaction hit and it would have recovered eventually on its own.\r\n\r\nIf this happens again, try waiting 5-10 mins to see if it revives. Not saying that this is a \"nice feature\", just that it would be useful to know if its leveldb or something else.",
