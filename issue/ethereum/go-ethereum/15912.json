A few months later after reinstalling WinOS I started a fresh geth sync but now the geth does not seem to be able to communicate and I cannot make any transactions. If I use my keystore file, would I be able to access my wallet with Mist? What would you recommend to do to regain access to my wallet?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n",
