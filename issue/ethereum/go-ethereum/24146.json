But, doing this makes Geth traces (as of 1.10.9) unusable with Truffle Debugger and presumably other debuggers.  Right now Truffle Debugger will just crash; we can of course fix the crash, but then we're still stuck with no memory!  What do we do, just pretend the memory is all zero?  We could of course attempt to keep track of memory ourself, and this might not seem unreasonable, as we already do this with storage; but in actual fact I don't think this is quite so feasible as that due to how many things can alter memory, whereas storage can only be interacted with via `SSTORE` and `SLOAD`.\r\n\r\n(Edit: Actually, I forgot, we do actually still use `storage` in certain cases.)\r\n\r\nBy contrast, with memory, in addition to being able to store things to it from the stack, one can also read things into it from other locations, such as code, calldata, or returndata; and old-style `CALL`s, with a nonempty output region set, will write to it directly.  I don't think it's practical for the debugger itself to compute all this.  The worst case is that of precompiled contracts, where, in order for us to get the output (whether written directly into memory or copied into memory from returndata), we'd have to actually compute it ourselves, because there are no trace steps to go by.  (And some languages, such as Vyper, do in fact use precompile 0x4 to copy memory around...) I don't think it's reasonable for the debugger to compute outputs of precompiles.\r\n\r\nSo, please restore memory (and storage) to traces!  Thank you.",

It's only returned for `SSTORE` and `SLOAD` objects. Is that enough information for your purpose or would you need a flag to enable storage for every trace step?",
