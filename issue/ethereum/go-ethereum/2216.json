  "body": "Acutally I experience the problems by using the wallet application. I filed the issue there but they told me that it is a network issue which belongs to be filed here. Here it goes:\n\nI find it quite difficult to connect the wallet to the blockchain. It often hangs in the \"Looking for peers\" mode with no resolution. Multiple aborts and restarts are necessary to finally find some peers and get the blockchain updated. The update itself is rather slow. I remember a time when I first experimented with geth in Windows when block downloads where much faster (months ago). Finally when everything is up the wallet loses connection to peers after some time and never regains it without a restart.\n\nI use Windows 7 64-bit and have a reliable high speed web access. I do not see similar problems with updating e.g. my Bitcoin or Dash full nodes.\n\nBecause this is a problem which might affect all MIst applications in Windows and Windows still is dominiating the desktop I think this issue should be taken seriously!\n",
