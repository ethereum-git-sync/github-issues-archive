  "body": "Hi there\r\n\r\nI'm currently playing around with geth and puppeth. I'm currently following [this](https://medium.com/@collin.cusce/using-puppeth-to-manually-create-an-ethereum-proof-of-authority-clique-network-on-aws-ae0d7c906cce#1b26) guide to setup Private network, and I've followed steps until this last one. I can't deploy Ethstats to node server, I constantly get this error after entering Secret password for API:\r\n```\r\nBuilding ethstats\r\ninvalid reference format: repository name must be lowercase\r\nERROR[10-25|12:14:18.662] Failed to deploy ethstats container      err=\"Process exited with status 1\"\r\n```\r\n#### Expected behaviour\r\nI'm expecting to get Ethstate deployed and running on another server.\r\n\r\n#### Actual behaviour\r\nI get the following error message, after following every step in Puppeth wizard for deploying Ethstats.\r\n```\r\nBuilding ethstats\r\ninvalid reference format: repository name must be lowercase\r\nERROR[10-25|12:14:18.662] Failed to deploy ethstats container      err=\"Process exited with status 1\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\r\nhttps://medium.com/@collin.cusce/using-puppeth-to-manually-create-an-ethereum-proof-of-authority-clique-network-on-aws-ae0d7c906cce#1b26\r\nSteps can be foundhere\r\n\r\nHope someone can help me, I think it's related to docker, but I have no idea how to debug go applications. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance :)\r\n",
