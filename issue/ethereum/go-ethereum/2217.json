  "body": "Hey guys,\n\nIt can happen that when you start geth with an empty database that it will never start syncing. This is the second time I encounter this problem. Thankfully I remembered to check `ntpd` and see if the clock was a bit off again. Both times this was the case but had to do some digging to find it out.\n\nIf the clock is off by 15-30 secs it will never sync, and will need adjustment. It's trivial to adjust it with ntpd(`sudo ntpdate pool.ntp.org`),  but if the user has no idea of the reason behind the failure it can be a hard thing to spot.\n\nWould it be possible to add some kind of warning when peer discovery fails due to time syncing issues?\n",
