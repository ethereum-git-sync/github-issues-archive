[No issues so far]\r\n\r\nLater I sent some more from exchange to my macbook wallet address and exchange shows it sent successfully, However when I tried open ethereum app in my mac, it started showing syncing the block chain.\r\nI thought it will take couple of hours to sync and reflect new balance. but its been more than 10 days, sync is not completed and my macbook shows, there is no diskspace, when checked the size of each folder, chaindata folder taking around 470GB.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. How to resolve chaindata folder 470GB issue and how to re-sync successfully?\r\n2. what are the steps I need to follow to get my amount of coin to reflect after re-sync?.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote:- I am new to this block chain concepts,  really appreciate if someone explains me with basic on each steps that I need to follow in order to complete above. \r\n\r\n",

[assume this will be a re-sync.]\r\n\r\nHowever I am little afraid that sent coins before re-sync will show on wallet or not by doing this [delete chain data.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease help me to get out of this mess by steps or any links.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
