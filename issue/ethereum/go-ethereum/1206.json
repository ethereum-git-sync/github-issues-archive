  "body": "This isn't something I can reproduce, but I did encounter it maybe 2-3 times this morning during very heavy peer churn. The downloader pulled a batch of hashes (8K, 20K) then froze. Further sync was not possible since the downloader was active, yet the downloader neither issues and hash requests nor hit the timeout. This might be the thing a few people are seeing during long running processes.\n\nMy guess is that it's either some data race, specifically that we try to send a request to a peer, it's dropped before we get to push out the request, and a channel to send the message on becomes nil, blocking us forever. Note, this is only a hunch, so consider it a memory dump so I won't forget it :)\n",
