If you attempt to submit a transaction to a node with a lower price than the node's pricelimit it will refuse it with this error.\r\n\r\nNote that just dialling down the price limit on a local node won't necessarily help: your local node will accept the transaction but if none (or very few) of the mining nodes will accept the transaction (due to their own price limit) it won't be mined and different nodes end up with different pool information (which becomes lots of fun to debug for the user).",
