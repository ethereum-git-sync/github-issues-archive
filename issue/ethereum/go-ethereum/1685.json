I think the issue is that bootnodes aren't automatically used as peers. when the problem went away, there was a 3rd node in the mix. So I think what's happening is geth searches the bootnodes for peers. If the bootnode doesn't have any peers, it doesn't connect. However geth should use the bootnode itself as a peer if available.\n",

For example, if any of the specified nodes is down, then none of the other nodes will be able to restart if they also go down. They just crash on startup.\r\nIn that other Github issue, I'm suggesting to make this a graceful warning rather than a fatal error... But had zero response.",
