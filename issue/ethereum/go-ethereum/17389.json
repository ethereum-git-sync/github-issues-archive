Thanks for all the effort!\r\n\r\nNow I want to interact with a privat blockchain through an iOS app.\r\nThe problem is, I can't find any documentation for how to use the official [geth pod](https://cocoapods.org/pods/Geth), other than this:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Mobile:-Introduction\r\n- https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Mobile:-Account-management\r\n\r\nIt never explains how to connect to a network, let alone to a private one. Additionally I found this (closed) issue #14997, which didn't contain any additional information either.\r\nDid I miss anything?\r\n",
