  "body": "When specifying custom bootnodes via `--bootnodes`, we set the same set to both v4 and v5. This is nice if only one or the other is used (full or light). However this doesn't work out when they are both needed (light server). We need to figure out a way to make the light server differentiate between the two discovery ports.\r\n\r\nWould be even nicer if we didn't have 2 different ports, rather reused the same with multiplexing.",
