What is the error? \r\n\r\n> while adding bootnode to other machine it is not responding cannot connect, admin.peers [] but other bootnodes connect to my chain (sometimes).\r\n\r\nI don't understand that sentence. \r\n\r\n```\r\nExecution engine call failed            error: ServerMessage { code: -32000, message: \"invalid terminal block hash\" }, service: exec  \r\n```\r\nThis^ is something completely different, it's an error indicating a chain misconfiguration. Might, or might not be related to your peering-problems: nodes use something called forkid to distinguish between peers that are compatible or not. So a misconfig on the forks can lead to peering-problems. \r\n\r\n> I blocked ports 30303/tcp & 30303/udp because when I checked using telnet it was connected but when I opened the telnet port it didn't respond\r\n\r\nYou blocked the `30303` ports? Then how do you expected them to be able to peer??\r\n\r\nAnd what parameters are you using? What version? \r\n",
