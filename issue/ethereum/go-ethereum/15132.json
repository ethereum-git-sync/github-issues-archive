As transactions are issued periodically, we expect them to be uniformly distributed among blocks, and block sizes to be roughly the same. \r\n\r\n#### Actual behaviour\r\nThe result was a bit shocking: we received several blocks with ~5000 transactions in them, and between two big blocks there are always several empty blocks. \r\n\r\nI then tried to limit the block size by setting the gasLimit tag, but after that there were more invalid transactions. \r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Backtrace\r\n\r\n````\r\n[backtrace]\r\n````",

    "body": "A few ideas:\r\n\r\n  * Please try the experiment again with the master branch. We've found and fixed a fairly ugly bug that mostly appears during mining and causes transactions to go missing (if multiple blocks are mined at the same time).\r\n * Geth has a transaction pool limit of 4K executable and 1K non executable transactions. These are enough for the main network, but if you're doing benchmarks, I'd roughly guess you'd need to bump these limits as 5K transacitions in a single block means the pool gets empty after a single block. So perhaps what you've been seeing is only the transaction originator keeping all transactions, and others just emptying their pool and not having anything left to include.",
