    "body": "I would like to *petition/request* that this be reconsidered as a feature.\r\n\r\n@obscuren you say that they tend to bite people in the ass.  I don't see why the implementation of a config file cannot be done so that it protects people from the common pitfalls.\r\n\r\n1. If a config value is present in the file that doesn't map to one of the allowed options display a warning or throw an error.\r\n2. At startup, if a config file was found or used, print out a message indicating as much: `\"Loaded configuration options /path/to/config.something\"`\r\n\r\nAs for maintenance overhead, it has been almost a year since this was first proposed.  I understand there is overhead here, but configuration via config file is *extremely* common and `geth` has matured a lot in the last 10 months.",
