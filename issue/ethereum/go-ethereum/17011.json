  "body": "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nHopefully someone can explain this odd behaviour I witnessed a few minutes ago, cause it looks like a serious issue to me. I transferred 50 ETH to a wallet address on the Ropsten network that we use for testing our contracts. What happened is that immediately after successful transaction of 50 ETH there were 2 other transactions following for exact amount of 50 ETH.\r\n\r\nOur account is visible here: [0x85a9916425960aa35b2a527d77c71855dc0215b3](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0x85a9916425960aa35b2a527d77c71855dc0215b3)\r\n\r\nMy transaction for 50 ETH is: [0x9f95ae4a78b9644603bb41af878c86ab5dd8d287fd9c13a47bb60f20e2f636cb](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/tx/0x9f95ae4a78b9644603bb41af878c86ab5dd8d287fd9c13a47bb60f20e2f636cb)\r\n\r\nThe first following transaction is: [0x84896b776e721b8535d95d642c31178dc89be778a2cd484519181b18c7d81fa7](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/tx/0x84896b776e721b8535d95d642c31178dc89be778a2cd484519181b18c7d81fa7)\r\n\r\nThe second following transaction is: [0x557c0c1c554e91e386eaee79a70f84dd573728618eecdffefdbea669bf979035](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/tx/0x557c0c1c554e91e386eaee79a70f84dd573728618eecdffefdbea669bf979035)\r\n\r\nThe transactions seem to be going to a miner of some sort - [0x7097f41f1c1847d52407c629d0e0ae0fdd24fd58](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0x7097f41f1c1847d52407c629d0e0ae0fdd24fd58)\r\n\r\nI was expecting my account to have a balance of 50 ETH, but was very surprised to find it was 0. Somebody stole 50 ETH from me. Can someone please explain what is happening here?\r\n\r\nAfter the first transaction I tried to make another one for 5 ETH and this one went trough as it should [0x8f4c8177fef24518d17e290478d1d6cfdc68f89579270a608873e65538a06a89](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/tx/0x8f4c8177fef24518d17e290478d1d6cfdc68f89579270a608873e65538a06a89)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### System information\r\n\r\nGeth\r\nVersion: 1.8.11-stable\r\nGit Commit: dea1ce052a10cd7d401a5c04f83f371a06fe293c\r\nArchitecture: amd64\r\nProtocol Versions: [63 62]\r\nNetwork Id: 1\r\nGo Version: go1.10\r\nOperating System: linux\r\nGOPATH=\r\nGOROOT=/usr/lib/go-1.10\r\n\r\n#### Expected behaviour\r\nTransaction should go trough and my balance should be 50 EHT.\r\n\r\n#### Actual behaviour\r\nSuccessful transaction was followed by two instant transaction that took away everything\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\r\nCan't find a way to reproduce.\r\n",
