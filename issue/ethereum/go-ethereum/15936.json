  "body": "Hi there,\r\n\r\nThere seems to be an inconsistency with the results being returned by the getLogs RPC method. Sometimes I will get back 41 results, other times 11, 9, 53, etc...\r\n\r\nHere is the command I am using to invoke this inconsistency  ` curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" --data '{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"method\":\"eth_getLogs\",\"params\":[{\"from\": 4861162, \"to\": 4861172}],\"id\":74}' localhost:8545 | jq '.result | length'`\r\n\r\nI've tried it on many different geth nodes, and the inconsistencies are on those nodes too.\r\nIn addition, this issue is seen by a few Infura users as well\r\n (https://github.com/INFURA/infura/issues/51).\r\n\r\n#### System information\r\n\r\nGeth version: `Geth/v1.7.3-stable`\r\nOS & Version: Ubuntu\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
