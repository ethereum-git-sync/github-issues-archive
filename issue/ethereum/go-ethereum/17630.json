Use the same passphrase mechanism as the keystore to protect the secrets.dat file.\r\n\r\n----\r\nComment/todo\r\n\r\nThe current setup trusts the device it's on a bit too much, and a user trying to backup the files `secrets.dat` needs to manually encrypt the file. TODO: Encrypt the master seed with a password, that needs to be fed into `clef` at startup. ",
