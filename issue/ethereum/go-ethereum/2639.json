  "body": "#### System information\n\nI'm running Mist version 0.7.4 on Windows 10. \n#### Expected behaviour\n\nI have been trying for over a week to sync the blockchain using fast sync but have been running into an issue where the sync appears to restart itself when there's only a few thousand blocks left to go. It appears to roll back a couple thousands headers around  Block 1606908, and then starts the sync again with a new peer (albiet at a much slower speed).\n\n![geth fast sync cmd](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7211130/15654162/6310967c-2657-11e6-84c5-7ee27a2192a5.png)\n\nThe issue seems related to Issue #2469. Is there any available workaround? The fast sync command below took 8 hours to get near the end before the restart.\n#### Backtrace\n\n```\ngeth --fast --cache=1024 --jitvm\n```\n",
