    "body": "> I am trying to have isolation in my tests via debug_setHead and using block numbers as the snapshot IDs.\r\n\r\nWell, I think the problem here is that `debug_setHead` is meant to be a tool to set back your chain head after something has gone horribly wrong, such as: \r\n\r\n- Your node had a consensus flaw, and you got stuck on the wrong side of a fork. After update, you need to rewind+replay. \r\n- Your db has inconsistencies regarding the latest state. You rewind to an earlier point where you had the state, and hope for the best. \r\n\r\nIt was never intended to be used as a snapshotting-tool to jump back in time. \r\n\r\nWhat it sounds like, is that the txpool state tracker does not function ideally, like you've already seen with the comment here:https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/22247 . \r\n\r\nAnyway, what I kind of mean is that yes, we'll fix this and/or accept a PR to get this fixed, but it's not a high-prio usecase for us, because it's borderline abusing the feature. Depending on what you want to achieve, there are probably other ways of doing it. ",

    "body": "I think they want to do as below:\r\n\r\n- Start from block N\r\n- Send a few txes (deploy contracts, interact with them)\r\n- Read state\r\n- Go back to block N (as if nothing happened in between)\r\n- Send other txes\r\n...\r\n\r\nSo I guess `debug_setHead` is the closest thing that comes there. But IMO geth is not really suitable for testing in this way. Why don't you use foundry/hardhat @unparalleled-js? If you want to test on a real-world state they have [forking features](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network/docs/guides/forking-other-networks).",

I am a tooling developer; Geth is one of options for local providers for our users with the caveat that there is no snapshotting. I really like Geth because it has the `debug_traceCall` method. I know Hardhat and Foundry plan on adding this method (https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/2782 and https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/issues/2971), but it is enticing for the gas reporting feature I am working on. Thus, I have been looking into what else I can do to make Geth (`--dev`) work similarly to the other local provider options we offer.\r\n",
