  "body": "I noticed that you guys are starting to do some graphql stuff and that you are using graph-gophers. I want to just make sure you are aware of the existence of gqlgen and you've considered it before you invest too much into graph-gophers. I strongly believe that gqlgen is significantly better. Check out their feature comparison: https://gqlgen.com/feature-comparison/ The main reason why I like it, though is the separation between models and resolvers.\r\n\r\nIf you still choose to stick with graph-gophers, that's fine, but when I was initially searching for a graphql library, I didn't find gqlgen until I had already written a lot of code for graph-gophers and the result is that our codebase would have been much cleaner if I knew about it earlier. Feel free to close this issue if you've already considered gqlgen.",
