    "body": "This usually means someone's trying to sync from you. The eth protocol is a tit-for-tat. You sync from others, others sync from you. Although older clients pulled a bit more from one select master peer, there's not much protection we can do at this point. With Geth 1.4.6 released this shouldn't be a problem much more as clients upgrade. We can consider additional capping options if this becomes an issue, but I'd rather not introduce artificial caps as it's a whole new can or worms that we really don't want to maintain currently.\n",
