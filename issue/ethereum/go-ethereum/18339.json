  "body": "Hello,\r\nI have installed go-ethereum, go lang on AWS EC2 instance.\r\nPrivate network is created, I have crated 4 personal accounts.\r\nOn mining new block, 2 blocks are added to the blockchain, and some balance to my first account.\r\nHowever, while trying to connect to the Ethereum network from MetaMask, it keeps clocking/loading.\r\n\r\nFrom the MetaMask logs, I found the port on Ethereum network is not responding.\r\nOn further troubleshooting, even the CURL command for this server and port http://server-name:30303 gives error as:\r\n\r\n_curl: (52) Empty reply from server_\r\n\r\nHowever, CURL works well with other websites like google. I have verified firewall and confirmed ports are listening on the server, and I am able to telnet from outside the network over the port 30303. It means there is some misconfiguration or issue while doing go-ethereum setup, can you please guide me how to overcome this. What I am missing here, what I need to do to fix this.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nJagdish",
