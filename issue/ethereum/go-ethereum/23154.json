We want our `TxData` interface to embed the `TxData` interface from geth so that we are able to reduce maintenance.\r\n\r\n# Implementation\r\n\r\n**Do you have ideas regarding the implementation of this feature?**\r\nMake the `TxData` functions public.\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to implement this feature?**\r\n\r\nYes\r\n",

    "body": "Hey @fedekunze. I had a quick look and it seems in the lifetime of #21502 these accessor methods started out as public methods but were made private in https://github.com/lightclient/go-ethereum/commit/389f039c89211eccfd68e6244a55a48d549789ca#diff-8fb609018eccff10931645347515b8ecc194992cc4ef9e84ebdea87682dd50c3.\r\n\r\nI know in general that the `core/types` API has been usually kinda stable and it's changed with care which I guess is the reason why these TxData methods were made private. But I can bring this up for discussion and if there was agreement on exporting them make a PR to address it.",
