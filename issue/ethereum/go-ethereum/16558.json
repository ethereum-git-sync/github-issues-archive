Unless we know exactly how many nodes the cut-off subtrie contained, we'd need to iterate, which is prohibitively expensive.\r\n\r\nMaintaining a counter inside the trie node might in theory be a possible solution, I'm just afraid of how much overhead that would be to add 8 bytes to every node (if we have 120M nodes on mainnet, that's 900MB of counter data).",

    "body": "This would indeed be very handy.. lots of users are complaining about the super long sync times and the fact that no one knows how many state entries are needed to be downloaded is compounding the problem.  Currently at 175M apparently :)\r\n\r\nGeth is able to keep track of the state entry count while syncing, even when it performs its intermittent block updates whilst downloaded state entries. But I understand that its probably not trivial once sync completes.\r\n\r\nEven if the node itself didn't keep a count due to resource constraints,  what if nodes that just finish syncing announce their state entries count to the network, so that other downloaders at least have a rough idea.  Or even better, perhaps once a node completes the sync it stores {blockNumber: 1234, stateEntryCount: 170M} and shares this information as part of its node info request.. then downloaders could find the most recently synced node and use its stateEntryCount as an approximate guess. Obviously the more recent the block the more accurate the state entry count.\r\n\r\nAnother option, what about an offline command whilst the node is not running.. to scan the DB and output a count?",

Let's have each newly synced node announce state entry count. \r\n\r\nI thought I was going crazy with fast sync taking this long, but after I found a lot of digging, I found a post from February 2019 which stated the synced state entry count to be ~284M. I am currently at 270M and still syncing, so I now believe I am almost there. \r\n\r\nEven just a centralized google doc with most recent state entry counts from newly synced people would be helpful at this point 😅😅😅",

    "body": "Update: My node is finally synced. Final state entry count as of **3/20/2019** is **292,494,140**.\r\n\r\nI started collecting some data during the last 20M state entries, and I made a chart and found the rate of state entry importation. Note that this is _after_ the sync has pretty much caught up with the network in terms of block imports. I'm not sure if the rate is different while it's importing a ton of blocks in the beginning. Anyway, the chart shows **187M state entry imports _per 24 hours_** on average. Yikes.\r\n\r\n![state_entry](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21989537/54732307-552d2680-4b50-11e9-8ab4-0b0eb992a38c.png)\r\n\r\nMachine is a 12 core VPS with 6GB of ram and a 250GB SSD \r\n",
