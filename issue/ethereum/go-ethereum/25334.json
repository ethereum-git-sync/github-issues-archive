    "body": "Statedb is the in-memory cache layer over the state database. `prev` is an account that existed in the cache under the same address. `createObject` is called in `CreateAccount` which is used for creating a contract. As per the comment it's possible to compute the address of a contract being created before, sends funds to it in which case a state object will exist by the time a contract is gonna be created at that address. Note this won't be considered a collision. Collision is when either the existing account has nonce > 0 or non-empty code. Hope that answers your question.",
