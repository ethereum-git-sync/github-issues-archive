Inputting a correct password is considered incorrect. If only one server is added, everything works fine. If both servers are removed from the config file and re-added after running, all runs fine until the next time Puppeth is closed and relaunched.\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\r\n\r\nAdd 2 remote servers to Puppeth, close and re-open Puppeth.\r\n\r\n![screenshot 2018-06-10 15 46 35](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1430603/41202203-ed33b53a-6cc5-11e8-8f43-81c9ed30ce70.png)\r\n\r\n",
