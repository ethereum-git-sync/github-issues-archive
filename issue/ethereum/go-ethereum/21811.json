  "body": "several remote code execution vulnurabilities found !!!! \r\nThis allow stealing etherum directly from the main node without any need for conformation with the client.\r\nthe poc is a simple javascript snippet that can be easily embedded on any site and causing users who navigate to the site to loose all \"security\" when the etherum is installed to the default directory or when useng web3 client like metamsk.\r\nthe severity of this is far greater then i could explain here or on the bounty site - i guess that is why i wasnt rewarded for finding the vulnuraibilty?\r\neither way the only way i found so far to fix it is changing the installtion to some unknown folder so that the wallet.dat file cannot be retrived or by encripting the wallet.\r\nis using a db like my sql for security - doesnt help as the snippet can easily be modified for remote code excution allowing the \"hacker\" to just copy the entire wallet and steal all funds.\r\nthe poc is actully taken from another type of vulnurabilty based on simple xss on wordpress sites - allowing theft of files on edd installations - either way if i dont see the bounty reward ill have no choice but to publish the poc in 2 days time for the sake of your users.\r\ni guess that is what happens when a group of web developer create a project like ethereum - no security inspection?!\r\nthe wallet for the bounty  reward is here : 0xE957F30eD79056aFcf4d814fBbB325bC56B49249 \r\nalthough id be far happier to recieve the bounty in fiat currency to my paypal as it cannot be hacked this easily: pablorotem8@gmail.com\r\neither way dont say i didnt share that there is a poc / security issue - i just dont trust grereey people who dont pay for bounty programs when they should !!!(the exact same happened to me with facebook and several other hacked sites and exchanges who just didnt care enough to secure their users or cared more about money then people..!\r\nso if i dont recieve the bounty reward for this poc ill need to submit it to google hacking database and hacker news so the users of etherum network can protect them selves before \"hackers(i put hackers in \" because it doesnt take a hacker to copy paste code) can steal their funds, so that most users can prepeare for this as obviosy the etherum \"owners\" / the group of people that develops and mainrtains the main nodes dont care about security issues as i tried to bring this to their attention for several months now via bounty programs\r\n\r\nto all users and developers of etherum - id suggest to change the installation forlder on the local machine / server - and possibly use encription for the wallet to fix this security issue!",
