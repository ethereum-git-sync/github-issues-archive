  "body": "The blockchain is currently stored within the AppData/Roaming folder. Due to the fact that the combined size of the chain is rather large, many users will not want to store it there. I propose that the ability to set a custom location for storage of the blockchain be added. This can be something that the user has to enter in additional command-line arguments for. As long as the option is allowed, it will provide more usability to many people though.\n",
