  "body": "Geth version: All verions\nOS & Version: All operating systems\n\n**Expected behaviour:**\n\nFrom user perspective API call communication between mist and geth scheme does not allow man in middle attack. \n\n**Actual behaviour:**\nMist calls geth in order to send tx with account unlocking for 2 second. Not likely other wallet singed tx itself and send before sending to the geth this allows man in middle attack via IPC and RPC while making a transaction by mist.   \n\n**Steps to reproduce the behaviour:**\nSimple batch script successfully hijack transaction to IPC with default mist and geth settings.\nRefer the following video.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNSwFy__m-8\n",
