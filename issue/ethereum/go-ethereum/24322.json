The Ethereum ecosystem already stepped in the right direction, but the path is not fully complete. This white list is offensive to some people and we empathize with those hurt by the use of that term. This terminology must be replaced. The tech industry should keep moving to a more inclusive, open culture, and this is an important step in this journey. While it takes time to make these changes now, it's a one-time engineering cost that will have lasting impacts, both internally and externally. We know inclusive language is just as much about how we code and what we build as it is about person-to-person interactions. I propose to change _Whitelist_ by _ApprovedList_ or _AllowList_.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/search?q=whitelist for a set of change required.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
