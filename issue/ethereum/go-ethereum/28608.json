  "body": "#### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nPrograms which make JSONRPC `eth_call` requests should not have to worry about the version of the client they are connecting to as long as it accepts `\"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\"` requests.\r\n\r\n#### Actual behaviour\r\n\r\nIf the client is on tag `v1.12.2`, then the `eth_call` parameters must specify the view call using the `\"data\"` field. If the client is on tag `v1.13.0` or higher, then they must instead use the `\"input\"` field.\r\n\r\nThis is not backwards compatible in any way shape or form, and the only way to understand what request schema to use is to inspect `web3_clientVersion`.\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\r\n\r\nRun two `go-ethereum` nodes, one at `v1.12.2` and the other at `v1.13.0`. Deploy a contract with a view method. Construct a JSONRPC API `eth_call` request for that method. The request that works for `v1.12.2` clients will not work for `v1.13.0` clients.\r\n\r\n#### Note\r\n\r\nIncidentally, I suspect most clients would be ok with *both* fields being passed.",

    "body": "Hi guys, I apologize for my delayed response - I don't receive GitHub notifications for some reason.\r\n\r\nMy issue isn't based on a misunderstanding. At least I do not think it is. It's not obvious to me what my misunderstanding is, so I would appreciate clarification on that point @holiman \r\n\r\nThis is my interpretation of what happened:\r\n\r\n1. The `geth` change implicitly reflected a change to the specification of the JSONRPC API.\r\n2. Since the implicit specification change to the JSONRPC API didn't come with an associated change to the version number, the treatment of `eth_call` now becomes unspecified behavior in *general* client implementations.\r\n\r\nIn my case, it broke my tooling when interacting with a client for a Polygon rollup that was using an old version of the OP stack.\r\n\r\nNow you can say this isn't `geth`'s problem because its `eth_call` implementation handles all cases correctly.\r\n\r\nBut whoever is maintaining the JSONRPC API specification should take responsibility for this. It could be handled by simple increasing the `\"jsonrpc\"` version number from `\"2.0\"` to `\"2.1\"` or something.\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that the `geth` implementation *becomes* the JSONRPC API specification. This is why I filed the issue against `go-ethereum`.\r\n\r\nIf my misunderstanding is that I filed the issue in the wrong place, then I apologize and I would appreciate a pointer to the right place to file this issue. Because whether or not it is an issue for `geth` it is certainly an issue for the Ethereum ecosystem.\r\n\r\nIf there is not misunderstanding, then let us continue the conversation here. I will set a reminder to poll this thread once a week so that I don't miss notifications.",
