  "body": "Hi Guys,\r\n\r\nDidn't find anywhere to ask questions, so I raised an issue here to ask. \r\nIf it is not appropriate, please close it.\r\n\r\nI am running testnet at one server for almost 2 months for testing purpose, But during this period, it crashed a few times, like stop syncing, threw strange errors.  \r\nMy question here is that is there a health check api to let user know if the API is alive?\r\nI plan to do a load balance, but don't know which API is good to call as health check function.\r\n\r\nI noticed, we have  eth_syncing, is it good enough to use as health check?\r\n\r\nOr I have to check admin_peers, to see how many peers connected?\r\n\r\nThanks.",
