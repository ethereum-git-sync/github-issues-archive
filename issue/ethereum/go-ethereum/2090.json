As little as 9 TX in a single block and my CPUs spike and the chain is always behind.  We have to kill geth and restart it to fix.  We only have about 20 test devices.  IOT will have a millions.  We are trying to refactor our code to use as little of the blockchain as possible now.  But it'll still never scale.  One bad actor putting too many transactions on the blockchain and it creates a stall for all transactions.\n\nI should add that my maxpeers is the default of 25.\n",
