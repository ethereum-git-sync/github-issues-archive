    "body": "This is not a bug. It is true that this is a local monotonic clock which is meaningless for another client but this value is only interpreted by the issuer itself when the other party returns with the ticket after the wait period. The issuer could also remember it but the idea was that the issuer should not need to store anything about tickets in order to avoid spam attacks by requesting tickets. So the local issue time is stored in the ticket and signed, then checked when receiving the ticket back. The other party only uses the wait period which it counts relative to its own local time when receiving the ticket.",
