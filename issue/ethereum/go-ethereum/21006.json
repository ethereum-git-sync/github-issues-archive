  "body": "Hi there,\r\n\r\nI have run geth as private chain. We were doing a load test and injected 10K transactions into the chain. The chain was able to handle the load for 3 times, but fourth time the chain is crashed. And when I restarted the chain, it is rewound to old state that is 2 months old state.

    "body": "It's obviously not an \"expceted behaviour\" for geth to crash, but when geth _does_ crash, it is expected behaviour that a roll-back can occur. Geth does in-memory pruning of state, and only writes out data every once in a while. If geth crashes, it may well have to discard a whole lot of blocks to go back to that point in time where it most recently stored the state to disk. \r\n\r\nShort answer: no, you cannot get the blocks back.\r\nIf you want more reliability in the future, consider running more nodes, and/or disable pruning -- a.k.a run `archive` mode. \r\n\r\nHope I've answered your questions, and since I don't see anything more actionable about this particular ticket, I'll close it.
