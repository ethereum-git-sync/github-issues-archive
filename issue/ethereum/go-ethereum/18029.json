NR 1\r\n2.   NR 2A PARENT 1\r\n3.   NR 2B PARENT 1\r\n4.   NR 3  PARENT 2A\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe are subscribed to an event. There is an event log is in Block 2A, our subscription fires in step 2.\r\nIn step 3, our event gets marked as removed, which is the last state we get for that event even tough block 2A is re-included in the chain in step 4.\r\n\r\n#### Expected behaviour\r\nEvents from Blocks which are rolled back should be marked as removed. However when that block is re-included into the longest chain, it should be re-fired again (maybe with a removed:false property).",
