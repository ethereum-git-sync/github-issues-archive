  "body": "really do not understand why they make it so hard ethereum wallet 0.11.1 works fatal, a few days ago it worked but after testing mist and / or update windows 10 this weekend Ethereum Wallet does not work. If I run geth.exe with --testnet and light mode it is able to connect to the node but when it is launched from the wallet it does not work. It took many days just for the wallet to work, I'm desperate with the software. I think the user should be able to interact more with geth from the wallet but no! I do not think it's difficult, to be able to configure geth better from the wallet and have the option to open the geth console from the wallet to see what is really happening. It is so difficult? I am desperate and so many hours lost just to be able to synchronize the wallet and without success .. TT please check it 0.11.1 sucks ...",
