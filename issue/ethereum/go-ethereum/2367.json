One way to see Geth and its libraries is as a backend that is hackable, tuneable and offers you little to no actual restrictions other than those defined in the protocol. \n\nIf such a restriction is to be added it would be any of the frontends (e.g. Mist). I suggest that you open up a feature request on the mist repo if you wish for this type of restriction to be added. \n\nClosing this because it's not an actual issue. \n",
