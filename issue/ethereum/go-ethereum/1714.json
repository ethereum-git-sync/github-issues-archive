This is making deploying contracts very difficult.\n",

Since you already have one instance running the second instance cannot create the named pipe since it already exists.\n\nThere are 2 options:\n1. Simply disable the IPC interface for one or both of your geth intances. This is no problem if you don't use it (e.g. `geth attach`). The command would than be something like `geth --genesis some.genesis.json --ipcdisable console`\n2. Specify a custom name for the pipe with the `--ipcpath` argument.

    "body": "First of all:\n\n```\ngeth --networkid=12345 --genesis C:\\Users\\106862\\genesis.json --datadir C:/Users/106862/.ethereum_experiment console\n```\n\nDoesn't connect to the main net. If you provide a custom networkid your node will not be able to connect to nodes which are on the network. If you use a recent version of geth (and you should) you can omit the genesis argument since its embedded in geth. Your command should somewhat like this\n\n`geth --datadir C:/Users/106862/.ethereum_main <more optional argument> console`\n\nIf you want to start a second node which you can use for development, testing and deployment you can setup a private network. Each geth instance needs its own datadir, unique ports and unique ipc endpoint. In your case you choose to disable the ipc interface which makes it a bit easier. And second you might want to use a custom genesis block for your private network. See https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Private-network for instructions and an example genesis file which you can adapt to your personal needs.\n\nThe command for you private instance will look something like:\n`geth --networkid 12345 --datadir c:/Users/106862/.ethereum_private --port 31313 --ipcdisable --genesis <path to genesis file> console`\n\nIf you want to do some DApp development and need the JSON RPC HTTP interface you must add the `--rpc` argument. If you want to enable the rpc interface on the main and private geth instance make sure you specify a unique port for the rpc interface with `--rpcport`.\n\nYou can find more instructions here: https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Setting-up-private-network-or-local-cluster.\n\nIf you need more help just visit the gitter channel, there are people who can help you with this.\n",
