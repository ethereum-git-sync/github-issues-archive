Even after hours, still 1 or 2 peers.\r\nI checked it several times: \r\nIf I switch back to 1.10.1, there are instantly 3 to 4 peers connected and 5 to 8 peers after ~30 minutes. \r\nBack to 1.10.2: 1 to 2 peers only.\r\nI had the same number of peers (1 to 2) before DNS discovery was implemented with 1.9.11. So maybe the DNS discovery is broken in 1.10.2?\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\r\nRunning the LES client 1.10.2\r\n",
