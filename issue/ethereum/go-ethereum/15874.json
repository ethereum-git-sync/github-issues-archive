Never before have I seen a project this bad that is also the default flagship client for a 100+ billion dollar enterprise.  \r\n\r\nIt's the default official full node client for the #2 cryptocurrency.\r\n\r\nIt also sucks really bad.\r\n\r\nIt stalls randomly, eats up GB of memory as if they were tic-tacs, and is an all-around abomination.\r\n\r\nWhat the fuck are you guys doing?  Fix your shit.  Performance tune.  Figure out why it can deadlock and fix it!\r\n\r\nI shouldn't have to restart it every couple of hours on a chain sync because it's stalled.  Only to see it happily continue downloading blocks after a restart.\r\n\r\nI shouldn't see it zip up to 8GB memory usage for no reason, only to drop back down to 900MB, then to zip up to 2.5 GB for hours.\r\n\r\nWhat the fuck is going on?\r\n\r\nIf I were you I'd be ashamed of myself.\r\n\r\nFIX YOUR CRAP!",
