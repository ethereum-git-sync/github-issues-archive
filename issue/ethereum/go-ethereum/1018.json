    "body": "I don't think this is a problem. Geth manages its memory actually quit well but go's scavenger routine will simple hold on to the memory (as most GC languages). Probably it will return the memory to the os when the environment is low on memory since some people have geth running on a raspberry.\n\nTo illustrate this I have logged the actual heap usage of geth during a full sync\n<img src=\"http://i61.tinypic.com/i6iaux.jpg\">\n\nYou can see that most of the memory (yellow line) isn't used and also not returned (purple line) to the OS. We could force it to return the memory to the os with `runtime.debug.FreeOSMemory()` but I don't think this is necessary.\n",
