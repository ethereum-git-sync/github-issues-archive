  "body": "the white paper in https://ethereum.org/zh/whitepaper/ say timestamp check mechanism in ethereum is：\r\n**\r\nThe basic block validation algorithm in Ethereum is as follows:\r\n\r\nCheck if the previous block referenced exists and is valid.\r\nCheck that the timestamp of the block is greater than that of the referenced previous block and less than _15 minutes_ into the future\r\n**\r\nhowever ，code in GitHub （https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/32150f8aa9789e4c9aa91a59085011eb692ac8ad/consensus/ethash/consensus.go) say:\r\n**\r\nallowedFutureBlockTimeSeconds = int64(15)  \r\nif header.Time > uint64(unixNow+allowedFutureBlockTimeSeconds) {\r\n\t\t\treturn consensus.ErrF\r\n**\r\none say 15 minutes, another say 15 seconds，which is right？Wish for your reply.",

    "body": "The actual yellow-paper is here: https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf \r\nAfaik, there's no definition there about the vailidity of future blocks, or how timestamps should be verified. \r\nThe 15s is the agreed-upon by node-implementors practical limit. If the block exceeeds this, then it will not be rejected per se, but just not imported right now -- it will be re-evaluated later on. \r\n\r\nWhy is this? See https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/23761#discussion_r738785512 for some more info\r\n\r\n> Currently, we have no strict (consensus) requirement about time. It's just a de-facto implementation choice, that the consensus engine will soft-reject headers too far in the future. Soft, in the sense that they're kept and attempted again later.\r\n>\r\n> One funky attack: if I can set the timestamp to whatever, then I can set it close to maxuint64, or max bigint, or whatever, and effectively halt ethereum, since nobody can mine a block with a timestamp exceeding mine. More effective probably, would be to not do that, but do it so a few thousand blocks can be mined on top of mine => more havoc. ",
