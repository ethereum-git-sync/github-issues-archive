    "body": "To clarify, this issue about if an owner has registered several names, has forgotten some of them, and would like to retrieve them.\n\n`registrar.addr(name)` assumes the owner remembers all the names (the exact strings) they have registered.  In this case, it would be helpful if there's something like `registrar.names()` and a sample output would be `[\"zelig\", \"zeligDonation\", \"zeligContracts\"]`\n\nAnother example, suppose that one of a dapp developer's account is known, and we would like to query the registrar for possible contracts/dapps/names they've developed.  It would be helpful if there's something like `registrar.names(address)` and a sample output would be `[\"coolContract\", \"gameContract\", \"engineContract\" ]`\n",
