    "body": "Mainnet was flipped over to be post-merge, meaning it always requires a beacon client sethead, even on initial genesis sync. At that point, we don't need to verify PoW any more, we just assume the security of the consensus client and run whatever it gives us. This permits us to get rid of ethash altogether.\r\n\r\nAfter stopping Rinkeby, we'll also be able to get rid of Clique, and thus completely wiping the `consensus` package and related complexity. This would also allow us to get back to having a single entry point for inserting new blocks / reorging the chain into the system. One extra needed is to have a Clique v2 that operates above the engine API.",
