  "body": "Hello, so I am trying to tweak geth so that it sets up a blockchain without gas costs. It works just fine by tweaking the command line parameters and the genesis block. The only issue is that we also use offline signing so we have to pick the nonce on our own.\r\n\r\nAfter a geth upgrade, we started to get \"Replacement transaction underpriced\" at times. What I understand is that a safeguard was added to geth so that it rejects transactions that have the same nonce as a previous transaction that has failed and it doesn't have enough gas cost. But when there's no gas cost in the network we can't just increase the gas cost to ensure that this transaction goes through. I wonder if this safeguard can be disabled when the gas cost is 0?\r\n\r\n\r\n#### System information\r\n\r\nGeth version: 1.7.2\r\nOS & Version: Ubuntu 16.04\r\n\r\n",

How can a node determine which (out of two) transactions to use, if they are equally 'good'? \r\nFrom the original description, it sounds like you are erroneously reusing nonces, thus creating \"replacement transactions\". That seems to be the core issue, not that you cannot reliably replace transactions in 0-cost chains. \r\nChanging that is not just a matter of coding -- how would it even work?
