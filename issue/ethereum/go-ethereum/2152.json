    "body": "I agree that this is a theoretical issue, and thank you for noticing.\n\nHowever, consider the following:\n\nThe largest message size allowed for eth is 10MB at this time. It applies to all messages,\neven those containing multiple blocks or transactions. The code that sends batches of blocks tries\nto keep the message size below 2MB (`softResponseLimit`), the only case where this limit could\nbe exceeded is if a single block or transaction is larger than 2MB.\n\nThe largest block to date was 2kB. We're still operating with pi million gas limit though,\nso when it raises itself blocks may become larger. But there is only so much execution\nthat can fit with 15s block time. If someone generates a 4MB 'jumbo' block, it will likely\ntake a long time to execute and a long time to propagate. So there is a bit of an incentive\nnot to make such large blocks.\n",
