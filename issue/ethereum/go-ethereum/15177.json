Currently, its the blockNumber is at 1702011.\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  currentBlock: 1702011,\r\n  highestBlock: 1711644,\r\n  knownStates: 0,\r\n  pulledStates: 0,\r\n  startingBlock: 1699999\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI have been running geth testnet for a good 3 months now and was learning about things by performing my own experiments. But, after the hard-fork as asked, I updated the geth client and since, then the syncing has been extremely slow.\r\n\r\nCan anyone help me with this or point me to right place.",
