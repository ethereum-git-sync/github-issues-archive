  "body": "My colleague and I are running a two node private network to testing and development. We are using instance: \"Geth/v1.3.3/linux/go1.5.1\". We each setup a static-node.json file each pointing to the other node. When we start geth everything works fine and they mine away happily taking turns. But if we leave it running for a day or two it seems that geth forgets its peer information and so stops syncing. I have tested this by typing admin.peers at the geth console and I see the peer information listed. Then later when I can see they are out of sync completely I type admin.peers again and it returns an empty array. Geth has been running the whole time but something has caused it to forget/empty the peers array. This has happened many times now. Each time we have to reboot the server restarting geth and let them sync again and then a day or two later it happens again. It's quite annoying. I assume it is a bug somewhere? Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n",

    "body": "We've heard a few reports list this, always using private networks and not the main/test nets. I have an idea of what might cause this. We have a feature in the network protocol that forbids remote connections more frequently than 30 seconds after a connect/drop.\n\nMy hunch is that with a 2 node network, if the connection drops for some reason, then the dropped peer will try to reconnect, but fail because the remote side doesn't accept it yet (it just dropped it), and when the remote side want's to connect, the first node doesn't accept since the 30 sec cooldown hasn't passed yet.\n\nIf this is the error, it should be fixable easily enough. I'll take a look. Thanks for the detailed report!\n",

    "body": "Hi!\n\nThanks for looking at this.\n\nWe are currently running the stable version, because when we ran development we had issues (can’t recall what), and where not sure if they were due to bugs in development so we reverted to stable and started our blockchain again. So I am slightly weary of updating to development again and introducing more issues. But I guess is our current issue is solved for certain in the development version that might be a reason to update. Can we change the verbosity logging to 6 on our stable versions and send you the logs of those? I currently have verbosity set to 4 and I think Kevin does too on his server. I currently have a massive log file from when we started our new blockchain. Not sure if verbosity 4 is enough to be worth sending you our current logs?\n\nThanks\n\nMichelle\n\nFrom: Péter Szilágyi [mailto:notifications@github.com]\nSent: 09 March 2016 11:38\nTo: ethereum/go-ethereum go-ethereum@noreply.github.com\nCc: Michelle.Bachler michelle.bachler@open.ac.uk\nSubject: Re: [go-ethereum] Geth forgetting peers list (#2250)\n\nHmm, we can't really seem to reproduce the problem.

    "body": "Hi!\n\nJust talked to Kevin and he reminded me what the issue was with running the development version. It basically got out of sync much more often and we were always having to reboot the server. And there was other odd behaviour with mining the same block on both machines etc. Not sure if it was all due to the same issue with dropping peers, but it was basically a lot worse. So on the stable the forgetting peers happens less often and mostly it is OK. On development it was a nightmare, so we really don’t want to run the development version unless it is more stable that last time we tried as we are in the middle of Dapp development and don’t want to have our nodes continually loose sync and go screwy.\n\nCould we up our verbosity to 6 on both nodes and start new log files and next time we go out of sync send you the logs?\n\nMichelle\n\nFrom: Péter Szilágyi [mailto:notifications@github.com]\nSent: 09 March 2016 11:38\nTo: ethereum/go-ethereum go-ethereum@noreply.github.com\nCc: Michelle.Bachler michelle.bachler@open.ac.uk\nSubject: Re: [go-ethereum] Geth forgetting peers list (#2250)\n\nHmm, we can't really seem to reproduce the problem.

    "body": "Hi!\n\nI recently had to create a second Ethereum blockchain. I had a lot of trouble keeping the two nodes connected. They kept dropping their peer and getting out of sync. I set the verbosity to 6 to see what I would see. It seems that one end got a ‘useless peer’ , message and dropped the peer. I did some Googling and it seems this message happens if the node thinks the peer is too far out of sink to bother synching with it anymore. Am I understanding that correctly? As this was a new network blocks where being generated really quickly. So I can see why they might quickly get out of sync. I stopped the mining on one of the two nodes and at the console kept running addPeer each time admin.peers came back empty to keep trying to connected them. Sometimes I had to stop both mining before I could get addPeer to work. The block count is now on 3000 and the block generation is slowing down a bit and now with only one of the two nodes mining it seems to be keeping them both in sync. As the block count goes up and the block generation slows down I will experiment with them both mining again to see if they stay syned.\n\nBut the underlying issues seems to be that even though this is a two node network with a static peers file and nodiscover set in the geth command, the underlying peer-to-peer protocol does not seem to care that these nodes should NEVER be disconnected and still throws a useless peer and disconnects them from each other. I am now wondering if this is also what is happening on the other, more established network where I reported the disconnection issue, where they lose connection every 2-4 days. I don’t know the peer-to-peer code, but if you are running a fixed network of set nodes, is there some way of telling it never to just decide a node is a ‘useless peer’ and always to keep synching them?\n\nThanks\n\nMichelle\n\nFrom: Péter Szilágyi [mailto:notifications@github.com]\nSent: 09 March 2016 12:06\nTo: ethereum/go-ethereum go-ethereum@noreply.github.com\nCc: Michelle.Bachler michelle.bachler@open.ac.uk\nSubject: Re: [go-ethereum] Geth forgetting peers list (#2250)\n\nMost of the juicy stuff happens at log level 6, so probably that would be needed.
