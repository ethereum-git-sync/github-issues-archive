  "body": "I ran the RPC tests again and found some minor issues, which i would like to see fixed:\n- [ ] `eth_getBlockByNumber` should return `null` for the block hash when its a pending block, using \"pending\"\n- [x] `eth_getFilterLogs` should return logs in the order from oldest to newest (to match cpp and make it better for dapp developers using web3, as every filter first uses getFilterLogs and then polls. Which in go makes the callback called with logs in this order `[5,4,3,2,1,'start polling', 6,7,8...]`)\n- [ ] The provided account in the block tests `0xa94f5374fce5edbc8e2a8697c15331677e6ebf0b` is not unlocked by default! @Gustav-Simonsson Actually it seems like this account is not event added anymore to the account set in `eth_accounts` (And should be removed after!)\n",
