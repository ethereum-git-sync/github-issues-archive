  "body": "Hi there,\r\n\r\nMy account has been flagged by @ethereum, but I don't know what I did wrong.\r\n\r\nThe following is the operation record before I was flagged:\r\n\r\n1. I found a typographical error when viewing the wiki of Etherum's JSON-RPC interface (URL: https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC#eth_newpendingtransactionfilter).\r\n\r\n2. By looking at revisions I found that Nathapon8899 changed \"edit mode\" to cause this error (Nathapon8899's home page has become 404).\r\n\r\n3. I restored \"edit mode\" and the page is displayed normally.\r\n\r\n4. My account has been flaggedby @ethereum.\r\n\r\nThe above process can be viewed through revisions. (https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC/_history)\r\n\r\nIf my behavior violates the @ethereum agreement, please let me know and I will apologize for it.\r\n\r\nThanks.",
