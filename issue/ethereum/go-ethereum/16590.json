I have some ether on it and would like to recover them...\r\n\r\nIs there a way to make it connect to the peers again, and transfer my ether to a new wallet ?\r\n\r\nHere is the printscreen :\r\n\r\n![eth](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34656616/39373017-85ca7cea-4a46-11e8-9a79-897aaea02bfa.jpg)\r\n\r\nThanks in advance to anyone who could help me.\r\n\r\nBan\r\n\r\n",
