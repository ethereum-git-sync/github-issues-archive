  "body": "It would appear that the ABI does not test for, nor is it correct for how to handle packing of static arrays from solidity. Per the Solidity End to End Tests here: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/test/libsolidity/SolidityEndToEndTest.cpp#L3858-L3880 static arrays should be handled by passing them in sequentially, no offset nor word length needed. I am currently working on a PR and would love to contribute soon as someone confirms with me that I am not mistaken and this is incorrect functionality of the ABI. \n",
