In order to get the base fee for the current block, eth_getBlockByNumber method is called. \r\n\r\nEven if the geth client opts to use fixed gas priced tx (also known as LegacyTx) eth_getBlockByNumber method is still called, which is unnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are the use-cases?\r\n\r\nGeth clients using fixed gas price transactions can avoid making unnecessary calls to the RPC.\r\n\r\n# Implementation\r\n\r\nDo you have ideas regarding the implementation of this feature?\r\nBy reorganizing the code flow in method transact from bind.BoundContract the extra call can be avoided.\r\n\r\nAre you willing to implement this feature?\r\nYes.",
