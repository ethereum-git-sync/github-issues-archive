Network is really crammed, might be a contributing reason?\r\nThe pending txns list doesnt work properly either, but even when it returns the correct pending txns it doesn't work to resend the txn.\r\n\r\n#### Actual behaviour\r\n\r\nError: Transaction \"some random hash\" not found\r\n    at web3.js:3104:20\r\n    at web3.js:6191:15\r\n    at web3.js:5004:36\r\n    at <anonymous>:1:1\r\n\r\nThe \"some random hash\" in the error is not the same as the txn in pendingTransactions[0]. It is not found in the mempool nor previous blocks; To clarify, it returns \"Error: Transaction x not found\", where x is some hash. This hash remains the same after restarts of geth.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\r\n\r\nResend a pending txn **WITH DATA**\r\n\r\nSeems to be related to problem described here:\r\nhttps://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/16269/geth-transactions-stuck-in-pending-resend-fails",

    "body": "Calling eth.pendingTransactions after sending a txn will return the txn, but sometimes (and this seems correlated to high ethereum network load / high amount of pending txns) no txns is returned even though they were sent very recently (and are not yet confirmed). They will maybe show up again in 5 minutes, but this behaviour is very inconsistent in my experience.\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\nOk I believe I have found the source of the problem. Transaction fails when there is data sent with the txn.\r\nIn the json rpc:\r\neth_pendingTransactions returns transactions, but the returned transaction object has no 'data' property, instead it is named 'input'. When trying to send the transaction again with eth_resend(...) you have to manually copy the 'input' and create a 'data' field in the transaction for it to go through.\r\n\r\nIn other words:\r\neth_pendingTransactions returns objects with 'input' property. \r\neth_resend uses 'data' for its input, which is not present in transactions from eth_pendingTransactions",
