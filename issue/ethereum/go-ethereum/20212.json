RPC has it's own web3 quirky format, which sometimes merges a lot of different pieces of data together to form a single result json.\r\n\r\nAll in all, if you are writing your own Go code, it might be cleaner to stick to the individual Go types (e.g. block, transaction) and not use the convoluted web3 API specs. You should already be able to convert all Go Ethereum types into json by themselves.\r\n\r\nCould you detail what you're trying to do exactly?

    "body": "Hi @karalabe,\r\n\r\nI can second the above request for making `ethapi` external, but I've needed that for a different reason which I can detail.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nI'm trying to use `go-ethereum`'s RPC API over a simulated back-end object as a library. I'm using a simulated back-end for smart contracts from another programming language and would like to have some fallback access to the simulated back-end state through the RPC API rather than having to implement each end-point one by one.\r\n\r\nIn order to set up the RPC API I'm using `NewServer()` and using a bi-directional pipe as the `codec`. The place where this approach fails is that `APIs()` are only available to full or light ethereum clients, but not the simulated back-end. The simulated back-end exposes `GetAPIs()` but this function is only available as part of `internal/ethapi`.\r\n\r\nAs a result I'm trying to effectively copy & paste the whole `internal/api` folder in my codebase but running into another related [issue](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/20226) that I've filed.\r\n\r\nWould love to also hear your guidance on how to achieve this and hope this helps support the overall thinking around the `ethapi`!\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n**To summarize - from my perspective there should be a way to use `APIs` or `GetAPIs` with the simulated back-end, I wouldn't actually need the whole `ethapi` package to be exposed.**",

Instead, it gives you a way to get the core/types data structures out of any implementation of the web3 RPC API. The core/types types cannot represent all the data returned by the API because the API assumes a slightly different data model.\r\n\r\nIf you want to make a generic cache, it would be much better to just decode the RPC results into `json.RawMessage` and cache that. You can do that by using `rpc.Client` instead of `ethclient.Client`.",
