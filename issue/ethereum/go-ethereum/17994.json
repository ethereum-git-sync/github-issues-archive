  "body": "Geth returns 0x0 in the mixHash field when running against Rinkeby (also POA). Parity connected to Kovan doesn't return the field at all. While you could argue that parity Kovan should be fixed, I think doing such a fix on the server is more involved than doing it on the client side. However this is a discussion that should be had.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if the go-ethereum ethclient would gracefully ignore the field not being present (i.e. treat it as a null value). I don't know if there's an easy way to distinguish between POA/POW chains and only error out when interacting with a POW chain and the field is missing.\r\n\r\nPlease also refer to the parity-ethereum issue where this is discussed: https://github.com/paritytech/parity-ethereum/issues/8841\r\n\r\n#### System information\r\nGeth version: 1.8.15\r\nOS & Version: Linux\r\n\r\n#### Expected behaviour\r\nI should be able to use ethclient to communicate with a parity node connected to the kovan POA testnet. \r\n\r\n#### Actual behaviour\r\nGeth returns 0x0 in the mixHash field when running against Rinkeby (also POA). It would be great if the go-ethereum ethclient would gracefully ignore the field not being present (i.e. treat it as a null value). I don't know if there's an easy way to distinguish between POA/POW chains and only error out when interacting with a POW chain and the field is missing.\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\r\nSubmit a transaction to a parity node connected to kovan. The implications of this bug are identical to #3230 but #3230 was due to an incompatibility of the parity client in general when this field was added to the endpoint in the first place. \r\n\r\n",
