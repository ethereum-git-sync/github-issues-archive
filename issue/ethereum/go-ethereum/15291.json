It is on Rinkeby.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Actual behaviour\r\nTransaction fails https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x649e93905489b7e3fdfaede7f0610862d2288a4a take a look at this account. It is on Rinkeby. I cannot send even 1 ether from this account. I tried Mist/Wallet and Truffle.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\r\nIf you look at the last 6 transactions and time stamps and amounts you would see that the account balance would go below 0.  Yet, these transactions were mined, confirmed and are on rinkeby.etherscan.io   It is complicated to explain all the steps that got this account to this point. Can do it in an interactive session.\r\n\r\nWhen the account got into this state I may have been still on geth 1.6.6 The account appears now to be permanently unable to send ether.\r\n#### Backtrace\r\n\r\n````\r\n[backtrace]\r\n````\r\n",
