  "body": "I've noticed after updating to 1.10.1 (ropsten chain) we have problem on tx gas limit estimation (Or I'm doing something wrong). Sometimes, tx estimation is not enough, up to several times. One of the interesting moments, that we have met:\r\n```\r\n// Let assume we are calling one contract in sequentially:\r\n1) transferFrom(A, B, x) 45,415 gas limit // tansfer from A -> B x tokens\r\n2) transferFrom(A, B, x) 36,415 gas limit // tansfer from A -> B x tokens\r\n```\r\nLast tx has been estimated to 36,415 - it might be EVM optimizations, I guess. But it failed due to `Out of Gas`.\r\nHere they are:\r\n1) https://ropsten.etherscan.io/tx/0x2c6111b36e2e68c3d145265b93dc785b3958c0ea9957c6e06c9d3cb98d444465 (Ok)\r\n2) https://ropsten.etherscan.io/tx/0xdbe1a610cea66d19b5575642b8555a9050b5eac026517aff91aea02530083d13 (Failed)\r\n\r\nThe next interesting moment we have here very similar case:\r\n```\r\n// Let assume we are calling one contract in sequentially, again:\r\n1) transferFrom(A, B, x) 45,415 gas limit // tansfer from A -> B x tokens\r\n2) transferFrom(A, B, x) 45,415 gas limit // tansfer from A -> B x tokens\r\n3) transferFrom(A, B, x) 36,415 gas limit // tansfer from A -> B x tokens\r\n```\r\n1) https://ropsten.etherscan.io/tx/0xcef794158c1ec7f5c6f04fd0575c0e90ce88c3949db7dff1abd120f7baf77470 (Ok)\r\n2) https://ropsten.etherscan.io/tx/0x4445d678c7a754f430627e40eeae1cfc038472645d1b5125f1e0bcbe506e8016 (Ok)\r\n3) https://ropsten.etherscan.io/tx/0x8accaa855f0a42fd94c6ec107f87fbb0fcd17f7507bd576afaee9943e67b465d (Failed)\r\n\r\nThese cases are could be reproduced easily. Idk why that working like this. Each case handled txs into one block. But I have some other cases, but it's difficult to catch.",
