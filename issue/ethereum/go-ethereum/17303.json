Block downloads are significantly slower when not fetched as part of the light sync, and it prevents  bloomFilter optimizations when querying getLogs. Since I know what block number the contract set was uploaded, I would like to use that for light node sync.\r\n\r\nSomething like\r\n```\r\ngeth --syncmode light --lightstartblock 5902200\r\n```\r\n\r\n",
