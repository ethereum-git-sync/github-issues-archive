We have been providing this as an option and the best thing it has helped us over the years is testing all tooling related to traces.\r\n\r\nAs PUSH0 / shanghai came about, things aren't working on our PoA testnets without using older versions of EVM to compile, which can be a pain.\r\n\r\n# Implementation\r\n\r\nDo you have ideas regarding the implementation of this feature?\r\nI just need it to \"work\" more than I need it to be chain-accurate, I really have no idea.\r\n\r\nAre you willing to implement this feature?\r\nI don't know how capable I would be otherwise yes, though I am also not sure how much time I will be able to find. If it really came down to it, then yes I would try, unless it really is impossible.",
