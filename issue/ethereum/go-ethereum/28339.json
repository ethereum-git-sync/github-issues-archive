  "body": "I use a Goroutine to iterate over blocks with ranged filter queries, batching the chunks. But it doesn't matter how many chunks I use in the routine, there is a moment the node keeps on taking all the CPU and it keeps on going like this even when exiting the program. Is this normal behavior ? It seems that even if you do a blocking routine ( to wait for the node to process the calls ) it gets overwhelmed and it crashes. Summarizing : what is the correct way to massively parse logs without killing the node? \r\n",
