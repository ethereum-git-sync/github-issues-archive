  "body": "I learned about GETH a few days ago. I need Geth to create wallets of etherum and make transactions with these wallets (I use geth instead of third-party api to create some programs related to eth). I very much hope that you will help me understand the following:\r\n\r\n 1. What are the minimum system requirements for geth? (for creating accounts, making transactions)\r\n 2. Is it necessary to synchronize a blockchain for creating accounts, making transactions?\r\n 3. If not, how does it work? How to make an account and transaction without synchronization?\r\n 4. How do I know if the synchronization is complete?\r\n 5. Will errors occur when synchronizing the blockchain if you accidentally disable geth? (server shutdown or geth process termination)\r\n 6. If so, how can I check for errors in the synchronized blockchain?\r\n 7. Are there any alternatives that have web3 access?\r\n8. I have a server running with geth --fast --cache = 2048.   \r\n System: cpu amd athlon II x2 220, 4 GB ram, 500 gb hdd 5400 rpm, OS ubuntu 16.04 x64. \r\n With such parameters, ram is loaded to 100%, + 1GB swap file of 4 GB. I tried to change the parameter --cache to 128, 256, 512, 1024 and even to 16 MB, but ram always get 100% loaded. Blockchain is synchronized for 6 days already, blockNumber still 0. \r\n **Is this normal?** \r\n\r\n> *P.S. Sorry for my english, this is not my native language.*\r\n> *P.P.S. If you know the answer to at least one question, please answer me.*\r\n\r\n#### System information\r\n\r\nGeth version: `1.7.3`\r\nOS & Version: ubuntu 16.04 x64",
