  "body": "Apologies for posting this in here, if I could tag it with assistance I would.\r\n\r\nIm working on reworking clique consensus algo to take a predefined list of signers from a text file and use them as validators - my PoC works seamlessly, however, when i take all nodes offline, then start them back up, each signer reports that they are not authroized and that the hash chain is invalid.\r\n\r\nFrom initial look everything seems fine, I cant seem to figure out why the network works so long as everyone is online and then dies with this warning.. perhaps someone can help me understand this to a better degree or if anyone is willing to help there is a bounty ;)\r\n\r\nI posted a similar issue here but this one is related to block difficulty https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/17056\r\n\r\nIf necessary I can supply a bash script and setup which will reproduce the issue @karalabe @anyone :)",
