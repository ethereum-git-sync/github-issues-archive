  "body": "About a year ago we've split out Ethash into it's own consensus package `consensus/ethash` and started supporting a more-or-less pluggable consensus model along with the Clique engine in package `consensus/clique`. Most of the codebase was refactored, but certain parts we're not essential for day-to-day use so were left behind. These however cause dependency leakages between `ethash`, `miner` and `core`, which make further development of these packages hard.\r\n\r\nOne of the current annoyances is that `core.ChainMaker` currently heavily depends on the ethash consensus engine for difficulty calculation as well as block reward accumulation. I'd like to break this dependency by having `ChainMaker` use a [`consensus.Engine`](https://godoc.org/github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/consensus#Engine) interface instead of ethash directly.\r\n\r\nThis task might require massaging a bit the `consensus.Engine` interface, as well as may have some open questions regarding the internals of `core.ChainMaker`.",
