EIP-2930 and EIP-1559 declare a `yParity` property on those transactions which is defined as \"The parity (0 for even, 1 for odd) of the y-value of a secp256k1 signature.\"  `v` is not defined anywhere in either of those EIPs and what one might put in a variable called `v` is incredibly ambiguous as it could be any of:\r\n1. yParity + 27\r\n2. yParity + 35 + 2 * chainId\r\n3. yParity (what I think geth is doing)\r\n\r\nWhile I advocate for fixing the source code to use `yParity` instead of `v` for type 1 and 2 transactions internally so the code is more readable and follows the specification closer, what actually matters here is that the JSON-RPC should be including a `yParity` in any transaction response with a type 1 or type 2 transaction.\r\n\r\nFor backward compatibility, it seems reasonable to continue to include a `v` value that contains whatever it contains now, with perhaps some plan (or not) to eventually remove it.",
