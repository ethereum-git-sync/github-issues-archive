    "body": "Well, the transaction pool is constantly morphing. It tracks about 4K pending transactions in total. Those will be the most expensive ones + any local transactions. Whenever space is freed up (a new block is processed), new transactions are accepted into the pool from the network. Also if a transaction arrives that's more expensive than the previous ones, it will push one out.\r\n\r\nIt's not possible to get *all pending transactions globally in Ethereum*, rather you can only get the best ~4K from your own node's perspective.",
