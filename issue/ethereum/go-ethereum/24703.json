  "body": "Hello, I need help)\r\nI need to start geth, so that 1) my node receives all transactions in txpool, 2) my \"pending\" block would be empty(no transactions). \r\nI am using Version: 1.10.17-stable syncmode full, node is fully synced. \r\nI have tried all combinations of --txpool.pricelimit,--miner.gasprice, --mine.\r\nIf I start without \"--mine\"(--miner.gasprice is ignored) and do web3.eth.getBlock(\"pending\"). My pending block becomes filled with transactions. \r\nIf I start with --mine and --miner.gasprice 10000000000000(so no tx get in pending block) , my node stops receiving all transactions at all(I think there is a bug here, because in case --mine + --miner.gasprice, --miner.gasprice  start to act like --txpool.pricelimit and none tx gets in txpool)\r\nSo, there are 2 outcomes now, node receives all txs but pending block becomes filled with txs, or node does not receive txs at all. \r\nIs there a way to make node receive txs but not to include them in pending block?",
