  "body": "Have been trying to fire up a private network based largely upon the Goerli `dumpgenesis` with Clique PoA\r\n\r\nIf I keep the following lines in the genesis that make the network think it's post-merge (so I can use PUSH0), it switches to PoS and searches for a beacon chain before falling over quite quickly:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n        \"shanghaiTime\": 0,\r\n        \"terminalTotalDifficulty\": 0,\r\n        \"terminalTotalDifficultyPassed\": true,\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I remove these options, then the network remains PoA but PUSH0 does not work (i.e. London)\r\n\r\nI note a similar issue was raised under #27327 which resulted in code changes, which fires up a simulated beacon chain by using the `--dev` switch. But this is PoS and not PoA.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to run a private PoA network that is compatible with Shanghai/PUSH0?",

    "body": "Currently, you only have two options:\r\n\r\n- either use the `dev` network which mocks consensus and gives you a workable dev environment\r\n- or setup your own merged network with a real consensus layer\r\n  - to understand it, read [How to merge an Ethereum network right from the genesis block](https://dev.to/q9/how-to-merge-an-ethereum-network-right-from-the-genesis-block-3454)\r\n  - or go strait to take a look at [pari's ansible playbooks](https://github.com/ethereumjs/consensus-deployment-ansible)\r\n\r\nTo make the beacon chain permissioned (as in PoA), you would have to modify the deposit contract (as [Sepolia](https://github.com/eth-clients/sepolia) does). But I'm not sure the Geth team can help you with that, it's pretty much out of scope for the client development.\r\n\r\nHope that helps.",
