  "body": "#### System information\r\n\r\nGeth version: v1.6.1-stable-021c3c28 and v1.6.0-stable-facc47cb\r\nOS & Version: Linux (Ubuntu 16.04) and Windows 10\r\n\r\n#### Details\r\nI have two computers running Geth\r\n\r\nOn both computers I have a static-nodes.json and a trusted-nodes.json file in the datadir and they contain one entry: the other node...\r\n\r\nI am under the impression that placing a node into trusted-nodes.json would not count against the maxpeers? However, running Geth with default maxpeers (not specifying --maxpeers, which defaults to 25) results in the systems not connecting to each other when net.peerCount = 25 on one of the nodes.\r\n\r\nIf I were to restart the node with a peer count of 25 they'll connect to each other just fine. So it appears to me that the trusted-nodes.json is being ignored when default maxpeers is reached?\r\n\r\nOne node is v1.6.1-stable-021c3c28 and the other is v1.6.0-stable-facc47cb\r\n\r\nI can reproduce at any time as one of my nodes is pretty much \"public\" over 30303 and always has 25 nodes, while the other does not...\r\n\r\nThis might be related to #3326\r\n\r\n#### Expected behaviour\r\nNodes configured in trusted-nodes.json connect to each other regardless of the number of peers connected\r\n\r\n#### Actual behaviour\r\nNodes configured in trusted-nodes.json only connect if current peer count is less than maxpeers\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\r\nconfigure trusted-nodes.json on two systems\r\nstart one system and let it reach maxpeers (without the --maxpeers setting this is 25)\r\nstart the other system, they will not connect",
