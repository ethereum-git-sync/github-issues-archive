That contract sends out log events for each incoming transaction so it's easily to follow in your own systems. This has the added benefit that you can make sure that you have sufficient access control to withdraw money out of your contract. \n\nJust trying to help, if you want to argue your point I suggest contacting @obscuren since I think he is pretty avidly against building such RPC methods. \n",
