  "body": "#### System information\r\n\r\nGeth version: any `>=1.8.0`\r\nOS & Version: All\r\n\r\n#### Expected behaviour\r\nWhisper should bundle messages up to the message size accepted by a given peer and potentially send a few bundles one after another in order to broadcast all pending messages. \r\n\r\nWhisper already knows peers' PoW values and bloom filters. It skips messages with lower PoW than accepted by the peer or if a message topic is not included in the peer's bloom filter.\r\n\r\nThe same approach could be used to handle bundles that exceed peer's message size. The requirement is that a node knows its peers' message size limits.\r\n\r\n#### Actual behaviour\r\nCurrently, a Whisper node does not check its peers' message size limits and create a bundle as large as the size of all not broadcasted messages. Even if all individual messages are smaller than peer's limit, the bundle might exceed that limit. \r\n\r\nBefore introducing https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/15666, each message was sent individually and the message size limit applied to each message. After introducing message bundling, the message size limit started being applied to bundles instead.\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\r\n1. Run a Whisper node A and post many small messages with long TTL to it,\r\n2. Before TTL expires, start a new Whisper node B with a small message size limit and connect it to the node A,\r\n3. Whisper node A collects all messages in a single bundle and tries to send it to Whisper node B,\r\n4. Whisper node B receives the bundle but as it exceeds its message size limit, it's discarded and the peer A is disconnected.\r\n\r\nIf the bundle was divided into smaller ones, the whole operation would succeed (provided that each message is smaller than node's B message size limit).\r\n",
