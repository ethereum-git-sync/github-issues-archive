  "body": "Hi guys, \n\nsince updating geth to 1.3.5 the cmd crashes after about 20 minutes (15 - 35 minutes), the window with ethminer kepps working. The error message was something like \"Host for console window stopped working (1 to 1 translation from german windows version); Event Data: \nconhost.exe \n6.1.7601.19160 \n56bcc7d3 \nconhost.exe \n6.1.7601.19160 \n56bcc7d3 \nc0000005 \n00000000000013e1 \nff8 \n01d17d9b5562bbc7 \nC:\\Windows\\system32\\conhost.exe \nC:\\Windows\\system32\\conhost.exe \n16133dc0-e992-11e5-9303-d05099194091 \n\nI downloaded this hotfix (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2961980) which seems to work, no more crashes. Now geth stops updating the console window after about 20 minutes, but it seems that the wallet is still sync, since it gets new blocks. Is there any way to check if ethminer solves synced blocks?\n\nUpdate:\nI tried the old geth version which worked before - same problem\n\nI'am using Windows 7\nWalletversion: 0.5.1\nSolo Mining \nGeth start Command: \nstart \"\" geth --rpc --rpcaddr \"localhost\" --rpcport 8545\n\nNo problems with poolmining (Coinotron)\n\nThank you for your help :)\n",
