This is the “workaround” I have.\r\n\r\nI have been attempting to sync geth on SSD-backed VPS instances with multiple cores and over 8GB of RAM (and 4GB of swap). Fast sync will complete, pivot, and then blocks will trickle in at a rate of one every 20 seconds or so (while blocks are generated ~15 sec on average). Peer count doesn’t matter, disk IO doesn’t appear to matter (I’m below the allotted IOPS for the instance), however geth is always using 100% of a single core during this process.",

To test, I spun up a VM using 20 cores of a Xeon v5 with 40GB RAM, and a SATA SSD, then also attempted the same VM on the same hardware with 4 cores and 8GB RAM. System resources were mostly blocked on I/O access in either case, so the sync issues don't appear to scale too much with any hardware other than I/O.\r\n\r\nThe VPS I am attempting to run geth on is a 4GB RAM, 2x Xeon E5-2650v4, with 60G SSD over NAS and 20G on the system drive.\r\n\r\nI have noted there are supposed to be improvements in 1.8.0 (unstable) on how much it thrashes disk. This appears to accelerate syncing on my local (NVMe-backed) laptops, the SATA SSD lab box I spun up the VM on, and the VPS, however the VPS is still trailing about ~1000 blocks behind mainnet, with \"imported new chain segment\" happening every 8-30(!) seconds, importing a single block at a time. Geth uses anywhere between 50-150% CPU for itself all the time. It is worthwhile to try 1.8.0 and see if you also see any sync improvement.",
