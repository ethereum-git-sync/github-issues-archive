Sometimes they don't even know it's geth. And also not which version.\n\nThe second reaction would be to ask what appears in the logs. But since most users simply double click the mist wallet dapp, the logs are lost in stdout somewhere.\n#### Actual behaviour\n\nUser has to manually pipe the log to a file (and to know how to use a command line).\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\n\nRun `geth`.\n#### Rationale\n\nI fear this might be closed as \"works as desired\", I see [piping is the way to go](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Getting-Geth#using-stderr). But at least I would like to get an opinion, why there is no debug logging enabled and maybe an indication if this could be implemented or not.\n",

The log files are rotated and stored in a platform-specific directory.\nOn OS X, the latest log is `~/Library/Application Support/Mist/node.log`\nOn Windows, it is `C:\\Users\\<name>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Mist\\node.log`.\nThere used to be a button in the Mist menu that opens this folder.\n\ngeth itself is intended to run in many environments and logging to a file isn't always feasible or the best way.

Are they majority of us cases? If they are 'edge' cases I suggest to flip logic. Enable logs by default, but add option to stop them when needed.\n",
