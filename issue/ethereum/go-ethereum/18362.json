If this happens, continuing to synchronize for a while after reboot will still result in data compression.\r\n4.

I hope to get help, thanks to everyone who responded\r\n",

    "body": "@holiman  Sorry you feel that way, but this issue has been around for a loooong time. Didn't want to spend more time researching this, but for the last year it was reported at early june, several times here, on github.\r\nTaking point from your reply I believe that back in june a lot of people used summer as time to decompress and take a vacation. I guess after that a 'back to school' was taking place. :)\r\n...\r\n\r\nLong time ago I was dealing with bitcoin, litecoin, doge. With all of these I've used a software that I didn't pay for. It may surprise you, but I've never ran in any issues with these... But eth.\r\n\r\nYou may get a feeling that I'm a little upset. I'm not upset. I'm pissed off wasting my time with a software that I didn't pay for. And as I said in another thread, if you guys don't know what you are doing, hire some people that doing this for a living, not for fun,\r\nIn other words, either do it the right way, or don't do it at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
