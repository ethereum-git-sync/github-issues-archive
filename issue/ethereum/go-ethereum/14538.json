Or perhaps you're not synced, and such it only knows it created the contract, but can't find it yet on your local chain? Best ask the Mist people about this. @frozeman @luclu \r\n\r\nRegarding how you can recover the funds, I'm assuming it's a multisig contract (or similar). I'd say that you should be able to interact with the contract with the account you used to create it. Again though, @frozeman @luclu please jump i with details.",

    "body": "@DSofter can you describe the steps involved creating and transferring that wallet? Do you remember if there were two transactions? Did you manually deploy the contract? Did you wait for the wallet to have 12 confirmations?\r\n\r\nI just discussed with the team and the only way we can see something like that happening is if you deployed a wallet, immediately sent ether to it, and then there was a chain reorganization in which the wallet did not deploy. It's a very weird case\r\n\r\nIf that's the case there's a chance of recovering that ether, specially if you didn't make any other transactions with that account: if you use the next nonces to deploy a multisig transaction then there's a chance that you'll be able to deploy a wallet in that contract and recover it.\r\n\r\n",
