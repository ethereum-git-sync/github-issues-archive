When I place it in the more recent develop versions of 1.4 I do not see it in my list of accounts after I start the geth node.   \n\nThe only difference with this account is that it is contained in a subdirectory of the same account name inside the keystore directory. \n\nI am not sure if this has something to do with when the pre-frontier account keys were changed to a new format or not. I have had no problem using this key up until the past few weeks. \n\nI need to get it working as I have used it extensively for building contracts and other transactions.\nThis is NOT a password issue. I believe it to be a format issue. as I can see it and interact with that account in geth 1.35.\n",
