  "body": "I want to promote transactions from queued to pending according to rules that there is only one special type transaction in the block.How to achieve it? \r\nI find function `func (m *txSortedMap) Ready(start uint64) types.Transactions ` will remove transactions not  promoted.Then I save these transactions  not  promoted and add a channel to notify when to promote them.But the whole program will be blocked after doing this.\r\nI would  appreciate it if you can give me some advice. Thanks.",
