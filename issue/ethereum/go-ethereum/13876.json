A huge consensus refactor was merged into Geth yesterday I believe to cater for different consensus engines, and it broke the miner for low difficulty networks. There's a PR https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/13870 to fix it, but it still needs a review confirm to merge. Feel free to run that PR, it should be stable enough (given that you're running master branch anyway) :)",

    "body": "Agg nth, not able to mine. This ismy genesis.json\r\n{\r\n    \"config\": {\r\n        \"chainId\": 15,\r\n        \"homesteadBlock\": 0,\r\n        \"eip155Block\": 0,\r\n        \"eip158Block\": 0\r\n    },\r\n    \"difficulty\": \"0x4000\",\r\n    \"gasLimit\": \"0xffffffff\",\r\n    \"nonce\": \"0x0000000000000042\",\r\n    \"mixhash\": \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\",\r\n    \"coinbase\": \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\",\r\n    \"timestamp\": \"0x00\",\r\n    \"parentHash\": \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\",\r\n    \"extraData\": \"0x4000\",\r\n    \"alloc\": {}\r\n}\r\n\r\nAnd following all instructions. No errors on running geth simply miner.start(1); does nothing. THis is my geth command geth --datadir \"/tmp/dataDir/1\" --networkid 12345001 --verbosity 3  --vmodule=ethash=5 --ipcdisable --rpc --port 30301 --rpcport 8545 --rpcaddr localhost console 2>> /tmp/dataDir/nodo1.log \r\n\r\nI have both TCP and UDP enabled for 30300-30500 range ports but still not seeing peers if they are not on the same AWS instance and no mining by any mean. Don't know what I am doing wrong:\r\n\r\n1.- Run geth with genesis.json\r\n2.- RUn geth to create accounts\r\n3.- Alloc the accounts in genesis\r\n4.- Delete dataDir/numNode/geth and reload genesis to pre fund --> this is OK\r\n5.- RUn the above command on same machine with diff port, rpcport and directory or in different mahcines\r\n6.- If they are on same I run admin.addPeer I got true always but only connected on local\r\n7.- None of the local instances nor different machines can mine\r\n\r\nDon't know what I am doing wrongly in the flow. I have validated that flow in several private network and private blockchains  pages. Still trying !!!! \r\n\r\nBest regards and tks vm for help\r\n\r\nSalvador\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
