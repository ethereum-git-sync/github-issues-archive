My belief is that it is printing \"true\" for every event the filter accepts, and \"false\" for _every other_ event. My private blockchain has quite a load of old contract events, so the terminal runs out of scrolling history immediately.\n\nSee also #1182. It's doing this every event, even those that happened before the callback was made.\n",
