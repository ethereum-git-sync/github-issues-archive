  "body": "#### System information\r\n\r\nGeth version: 1.10.19 (but behavior appears unchanged in .21)\r\nOS & Version: Linux\r\n\r\n#### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nA node that is only asked about \"recent\" logs/receipts via `eth_getLogs` should be able to handle a high volume of that RPC without duplicate trips to the raw level DB.\r\n\r\n#### Actual behaviour\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/17610 we added a `receiptsCache` LRU to `BlockChain` to prevent redundant db lookups and RLP decodes of receipts and logs from the DB.  However, it appears that changes introduced in https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/23147 circumvent that LRU cache completely, leading to what appears to me to be a performance regression in `eth_getLogs` RPC performance.\r\n\r\nWith a recent version of geth, under only moderate `eth_getLogs` load that only accesses logs from the last 128 blocks, we quickly see that a significant portion of the nodes flamegraph is spent in the new `ReadLogs` method:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53520/181306703-2f6f9973-2362-4b64-9c6a-651c6df4b455.png)\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\r\n\r\nIt's pretty easy to reproduce:\r\n\r\n- sync a node to head, preferably mainnet since it has the most logs in a given block.\r\n- generate some load on the geth node, for example using `hey` (https://github.com/rakyll/hey): `hey -c 5 -z 30s -t 0 -m POST -T application/json -d '{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\", \"id\": 1123123, \"method\": \"eth_getLogs\", \"params\": [{}]}' http://0.0.0.0:8545/`\r\n- even with only 5 concurrent `eth_getLogs` requests for the latest logs like the above, note that a non-trivial amount of time is spent in `ReadLogs`:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53520/181310632-135d13ef-9f7f-497a-97fe-af109dd2c0d5.png)\r\n\r\n- raise the number of concurrent requests to 50 (`-c 50`) and note that the amount of time spent in `ReadLogs` increases as well:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53520/181311227-12ad0632-f182-4b9a-be93-9ad3a1ccc873.png)\r\n\r\nOne would expect that the recent block's receipts/logs is only read from the raw DB once per block, and thus that the relative amount of time spent in `ReadLogs` would go down rather than up under increased load.\r\n",
