    "body": "In the old site, clicking the accordion header would take you to the index page defined for the section. This doesn't necessarily have to be the first page (though we could make it the first page by convention).  We decided to have this model because it gives us control over what users will see first, without always having to create a special 'index' page.\r\n \r\n> Would you like me to get rid of those in lieu of having the section header also being a link?\r\n\r\nIMHO it is confusing to make the accordion header be its own page. It should just be a link to one of the pages within the group.",
