  "body": "Does anyone else have issues with bootnodes ?\r\n\r\nI have deployed 2 bootnodes, 6 signing nodes and 2 standard nodes.\r\n\r\nMy nodes rarely find each other via them or do with difficulty/time and usually i have to opt for the using ```addPeer``` or ```static-nodes.json``` to get them talking to each other.\r\n\r\nits not a networking issue as i can locate and connect using netcat ```nc -nv -u ipaddress 30301``` and my aws security group is open to receiving UDP packets on port 30301 (even tried TCP for the hell of it)\r\n\r\nFrom what i see to get a reliable operating network you need each node and signer to be able to discover more than 1 other node, so far when any node actually manages to discover another it seems to only add 1 peer maximum (even though i have 2 bootnodes). \r\n\r\nIm guessing this is a fault of the go-ethereum core for the bootnode, i saw elsewhere that you guys operate full nodes as bootnodes for the rinkeby network, perhaps this is the best option ? [after testing this method i can confirm better reliability]\r\n\r\nCan anyone offer more insight into how to operate the correct ratio of bootnodes to ensure a sufficient level of connectivity/discoverability.",
