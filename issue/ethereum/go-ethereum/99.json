The Ethereum instance manages the private key: Ask the Ethereum instance to make and the transaction.\n    + edit: or maybe A can ask the ethereum instance to make the transaction, but the Ethereum instance asks B instead.\n2. The application manages a private key: It creates a transaction and sends the signed transaction.\n\nThe bit that signs it basically has the problem 'does the user really want to send this message?' Imo contract/interface-to-contract writers might have to be able to write a little code so they have some control over what the user sees before signing a transaction.\n",

    "body": "I thought of the same pattern. There should be a JSON RPC Client that implements the public API. Whats more the ethereum browsers (GUI, CLI) could connect this way too. This could allow clients to easily connect to a full mining node (from gadgets, or mobile devices which do not run a full node). There could be admin interface and remote reactor either as capabilities or with their own json-rpc server.\nWhen refactoring the keymanager, I already thought of a remote keystore with encrypted wallet. Although running your own full node in the cloud with private ports with ssl is pretty good privacy, the idea that your private key would never leave your local device while it is connected to a remote ethereum node is tempting and possible.\n",

    "body": "@zelig i think that is what lightweight clients are for? I would suspect that ethereum entities running on a cloud service to in effect be a single Ethereum instance, at best. It is a risk to decentralization.\n\nLightweight clients is a possible answer to the idea of the JSON RPC of course; \"the proper way to do it is not the JSON RPC, but a lightweight client\". But then i see no harm to JSON RPC if it only connects securely between things owned and _controlled_ by the same person.\n\nHard wallets for instance sound interesting. If you have a lot at stake, private keys .. well i would have different levels of security and ability on different keys, and maybe use multiple computers to boot..\n",
