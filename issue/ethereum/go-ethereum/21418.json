  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nGeth keeps track of the transactions known to the peers:\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/d21303f9ddac0c01fa5acb8a8dd98758daa73d15/eth/peer.go#L104\r\n\r\nThis set is filled when transactions are send or broadcasted to a peer, for example in:\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/93142e50c3d4ced88ca1620b4cee2038c4c145ba/eth/peer.go#L397-L413\r\n\r\nNote that this functions adds the whole slice of transaction-hashes to the list of transactions to be known by the peer. \r\n\r\nHowever when the hashes announced on the `p.txAnnounce` channel are actually send. Only `maxQueuedTxs` (currently 4096) are send to the peer, the rest is truncated:\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/93142e50c3d4ced88ca1620b4cee2038c4c145ba/eth/peer.go#L259-L267\r\n\r\nThis results in transactions that we assume are sent to the peer, but actually are not.\r\n\r\nTo make matters worse, the transaction-hashes are truncated such that the oldest ones are deleted first. When having more than `maxQueuedTxs` transactions from a single \"own\" account in the tx-pool as pending, the transactions having the lowest nonce will never be announced or broadcasted to other peers. This blocks all later transactions from this account. ",
