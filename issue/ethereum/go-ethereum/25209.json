    "body": "I see in the release notes that the flags must be before the arguments.\r\n\r\n> Geth and most other command-line tools now use a newer version of the command-line argument/flag handling library. There is one new restriction with this change: flags must now be given before other arguments. Very few of Geth's subcommands take arguments, so this is unlikely to cause issues.\r\n\r\nI found this as a surprise when updating the \"stable\" image of geth. I would like to request that the prior functionality be restored such that the flags can appear in any order as many program commands allow or prefer the flags after the arguments. ",
