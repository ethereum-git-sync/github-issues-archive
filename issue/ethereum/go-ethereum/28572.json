  "body": "Geth at least has a down-to-1-wei precise gas estimator. Since wallet providers will just bump this up, we could save a bunch of compute by not doing it. E.g. we could by default only estimate until we reach 1% precision, or less (5%?).\n\nSince it still seems very very useful to estimate with full precision + it seems like an arbitrary ad hoc decision which may or may not work for everyone, my proposal is to estend eth_estimateGas with an optional parameter that specifies what precision the estimator should stop at. Then providers could roll this out slower and they could decide how precise they want to be without us influencing them.",
