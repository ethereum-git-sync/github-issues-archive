  "body": "#### System information\r\n\r\nGeth version: `1.10.6-stable`, `1.10.9-unstable`\r\nOS & Version: Linux\r\nCommit hash : `576681f29b895dd39e559b7ba17fcd89b42e4833`, `90987db7334c1d10eb866ca550efedb66dea8a20`\r\n\r\n#### Expected behaviour\r\nI am trying to do chain tracing from block 0 until now using a custom JS tracer. We want to extract data which otherwise would be difficult to obtain. \r\n\r\n#### Actual behaviour\r\nHowever we are experiencing seemingly _random_ aborts of the tracings. At first I thought it was due to my js code, but after further experimenting I found that using even the `noop_tracer.js` can produce these random aborts. Here are some of the error logs when the abort happens: \r\n\r\n```\r\n- WARN [09-09|15:54:50.297] Chain tracing failed                     start=0          end=12,300,000 transactions=1,127,999 elapsed=10m16.166119292s err=\"missing trie node fe7d23a257f7528f27cb8d821f9212cdb4ce1835eca729e16464be6423ad1ae2 (path 03)\"\r\n- WARN [09-09|16:01:39.373] Tracing failed                           hash=9fe770..825038 block=531,280 err=\"tracing failed: insufficient funds for gas * price + value: address 0xa6BDc31c431B8F97848c9D60cbbe9660dc450eB7 have 5159916608128893981 want 5165818380000000000\"\r\n- WARN [09-09|16:01:39.984] Chain tracing failed                     start=0          end=12,300,000 transactions=566,584   elapsed=4m59.667592415s  err=\"processing block 531280 failed: could not apply tx 6 [0x9fe77018a2ecc3a011c74dc95b040c86050f67aa84e4f3f82bfc5c9837825038]: insufficient funds for gas * price + value: address 0xa6BDc31c431B8F97848c9D60cbbe9660dc450eB7 have 5159916608128893981 want 5165818380000000000\"\r\n- WARN [09-09|16:06:47.806] Chain tracing failed                     start=0          end=12,300,000 transactions=305,093 elapsed=2m31.62350779s  err=\"can't create storage trie: missing trie node ba59fa34a843ee0ac546128f5f1e9f4c889d38bf060948ecca48a0412b7107c0 (path )\"\r\n- WARN [09-09|16:11:57.855] Chain tracing failed                     start=0          end=12,300,000 transactions=207,006 elapsed=1m51.909702218s err=\"missing trie node 7f0767d73909ad822e4e811db203e6e6781cffdd46d082644ab4262bd6fb7c72 (path 0d0008)\"\r\n- WARN [09-09|19:29:08.723] Chain tracing failed                     start=0          end=13,000,000 transactions=542,976 elapsed=4m18.446828689s err=\"processing block 519064 failed: could not apply tx 1 [0x0c7706562bab01109373b69db37530eb3acd1ae711b709a5395ca23c1f31bef3]: gas limit reached\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhats even more frustrating is that these happen inconsistently and I can't reproduce the failures at the same transaction between different runs. For what it's worth, I could confirm this behavior on two different machines on two different versions of geth. The logs also make me think that the fails are due to different causes, which would make this even more annoying.\r\n\r\nThe furthest I was able to trace was up to block ~2M\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour (it eventually happens...)\r\nGeth is started with:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngeth \\\r\n--datadir='/mnt/7F050DA422DCAB55/.ethereum' \\\r\n--txlookuplimit=0 \\\r\n--verbosity=3 \\\r\n--vmdebug \\\r\n--maxpeers=0 \r\n```\r\n\r\nIPC socket tracer command (using `nc -U geth.ipc`): \r\n```\r\n{\"id\": 1, \"method\": \"debug_subscribe\", \"params\": [\"traceChain\", \"0x0\", \"0xc65d40\", {\"tracer\": \"{step: function(log, db) { }, fault: function(log, db) { }, result: function(ctx, db) { return {}; }}\", \"timeout\": \"10000s\"}]}\r\n```\r\n",

On the upside, I am now able to somewhat reliably reproduce it, so I'm throwing various debug code at it to narrow it down further.  \r\n\r\nWhat makes it a bit hard is that \"reliably repro\" still means it takes ~4 minutes of tracing for it to hit, and it doesn't happen on the same place each time -- even rerunning the tracing without restarting the node doesn't make it hit on the same place.

The chaintracer never flushes to disk (it does memory garbage collection though). Also, it never \"resets\" the base disk image, which is whatever you started tracing at (so e.g. genesis). \r\n\r\nSo instead of tracing 0-13M blocks, it's better to trace e.g. 0-1M, 1M-2M, etc. We might fix something so it automatically clears out the in-memory data and starts from a new disk trie at certain intervals, but that's how it is right now.

That would actually benefit us even more because once we're done with 0-13M, we'd need to trace 13-14M at some point. However we also want to do this while not having to run a full archive node. Is that possible with your suggestion? \r\n\r\nCurrently when I try to continue tracing from a point where I previously had stopped, I get an error like this:\r\n\r\n`WARN [09-25|11:15:26.160] Chain tracing failed                     start=50000     end=100,000    transactions=0          elapsed=133.902753ms        err=\"required historical state unavailable (reexec=128)\"\r\n`",
