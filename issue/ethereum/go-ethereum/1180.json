It's not an easy problem by any stretch, but there are always efficiencies to be gained.... Maybe I'll try and submit a go PR :)\n\nMapping the network is actually a trivial problem given the properties explained in the documentation.  You don't need to traverse the network, the network will essentially traverse you with the right signaling.  Security via network obscurity does not work, there are some pretty timely examples in the news right now....\n",
