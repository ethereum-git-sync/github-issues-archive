Could you guys (devs) tell me what command line options you used for that test? \r\n\r\n#### Actual behaviour\r\n\r\nI am running on similar hardware and my geth node has been 65 blocks behind the mainnet for the past 2 days.\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\r\n\r\nLaunch geth container on CoreOS.

The RAM is more or less fully allocated (which you would expect with only 1G) but the 2G swap \r\nfile is barely used, so memory does not seem to be an issue either really.\r\n\r\nThe I/O utilization (checking with iotop) does not really show anything exceptional either and the 128GB SD card (SanDisk) has some 50GB still free (while trimming/erasing now and then to minimize the amount of garbage that the wear levelling mechanism potentially has to move around).\r\n\r\nNetwork bandwidth utilization is neither at any alarming level (as reported by my router) although I can see that there is more or less constant communication going on between the node and peer(s).\r\n\r\nI am running a fast sync that appears to stop (i.e. 'eth.syncing' starts returning 'false') when it is 65 blocks behind the highest block and then just \"hangs\" making no apparent further progress. When I restart Geth it will relatively quickly catch up to 65 blocks behind the new highest block and do some state downloading until it eventually \"stops\" again and 'eth.syncing' starts returning 'false'.\r\n\r\nNow, the curious thing is that when I check the stack trace after the syncing has \"stopped\" (i.e. 'eth.syncing' starts returning 'false') I can see that there appears to still be syncing going on with a single peer as the '(*Downloader).spawnSync' is still waiting on a channel (and has been for 1029 minutes) while the various goroutines attached to the channel ('fetchHeaders', 'fetchReceipts', 'fetchBodies' and so on) do NOT appear to \"hang\" on their selects but rather being busy downloading data (as indicated by 'fetchParts' apparently being called repeatedly).\r\n\r\nSo, the question in my head is now: why does Geth appear to still be in syncing mode while 'eth.syncing' is returning 'false' and what is my node doing being stuck on the same peer for hours downloading data that then appears to be just thrown away, or what?\r\n\r\nI have attached a stack trace and also ten minutes worth of Go trace if that could be of any use.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n[debug-info.zip](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/files/1777853/debug-info.zip)\r\n",

    "body": "Syncing Ethereum is a pain point for many people, so I'll try to detail what's happening behind the scenes so there might be a bit less confusion.\r\n\r\nThe current default mode of sync for Geth is called fast sync. Instead of starting from the genesis block and reprocessing all the transactions that ever occurred (which could take weeks), fast sync downloads the blocks, and only verifies the associated proof-of-works. Downloading all the blocks is a straightforward and fast procedure and will relatively quickly reassemble the entire chain.\r\n\r\nMany people falsely assume that because they have the blocks, they are in sync. Unfortunately this is not the case, since no transaction was executed, so we do not have any account state available (ie. balances, nonces, smart contract code and data). These need to be downloaded separately and cross checked with the latest blocks. This phase is called the state trie download and it actually runs concurrently with the block downloads; alas it take a lot longer nowadays than downloading the blocks.\r\n\r\nSo, what's the state trie? In the Ethereum mainnet, there are a [ton of accounts already](https://etherscan.io/chart/address), which track the balance, nonce, etc of each user/contract. The accounts themselves are however insufficient to run a node, they need to be cryptographically linked to each block so that nodes can actually verify that the account's are not tampered with. This cryptographic linking is done by creating a tree data structure above the accounts, each level aggregating the layer below it into an ever smaller layer, until you reach the single root. This gigantic data structure containing all the accounts and the intermediate cryptographic proofs is called the state trie.\r\n\r\nOk, so why does this pose a problem? This trie data structure is an intricate interlink of hundreds of millions of tiny cryptographic proofs (trie nodes). To truly have a synchronized node, you need to download all the account data, as well as all the tiny cryptographic proofs to verify that noone in the network is trying to cheat you. This itself is already a crazy number of data items. The part where it gets even messier is that this data is constantly morphing: at every block (15s), about 1000 nodes are deleted from this trie and about 2000 new ones are added. This means your node needs to synchronize a dataset that is changing 200 times per second. The worst part is that while you are synchronizing, the network is moving forward, and state that you begun to download might disappear while you're downloading, so your node needs to constantly follow the network while trying to gather all the recent data. But until you actually do gather all the data, your local node is not usable since it cannot cryptographically prove anything about any accounts.\r\n\r\nIf you see that you are 64 blocks behind mainnet, you aren't yet synchronized, not even close. You are just done with the block download phase and still running the state downloads. You can see this yourself via the seemingly endless `Imported state entries [...]` stream of logs. You'll need to wait that out too before your node comes truly online.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Q: The node just hangs on importing state enties?!**\r\n\r\nA: The node doesn't hang, it just doesn't know how large the state trie is in advance so it keeps on going and going and going until it discovers and downloads the entire thing.\r\n\r\nThe reason is that a block in Ethereum only contains the state root, a single hash of the root node. When the node begins synchronizing, it knows about exactly 1 node and tries to download it. That node, can refer up to 16 new nodes, so in the next step, we'll know about 16 new nodes and try to download those. As we go along the download, most of the nodes will reference new ones that we didn't know about until then. This is why you might be tempted to think it's stuck on the same numbers. It is not, rather it's discovering and downloading the trie as it goes along.\r\n\r\n**Q: I'm stuck at 64 blocks behind mainnet?!**\r\n\r\nA: As explained above, you are not stuck, just finished with the block download phase, waiting for the state download phase to complete too. This latter phase nowadays take a lot longer than just getting the blocks.\r\n\r\n**Q: Why does downloading the state take so long, I have good bandwidth?**\r\n\r\nA: State sync is mostly limited by disk IO, not bandwidth.\r\n\r\nThe state trie in Ethereum contains hundreds of millions of nodes, most of which take the form of a single hash referencing up to 16 other hashes. This is a horrible way to store data on a disk, because there's almost no structure in it, just random numbers referencing even more random numbers. This makes any underlying database weep, as it cannot optimize storing and looking up the data in any meaningful way.\r\n\r\nNot only is storing the data very suboptimal, but due to the 200 modification / second and pruning of past data, we cannot even download it is a properly pre-processed way to make it import faster without the underlying database shuffling it around too much. The end result is that even a fast sync nowadays incurs a huge disk IO cost, which is too much for a mechanical hard drive.\r\n\r\n**Q: Wait, so I can't run a full node on an HDD?**\r\n\r\nA: Unfortunately not. Doing a fast sync on an HDD will take more time than you're willing to wait with the current data schema. Even if you do wait it out, an HDD will not be able to keep up with the read/write requirements of transaction processing on mainnet.\r\n\r\nYou however should be able to run a light client on an HDD with minimal impact on system resources. If you wish to run a full node however, an SSD is your only option.",

Even if you do wait it out, an HDD will not be able to keep up with the read/write requirements of transaction processing on mainnet\r\n\r\nThis is a problem not of an HDD, but the design of `geth` and the choice of using a NoSQL database like LevelDB. SQL databases have a transaction log, and every change is written to this log,  later they are reproduced by making these changes on the corresponding sector/cylinder/head. So, an SQL database does 2 writes, first write in the WAL (Write Ahead Log) and the second is the `good` write since it can combine many records in a single operation. I suppose (since it is very light)  LevelDB is not a designed to manage high volume of transactions by accessing disk every time it needs some data, and this is why you face this problem. The SQL databases like Postgres can manage large volumes of INSERTs and UPDATEs because their engines were designed for such speed. Now, Ethereum has a 15 transactions per second rate, it is ridiculously low volume to be limited by IO bottleneck. If you would drop LevelDB and write blocks directly through kernel system calls you would achieve much better performance, because you would be able to organize adjacent data and stored it in a single write(), for example.\r\n\r\nBut anyway, you can solve current problem by replacing LevelDB with another more powerful NoSQL database engine, or increasing the cache size of LevelDB. Because LevelDB doesn't have to send SEEKs to the HDD every time it has to read something, if you cache the entire state, the READ operations would not be necessary at all. And for WRITE operations you can combine the requests for the same physical block. \r\n\r\nSo, in theory you should be able to run Ethereum node on an HDD, because it is not a hardware limitation, it is a limitation of design. The average SEEK time of an HDD is 9 milliseconds, doing some basic math, you can execute 111 WRITE or READ operations per second without bottleneck. Ethereum has 15 transactions per second rate, so  if every transaction does 4 READs and 3 WRITEs you would be able to use an HDD. Now, this is if no cache mechanisms are used, but with cache the performance would accelerate dramatically, like a 500x or 1000x speedup, depending on the ram you would be wiling to consume.\r\n\r\nToday's programmers write software without knowing much about hardware, that's why users are suffering. \r\n\r\n",

    "body": "> Many people falsely assume that because they have the blocks, they are in sync. Unfortunately this is not the case, since no transaction was executed, so we do not have any account state available (ie. balances, nonces, smart contract code and data). These need to be downloaded separately and cross checked with the latest blocks. This phase is called the state trie download and it actually runs concurrently with the block downloads\r\n\r\nQuestion for @karalabe or anyone else who knows: **_what is it exactly that's in a block?_** What do you actually have from the network when you _\"have a block\"_?\r\n\r\nAs far as the tries go, I assume the state trie is separate, but are the _transaction_ and _transaction receipt_ tries included in \"block download\" or are they also separate somehow. I assume that at the very least the transaction trie is included, but I'm unsure where the transaction receipt trie is also downloaded or whether that's derived by playing back transactions from the transaction trie.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17693119/54320261-c144e300-45c2-11e9-878d-df600de32931.png)\r\n\r\n",
