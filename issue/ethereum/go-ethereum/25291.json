  "body": "I have been using geth for a while now just tinkering and understanding the code but never got to try out a full sync. Does anyone know how long it will take to do a full sync with the current geth version on an acer nitro 5 laptop? Here are my specs:\r\n\r\nProcessor\tIntel(R) Core(TM) i5-8300H CPU @ 2.30GHz   2.30 GHz\r\nInstalled RAM\t32.0 GB (31.8 GB usable)\r\nSystem type\t64-bit operating system, x64-based processor\r\nNVIDIA GTX 1050 4GB vRAM\r\n\r\nI was also planning on getting a 2TB NVMe SSD with the highest IOPS since I understand sync time is mainly impacted by I/O reads and writes rather than processor speed.\r\n\r\nAny time estimates will be appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks",
