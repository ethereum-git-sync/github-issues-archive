  "body": "Hi team, I have an idea. We have deployed multiple Geth  nodes, and we have spent a lot of time and network costs for synchronization. \r\nFor this cluster, is it possible to enable them to automatically discover each other and prioritize the use of the local network for data retrieval? This way, it would accelerate network speed and avoid incurring additional network costs. \r\nAlternatively, can we have only one node actively participating in P2P while the other nodes only download without uploading? Is this idea feasible?\r\n\r\n",
