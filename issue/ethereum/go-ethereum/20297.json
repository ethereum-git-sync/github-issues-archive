  "body": "The EVM interpreter's logic to handle `ExtraEIPs` depends on configured slice order.\r\n\r\nAlthough (mostly/only?) used in tests at this point, and so maybe this is not a huge priority now since this feature seems relatively disused, and/or if ever only with an adhoc intention, but I think worth at least noting in case it wants to be reused or extended in the future.\r\n\r\nThe method `NewEVMInterpreter` uses logic as follows:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/060e33fb4c28a20f3e0ae0e95cd5b27e88c9ec7d/core/vm/interpreter.go#L111-L117\r\n\r\nwith some following associated logic, eg:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/3bb9b49afb17ae4e66f52adba359670078883dcb/core/vm/eips.go#L25-L40\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/3bb9b49afb17ae4e66f52adba359670078883dcb/core/vm/eips.go#L89-L92\r\n\r\nIn the case where two or more EIPs were to implement contradictory changes (working on same facet of interpreter (ie opcode) in different ways)\r\nthen the order of `cfg.ExtraEIPs` iterated through to `EnableEIP` would determine the final jumptable definition, rather than the actual chronology of desired and expected implementation.\r\n\r\nFor example, two hypothetical EIPs 9000 and 9001 both modify an opcode `DISCOVER`, where\r\n- eip9000 -> `DISCOVER.constantGas = 42`\r\n- eip9001 -> `DISCOVER.constantGas = 57`\r\n\r\n(Presumably these would be implemented in different forks.)\r\n\r\nPassed through the `vm.Config.ExtraEips` related logic, these EIPs could be enabled in ambiguous order, resulting in a nondeterministic `constantGas` cost for the opocode.\r\n\r\nIt is not enough to sort the EIPs (implemented as `[]int`) either, because EIPs features are not \r\nguaranteed to be implemented in number-sorted order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
