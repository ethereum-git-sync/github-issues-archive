It's meant to prevent snooping by casual observers but...\r\n\r\nA large portion of users will be / are on shared hosting instances or \"VPS\", a lot of information is protected by the strength of the protection around those keys.  As far as I can tell, the jump to AES-384 or stronger which would be suitable for Top-Secret and below, would be trivial to make and this isn't java where the key strength is neutered by Oracle.   So the question is why not?\r\n  \r\nAlso why did you unilaterally close the topic, is there a place this is supposed to be brought up?
