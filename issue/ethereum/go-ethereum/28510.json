  "body": "I'm trying to figure out the rationale behind the introduction of LazyTransaction for retrieving pending Txs.\r\n\r\nThe code states:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// LazyTransaction contains a small subset of the transaction properties that is \r\n// enough for the miner and other APIs to handle large batches of transactions;\r\n// and supports pulling up the entire transaction when really needed. \r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, types.Transaction does that just as well.\r\n\r\nI also don't quite get the need for the Resolve() step. Why are Blob Txs not simply returned directly, like legacy Txs? I can't imagine it has something to do with eviction, as the lifetime of the result of a Pending() call is usually in the few tens of milliseconds. There's also no cost benefit in \"pulling up the entire transaction when really needed\", quite the opposite.\r\n\r\nCan anyone enlighten me? Thanks!",
