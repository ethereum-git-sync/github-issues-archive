Since then i got 2 TB more wrote to my ssd and got 20-25 GB more actual data. \r\n\r\n",

    "body": "This might not be the optimal solution, but it is an easy work around by using Geth to fast sync. Essentially you will use Geth to quickly sync your blockchain, and then you can go back to using the ETH wallet app.\r\n\r\nFirst downlaod [Geth](https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/) .Geth stands for go-ethereum\r\n\r\nOnce its installed open cmd (click start or hit windows button and type cmd) and type\r\n\r\n`geth --fast`\r\n\r\nand hit enter. Launching geth with the --fast flag will  basically allow you to quickly download the blockchain in a significantly smaller size and at a much higher sync speed.\r\n\r\nA full description of --fast is \r\n\r\n> \"This flag enables fast syncing through state downloads rather than downloading the full block data. This will also reduce the size of your blockchain dramatically. NOTE: --fast can only be run if you are syncing your blockchain from scratch and only the first time you download the blockchain for security reasons.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nmore info [here](https://github.com/ethereum/homestead-guide/blob/master/source/network/connecting-to-the-network.rst#using-geth)\r\n\r\nNote: if you are having issues with the --fast flag because I believe it only runs if your blockchain is empty. You may need to delete the data you've already saved and essentially restart. \r\n\r\nThis thread is all about reseting the blockchain and fast downloading. Its on mac, but the geth commands are identical. [Here](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/1897/how-to-delete-or-reset-the-blockchain-in-geth-osx)",
