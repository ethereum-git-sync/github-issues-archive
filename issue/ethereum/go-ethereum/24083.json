I expect the peers to be able to connect to each other.\r\n\r\n#### Actual behaviour\r\n\r\nPeers fail to connect with```Snapshot extension registration failed peer=af5dfeb7 err=\"peer connected on snap without compatible eth support\"```\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\r\n\r\n1. Take the attached genesis file and move it to a new directory\r\n2. Run ```geth init --datadir \"peer1\" genesis.json``` and ```geth init --datadir \"peer2\" genesis.json``` to initiate the peer\r\n3. In console 1 run ```geth --datadir \"peer1\" --networkid 1111 --port 30401 console 2>peer1.log```\r\n4. In console 2 run ```geth --datadir \"peer2\" --networkid 1111 --port 30402 console 2>peer2.log```\r\n5. In console 3 run ```tail -f peer1.log``` to see the error message\r\n\r\n#### My attempted fixes\r\n\r\n- Setting ```--snapshot=false``` produces the same error\r\n- Changing the ```--syncmode``` to full, fast or light made no difference\r\n- Adding the peers manually with ```admin.addPeer(${peer1.admin.nodeInfo.enode})``` returns true, however ```net.peerCount``` and ```admin.peers.length``` return 0\r\n- Changing the ```chainId``` did not produce any different results\r\n- Waiting did not help\r\n\r\n#### Files\r\n\r\n- [peer1.log](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/files/7675805/peer1.log)\r\n- [peer2.log](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/files/7675806/peer2.log)\r\n- [genesis.txt](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/files/7675809/genesis.txt) (uploaded as .txt since github does not support .json)\r\n ",

As for discovery, you either need a bootnode they all connect to, or run your own crawler which publishes the enr entries over dns.. Which is a lot of work. \r\n\r\nThe \"peer connected on snap without compatible eth support\" is what it says -- other peers connecting to you but not supproing the `eth` protocol. IIRC, it's optimism nodes which replaced `eth` with something else, but didn't replace `snap`, so they advertise `snap` but not eth, and it's been a cause of a not of noise.  ",

    "body": "I think originally there were two issues: the error message as reported in the subject, and peers not connecting.  The latter was caused by a user configuration issue and was the primary problem for OP, so it was closed.\r\n\r\nThe message itself is a separate issue.  I'm seeing it on v1.10.20-stable on both nodes of a private nonstandard-chain-id network, which firewall settings show as blocked from external communication.  The listed 'peer' (4-byte identifier) seems to vary randomly and I'm not sure what that field means, but it does seem confusing when each node should only report a single peer which supports exactly the same set of features (because it's running the same binary!).",
