Use go-ethereum v1.9.12\r\n2. Write code that depends on `abi.U256()`\r\n3. Attempt to upgrade to go-ethereum v1.9.23\r\n4. Find that `abi.U256()` was removed for no obvious reason: https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/commit/ab72803e6f171d6fc2c40419c833853b7c122f6f#diff-baa94fd18f34eadd3684559252ba85328c6da713e079ccc39de383ecbd6950d6L40-L45\r\n5. Find out that a number of your dependencies also depend on `abi.U256()`\r\n\r\nAs another example, https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/21043 changes the behaviour of `estimateGas()` in a breaking way when a non-zero gasPrice is specified. This should not go in a patch release!\r\n\r\nSee https://semver.org/ for reference.",

We will be more careful regarding such API changes in the future.\r\n\r\nPlease note that certain packages in go-ethereum cannot always remain backwards-compatible because their APIs need to be adapted to changes in the ethereum protocol. This mostly applies to the 'core' package. That said, we do try to maintain compatibility as much as possible. This change in accounts/abi was very unfortunate, and could have been avoided.",

    "body": "Thanks. I completely understand that breaking changes are sometimes needed, the important thing is that breaking changes should always lead to a major version bump, that way it is less surprising to developers. Unfortunately, for now I am stuck on v1.9.12 since upgrading will require a long and tedious process of ensuring all my dependencies work with v1.9.23 and re-compiling the contract bindings for v1.9.23, which I do not have time for right now.\r\n\r\nClosing since I don't think there is any immediate action go-ethereum devs can take to remedy this situation, just wanted to make you aware.",
