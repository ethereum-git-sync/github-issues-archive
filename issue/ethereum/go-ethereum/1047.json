  "body": "The issue I'm trying to address is: when running ethminer unattended, it's hard to identify how many blocks are mined through the logs.  There are so many uncles that the \"Mined block\" line is not a useful signal.  (I'm seeing north of 80% stranded blocks)\n\nMy proposed solution is: a log event that conveys: \"One of the blocks mined through this geth instance is now 5 blocks deep in the network.\" (or whatever number seems very likely to stick)\n\nI'm happy to work on a pull request, if a maintainer thinks this could get merged.\n",
