  "body": "The talk about sharding Ethereum seemingly exclusively refers to changes to the Ethereum protocol to allow more transactions through the use of side-chains. Sharding Ethereum refers to making the Ethereum VM itself more distributed. This proposal does not change the Ethereum protocol, or solve transactional scalability.\r\n\r\nThe scalability issue this addresses is mainly storage availability. Running a geth node requires quite a lot of hard drive space. I had a variety of problems in getting Geth to work, and running out of storage space was one of them. There were other problems with fast syncing, but I was attempting to do that to save storage space (and time). Having a sharded / distributed database would improve the performance of the node, as the read/write speed of the cluster would be greater than a single machine in most situations.\r\n\r\nA database that supports sharding (or clusters as it could be known) would enable a few configurations that would enable more people and organisations to run nodes successfully with the hardware they already have.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\nSingle computer, modest sized SSD, large hard drive: The frequently accessed blocks would be stored on the SSD while less frequently accessed (and possibly older) blocks are stored on the HD.\r\n\r\nA similar case could be made with using some NVME SSD storage on one computer and some slower SATA SSD storage.\r\n\r\nNetwork of computers with small/medium SSD drives: The data would be distributed across these nodes, so none of the nodes would require more storage than they have (eg 30GB), and all of them would individually have fast IO over a subset of the data. The data should (first opinion here) be evenly distributed across these nodes, so all of them are reading and writing (but especially reading) transactions that are frequently accessed and well as the less frequent ones.\r\n\r\nSingle computer, multiple SSD drives of varying sizes: This is useful for when that 256GB or 512GB SSD fills up. If more space is needed quickly, it's cheaper to use that spare 128GB SSD or buying one than getting a new 1TB SSD.",
