    "body": "(The answer is probably (implicitly) covered by responses to previous questions on SE. For example: https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/17051/how-to-select-a-network-id-or-is-there-a-list-of-network-ids)\r\n\r\nThe network IDs may be the same, but the _chain_ IDs are different. The main Ethereum chain is `1`, Ethereum Classic is `61`, Expanse is `2`. (The Expanse network also has a network ID of `1`.)\r\n\r\nChain IDs were added in[ EIP-155](https://github.com/ethereum/eips/issues/155) (I think) to prevent replay attacks across chains.\r\n\r\nThe networks also use different hard-coded boot nodes, used when client nodes initially bootstrap into the network, so really there should be no reason why the networks would overlap, unless you explicitly add a node from another network using the `--bootnodes` flag, or similar.  See [here](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/79b11121a7e4beef0d0297894289200b9842c36c/params/bootnodes.go#L23) for the main network's config.\r\n\r\nSomeone more familiar with the code might want to comment further, but you can track down ID mismatches - and potentially where blocks/transactions are dropped - by poking around at `ErrInvalidChainId`.",
