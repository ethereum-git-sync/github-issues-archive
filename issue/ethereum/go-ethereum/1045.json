As @tgerring pointed out, you could still start the geth in interactive mode and enter different passwords for different addresses. \n\nAnyway, if we think of the addresses as belonging to a unique account, it does make sense to have the same password for all its addresses. Actually, in a ideal world, we should be able to have as many accounts as we want and each account with as many addresses as we want, each account having just one password for all its addresses, imho. \n",
