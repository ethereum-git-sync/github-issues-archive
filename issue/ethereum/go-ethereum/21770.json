  "body": "#### System information\r\n\r\nGeth version: `Geth/v1.9.23-stable-8c2f2715/linux-arm64/go1.15.3`\r\nOS & Version: Ubuntu 20.04\r\n\r\n#### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nThe latest stable version is giving different number of logs for an `eth_getLogs` http request compared to the previous versions.\r\nFound this issue while trying to query the eth2 medalla testnet deposit contract logs on goerli. Following are the params for the rpc request:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    \"address\": \"0x07b39F4fDE4A38bACe212b546dAc87C58DfE3fDC\",\r\n    \"topics\": [\r\n      \"0x649bbc62d0e31342afea4e5cd82d4049e7e1ee912fc0889aa790803be39038c5\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"fromBlock\": \"0x35FC08\",\r\n    \"toBlock\": \"0x35FFF0\"\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n``` \r\nThe `eth_getLogs` request with the above params returned 120 logs in the latest version (Geth/v1.9.23-stable-8c2f2715/linux-arm64/go1.15.3) and 125 logs in an earlier version (Geth/v1.9.22-stable-c71a7e26/linux-amd64/go1.15.2). Both nodes are fast synced.\r\n\r\nPlease note that deleting the datadir and resyncing the geth node seems to fix the issue (gives correct number of logs for the above query)\r\n\r\n#### Actual behaviour\r\n\r\nShould always return correct number of logs.\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\r\n\r\nNon deterministic issue. Happening on a specific 1.9.23 goerli node. Other nodes of the same version return correct number of logs. \r\n\r\nI think this could be an issue with changes to the bloom filter in the latest version. Had a similar type of issue on nethermind a few months back https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind/issues/1980 which was an issue with bloom filters.",
