  "body": "Dear Team,\r\n\r\nOver the years, one issue which is really frustrating but seems like ETH Team has not resolved it and its causing issues for lot of users is about Pending Transactions. \r\n\r\nI will just request the ETH Team to consider introducing any solution for that as Tx just stuck in Mempool due to Low gas fees and remain there for may be even years. Thus not letting the Users to do any activity within his account. \r\n\r\nMy Tx on ETH is stuck for more than 25 hours now & funds are stuck. Will be happy If ETH can change this experience?\r\n\r\n**Note: Talking about the users who tried to \"Cancel\" Pending Tx but were not able to Cancel Pending Tx or even replace it.** \r\n\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\n",
