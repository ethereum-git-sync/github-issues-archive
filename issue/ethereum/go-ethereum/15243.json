It basically just failed to respond. We were able to consistently reproduce by calling `eth_getBalance` for random addresses in a loop: geth was intermittent at responding.\r\n\r\nRoughly at 19:46 UTC on October 4th, 2017 the problems subsided and geth's jsonRPC started acting normally again. We didn't see any problems until....\r\n\r\nAt 01:20 UTC on October 5th, 2017 we **updated to geth 1.7.1**. Immediately after updating we started seeing erratic behavior from geth's JSON RPC while under normal operations. We have been unable to pinpoint what is exactly the problem, but downgrading to 1.7.0 seems to have helped.\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\r\nUncertain at this point.\r\n\r\n#### Backtrace\r\n\r\n````\r\n[backtrace]\r\n````\r\n",

It's been a hectic day.\r\n\r\nWe log all responses from geth but this time there are no errors being returned by the JSON RPC - it just fails to respond and drops the connection. I can confirm that I had been running 1.7.0 for days (so we had already done the db upgrade) without issues and **we first saw the error while still on 1.7.0**. Upgrading to 1.7.1 seems to have made it worse so we returned to 1.7.0 and the problem went away.\r\n\r\nFor the past 12 hours we have been running 1.7.1 again and have not seen the error once.\r\n\r\nLooking at our disk latency graphs, I can confirm that these errors are 100% correlated with disk latency issues and unusually high outbound network traffic. The only thing we are running on this box is geth.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1153\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-10-05 at 11 18 21 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1325863/31263333-2eb2d84a-aa27-11e7-8846-08fa2708e653.png\">\r\n\r\nDigging through the geth logs I don't see anything unusual around the times of the high latency... \r\n\r\n@karalabe - I can no longer reproduce the connection drops.\r\n",
