  "body": "Dear Geth Support Team,\r\n\r\nI'd like to inquire further about the specific types of log entries that are printed when a transaction is rejected or replaced by the go-Ethereum node. Could you provide detailed information on the following aspects?\r\n\r\nWhat are the different scenarios under which a transaction might be rejected or replaced by the go-Ethereum node, and how are these events logged?\r\n\r\n1. Are there any specific log levels or configurations that need to be set to monitor these particular events? If so, please provide guidance on how to enable them.\r\n2. Understanding these aspects will greatly assist me in analyzing and troubleshooting related issues in my project. Your expertise and support are invaluable to me.\r\n3. Please provide an example of a log response for replace and rejected transactions - specifically log responses for mempool activity, and block inclusion as well.\r\n\r\nThank you once again, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.",
