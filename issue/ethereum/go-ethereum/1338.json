  "body": "Over time my node will tend towards just a few peers, rarely going over 10, yet maxpeers is set to 50. Eventually it will get stuck on an old block. When my peer count is less than ~10, block propagation gets pretty slow compared to the other nodes on stats. It seems to help if I delete nodekey and the nodes directory then restart geth every now and then (once or twice a day). Not sure if this is specific to me or maybe a Windows issue. You can watch my node struggle on the stats page (DankHash). \n\nMy machine is pretty beefy so i doubt it is the issue: 6-core i7 5930k, 32GB DDR4 RAM, SSD, 90 mbps internet.\n\nHere is a filtered log of a few min while my node was chugging along:\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/TalkingAntColony/f2371b0e64c5e6117f0a\n",
