Calling FailNow does not stop those other goroutines\r\n\r\nThis is sometimes violated. See one example of it in `TestCanonicalBlockRetrieval` of `blockchain_test.go`.\r\n\r\nHowever, tests will correctly be marked as failed if there is an issue in one goroutine so this isn't breaking but an enhancement.",
