  "body": "Hi all,\r\nI am a newbie on this field and trying to setting Geth on my local.\r\nI am in a situation where I can't install Homebrew, so I have to rely on downloading from the official website ( https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/ )\r\n\r\nFrom the website, when I clicked the button \" Geth 1.10.16 for macOS\" and I downloaded \"geth-darwin-amd64-1.10.16-20356e57\".\r\nAnd executed \"geth\" file.\r\nThen, it seems like downloading all blocks and when it downloaded over 100Gb, I stopped since I don't have enough space.\r\n\r\nI have seen that I can start with \"Light node\" with parameter `--syncmode \"light\"` but I can't find any info.\r\n\r\nIs there any way to start with light node mode on MacOS?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.

    "body": "Hi, are you running geth by double-clicking the executable? If you do that, it will run the process with no options at all, and you won't be able to use it. You need to run it from the command-line instead.\r\n\r\nOpen Terminal.app and type `cd ` (space at the end), then drag the folder containing geth to the Terminal window. It will now say `cd /Users/.../Downloads/geth-.../` or something like that. Now press enter. This navigates your command-line into the correct directory.\r\n\r\nNow run geth by typing the command `./geth --syncmode light`. Press enter to run the command. You can quit it by hitting Ctrl-C.",
