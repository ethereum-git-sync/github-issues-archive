  "body": "#### System information\r\n\r\nGeth version: 1.5.5-stable\r\nOS & Version: Linux Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS\r\nCommit hash : Not sure\r\n\r\n#### Expected behaviour\r\nI would expect mining not to stop and carry on until I stop it.\r\n\r\n#### Actual behaviour\r\nI have just downloaded and built geth 1.5.5-stable, but whenever I start mining,  after a while, I get the following message: \r\n`I0103 22:12:40.409435 miner/worker.go:297] Invalid header on mined block: nonce for #360110 [f5ae0385aec845c433bf0a49bb06d4eceffa81e425372ab30121ff4b4f5edaa9â€¦] is invalid (got 7607790145661264965)`\r\nand the mining stops. \r\n\r\nIf I run `miner.stop();` and then `miner.start(1);`, it will start mining again for a few minutes, until it gives me the same error message, but on a different block. This behaviour didn't exist on 1.5.5-unstable.\r\n\r\nI am running geth on my own private network with no other mining server and no other geth servers, so it couldn't be that my instance has gotten out of sync with another.\r\n\r\nOne thing I need to note though is that I am changed the core/block_validator.go file to have a static difficulty. I have set it to 0x10000. Could this create this behaviour?\r\n\r\nI have the same issue on geth version 1.5.6-unstable.\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\r\nI just start mining and after a few seconds to a few minutes, I get this issues.\r\n\r\n#### Backtrace\r\nNot sure how to get the backtrace, but if given the instructions, I am willing to provide it.\r\n",
