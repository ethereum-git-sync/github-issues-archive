    "body": "I was looking a bit into `eth_feeHistory` and it seems to me that this query already has almost all of the \"raw data\" necessary:\r\n\r\n```graphql\r\nquery feeHistory($from: Long!, $to: Long!) {\r\n  blocks(from: $from, to: $to) {\r\n    number\r\n    baseFeePerGas\r\n    gasUsed,\r\n    gasLimit,\r\n    transactions {\r\n    \tmaxFeePerGas\r\n        maxPriorityFeePerGas\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe have the list of base fees for the block range itself, `gasUsedRatio` can be computed by `block.gasUsed / block.gasLimit`. Now, short of adding a `feeHistory` field to the `Query` schema we have several options for facilitating the client to compute the rest of the data itself:\r\n\r\n- Add `nextBaseFeePerGas` to `Block` since `feeHistory` also returns the computed base fee for one future block\r\n- Add `reward`/`effectiveTip` to `Transaction`. This can be computed by `min(tx.priorityFee, tx.maxFee-baseFee)` but it's a EVM-related logic and it's fair to provide it\r\n\r\nIMO the percentile logic for rewards can be left for clients to handle.",
