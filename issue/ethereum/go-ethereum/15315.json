    "body": "I'm suspecting that MD5 is used, rather than a \"stronger\" algorithm, because it's only being used as a way to check the integrity of the download (i.e. to check the file downloaded without any errors), rather than as a way to check its provenance. And for this, MD5 is probably as good as anything else.\r\n\r\nIf we wanted to go a step further, rather than just providing a checksum, we could provide GPG signatures in the form of `.asc` files, and [do what the Tor project does](https://www.torproject.org/docs/verifying-signatures.html.en). Perhaps overkill?",
