  "body": "When I deploy ethstats with the nginx reverse-proxy and a sealer node, the sealer node attempts to connect to it via the the remote address and port. For some reason, it seems docker is rerouting this to 127.0.1.1 and this doesn't seem to be linked to any loopback and therefore sealer cannot connect to the ethstats server. When I manually update the sealer's ethstats url to `ethstats:3000` it is able to connect via the default networking bridge in docker.",
