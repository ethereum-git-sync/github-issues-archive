  "body": "I was wondering if there is a certain config, flags or anything that I could launch or tweak my Ethereum fullnode that will speed it up in terms of transaction propagation and fetching mempool transactions. I built a sniper bot and as far as I can see it's really fast but not fast enough - there are bots that are always before me. I've optimized as much of my code as possible so basically only thing left is fullnode configuration.",
