    "body": "But if the question is \"can I disable block synchronization from A\", then the answer is no, no such switch. However, it is theoretically possible to run the `cmd/bootnode` `bootnode` binary, which is just a node which provides capability for other peers to meet. We haven't really maintained the `bootnode` binary a lot, so I'm not 100% sure it works as expected. ",
