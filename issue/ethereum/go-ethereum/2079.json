  "body": "Hello,\n\nI downloaded and compiled go-ethereum, however it does not connect to any nodes and it says \"Table.go: No seed nodes found\".\n\nAnalysing the network-traffic with wireshark shows that there are no problems with connectivity it simply does not try.\n\nI am able to add nodes manually by extracting the enodes from ./eth/backend.go and adding them with admin.addPeer()\n\nUsing this technique it connects to 3 nodes and it will function properly, however it will never connect to more then just those 3 nodes.\n\nSo the issue is:\nIt does not connect to any bootnodes.\nIt does not exchange any peers with connected nodes.\n",
