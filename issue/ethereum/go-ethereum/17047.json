  "body": "Hi,\r\nSuppose I have 2 geth nodes,  after these two nodes run independently for a period of time, suppose the block number of one of them is 10 and another is 5. \r\n\r\nIf I invoke \"admin.addPeer()\" in one of the nodes, after the synchronization,  What is the block number of them, 10, or 15(10+5)?\r\n\r\nI test this and found that the result is always the largest of the two numbers, which is 10. If this is true, all of the blocks(5) of another node with smaller block number will be discarded?\r\n\r\nAm I right?",
