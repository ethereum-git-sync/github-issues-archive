  "body": "I currently cannot run a full node on my laptop due to HDD space requirements, the --light sync mode works great however I cannot use it to scan the blockchain for transactions due to creating too many requests to light-client server nodes.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if I could run in \"light\" mode but also have my node download only the blocks i'm interested in.  So lets say i'm interested in all transactions for account 0x123456, it would ask the light server nodes for the transaction history for that account/log/topic etc.. Then my hybrid node would know it needs to request block 1, 6, 15, 250 etc..  and it saves them locally, it can check the block hash against the light mode chain to verify its correct.\r\n\r\nThen I can scan/query my local database as many times as I like without having to query other nodes on the network.",
