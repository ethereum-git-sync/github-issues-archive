  "body": "Hello, not sure if it's a bug or just me being incompetent, but looking for this error yelded zero results so I figured I could ask here. After ETH2.0 merge, I deployed from scratch on a Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS server, **Geth 1.10.25-stable** and **Lighthouse v3.1.0-aa022f4**.\r\nThis is the command line that I used to start up Geth:\r\n\r\n`/usr/local/bin/geth   --mainnet   --datadir /var/lib/geth --maxpeers 30 --http.api personal,web3,eth --http.addr 192.168.38.15 --http.port 8545  --authrpc.port 8551  --syncmode snap  --authrpc.jwtsecret /var/lib/jwtsecret/jwt.hex --authrpc.addr 0.0.0.0`\r\n\r\nThis is what comes up as soon as I launch Geth:\r\n`INFO [12-08|01:33:53.975] WebSocket enabled                        url=ws://[::]:8551\r\nINFO [12-08|01:33:53.975] HTTP server started                      endpoint=[::]:8551 auth=true prefix= cors=localhost vhosts=localhost\r\n`\r\nThe blockchain is fully synchronized, however I'm not able to conenct to my sever using web3.\r\nIf I go to 192.168.38.15:8551 with a web browser, I see the following error: \r\n`missing token`\r\n\r\nI've also tryed running this connection test:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom web3 import Web3\r\n\r\napi_address = \"https://192.168.38.15.8551\"\r\n\r\nw3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(api_address))\r\nres = w3.isConnected()\r\nprint(res)\r\n```\r\nHowever it just prints _**false**_\r\n\r\nI'm trying to understand what is the \"missing token\" the web server is referring to, is it correct to assume it's the JWT secret that's shared between Geth and Lighthouse, if so, I'm unable to find a single example of web3 passing this argument to geth.\r\nAny help is gereatly appreciate, thank you!\r\n\r\n\r\n",
