  "body": "Since txs with zero gas price are broadcasted it's possible to continuously spam the network with txs without inuring any Ether cost.\n\nThis is asymmetric in resource consumption as the tx will be handled and re-broadcast by every node, while the attacker only needs to send a single request to one node.\n\nMoreover, if the node is mining, the default miner (policy) code will delete the tx from the tx pool _after_ broadcast due to having too low gas price. The node will then accept the same tx again if it's re-sent by the attacker.\n\nFurthermore, since txs are periodically deleted from the tx pool, it's possible that a node receives the tx again and cannot know that it has seen it before, thus causing a broadcast loop in the network.\n",
