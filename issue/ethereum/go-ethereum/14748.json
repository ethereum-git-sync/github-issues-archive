    "body": "The private keys are encrypted using a memory and computationally hard algorithm to make brute forcing it extremely long. On a modern CPU it takes about 1 second and 256MB memory to try one single decryption.\r\n\r\nYou might try running in concurrently from many threads (although I would probably use a library and try to decrypt directly instead of via a geth RPC call, since Geth has some concurrency protection when multiple transactions use the same account). Not sure if there's some GPU decrypter that might brute force it a bit faster, but it's definitely a hard nut to crack.",
