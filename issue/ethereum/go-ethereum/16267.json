  "body": "Hello Everyone.\r\nI'm not sure if this is the right place to post this. Please tell me if I should move this post somewhere else.\r\nGeth chain data cause insane fragmentation on my hard disk. Hundred of thousands of 2 mb files with over 20 fragments each. This is the only program that is causing me this issue. HD is only 60% full.\r\nI even tried deleting all chain data, fully defragmenting hard disk and empty hard disk space, and then resyncing with blockchain. Again hundred of thousands of superfragmented 2mb files.\r\nThere is something wrong with write operations in your code. Also, is it not possible to bundle up all these hundred of thousands of mini files into one or few less fragmented files? I'm having this issue only with ethereum. Other desktop wallets like Decred, Bulwark, lbry, Monero etc do not have any of these issues.\r\n\r\nPlease help!\r\nThank you!",
