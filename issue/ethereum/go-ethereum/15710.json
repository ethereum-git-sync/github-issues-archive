    "body": "Agreed it requires some thought on the best approach. Two ideas:\r\n\r\n1. Remove the underscore (and any other following non-alpha chars) and uppercase the first alpha char in the identifier. Good for the typical case where it’s just a single underscore then an alpha char, and indentifier name collisions within that context are unlikely. Would require handling of collisions should they happen, and cases of only non-alpha chars (‘_123’, etc.)\r\n\r\n2. Preface the identifier with an uppercase ‘A’. Would need to handle collisions, although I haven’t seen this pattern (e.g., identifiers already named ‘A_abc’). For the typical case of just a single underscore followed by alpha chars, I think this option isn’t as nice. \r\n\r\nOther ideas?",
