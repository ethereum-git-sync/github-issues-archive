    "body": "I also don't understand your question completely. \r\n\r\nIn Feed.Send, the `cases` list keeps the cases of the select. The first select case (index 0) is a read operation on the `removeSub` channel. The remaining select cases are send operations on subscription channels. `removeSub`  is used to cancel subscriptions. When a subscription is canceled/unsubscribe while `Send` is active, the subscription channel must be removed from the select cases because it is not allowed to send on a subscription channel after `Unsubscribe` has returned.\r\n\r\nIf you think this can be implemented better or more efficiently, please make a pull request or propose a diff. The tests will also show if your idea works or not.\r\n\r\n",
