Like if I know I'm about to reboot my node or upgrade it, it would be nice...\r\n\r\nI just stopped my node via `supervisor stop geth` so that I could upgrade to the latest version and lost 10k blocks.\r\n\r\nI did a little more digging, Supervisor sends `TERM` and has a default timeout of 10 seconds. I'm guessing that timeout is just too low. So I can probably fix MY issue but it would be cool for this to be more configurable / accessible.",
