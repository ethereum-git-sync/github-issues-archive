  "body": "Hi, \r\nMy goal is to be able to get access to the average time taken by a private PoA (Clique) geth node to execute all transactions in a block. I was wondering what could be the best metric for this matter?\r\nI've activated the metric server and can have access to metrics like `chain/head/block` (number of highest block) and `txpool/pending` (number of pending transactions) but most metrics stay at `0`.\r\n\r\nFor instance: `chain/inserts`, `chain/validation`, `chain/execution` and `chain/write` timers (that seems to be what I am looking for) stay at a value of `0`. If fact, most of my metrics stays at 0 (see provided file: [metrics.txt](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/files/6344603/metrics.txt) ). \r\n\r\nIs this normal to have so many `0`s metrics? Is there any metrics to get access to average block execution time? \r\n\r\n(P.S: I chose the `question` issue type as I'm not sure if this is a bug or just a misusage on my side).\r\n\r\n## Network description\r\nOnly one PoA Eth. \r\nTransactions are generated by a python script. Transactions are indeed processed and included in blocs. Everything seems to work. \r\n\r\n## Geth command\r\n(executed in a docker environment)\r\n```\r\nexec geth \\\r\n  --datadir /root \\\r\n  --config .config.toml \\\r\n  --allow-insecure-unlock \\\r\n  --nousb \\\r\n  --verbosity $ETH_VERBOSITY \\\r\n  --gcmode=archive \\\r\n  --mine \\\r\n  --miner.threads 1 \\\r\n  --unlock $ETH_ADDRESS \\\r\n  --password /tmp/eth_pass \\\r\n  --metrics --metrics.expensive \\\r\n  --metrics.addr '0.0.0.0' \\\r\n  --metrics.influxdb \\\r\n  --metrics.influxdb.endpoint \"http://influxdb:8086\" \\\r\n  --metrics.influxdb.database \"db0\" \\\r\n  --metrics.influxdb.username \"admin\" \\\r\n  --metrics.influxdb.password \"admin\"\r\n```\r\n## Geth Version\r\n```\r\nGeth\r\nVersion: 1.10.3-unstable\r\nGit Commit: 9c653ff6625df1ff0f6c6612958b2a1da0021e40\r\nGit Commit Date: 20210409\r\nArchitecture: amd64\r\nGo Version: go1.16.3\r\nOperating System: linux\r\nGOPATH=\r\nGOROOT=go\r\n```",
