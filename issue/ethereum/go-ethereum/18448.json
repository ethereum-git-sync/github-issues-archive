After encountering two instances of this issue withing 2 days, this has been reported here.\r\n\r\n#### System information\r\n\r\nGeth version: Geth/v1.8.20-stable/linux-amd64/go1.10.3\r\nOS & Version: Linux\r\n\r\n#### Expected behaviour\r\nReceipts of all hashes contained in block should be available.\r\n\r\n#### Actual behaviour\r\nFetching receipt from the RPC returns null for all transaction hashes for some blocks.\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\r\nThis seems to be a random behaviour which occurs for some transactions in block. This behaviour can be reproduced by continuously verifying receipts in latest blocks.\r\n\r\nUpdate: Not some receipts, all receipts are missing for some blocks.",
