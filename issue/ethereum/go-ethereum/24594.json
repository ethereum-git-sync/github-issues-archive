    "body": "You are running a Geth node for validating the blocks propagated over the network, not only your own transactions.\r\n\r\nFlag `maxpeers` means the number of node connections it will maintain at most. Maintaining more peer nodes will increase system resource usage (network bandwidth, disk IO, CPU, etc.) to a certain extent to serve requests from peers. Of course, the advantage is that you can receive transactions and blocks from the network faster. If you connect a lot of peers, it will affect the efficiency of block processing to a certain extent.",
