  "body": "Package event provides type `Feed` for subscription handling. A `Feed` is always constrained to a single type, and this restriction is enforced at runtime using reflection. With the introduction of generics in Go 1.18, it is now possible to declare and enforce the element type of `Feed` at compile time.\r\n\r\nTo avoid breaking downstream code, I suggest we add a new type `FeedOf[T any]` to package event. The behavior of this feed implementation would be exactly the same as the current one.",
