  "body": "There is an atomic load inside the EVM loop that checks if execution should be terminated before reaching the end. The idea being that itâ€™s nice if we can abort an infinite loop over rpc, after the rpc-call times out.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/66ee9422f56626dccc94b00762b8991c9b3195b0/core/vm/interpreter.go#L183-L188\r\n\r\nCPU profile\r\n```\r\n         .          .    182:   steps := 0\r\n         .          .    183:   for {\r\n     120ms      120ms    184:           steps++\r\n     120ms      120ms    185:           if steps%1000 == 0 {\r\n         .          .    186:                   if atomic.LoadInt32(&in.evm.abort) != 0 {\r\n         .          .    187:                           break\r\n         .          .    188:                   }\r\n         .          .    189:           }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe atomic itself is not a problem, but tracking steps is. This consumes at least one additional register.\r\n\r\nEasy quick improvements is to change the condition to `steps%1024`. https://godbolt.org/z/esfhf3EhW\r\n\r\nConsidering the feature is only to terminate long running looped EVM code, I propose to track jumps instead of steps. We can have `in.numJumps` field which will be bumped in `opJump()` and `opJumpi()`. And atomic flag will be checked every some number of jumps. The `numJumps` does not need to be ever reset if the condition is e.g. `numJumps % 64 == 0`. Also check what is the overhead of checking the atomic flag on every jump.",

Having long running branch-less code is restricted by the code size, but that doesn't yet apply to initcode.  Is that case however a strong enough argument to keep steps as opposed to jumps?",
