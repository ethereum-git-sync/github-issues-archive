I updated everything to latest versions and cleared out chaindata to start from scratch.. one thing I did notice is the geth chaindata folder has 121,000 files now even after starting from scratch. Before I cleared it, it only had 55,000 files.. I'm wondering if that many files is slowing down the ssd. any help is appreciated. Thanks in advance.",
