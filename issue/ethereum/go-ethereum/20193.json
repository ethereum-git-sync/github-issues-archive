  "body": "Sorry for creating issue there, I've already created on [ethreum.stackexchange](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/76855/about-transaction-higher-nonce-than-current-nonce) but don't have many noctice... I'm working with concurrent Ethereum transaction (old discussed thread). Sometimes, invalid nonce can be occured, I'm using Redis and physical DB to storage nonce, actually higher nonce than current nonce will be marked same as success transaction (tx) with a valid hash return but can not find it on explorer. It may appear on list of pending/waiting txs, I've also checked on node by using eth_pendingTransactions and txsPending from etherscan but empty return.\r\nExample:\r\nCurrent nonce is 50, create a loop 10 times tx from nonce 51 to 60, all of these tx will return valid hash and will be waited. After specificed time (I've test between half day to full day) then creating tx with nonce 50, waiting till it is broadcasted on network, next 10 tx will appear on explorer too.\r\nThe problem that I can't find any information about list of txs which higher nonce than current nonce, so I want to ask about expired time of those txs and where I can find those txs when they're on hold status, thanks so much.",

    "body": "@ligi, I've tried on both testnet and mainnet. I'm trying to build an Ethereum exchange service, so concurrent schedule is needed and nonce management is the most problem. At specificed moment, I have large request of transactions (txs), so I'm using redis and physical database to storage current nonce and update it +1 while ending (often get nonce from redis, if redis is dead, switch to physical db). When testing, nonce from redis occasionally is higher than current valid nonce (getTransactionCount), it will be marked as successful transaction (tx) with a valid hash is returned:\r\nExample current nonce is 50, create txs with nonce bigger such as 51, 52,... is all valid and return valid hashes.\r\nThe problem at there is if nonce 50 is not filled by a specificed tx, txs with higher nonce than 50 will wait for a period time and I don't know when it will be expired. I've test a half day to full day but they're not expired. When I create a tx with 50 nonce, after a short time, higher +50 nonce txs will be broadcasted automatically and become successfull too. I know that I can cancel these txs by creating a self transaction with higher gas but it's not the problem I'm facing.\r\nSo, I have 2 question, where can I find list txs higher nonce than current valid nonce eg etherscan.io or my node though I've storaged them on physical DB. And 2nd question is if I don't fill a missing nonce to chain, will list txs be expired for a period time (how long) or they're storaged forever, if I wanna cancel them I must create self transaction with higher gas? Thanks for hearing me so much and have a nice day.\r\n//I'm creating a schedule, which check nonce from node and redis if they're diffrent, create a self transaction with nonce from node but I think this is not a good resolve...",
