  "body": "#### System information\n\nGeth version: \n\n```\nGeth\nVersion: 1.4.10-stable-5f55d95a\nProtocol Versions: [63 62]\nNetwork Id: 1\nGo Version: go1.6.2\nOS: darwin\nGOPATH=\nGOROOT=/usr/local/Cellar/go/1.6.2/libexec\n```\n\nOS & Version: OSX 10.11.6 and 10.12 Beta (16A239m) (has occured on both)\nCommit hash : (if `develop`)\n#### Expected behaviour\n\nRPC returns calls in a timely manner (which mostly happens)\n#### Actual behaviour\n\nOccasionally RPC calls take many seconds (up to 128s observed). I'm running things through an `ngrok` tunnel so have some info on calls (pasted later).\n\nThroughout this time the console is responsive, though it seems _all_ RPC calls are slowed.\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\n\nUnknown :(\n#### More details about the RPC calls\n\nI'm making calls from atom (through the ethereum interface) though it seems like this happens when making an RPC call from `curl` as well. I've taken some screenshots (see below) that show what I'm talking about. They're all trivial calls, and if I put the raw data into the console they execute in a timely fashion even while an RPC call is hanging.\n\nI've added a bunch of screenshots in case they're useful. There is 1 request in there made by curl (with the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` content type).\n\nThis is an intermittent issue and restarting geth fixes it.\n\n![screen shot 2016-07-26 at 12 01 43 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1046448/17123779/7d24fae0-5329-11e6-9600-38eda1c495a5.png)\n![screen shot 2016-07-26 at 12 02 15 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1046448/17123780/7d24f45a-5329-11e6-88c3-ef4f15d345c9.png)\n![screen shot 2016-07-26 at 12 02 23 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1046448/17123783/7d294f5a-5329-11e6-9393-56a4513c8f32.png)\n![screen shot 2016-07-26 at 12 02 32 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1046448/17123781/7d2643c8-5329-11e6-9797-2bced9dd82d8.png)\n![screen shot 2016-07-26 at 12 02 39 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1046448/17123782/7d282bde-5329-11e6-9e47-80b0975b83bb.png)\n![screen shot 2016-07-26 at 12 02 50 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1046448/17123778/7d248ba0-5329-11e6-9b69-66db1c8fbbd9.png)\n![screen shot 2016-07-26 at 12 02 54 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1046448/17123785/7d55852a-5329-11e6-902d-88b656e19dba.png)\n![screen shot 2016-07-26 at 12 03 19 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1046448/17123788/7d579ed2-5329-11e6-9314-4b9630c18bf3.png)\n![screen shot 2016-07-26 at 12 04 46 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1046448/17123786/7d55e2f4-5329-11e6-936c-0a5af457f1a6.png)\n![screen shot 2016-07-26 at 12 04 51 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1046448/17123787/7d564276-5329-11e6-83a1-aab261b4903c.png)\n![screen shot 2016-07-26 at 12 05 01 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1046448/17123784/7d554bbe-5329-11e6-9918-61be60d9dfce.png)\n",

    "body": "In this case I'd restarted right before taking the gist, I think. If not then it was very shortly after restarting with 1 or 2 unlocks before hand. Usually unlocking is for an unlimited (default?) period of time (IE the param is just omitted). These RPC calls are the only way I'm interacting with the node in the above gists (on a testnet, if that helps).\n\n---\n\nIn the system we're developing, unlocks are fairly common (as a sort of blunt-object approach to the problem) and so far I'm the only one (out of 4 machines) that has this problem. One example is running a `js` script which basically loops every 60 seconds unlocking all accounts; and have not had this problem. Side note: is this bad practice?\n\nThat version is:\n\n```\neth@ethereum:~$ geth version\nGeth\nVersion: 1.5.0-unstable\nProtocol Versions: [63 62]\nNetwork Id: 1\nGo Version: go1.6.2\nOS: linux\nGOPATH=\nGOROOT=/usr/lib/go-1.6\n```\n\nAnd the js: \n\n```\nfor(var i = 0; i < eth.accounts.length; i++){\n  personal.unlockAccount(eth.accounts[i], '');\n}\n```\n\nrun through a bash script like `while sleep 60; do ./unlock-accounts.sh; done`\n",
