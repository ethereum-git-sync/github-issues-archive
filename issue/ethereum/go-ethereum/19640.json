  "body": "You can find two reports from @InoMurko, [Potterhat with Parity, Infura, Geth](https://drive.google.com/a/ethereum.org/file/d/1CFRMovEQpnbvxUrqF18Wus9ibcTzX045/view?usp=sharing) and  [Potter client comparison spreadsheet](https://drive.google.com/a/ethereum.org/file/d/1cmFBUD3jkXzgcroJ3YdpueTTyR-DGP7t/view?usp=sharing). They were done for PoC Potterhat we’re doing to get a reliable and HA Ethereum service in place (simillar to Infura but open source – if we decide to continue working on it). These results are all based on mainnet and *stable* is defined as – the service didn’t die, and websockets were emitting events constantly. RPC calls excluded.\r\n\r\nAlso attaching two images CPU1, CPU2. These CPU spikes are from a Geth and a Parity node that live on the same cluster, connected to the same network (Rinkeby). Geth is the red line and Parity is the yellow line. When the Geth instance CPU spikes, we've found that RPC calls suffer. RPC calls then:\r\n\r\n- Timeout\r\n- Take up to 5000ms to complete\r\n- Get a malformed response\r\n\r\nAnd a general observation from the team is that WebSocket stops emitting events. We’re not sure why. It just stops until Geth node is restarted. This happens while Parity on our cluster and Infura work fine. These are ***newHeads*** event, no filters. A freshly spun up geth also works fine, and seem to start having problem after left running for a few days.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/208822/58614298-513c2400-82b8-11e9-96b6-28e535da7200.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/208822/58614309-59945f00-82b8-11e9-84de-9cf1b446fb77.png)\r\n",
