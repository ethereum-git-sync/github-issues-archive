I get this error quite often in the logs, but it remains connected to the stats.goerli.net dashboard and it continues to report stats.\r\n\r\n`ethereum/client-go:stable` on the other hand will report this error once, and then it seems to just give up.\r\n\r\nI also tried with `ethereum/client-go:latest` and the issue remains.\r\n\r\nAny build newer than `ethereum/client-go:v1.9.15` seems to report its block number once, then it just shows offline",
