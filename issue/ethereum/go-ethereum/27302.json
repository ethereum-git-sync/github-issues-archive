  "body": "# Rationale\r\n\r\nWhy should this feature exist? To make the asics E9 AND E9 PRO compatible for mining pools ethash\r\nWhat are the use-cases? The goal would be to generate a double-triple dag so that the asic can mine new tokens (with or without Genesis) with less than 2 GB of dag. The mentioned Asics does not mine below 2 GB.\r\n\r\n# Implementation\r\n\r\nDo you have ideas regarding the implementation of this feature? This will be a solution for asics that are not compatible.  I don't know how to implement it. \r\nAre you willing to implement this feature? It is not possible for me to implement this solution alone. Bitmain support is not very responsive, remains to be seen if it is possible to implement this functionality directly in geth.",
