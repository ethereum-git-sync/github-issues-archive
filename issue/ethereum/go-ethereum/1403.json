  "body": "\"Official\" namereg is a nuisence. Ok, maybe this one is necessary because the dapp browser is an official project.\n\nBut the IBAN asset interface is not general enough to have a chance at being the central asset registry, but also complex enough to be a pain to make your assets conform to. Let standards emerge once people see the best asset contract architectures in the wild.\n\nAre we going to have the developer's personal dapps get first-class support? If no, please don't try to anticipate the best contract system designs, it's almost the same thing.\n\nSo the issue is:  Is there an official policy on this? How did you decide to give the go-ahead for IBAN contracts but not a standard voting contract or key management contract, for example? How can I get my _contract_ architecture decisions into the core client too?\n",

This is the only remnant I can find right now, but I'm pretty sure I saw more in either web3 or in geth. It doesn't show in github search so maybe it's been removed already ?\n\n> I would like to have a round table on DEVCON1 around exactly these topics, i.e., dapp devel best practices, standard interfaces, interface starndards, deployment and development infrastructure, distribution, off-chain info standards, internatspec, testing, etc.\n\nGreat. The issue I'm filing is that I want a policy that is a result of a discussion like this which guides devs that contribute to ether core. I'm concerned about the damage bad contract architecture decisions will cause if they are baked into the client. \n",
