  "body": "hi,\r\nI already have a private network running and a lot of transaction has been done. Now, I want to undo some changes and modify few fields in genesis file. also wants to preserve previous blocks(old blockchain data). \r\nHow can I achieve that? \r\ndo we need to do hard fork or any other alternative? \r\nif hard fork is required then how can I do that? \r\nI tried some steps of hard fork but not able to import old blockchain state.\r\n\r\nI am getting `invalid block 999: unknown ancestor` .\r\n block 999 was the latest block of old blockchain.\r\n\r\nthanks!\r\n",
