    "body": "The transaction pool contains two queues:\n- The `pending` queue contains transactions that seem to be executable, though there may be a lot of them so it may take time until miners start including them.\n- The `future` queue contains transactions that seem to not be executable, usually because there's a nonce gap for the particular account. The role of this queue is mostly to cover out of order transactions arriving from the network.\n\nNow, the caveats:\n- If a new transaction is issues for the same account and the same nonce, the higher priced version will be retained.\n- The local transaction pool will always accept your local transactions irrelevant of the price, but remote pools will filter out anything that's below their configured gas price.\n- If pool limits are reached, `pending` transactions are evicted in such a way that accounts have a fair share to get transactions included and `future` transactions are evicted according to when the account last had a successful transaction (to avoid caching junk for inactive spammers).\n",
