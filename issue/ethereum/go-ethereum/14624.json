  "body": "We're working on a very large-scale application that issues a lot of transactions and we are not sure what exact guarantees Ethereum/Geth gives us.\r\n\r\nOn Ropsten testnet, we try to issue 100 transactions at once but only a fraction get mined. It seems like some transactions get discarded by the transaction pool and therefore mess up subsequent transactions because of the transaction nonce.\r\n\r\nI looked at the code here: https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/core/tx_pool.go#L80-L83\r\n\r\n- How is \"non-executable transaction\" defined? I assume this defines transactions that can't be executed because of a too high nonce \r\n- If AccountSlots is set to 16 (and I assume the majority on the network has set that), does that mean the 16 lowest transaction nonces will go there? \r\n- Is the number of possible transactions per account in the tx pool ```AccountSlots + AccountQueue``` or ```AccountQueue```?\r\n- What if I try to send more than that? Will Ethereum silently drop the transaction? (as I assume that this is what is happening at the moment)?\r\n",
