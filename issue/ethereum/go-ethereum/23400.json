    "body": "Thanks for the reply. Because I do \"transfer token\" Transaction for USDT contract so gas value depends only on the state (Address's amount token > 0 or = 0) of Address's From or To in the storage contract. Therefore, I think \"eth_estimateGas\" should return at least 46109 but sometimes, it returns 38109 lower than 46109. At the time, \"eth_estimateGas\" returns 38109, it means that the \"transfer\" function (USDT contract) is successfully executed with that value (38109) but in fact, there is not existence a Transaction that successfully executes with that gas value (38109) => contradictory!!",

The transaction will not be added to the blockchain. **Note that the estimate may be significantly more than the amount of gas actually used by the transaction, for a variety of reasons including EVM mechanics and node performance**\". Could you please explain why the value of estimateGas tends to rise (bold paragraph)? Because I've noticed that the value of estimateGas is usually lower than the value of gasUsed (as evidenced by my question above). Thank you very much!",

If you e.g. send a tx to take some bid in an auction or a defi trade, then there might be other players who are frontrunning you transactions, which could cause the state against which you interact in-block to be different compared to when it was evaluated locally. \r\n\r\nSo most differences, I think, would arise from state-changes between estimation and inclusion. Can't really think of any other reason for discrepancies, off the top of my head. \r\n\r\nAnywyay, I think the question is answered? Closing this",
