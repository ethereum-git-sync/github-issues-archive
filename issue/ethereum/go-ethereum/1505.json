    "body": "Yeah, the race detector is really expensive, though I was hoping that the crash might be related to a data race, that's why I suggested you should run with it. We've pushed a small race fix 1-2 days ago, and I'll try to address the other one now. Though I don't think it's the reason for the crashes you are seeing it might be worth a shot.\n\nThe downside is that if the database was corrupted some time ago due to a bug/crash, it may already be too late to fix it. It could probably help to see the offending database, but at it's current size that's probably not possible.\n",
