    "body": "Our JS interpreter is pretty old, and it doesn't support certain things in the newer ECMAScript standards, for example, it cannot handle `async`, which makes anything promise-based not possible. It also differs in the regexp implementation (IIRC it uses the golang regexps, which are different). \r\nTherefore, we can't update to a modern version of web3.js, and even making a small update to web3 is quirky, since we have to modify the javascript to change a few regexp uses (again, IIRC). \r\n\r\nOur console is mainly for some quick manual debugging. We've considered many times to drop it, but OTOH it's highly useful for us as developers, whenever one has to do a quick check on some basic thing, and don't want to spin up a full node environment. \r\n\r\nFor any more advanced contract interaction, you should use a better environment, such as node-based or python-based, with all the bells and whistles. \r\n\r\nI'd like to close this ticket, but maybe we should highlight this somehwere in the docs -- could you point us to any specific places where you think this info should be more visible? \r\n\r\n> (Side issue: can't connect to ws or http or ipc and spent all day trying. Internally, from another computer, ports, firewalls, tried to sideload web3, etc. I finally gave up, loaded web3 into node console, started using an Infura endpoint and gave up on geth entirely.)\r\n\r\nNow _this_ is a lot more concerning to me. Please provide more info, because connecting to ws or http always works like a charm for me, and it's very important that this works well.",
