  "body": "If i try and use the --bootnodes arg and have something like - \n\n```\n--bootnodes='enode://ENODE_IP@host1:30303'\n```\n\nThis won't join - even though if I `ping host1` it resolves to its IP address. If I however replace the above with - \n\n```\n--bootnodes='enode://ENODE_IP@127.0.3.1:30303'\n```\n\nIt works just fine. Should the bootnodes arg be able to use DNS (via /etc/hosts for example) to resolve the IP address? The reason i'm asking as i'm trying to set up a cluster via Docker and using DNS vs IP addresses would be handy in this situation. I'm booting a container off the latest ethereum go docker container on the hub.\n",
