  "body": "#### System information\n\nGeth version: 1.4.6\nOS & Version: Linux(Ubuntu:xenial)\n#### Synopsis\n\nI've got two geth nodes joined together on a private test net.  Both have a coinbase.  I can send transactions from the coinbase on the miner to the coinbase on the client geth.  Post 1.4.6 i cannot send them back.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n- bring up two geths, create coinbase on each, unlock accounts\n- join them together using admin_addPeer\n- start mining on one node - wait for it to have some ether\n- send a transaction of, say, 4 ether from the miner coinbase to the non-miner coinbase\n- observe that this succeeds\n- once the non-miner coinbase has a balance, send some ether back\n- observe that on 1.4.5 this works fine.  on 1.4.6 this transaction is never included\n\nPresumably there is either a bug or I've mis-setup my setup.  But that fact that the txns flow in one direction seems interesting.\n\nI've attached some files that show the problem (dag generation takes a while).  They work on a mac with docker-machine started and presume a docker machine ip address of 192.168.99.100 - you might need to change this to localhost on linux (there are command line args for this).\n\nThe runTest.sh file assumes that you are in a directory called ethBug to help it find the ip address.\n- docker-compose -f geth-docker-1.4.5 build\n- docker-compose -f geth-docker-1.4.5 up\n- npm install      (i'm using node5, but presumably node6 will work)\n- ./runTest.sh\n\nAt this point observe that the test (eventually) finishes with a payment back.\n\nThen:\n- ctrl-c the running docker compose (once)\n- docker-compose -f geth-docker-1.4.5 down\n- docker-compose -f geth-docker-1.4.6 build\n- docker-compose -f geth-docker-1.4.6 up\n- ./runTest.sh\n\nObserve that this does not complete.\n\nYou can see this in the logs for 1.4.6:\n\n```\ngeth-client_1  | I0701 13:09:53.111635 eth/api.go:1193] Tx(0x155385db87d578a08c5efb8486335da0ee690f72c0d10a95ead23763f4fffa09) to: 0xc64b8fc5796146dd68727e7bc3fba4edd7d30bb2\ngeth-miner_1   | I0701 13:09:53.854263 miner/worker.go:337] ðŸ”¨  Mined block (#7 / e95015dc).

    "body": "This was actually a feature that behaves in a weird way on private networks with a single miner.\n\nWe've noticed that on the main network when new nodes join, they already receive and try to process transactions against their whatever stale state. Since initial sync can take quite some time, new nodes manages to pile up 10s of thousands of transactions, which put an enormous burden on them. Our solution was that the nodes do not accept new transactions from remote nodes until they complete their initial sync cycle (= receive either a long chain from a remote node, or a fresh enough block).\n\nIn a private scenario with only 1 miner, the miner actually never completes a sync since it never receives a block from anyone else (as it is the only one minting the blocks). It's an unfortunate corner case we didn't think of.\n\nOne solution is to assume the chain synced when a miner starts mining, but the drawback is that people starting a new node with `--mine` preset could end up in the same sync issue. Another solution was to only accept txs during actual mining (mining is halted during sync), but this results in a single-miner private-network node to stop accepting new txs if mining is stopped (e.g. only mine if txs are present). There's a third (albeit rare) corner case when there is no miner at all, so sync cycle is never assumed complete.\n\nI'm trying to figure out the best solution for this.\n",

    "body": "@karalabe  - that's really interesting, thanks.  So actually in my case i could work around the issue by mining a bit on each node and letting them sync before switching to a single miner.  I will try that and report back later today.\n\nYou might ask why we're only using one miner?  We are trying to have broadly one block per second and we've found that we get into a lot of trouble with multiple miners and low difficulties so we've switched to one miner for the moment. There are other rather interesting issues in this use case.\n\nMany thanks for the clear explanation about what is going on - that's _really_ helpful.  \n",

The \"main\" miner was the only one mining and the other two miners were connected to the  main miner but not each other.  At first, I observed the behavior above.\n\nReading the discussion above, I started mining on the two other nodes at which point transactions were indeed passed along to the main node, however, the two other miners happened to be mining faster than the main miner and they were all out of sync in block numbers.  The main miner (slowest) was in the 1930's, and the other two were in the 2030's range and 2070's, respectively.  None were syncing to the longest chain but were passing on transactions.  I verified all were connected correctly by checking admin.peers.\n",
