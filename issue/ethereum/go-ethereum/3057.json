  "body": "#### System information\n\nGeth version: `1.4.14`\nOS & Version: macOS Sierra\nCommit hash : geth-1.4.14-prerelease-f88bca7-darwin-10.6-amd64\nHardware:\n-     Macbook Pro (2015)\n-     Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-5557U CPU @ 3.10GHz\n-     16GB RAM\n#### Expected behaviour\n\nTypically geth doesn't use an exessive amount CPU for me, and never sits at 100% usage for a length of time. Infrequent usage spikes are the most I usually see.\n#### Actual behaviour\n\nI was previously running `1.4.13` and when I executed `1.4.14` I was only about 100 blocks behind. My CPU usage went to 100% until geth caught up to the current block, then went back to normal\n\nIt also went up to a little over 3.5GB memory usage during this time then settled back down, and is currently at 1.6GB. I can't comment on if this was too out of the norm for me, as I don't remember memory usage on `1.4.13`. (I have 16GB memory, so out of the norm memory utilization doesn't alert me like CPU utilization does)\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\n\nRan with: `--cache 2048 --targetgaslimit 1500000 --gasprice 20000000000 console`\n#### Backtrace\n\nN/A\n",

    "body": "I think that is understandable. Processing blocks is usually computationally intensive, so as long as it settles down when sync finishes I think it's natural. As for the memory usage, given that you allowed 2GB cache, a 3.5GB usage is normal as Go's garbage collector runs when total memory reaches 2x the previous used memory (this is planned to be addressed in Go 1.8).\n",
