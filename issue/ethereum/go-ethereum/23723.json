    "body": "We decided not to handle 'advanced logging' inside go-ethereum. There have, historically, been suggestions to implement log output to file, which leads to: implement log rotation. The latter of these is pretty intricate, since it involves rotating files and compressing older files, removing some files, and generally: handle a lot of errors, and add a bunch of configuration options. \r\n\r\nThis is similar to adding ssl certificates on http endpoint: it's definitely reasonable, but it's a very large surface area, and a lot of added complexity, which there is already external tools that do a lot better than we'll ever be able to. \r\n\r\nSo for advanced logging, you're better off relying on whatever tools are available on your distro, e.g. redirecting to syslog or some cloud logging (we  use papertrail a lot internally). Same for ssl certs: an nginx wrapper is a much more robust and capable ssl terminator with all the bells and whistles already implemented. \r\n",
