  "body": "Sometimes I want to interact with some smart contract ( maybe a decentralized exchange like uni swap)\r\n\r\nAnd I want my transaction to be confirmed __the fastest__.\r\n\r\nBut usually, we are relying on other full nodes to help us broadcast the transactions.\r\n\r\nFor example on uniswap trading website https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap  ,  it use  https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx  as a provider. \r\n\r\nBut the service is not guaranteed and it could delay your request to broadcast the transactions. \r\n\r\nSo I am thinking whether building my own node will be better.\r\n\r\nWhat node could broadcast transactions to miners?    Is __full node__ the only choice?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
