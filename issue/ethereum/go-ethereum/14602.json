I'm using ethminer on my RX 480 to solo mine to a local account I set up through geth. It looks like its working fine, and my GPU sticks to 25 MH/s, but after a day, no matter whether I use the javascript console, Ethereum wallet, or any website, it says I've gotten absolutely nothing. Aren't you supposed to get bits of ethereum over time? Or do you only get any when you mine a whole ether? Because I have absolutely 0 Wei, and it's making me think I'm not actually doing anything.\r\n",
