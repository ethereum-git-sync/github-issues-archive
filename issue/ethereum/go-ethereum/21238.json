We do detect it, but I guess you mean a bit earlier than when the crash occurs :) ? \r\n\r\nCould you link to some specific issues that people have had with this? I believe that in many cases, out of handles depend on \r\n\r\n- Using non-standard filesysstems, like network filesystems where the OS says we can have `X` handles, but the actual fs only handles `Y` (`Y` < `X`).\r\n- Cases where we don't detect the number of allowed handles properly. I know we had issues on OSX previously, and maybe NTFS too. \r\n\r\nI think it might be easier to solve the specific cases individually, whereas this \"generic\" ticket is a bit difficult to take in one bite. As far as I know, there's no sure-fire way to reliably detect \"out of handles\" until you actually go out of handles. \r\n\r\n(So maybe close this?)  ",

I understand the problem is that Geth crashes and it's not even obvious to the user it happened due to a lack of free file handles.
