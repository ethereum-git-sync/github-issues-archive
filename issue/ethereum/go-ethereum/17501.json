  "body": "I've been running geth (1.8.12) as a light server (`--lightserv N`) for a while now, and watching all the discovery msgs sent over the wire (via wireshark + https://github.com/ConsenSys/ethereum-dissectors). I see my node sending a lot of v5 msgs, including pings containing its topic (`LES2@41941023680923e0`, as shown below), but I never see an actual registerTopic msg being sent.\r\n\r\n> INFO [08-24|12:28:38.969] Starting topic registration              topic=LES2@41941023680923e0\r\n\r\nAIUI (and according to https://github.com/fjl/p2p-drafts/blob/master/discv5-topics.md), a node must send a registerTopic after receiving a _ticket_, which I believe is what I see my node receiving in the pongs sent as replies to its pings. I've tried to read the `discv5.Network.loop()` code to track this down, but I can't really follow what's going on there.\r\n\r\nIf this is an actual bug and means nodes are not registering their topics, it'd mean the discv5 DHT is pretty much useless, no?",
