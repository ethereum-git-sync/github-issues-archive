  "body": "\r\nThe bzzup uploader can recursively upload directories to swarm. All files in all subdirectories end up being listed in some manifests but it is not easy to navigate the directory tree on swarm. \r\nThe two options available right now are to load the root manifest in a swarm filemanager or to download the manifests by hand (using bzzr) and inspecting the json.\r\n\r\nWe do not want the bzzd http daemon generating html listings for manifest assets (in the way an apache webserver might generate directory listings); However there is no reason we could not generate a simple file-listing html file during bzzup upload and register it as the empty path in each manifest that would not otherwise have an empty path.\r\nThis enhancement would make onboarding of new users easier, it would potentially vastly decrease the number of errors of the form \"manifest entry for ' ' not found\" (which has to be confusing).\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Bzzd can output better errors without a proxy. They don't need to look fancy for now. These pages will be seen by users if swarm fails to retrieve something and should contain a small amount of debugging info that may hint at the cause.\n\nThe ideas I suggested here were meant as alternatives to the originally proposed bzzup feature (generating HTML listings at upload time). The feature is still useful and I'd love to see it implemented, but IMHO it won't help with the error. Having some amount of support for manifest exploration in bzzd (as part of the HTTP API) would help more, and might just be good enough for basic listings.\n\nAn issue I foresee is that dapps uploading\nmight structure the manifest incorrectly. Built in support for pretty printing a manifest as a listing could help debug this and might be of value to users of such buggy applications (\"I see your app is generating entries as foo/.bar, creating a broken link\").\n\nI remain convinced of my original suggestion for the error page: output `manifest at <hash> does not contain <path>`, with the hash being a link to a very basic listing of the manifest entries.\n\nAgain, sorry for derailing this issue to discuss the error page. The issue is actually about a bzzup feature, and the feature is a good idea.",
