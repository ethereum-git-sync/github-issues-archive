  "body": "The current setup with filter allows that you can guess other filter IDs, (e.g. by counting up) and listen to other filters. \n\nFor ethereum activity this might only be used to disturb other dapps, but for whisper filters it could be used to listen to private encrypted conversations.\n\nA simple fix would be to make the filter ids non numeric e.g. `\"eg35gdf5trew4535\"`, so that they are hard to guess.\n\nAccroding to the RPC specs, ids can also `... contain a String, Number, or NULL value if included.`\n\nThis would make filters safe from spying dapps.\n",
