    "body": "Just to expand a bit on this: `~` is expanded by bash into your home folder. However, for bash to do it's expansion, it must be the first character of a word, otherwise bash assumes it's a literal. So if you don't use `=`, bash will correctly expand it, but otherwise will believe it's a middle character of whatever string so it will leave it as is (bash has no notion of `--var=val` constructs, it's a single string to it, split up by the invoked command internally).\n\ne.g.\n\n```\n$ echo ~\n/home/karalabe\n$ echo =~\n=~\n```\n\nWill close this as it's not something we can fix (apart from manually expanding `~` ourselves, but that's crossing over to bash territory, which we don't want to do).\n",
