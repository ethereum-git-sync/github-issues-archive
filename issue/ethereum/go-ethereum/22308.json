    "body": "@karalabe  Sorry but i don't think you get the full picture of the issue here.\r\nWhen we're sending transfer we're getting gwei price from https://etherscan.io/gastracker average value, so the issue is not related at all to the gwei. \r\n\r\nEven if the issue was the gas price THE TRANSFER SHOULD BE VISIBLE ON BLOCK EXPLORER if we're checking the txid from pending transfers. But when we're checking transfer etherscan return invalid txhash. When transfer is sent out with low gwei and geth successfully process it, transfer is available on block explorer with pending state. \r\n\r\nHere the issue is: transfer is send with correct amount of gwei, and all other necessary details but geth won't send transfers out.  Blocks are updating but if we check eth.pendingTransactions we have plenty of transfers in pending state and when we check any of this txid inside explorer transfer isn't available. IF WE RESTART GETH - GETH BROADCAST TRANSFER AND THEY ARE PROCESSED! It is not a gwei issue it's totally geth fault and broadcast of transfers is happening only after geth restart. I have reported the issue 2 times ~ 1 year ago and it was told to me the issue was fixed (also other users reported same issue but in fact it was never fixed).\r\n\r\nIssue is appearing random after some time and inside geth we don't have any information about transfer just txid which is not valid. Right now we have many transfers in pending state but it looks even after geth restart transfers are still not processed and can't get any information about them from explorer.\r\n\r\n`> eth.pendingTransactions\r\n[{\r\n    blockHash: null,\r\n    blockNumber: null,\r\n    from: \"0x9f2e63c42623fcf34f854c78335a668c327dac48\",\r\n    gas: 21000,\r\n    gasPrice: 140000000000,\r\n    hash: \"0xc641ec3e02d2b094e0e8b6f82897fce2953625ea88e769011d89c6a1fb80658a\",\r\n    input: \"0x\",\r\n    nonce: 27,\r\n    r: \"0xcc52ed99ce1d3434ea90419926dba2da516ed6692c9a84843497eb289cb8b459\",\r\n    s: \"0x1ebfbadd1383c246ab16215d52a3cefc4d678bfeb9940bba590968bf1a98222a\",\r\n    to: \"0xd819b145004b4e88c2f9f814246800f65c4b1e9b\",\r\n    transactionIndex: null,\r\n    v: \"0x25\",\r\n    value: 113387710000000000\r\n}, {\r\n    blockHash: null,\r\n    blockNumber: null,\r\n    from: \"0x9f2e63c42623fcf34f854c78335a668c327dac48\",\r\n    gas: 21000,\r\n    gasPrice: 120000000000,\r\n    hash: \"0x6c84bbb044aa2aea668c841f3274f1b08ca6da4da699eefeec95467d6f4bef92\",\r\n    input: \"0x\",\r\n    nonce: 28,\r\n    r: \"0xec0fa88cde01b05db0027091e1008814fe9e1b50a1511833baaa14d800d69378\",\r\n    s: \"0x7f98553c04ddd58631eb0852e0dbee779b2b7aa0b97c1ec1bbf42d72565eeae4\",\r\n    to: \"0x4f9637a095cb48ecfdea7d5abece9bf51bbc752b\",\r\n    transactionIndex: null,\r\n    v: \"0x26\",\r\n    value: 320793360000000000\r\n}, {\r\n    blockHash: null,\r\n    blockNumber: null,\r\n    from: \"0x9f2e63c42623fcf34f854c78335a668c327dac48\",\r\n    gas: 33545,\r\n    gasPrice: 133000000000,\r\n    hash: \"0x375a4fae37ad86fb1f3dbd9b1f886acc0b1655ceea0537940f696496735cb75b\",\r\n    input: \"0x\",\r\n    nonce: 29,\r\n    r: \"0xaf54cff52cd8b0020d9858ee1c47d33ca919ffe1fae6bd655230d9b7b0b03f55\",\r\n    s: \"0x342cb0eb881d8111b2dfb032d29a24239176e2ffdb1eeda1ea650aa67924a883\",\r\n    to: \"0xd76becb1ae8588963515c52e8941f1b002471715\",\r\n    transactionIndex: null,\r\n    v: \"0x25\",\r\n    value: 7633337180000000000\r\n}, {\r\n    blockHash: null,\r\n    blockNumber: null,\r\n    from: \"0x9f2e63c42623fcf34f854c78335a668c327dac48\",\r\n    gas: 21000,\r\n    gasPrice: 155000000000,\r\n    hash: \"0xf3d1a44b11ac2c85e406214ac7f3cca6ff23d62967403816e9282fcee92fbff6\",\r\n    input: \"0x\",\r\n    nonce: 30,\r\n    r: \"0x3ace40d0cf3103711f896f6d1618693848ae39a599d20cd6aff6ec3ce85d3590\",\r\n    s: \"0x6f9cdc5c7a966aa27c0ae7eb4047e02aac8f9baad16a45bfaae11368c243ffec\",\r\n    to: \"0x87a38ff8789409c5efd5c4686d0baea5661b38bd\",\r\n    transactionIndex: null,\r\n    v: \"0x25\",\r\n    value: 100000000000000000\r\n}]\r\n`",

It may cost about 1.5 hours for geth to re-broadcast these transactions to the network and then these transactions confirmed by the network.\r\nBy the way, this happens very randomly, in our case it may happen once in 3~5 days.",

How many transactions do you push into the network when this happens, how fast do you push them in, what is the txpool content at that time (`txpool.inspect`).\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of moving variables, and we're mostly confident Geth handles things correctly in general, but once you push transactions over the limits of your local and remote peer's capacities, things might get unreliable.\r\n\r\nI'm 100% certain Geth published every transaction it gets. The question is why the those transactions get dropped by remote nodes to which you send it to. It hits some limits, the question is which one. ",

Do you have any temporary solution how to have this transfers available on network? ~ 2 years ago when we face same issue and we restarted geth, pending transfers from geth were executed 2 times and we lost some huge amount because of that. Please kindly let us know what we can do to have transfers properly sent out from geth. We have also prepared other servers with geth fully synced but i am not sure if we can move keystores and migrate to new one, and what will happen with pending transfers from old geth?  We don't want to have transfers executed 2 times. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "@Gbogdann93 It's completely understandable that you don't want to debug/test on live environments, independent how much funds are at stake. Obviously don't test in prod.\r\n\r\nOur suggestion was a bit different. We are mostly convinced that it's not your local node that's not sending out transactions, rather it's the nodes around you (the ones you're connected to) that are rejecting them after they receive them.\r\n\r\nAs such, you don't need to touch your production nodes at all really. What we need is a completely independent new node, that is simply connected to your production nodes and doesn't do anything special, just behaves like any other live node (with high verbosity logging). Martin suggested you set it up because you might feel better if no details about your infra are shared with us.\r\n\r\nWe can set up a node ourselves too with all the logging we'd need, the only thing we need is to be connected to your own nodes to see what's happening on the wire. We can whitelist your nodes to allow them to always connect to us if you give us `enode` URLs; though we'd probably need you to add our node as a connection to ensure there's a link when things go wonky. Then whenever you tell us a tx is dropped, we could dig up the events from out own logs to see what happened.\r\n\r\nThis bug is obviously a rare thing that I still say depends on network conditions. You won't be able to reproduce it easily, because there's no singular cause and wou won't be able to reproduce the network conditions. The only option we see is if we can somehow monitor the network traffic and analyze the events after-the-fact. So Option A: you set up an extra node within your infra, have it connected to your servers and send us logs; Option B: we set up our monitoring nodes and run it the best we can, but we still need to know we have a connection to your systems when weird things happen.",

It sucks, but this almost always gaurantees they are seen.  We no longer have those stuck transactions with this setup.\r\n\r\nThe time this fails is large gas spikes and you have TXs that are stuck for multiple hours because of gas fees.  When this happens, all the tx's you have out there are dropped, and all the endpoints you've sent them to already know about them too and have dropped them as well.  The only way to fix that is basically find a new endpoint to rebroadcast the tx to.  \r\n\r\nAs a service operator that relies on geth this entire thing is extremely frustrating.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

(sorry i was in a rush so couldn't capture the messages) So I thing the problem might be when Geth is running for quite some time, it doesn't validate the health of the other nodes it is connected to and drop the bad/unsync ones properly so when it broadcasts a transaction it doesn't get relayed properly.",

It may be failed to broadcast 3~5 txs occasionally.\r\nBut for version `1.10.1`, geth failed to broadcast the large portion of the 100 txs almost every time. When I tried to re-send the raw tx to geth, it reported `already known`, but when I check on etherscan, nothing found.\r\nI have to deploy a script to fetch all the stuck txs from the `txpool` and send the txs to other third party node.\r\n\r\n[update] After I checked the peers count on my node, I found that the node only connected to 16 peers. Then I changed the firewall rules to allow `30303` port. I've managed to make geth `1.10.1` to broadcast my batch txs to the network smoothly. So far so good. I think this broadcast issue indeed has big connections with the peers count and quality.",

MaxPeers value, which was 25.\r\nWith this configuration, geth only had 3 to 4 peers. And the issue happened several times a day - everyday.\r\nTo resolve, I did stop, sleep 10 seconds, and start geth daemon. Then, somehow the pending transactions were broadcasted.\r\n\r\nYesterday, after **changing MaxPeers to 100**, \r\npeers were around 33 and **there's no pending transactions so far**.\r\n\r\nI know it's too early to reach a conclusion. But may help someone else.\r\n\r\n[update @ 2021-04-02]\r\nFor last 2 days, there were no pending transactions at 1.9.25\r\nAfter upgrade to 1.10.1, I had only one pending transaction condition.\r\nSo I'm pretty sure that MaxPeers helps to reduce pending transaction case.",
