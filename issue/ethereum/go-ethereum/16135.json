  "body": "Hi there,\r\n\r\nI noticed that there is no information on how to adapt `callTracer` or any other tracers in online guides. The only documentation at all about tracers was [v1.8.0 announcement](https://blog.ethereum.org/2018/02/14/geth-1-8-iceberg%C2%B9/) and [source code](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/tree/master/eth/tracers/internal/tracers). \r\n\r\nI would be happy to update documentation myself and send a pull request if that helps, but I would need some help on figuring things out. Currently I have no idea even how to install these tracers. Could someone provide some clues?\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nAndrew",
