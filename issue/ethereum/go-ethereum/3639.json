  "body": "#### System information\r\n\r\nGeth version: 1.5.8-stable\r\nOS & Version: OSX\r\nCommit hash : `f58fb322`\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n- RPC server is expected to be available during header syncing\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Actual behaviour\r\n- Everything blocks up until sync is done\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\r\n- While this issue was first found when we tried to run `eth.*` commands using web3, this issue can be reproduced in console as well\r\n- Basically, `geth --light --testnet console`, then once sync starts, you cannot call any commands (they block), you can't event dump `eth` object by typing `eth ENTER`:\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/188194/22584495/bb724020-ea03-11e6-96e5-09a97f1c1fc5.png)\r\n\r\n#### More Notes\r\n- the issue is introduced by this commit: https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/3413/commits/c57c54ce96628aeb6345776310123a80593f0143 (I've tested code prior to that commit - no blocking exists there)\r\n- the very same or really similar issue was already accepted and fix was provided by https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/3607. From description of that PR:\r\n> removes the mechanism which delayed starting the LES server side protocol until ETH was fully synced. This mechanism solved a problem that does not exist anymore, clients now check server's reported head before sending requests and choose a server that can actually serve it. At the same time it caused other problems, like not starting LES server at all when the node was mining alone on a private net. Also, not starting the protocol stalled connections to other LES servers through ETH, even though they did not want to do anything with each other through LES.\r\n- probably some aspects of the problem are solved with that PR, but the problem reported in this issue (that's blocking calls to `eth` - using RPC, via console or web3) is still there\r\n\r\n#### Severity\r\n- This issue is really severe. Blocking/delaying light client server up until full sync (especially on mobile devices where we use LES, and where sync is a bit slower) is huge concern, as it prevents users from using our app up until sync is done",
