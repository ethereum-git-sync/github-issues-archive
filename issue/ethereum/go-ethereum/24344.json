  "body": "# Rationale\r\n\r\nFor automated managers of Geth nodes (i.e. DAppNode https://github.com/dappnode/DNP_DAPPMANAGER/issues/915) it would be necessary to know reliably that `--prune` has completed (either successfully or not), in order to restart Geth without `--prune` flag. To my knowledge the only signal that pruning is done is a log to stdout.\r\n\r\n# Implementation\r\n\r\nTouch a flag file when prune is complete if some flag is set, i.e. `--prune-flag-file`. Otherwise if the team can assure that the printed log to stdout is reliable enough and won't ever change without a breaking change notice that should work too but it's a bit more ugly.\r\n\r\nLet me know if that makes sense or what you think is a better strategy",
