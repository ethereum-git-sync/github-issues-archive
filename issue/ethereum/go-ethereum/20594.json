  "body": "I had deployed my private blockchain network back in 2018-08-12 16:12:48 +0600 (1 year, 167 days ago). Since then it is working. At that time the block time was 20-30 seconds which was acceptable for our private transaction. But now a days the average block time has increased to 1 min and sometimes it takes 8-10 minutes to mine a single block which seems crazy ;(\r\n\r\nNB: There are 7 running nodes and all them has 8 GB ram.

    "body": "In PoW mode the network adjusts to 14 second blocks, independent of mining power, so this seems odd. Perhaps it's the ice age? What's your chain configs (i.e. which forks did you enable on your network)? In general is would seem odd to use a PoW private network, since the security will be 0 unless you have massive mining power. Why not use PoA (Clique)?",
