  "body": "This feature request is related to taming memory and complexity issues related to trace, more specifically https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/2547 and https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/2546\n\nThe idea would be that rather than making traceTransaction super-smart and super-optimized, it could be invoked multiple times to provide the relevant data.\n1. you would invoke it a first time with a \"light trace\" option, and it would return just an array of opcodes (and maybe depth), the idea is to have something lightweight in terms of JSON\n2. you would then call it again, specifying the steps (indexes in the previous array) for which you want trace, and it would return the full trace, as usual, but just for those steps, and nothing else\n\nThe VM could be run multiple times, no special optimization needed. This would allow for complex transactions with hundreds of thousandths of steps to be traced piecemeal (like 0x9b3d5c27071b5ed45bff4e3c48b97efd790e9455cef4c92748ac5e27f99d59da)\n",
