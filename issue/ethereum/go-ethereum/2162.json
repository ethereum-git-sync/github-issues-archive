I was trying to get any more details about the issue.\n\nSo the firewall we have is Cisco ASA5505, but I was said by IT guy it _does not_ blocks connections from my computer. The limit of opened connections is 2000.\n\nThe true issue is, after some time of running geth (`geth --networkid 666`) I have internet connectivity problems - some hosts are unreachable and/or responses are very slow. If you have idea what test I can perform to detect the issue please let me know.\n",
