  "body": "This issue came up in a discussion here: https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/pull/239\r\n\r\nI think the correct approach is to set `chainId` for legacy txs that take advantage of EIP-155. If we want to take it a step farther, we could say that `chainId = 0` refers to a tx valid on any chain. This is essentially what the `tx.ChainId()` method does.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nAdditionally, accepting `chainId` in `TransactionArgs` seems superfluous. If `chainId` doesn't match with the client it should probably be an error anyways. Seems simpler to just remove it altogether.",
