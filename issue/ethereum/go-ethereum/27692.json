  "body": "Although snap is great, there are a few classes of users that I don't think it serves the best:\r\n\r\n1) Ethereum users with poor internet, but good hardware -- for these users it will take a while for the healing phase to complete\r\n1) Ethereum power-users who need to sync new nodes and have powerful hardware capable of quickly recomputing state -- yes healing will be relatively fast, but likely not as fast as fully executing the blocks from a recent state checkpoint\r\n1) Ethereum clones with high gas limits -- some of these churn state so much that _most_ hardware / networks are insufficient to ever complete healing (#25965)\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, it might be interesting to allow users to opt-in to some type of warp-sync-like-scheme using snap. \r\n\r\nThe general idea would be to have a way to tell geth to stop at certain intervals to \"preserve\" the snap layers for that block and to also allow clients to pass a specific node id to snap sync from and avoid pivoting to a later block (so long as the target continues responding).",
