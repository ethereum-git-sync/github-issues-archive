Sometimes, just waiting for a while (with no predictable period of time), it just starts again. It threw these errors in the past, and then I regenerated the DAG and it worked again. But now, even that doesn't seem to kickstart it again. Trying all possibilities to figure out why it is locking up. And trying to figure why it started working again previously.\n",

    "body": "So, I did some debugging (aka waiting). Turns out sometimes my miner on OS X just slows down to something like a 10th of its usual hashrate, thus causing blocks to sometimes be as long as 10 minutes. \n\nI can't seem to figure out when this happens to reproduce it predictably. Stop and starting it, doesn't always work. Regenerating the DAG also doesn't work always. Also, even restarting isn't predictable.\n\nSo, I suspect there might be something else happening rather than just system-level resource issues.\n",

    "body": "Unfortunately, still experiencing issues with this. Thought about making a new issue, tell me if I should.\n\nOn v0.9.23. It's definitely an issue with an inconsistent hashrate still. It's incredibly difficult to debug. I have no idea where to start looking. I can't measure the hashrate before it actually solves a block. The only way I know it is actually trying to mine is that my Mac goes slightly slower & it does eventually find a block (sometimes only 10min later). Sometimes it never finds a new block (even after 30min). Then sometimes it just \"snaps\" back, and produces blocks on the regular (< 12s/block).\n\nI'm not sure why I'm getting inconsistent hashrates. My suspicion is that it might be DAG-related? (the only reason guess it is this, because this is the only thing that is relatively different than other blockchain mining systems). But even if I restart and try it, it is something wonky.\n\nAny advice on how to debug this? Any help appreciated.\n",

It's not generating anything useful (at verbosity 4 at least).\n\nAt verbosity 8 there's too much noise, so I tried piping it to a logfile (to grep the related mining logs and see if there are logs I'm missing), but it seems I'm having issues with --logfile. Will debug that.\n\nfwiw. Here's the log on startup at verbosity 4.\n\n```\nSimon-2:~ simon$ geth --networkid 66612 --verbosity 4 console\nI0526 18:54:54.250354   53354 backend.go:255] Protocol Version: 60, Network Id: 66612\nI0526 18:54:54.250397   53354 backend.go:265] Blockchain DB Version: 2\nI0526 18:54:54.250646   53354 statedb.go:232] (+) 6c386a4b26f73c802f34673f7248bb118f97424a\nI0526 18:54:54.250712   53354 statedb.go:232] (+) cd2a3d9f938e13cd947ec05abc7fe734df8dd826\nI0526 18:54:54.250762   53354 statedb.go:232] (+) 2ef47100e0787b915105fd5e3f4ff6752079d5cb\nI0526 18:54:54.250802   53354 statedb.go:232] (+) 0000000000000000000000000000000000000002\nI0526 18:54:54.250867   53354 statedb.go:232] (+) 0000000000000000000000000000000000000004\nI0526 18:54:54.250911   53354 statedb.go:232] (+) dbdbdb2cbd23b783741e8d7fcf51e459b497e4a6\nI0526 18:54:54.250952   53354 statedb.go:232] (+) e4157b34ea9615cfbde6b4fda419828124b70c78\nI0526 18:54:54.250993   53354 statedb.go:232] (+) b9c015918bdaba24b4ff057a92a3873d6eb201be\nI0526 18:54:54.251031   53354 statedb.go:232] (+) e6716f9544a56c530d868e4bfbacb172315bdead\nI0526 18:54:54.251072   53354 statedb.go:232] (+) 1a26338f0d905e295fccb71fa9ea849ffa12aaf4\nI0526 18:54:54.251116   53354 statedb.go:232] (+) 0000000000000000000000000000000000000001\nI0526 18:54:54.251156   53354 statedb.go:232] (+) 0000000000000000000000000000000000000003\nI0526 18:54:54.251629   53354 chain_manager.go:247] Last block (#140) 4a81847735e3d5a877d5588657dd65b4259b8054135eb102bfab6f1ed9c4fc2c TD=19075754\nI0526 18:54:54.258025   53354 statedb.go:232] (+) 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\nI0526 18:54:54.258646   53354 state_object.go:241] 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000: gas (+ 3141592)\nI0526 18:54:54.258687   53354 state_object.go:197] 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000: #0 1500000000000000000 (+ 1500000000000000000)\nI0526 18:54:54.263672   53354 cmd.go:137] Starting Geth/v0.9.23/darwin/go1.4\nI0526 18:54:54.263756   53354 server.go:209] Starting Server\nI0526 18:54:56.827149   53354 udp.go:189] Listening, enode://27f6ddad5e8b84a6d3e2f97c609a83831fa075ff43e664053d25ee27a4661682aa6d8477fc8c777ce608c6fc12814f1fff942d335df1619ffa32c072d408cc56@196.210.150.223:30303\nI0526 18:54:56.827273   53354 backend.go:479] Server started\nI0526 18:54:56.827255   53354 server.go:349] Listening on [::]:30303\n> admin.miner.start()\nI0526 18:55:58.657861   53354 backend.go:593] Automatic pregeneration of ethash DAG ON (ethash dir: /Users/simon/.ethash)\nI0526 18:55:58.657926   53354 backend.go:600] checking DAG (ethash dir: /Users/simon/.ethash)\nI0526 18:55:58.657935   53354 miner.go:100] Starting mining operation (CPU=8 TOT=10)\ntrue\n> I0526 18:55:58.658760   53354 state_object.go:241] ba28a0a1e4c209a5a5789ff3d454e8cfeae7274c: gas (+ 3141592)\nI0526 18:55:58.658784   53354 worker.go:349] commit new work on block 141 with 0 txs & 0 uncles\nI0526 18:55:58.658800   53354 state_object.go:197] ba28a0a1e4c209a5a5789ff3d454e8cfeae7274c: #0 225000000000000000000 (+ 1500000000000000000)\nI0526 18:55:58.658968   53354 ethash.go:186] Generating DAG for epoch 0 (0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000)\nI0526 18:55:59.680981   53354 ethash.go:203] Done generating DAG for epoch 0, it took 1.022034247s\n```\n\nThen stopping and running it again.\n\n```\n> admin.miner.stop()\nI0526 18:57:00.337813   53354 backend.go:647] Automatic pregeneration of ethash DAG OFF (ethash dir: /Users/simon/.ethash)\ntrue\n> admin.miner.start()\nI0526 18:57:05.665683   53354 backend.go:593] Automatic pregeneration of ethash DAG ON (ethash dir: /Users/simon/.ethash)\nI0526 18:57:05.665746   53354 backend.go:600] checking DAG (ethash dir: /Users/simon/.ethash)\nI0526 18:57:05.665771   53354 miner.go:100] Starting mining operation (CPU=8 TOT=10)\ntrue\n> I0526 18:57:05.666457   53354 state_object.go:241] ba28a0a1e4c209a5a5789ff3d454e8cfeae7274c: gas (+ 3141592)\nI0526 18:57:05.666481   53354 worker.go:349] commit new work on block 141 with 0 txs & 0 uncles\nI0526 18:57:05.666495   53354 state_object.go:197] ba28a0a1e4c209a5a5789ff3d454e8cfeae7274c: #0 225000000000000000000 (+ 1500000000000000000)\n```\n\nIn both cases, nothing new happens. This is obviously after the DAG has been created. It's not related to a newly created DAG, since even if I nuke it and redo the DAG, it also just hang and waits (assuming it's generating poor hashrates).\n\nBest debug would be to know what the hashrate is before I even find a block. That could give more clues.\n",

    "body": "Looking at the code, if I understand it correctly nextEpoch isn't set the first time it is started, thus it tries to generate the DAG again, but it is already done, so it just looks like it is generating it twice. That could explain that part?\n\nHowever. The mining works sometimes and then sometimes it doesn't. So don't think it is the generation of the DAG that is the issue. I can mine, turn it off, do some coding, not closing geth and then try to mine some new transactions and then it just doesn't mine new blocks (or 1 every 10 - 30min). So something is happening subsequently, causing hashrate to drop substantially, and randomly. I've rebooted and ran it, and the hashrate was horrible. I've used a fully encumbered system and it mined perfectly. \n\nThis has been failing since 0.9.20 (the first version I tried in a while, so the error could've come from earlier), not the new auto-updating DAG code. \n",

    "body": "Nope. Nothing.\n\nHowever, I've been trying to figure out what could be causing it to slow down so considerably. Understandably it behaves slightly more consistently with less load on the machine. So, I proceeded to kill all running apps, and then after about 2 minutes, it started producing blocks (while keeping 8 threads running). When producing blocks the hashrate is in the excess of 260k - 320k. 1 thread produces 59k. When it is really slow it was around 20k (for all 8 threads combined).\n\nThis could just be some fluke again, because I have run geth straight from a fresh reboot and it didn't produce blocks. (I'll be pretty annoyed if it is a fluke, because I'm starting to feel like I'm just wasting everyone's time here).\n\nI just wish there was a way to know for sure that the load on the machine is causing it to decrease. Or, introduce some information what the current hashrate is (before even finding a block), and when (considering the difficulty) an expected block will be found. And as more resources become available it should update as it goes along.\n\nIs there any other way I could debug this more? Or any other way I can produce blocks more consistently and not get hiccups when developing?\n",
