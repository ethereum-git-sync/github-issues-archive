This looks like it reaches into the mempool to find out if your local node has pending transactions. How come it needs to reach out to peers? I get sometimes get a 'no peer available' error on requests sometimes. Does this not work locally or does it try to get pending status from other peers as well for some type of confidence measure?",

It will scan incoming blocks and try to detect inclusion, but the only way to see if remote nodes still maintain it or dropped it is to ask them. It can give you a hint as to whether your transaction is underpriced or similar issues.",
