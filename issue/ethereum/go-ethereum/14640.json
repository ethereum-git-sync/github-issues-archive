  "body": "Recently I installed the ethereum client on my linux laptop. When I did so, I found there was already an account present. I did not realize that the private key to that account is actually locked with a password for sending out from. I thought this was a default initial account.\r\n\r\nWhat had happened (but which I forgot about) was that I had installed the client before, but never used it. Then I had some OS re-installs (but preserving my home dir) due to problems with my laptop, and only now I re-installed the client. About 6 months went in between. I did not realize this account was an older one.\r\n\r\nI tried sending a little ETH into it first, and it worked, so I sent more. Totalling 82 ETH.\r\n\r\nSo I must have typed the password (twice) back then, when the account was created the first time. And normally I'd use one of just a few passwords for these things. But none work.\r\n\r\nI've been in touch with Dave Bitcoin <walletrecoveryservices@gmail.com> already, but just wondering if anyone else may have some ideas.\r\n\r\nI feel like a total ass, especially since these things are worth almost $30k at this time. I should have tried sending out first after depositing a little bit. I'm used to bitcoin using multibit, where the keys are backed up with one master password. Also, when creating new addresses in multibit, only the master password is used. I never realized each key in ethereum is encrypted individually. \r\n\r\nIt's not the end of the world, but it is a lot of money and it will take me quite a while to build that up again.\r\n\r\nAlso, perhaps this may help others to prevent the same situation. If you are re-installing ethereum, make sure you create a new account so that you are sure of your password.",

    "body": "Update: I got they key unlocked with the help of Dave @ walletrecoveryservices.com  \r\n\r\nIn the end it turned out to be a combination of the passwords I would normally use. Very dumb on my part, and an expensive lesson learned (but far less expensive than it could have been).\r\n\r\nVery good service, trustworthy. Dave took the 20% that was agreed upon. I transferred the remaining 80% to a new key. If you're desperate, give him a try:\r\n\r\nDave Bitcoin <walletrecoveryservices@gmail.com>\r\n\r\nIn hindsight I should have tried more myself, not have given up so soon, but that is another lesson learned.",
