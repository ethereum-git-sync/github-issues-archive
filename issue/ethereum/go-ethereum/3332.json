This is very convenient for a number of reasons.\r\n\r\n* If I consistently run two clients I can set one of them to use a different port by default so that they do not conflict.\r\n* Certain command line flags are inherently long, such as `--bootnodes`.  Being able to hide these within a config file makes command line interaction easier.\r\n* Being able to specify which config file to use with something like `--config` allows for pre-saved configurations.\r\n\r\n### How could it be implemented\r\n\r\n* Have `geth` load defaults for cli options from a config file from somewhere like `./data-dir/<config-file>`.\r\n* Anything provided via command line would override values from a config file.\r\n* Allow specifying a specific config file with something like `--config`\r\n\r\n#### Cute animal picture\r\n\r\n![baby-hippo-hippos-24490777-500-667](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/824194/20567124/d562bc68-b154-11e6-9e96-b1796a6b5648.jpeg)\r\n\r\n",

I don't see why the implementation of a config file cannot be done so that it protects people from the common pitfalls.\r\n> \r\n> If a config value is present in the file that doesn't map to one of the allowed options display a warning or throw an error.\r\n> At startup, if a config file was found or used, print out a message indicating as much: \"Loaded configuration options /path/to/config.something\"\r\n> As for maintenance overhead, it has been almost a year since this was first proposed. I understand there is overhead here, but configuration via config file is extremely common and geth has matured a lot in the last 10 months.",

    "body": "My main concern with configuration files is that they are error prone and generally dangerous in critical systems and maybe even more so in programs where there's actual value involved.\r\n\r\nHaving an additional file means that you need to make sure that an additional file is protected (e.g. write protected and maybe even read only by you). There are certainly ways that we can accommodate but we can't help everyone from making silly mistakes.\r\n\r\nHere's one such an example that might seem OK at first. Let's assume the following configuration file:\r\n\r\n```config\r\nrpcaddr: 127.0.0.1\r\nrpcport: 8080\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is neat, we bind the rpcaddr to localhost on port 8080. This configuration option is *extremely* dangerous, especially if someone gains access to this \"silly\" configuration file. `rpcaddr 0.0.0.0` is **extremely** dangerous as it will give anyone on the internet remote access to the RPC and might (if you recall past incidents) swipe your accounts if left open.\r\n\r\nI'm sure there are other such scenarios where attacks become plausible, and for what, because we are lazy? Because it's trivial to have configuration files?\r\n\r\nSecurity is way more important.",

    "body": "I'm sorry @obscuren but I don't feel like your argument against config files holds up.\r\n\r\nYou say that config files are dangerous because an attacker with access can modify something like the `rpchost`.  That same argument applies to your proposed alternative to config files which I believe is either a bash alias (which would likely be in `$HOME/.profile`), or a shell script.  An attacker who can access these files can produce the same harmful results.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of critical systems that use config files.  I don't know if this helps or hurts my case, but I recall the bitcoin client allowing configuration via config file.  Parity has config file support.  Every database that I know of has a config file.  Most software that I've used supports configuration via a config file and while I understand that you feel it's a security hole or foot gun or something, I think the prevalence of configuration via config file across the software world is evidence to the contrary. \r\n\r\nI've made my case for this and said what I have to say.  I understand that this may not be a feature that the go team supports and I'll respect that decision.  Thank you very much for creating the go ethereum client.  It's awesome and I appreciate all the hard work you and the rest of the team have done in creating it.\r\n\r\n#### How about this cute animal????!??!\r\n\r\n![73406284](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/824194/20584597/69ca597c-b1b1-11e6-9461-4bbd1f88a211.jpeg)\r\n ",

I'd prefer to have orderly configuration files. \r\n\r\nIf we're concerned about protection and erroneous configs or whatever, we could do something like this:\r\n\r\n* Geth is started with a configfile.\r\n* All configfile options are displayed:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    You're about to launch geth with the following config\r\n    networkId: 3\r\n    bootnodes: [...]\r\n```    \r\n\r\nFor any security related options, we could print a warning and prompt:\r\n \r\n    WARNING: This configuration enables RPC over external address\r\n    enable? (y/N)\r\n\r\n    WARNING: This configuration enables admin API over RPC\r\n    enable? (y/N)\r\n\r\nPeople may configure strange defaults, but anyone running a 'complex' setup is likely to just shove it in a script anyway. So I think providing warnings and user-prompts may enhance security from where we are now. A bit like providing password managers; the alternatives (easy passwords, password reuse, txt-files) that people will use otherwise are worse.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe could also do it so that security defaults are not even, e.g. setting the rpc to non-localhost isn't even possible, whereas setting chaindata folder maybe should.\r\n",
