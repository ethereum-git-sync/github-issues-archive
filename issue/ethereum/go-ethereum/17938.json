  "body": "I'm doing a Clique with #signers=6, blocktime=5s, and from time to time the blockchain got stuck, and I see in the logs some `ðŸ˜± block lost` messages. I'm wondering if the blocktime is too low.\r\n\r\nI checked the clique code, and I see that clique uses a variable signature delay to allow concurrent signatures, based on the number of signers\r\n\r\n```\r\n   wiggleTime = 500 * time.Millisecond // Random delay (per signer) to allow concurrent signers\r\n   // It's not our turn explicitly to sign, delay it a bit\r\n   wiggle := time.Duration(len(snap.Signers)/2+1) * wiggleTime\r\n   delay += time.Duration(rand.Int63n(int64(wiggle)))\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, what is the the \"good\" relationship between the #signers and the block time?  (it can be done ommiting network propagation time?)\r\n\r\nI think that could be nice to issue a warning if the relationship is in a \"danger area\", I will write the code and do a PR for that.\r\n\r\n**=== UPDATE ===**\r\n\r\nThe blockchain stalled seems due a bad firewall configuration of the clound provider.",
