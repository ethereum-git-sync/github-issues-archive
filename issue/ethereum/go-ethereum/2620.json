  "body": "I was trying the greeter example on https://www.ethereum.org/greeter and I could not find out why my contract deployment did not work. It did not display anything after the `greeterContract.new` call while I started geth with `--verbosity 2`.\n#### System information\n\nGeth version: 1.5.0-unstable (`develop` branch)\nOS & Version: Windows 7 x64\nGo Version: go1.6.2\nCommit hash : 5bcdbb1ce4ac576cab778e9772fabdcc7cbfbb5f\n#### Expected behaviour\n\nI expected geth to ask me for my password to unlock my account just like it does for `eth.sendTransaction` or to at least show a message saying that it could not deploy the contract because the account was locked.\n#### Actual behaviour\n\nNothing happened after calling the `new` method on the contract from `web3.eth.contract()`.\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\n- Start geth with `--verbosity 2` in console mode.\n- Make sure not to unlock your account(s).\n- Follow the steps mentioned on [the greeter contract example](https://www.ethereum.org/greeter).\n- Notice that after calling `greeterContract.new`, nothing happens.\n",
