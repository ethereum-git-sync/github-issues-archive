    "body": "Thanks for the heads up!\r\n\r\nMyeah. The discovery of the light client protocol was nuked, currently it can only do DNS discovery, which puppeth/faucet is not capable of. Because of this, the faucet can only ever talk to the bootnode. Hopefully a replacement will be shipped for the discovery or maybe I'll take a look at somehow hacking some more options into puppeth.\r\n\r\nEither way, I've restarted the faucet and it's in sync now, so please try again. If it borked again, please notify me.",
