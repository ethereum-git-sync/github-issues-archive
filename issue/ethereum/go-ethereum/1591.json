    "body": "Ommer? What the heck does that mean? Is it the same as uncle?\nEDIT: ok, I think I got the answer. First, I didn't know there can be up to 2 uncles per block.\nThen the most important point I was missing: uncles and block share the same numbers!\nI though there was a different numeration for uncles, unrelated to that for the blocks.\nRather, if the uncle is one level above the block, then its number is equal to the block's father number, i.e. [block number] - 1. If its 2 levels above, then [block number] - 2, etc. Am I correct?\n",
