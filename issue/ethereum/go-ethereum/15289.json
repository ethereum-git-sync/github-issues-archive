  "body": "#### System information\r\n\r\nGeth version: `1.7.0 (also tested on 1.7.1 stable and 1.6.6)`\r\nOS & Version: Linux (Ubuntu 14.04)\r\n\r\n#### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\n1. Send a transaction to a remote address with correct nonce n, and gas price p.\r\n2. Overwrite this transaction by sending a new transaction with same nonce n and gas price p * 1.25\r\n3. Original transaction should be overwritten.\r\n\r\n#### Actual behaviour\r\n\r\n1. Send a transaction to a remote address with correct nonce n, and gas price p.\r\n2. Overwrite this transaction by sending a new transaction with same nonce n and gas price p * 1.25\r\n3. We are shown a transaction hash from step 2, but it is never broadcasted. The transaction from step 1 remains the only visible transaction remotely. There is no change even after waiting a few minutes.\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\r\n1. Open Geth console (Geth attach)\r\n2. Send a transaction that won't be processed quickly. It should broadcast as expected: eth.sendTransaction({to:\"0xDEADBEEF\",from:\"0x0xCAFEBABE\",gas: 250000, gasPrice: web3.toWei(3, 'gwei')})\r\n3. Attempt to overwrite it:\r\neth.sendTransaction({to:\"0xDEADBEEF\",from:\"0x0xCAFEBABE\",gas: 250000, gasPrice: web3.toWei(5, 'gwei'), nonce: <the nonce of the txn from step 2>})\r\n4. You will be shown a txn hash from step 3, but it does not broadcast.\r\n\r\n\r\nWorth noting that restarting Geth will correctly broadcast the replacement after it reloads the pending transactions.",
