For the state prefetcher, we think it's already bound by IO, and adding more threads that tries to resolve nodes would not improve the situation, it would only add more goroutines waiting for IO.\r\n\r\nYour follow up PR basically created goroutines like crazy to massively try to read from the backend. I had already said that we were sceptical about doing so. \r\n\r\n> even after I proved my case.\r\n\r\nOn a testcase, which runs in isolation, you were able to achieve higher speeds when you used \"unlimited\" number of goroutines to read. On a live blockchain, there are other things going on aswell, and we can't just have 1000 goroutines dedicated to hammering the disk. So in order for us to actually evaluate it, we would have to put it on on our benchmarking nodes, let it run for a week, and see the results. \r\n\r\nHowever, despite my already expressed scepticism about it, I would have done it on your PR, but apparently I was not fast enough for you.  \r\n\r\n>  and contributions are indeed unwelcome\r\n\r\nI'm one of the maintainers, and I've had _my own_ PRs sitting for months -- I think 1+ year has even happened in cases where my PRs touch places that are both consensus-critical _and_ are very complex. \r\n\r\nI'm sorry your experience wasn't what you had hoped for and that it ended on a sour note.

This was our problem all along, it's a blind optimization that the author didn't even bother to test on a live node. Can it be made faster? Maybe, I don't know. It is not my task to prove the PR is faster than one we have, that lies at the author.\r\n\r\nPS: Next time you want to contribute to the \"worlds shittiest codebase\", at least don't submit an OOM. Doesn't make you look good.",

Neither our time, nor any priority handling. I ran your code as a courtesy to @Dylan-Kerler, who asked nicely if the improvement was relevant or not.\r\n\r\nFor the record, benchmarks usually take a week to finish, unless the code is buggy or is an obvious deterioration in performance. When code reaches our benchmarkers, we don't expect them to blow up.\r\n\r\nI don't get why you're angry that we didn't put more time in it. Your code OOMs, and does so *fast*. This means you didn't even bother to try and run even a short sync cycle with it. If you couldn't even be bothered to sanity test your own code, turns out that the team was always right not to try and benchmark it. It just wasn't ready. It is not the Geth team's job to fix obvious issues. Yes, we can help iron out kinks or maybe discuss integration points, but first you need to prove it's worthwhile, which you didn't do.\r\n\r\nMy friendly suggestion for the future is to accept the working style of a team you're trying to contribute to, whether you like it or not. The world around you is not dumb and there are reasons processes work as they do. If you find them insufficient, try to understand why they are like that, and maybe afterwards suggest improvements. Trying to insult people and calling them things won't get your point across and will neither make you look good.\r\n\r\nLet's agree to part ways semi-amicably and stop escalating the situation. Wish you all the best in life.",
