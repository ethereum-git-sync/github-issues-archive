  "body": "My computer running Geth froze about 2 weeks ago and I had to cut its power. When it started back up, Geth was out of sync by about 1.5 weeks and it was very slow to resync. It took about 6 hours, during which I could not validate with Prysm. Today I lost power for a bit, and again Geth is out of sync by a little over a week, almost up to the point of when Geth was last started. So it's like my Geth is not saving it's state to the disk anymore. I think if Geth is shutdown gracefully it will save it, but I assume it should be saving more periodically on it's own. I'm not sure what to do about this.\r\n\r\nGeth version: 1.10.25-stable",

    "body": "The only way to avoid it is to run `gcmode=archive`, then geth flushes to disk after every block. In normal mode, geth maintains \"as much as possible\" [1] in memory, and does pruning of the stuff before it goes to disk. \r\n\r\n[1]: \"as much as possible\" is not not really true; we flush after about 2 hours of processing time. If a block takes 200ms to process, that comes to about 10K blocks. The idea is that the max time you may have to reprocess blocks after a crash is ~2 hours.\r\n\r\nSo geth is saving to disk, but anything saved to disk cannot be ever pruned. It's a tradeoff.  ",
