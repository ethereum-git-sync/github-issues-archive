  "body": "#### System information\r\nGeth version: `1.7.2`\r\nOS & Version: Windows 10\r\n\r\nWhen running with geth, mist (v0.9.2) does not fully sync and is not able to place transactions on the chain.  Even though mist says it's synced, when trying to transfer ETH, mist says \"0 of 12 Confirmations\" forever.  I am suspecting geth, since using \"parity --geth\" as the ethereum client fixes the problem.\r\n\r\n I first tried the following actions, which did not fix the issue:\r\nClearing the chain cache and re syncing\r\nUsing the beta light sync\r\nExplicitly launching geth before mist\r\n\r\nI finally solved the issue by launching the latest parity geth client before starting mist:\r\nc:\\program files\\parity\\parity\\parity.exe --geth\r\n\r\nThen when I started mist, I noticed that there were a couple more thousand blocks that weren't synced, even though I had just closed geth/mist that said it was synced. After syncing, mist started, and everything worked great. In fact, a whole handful of test transactions that I had previously tried all suddenly went through. It was like winning on the slots. ;)\r\n\r\n",
