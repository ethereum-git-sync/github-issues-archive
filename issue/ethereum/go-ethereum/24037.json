    "body": "Thank you very much for your reply. Forgive my confusing description, I was so anxious yesterday.\r\n\r\nIn fact, I am trying to run an archived node. I downloaded the original blocks data, including block header, transactions, uncles, from the infura due to network reasons and re-executed all blocks to get the world states of each block height. I have verified them through the block header hash and MPT root hash of transactions.\r\n\r\nThe following is the re-executed code omitting the part that reads the block. It started from the genesis block and worked to a block height of 8262818. However, the error described earlier occurred at that height of 8262819.\r\n\r\nThe content of the output indicates that the gas consumed for execution is different from that indicated in the block (that is 8262819). According to my observation, this happened in the 361st transaction: 7979332 - 7979005 = 55231 - 54904 = 327.\r\n\r\nAmong them, 7979332 is the gas consumed by my execution, 7979005 is the value indicated in the block, 55231 is the consumed gas of the 361st transaction by the execution, and 54904 is from the web etherscan.\r\n\r\nAnd, in this block, only the 361st transaction failed to execute, I am not sure if the error is related to it.\r\n\r\nWhat should I do to fix this error, thank you again for your help.\r\n\r\n```golang\r\n    // Initialize the genesis

Check out `geth snapshot traverse-state -h` \r\n```\r\ntraverse-state [command options] <root>\r\n\r\ngeth snapshot traverse-state <state-root>\r\nwill traverse the whole state from the given state root and will abort if any\r\nreferenced trie node or contract code is missing.

This inconsistency error comes from a stupid operation of mine: when compiling the windows version, I used cross-compile, but did not specify the correct cross-compiler. The error no longer appears after using the cross compiler.\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your kind help.",
