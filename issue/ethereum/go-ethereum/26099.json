  "body": "We need an external library/binary, which should do the same thing that the beacon chain does. But it should use clique to sign the blocks. \r\n\r\nIt is sort of a \"mini-go-ethereum\" which doesn't have transaction processing, but does have block relaying and gossip, and can do snap-sync and process headers (and blocks?). It then uses the clique-info from the headers to drive an \"EL-client\" . \r\n\r\nThe block relay is not enabled post-POS, so we need some additional subprotocol to pass the blocks around.",
