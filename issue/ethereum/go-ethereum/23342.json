We have updated our GETH to stay aligned with the London fork. but at this slow rate, It would take months to reach the forking block. We are running it on a K8s (8 cores and 64 GB) cluster with an Azure premium SSD of 16TB attached. Attaching the Grafana [snapshot](https://snapshot.raintank.io/dashboard/snapshot/SIgYtW46RI4M6nXs1Hv7woCzbYlDAGTX) for reference.\r\nThese are my arguments `--cache=65536 --syncmode=full --gcmode=archive --datadir=/data/eth --nousb --maxpeers=20`.\r\nI have seen people using `--snapshot=false`.

    "body": "Hey, guys. We are experiencing the very same issues here with our 2 Geth nodes (1 full and 1 archive). What makes our situation even worse is that we missed the hardfork initially, and when we realized and updated we were 7k blocks behind.\r\nNow it's 10k blocks behind. Is there any patch or something planned? Or should we reconfigure our nodes somehow?\r\n\r\nHere is all my config info to debug:\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/ArseniiPetrovich/c7f163394a531843f1d596a1d0c2e1ec\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S. For now I noticed that if we restart Geth node, the situation getting better for 30 mins or something, so we used this [instruction](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31055194/how-can-i-configure-a-systemd-service-to-restart-periodically) to setup a temporary solution that restart Geth each 30 minutes, but that is definitely is just a temporary workaround.

Running an archive node is extremely IO heavy. \r\n\r\nHowever, they're both way faster than 1-2 blocks per minute, as the title says -- the mean for the archive seems to be sub 1 second per block.

    "body": "Hey, @holiman, thank you for taking a look there! Well, after the node is synced up there are no problems with them, and that is what you are seeing, the node behaves really well when synced. Do you happen to have the data for the period prior to full synchronization? I just don't think we are ready to force our node to fall back behind the chain once again to check the sync process.\r\n\r\nOther questions:\r\n1) If I enable snapshots - this will speed up the sync? Will the node remain archive in that case?\r\n2) Are you saying that the bottleneck is the disk IOPS currently?\r\n\r\nThank you for getting back to me! :)",
