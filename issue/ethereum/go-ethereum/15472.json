  "body": "Originally Puppeth was implemented so it can run web services both on raw ports on domain-less machines, as well as using port sharing behind reverse proxies and domains. Since we mostly used Puppeth in house for Rinkeby only, the domain-less mode of operation got broken without anyone noticing.\r\n\r\nThis issue is here to verify which functionality works still correctly and which got broken for domain-less setups and to patch them up. Note, this issue should only be started when https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/15390 is merged since that's a huge pending change.",
