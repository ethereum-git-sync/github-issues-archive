  "body": "I've noticed two consecutive occurrences where my node got out of sync and would simply not import blocks, even though it had them cached up, and an import was even running (it completed in \"5ms\" after being stuck for 5 mins). The second time I managed to create a crash dump: https://gist.github.com/karalabe/c0437c931beb6cf7d071\n\nThe interesting thing is that insert chains seems to be stuck in some leveldb code, hence stalling the entire node. I've no idea what this could be, and it's even stranger that it seems runnable, yet will not run. Here's a full dump of all the goroutines: https://gist.github.com/karalabe/7511d67a5fc5c3d519fd\n",
