I was using mist wallet which comes with geth and therefore defaults to fast.  I finally tried to engineer a correct sync by uninstalling everything except backups of my keystore and starting over using a full sync, and manually added peers. This seems to be working so far.  Fast sync NEVER entered full mode even after fully synced. That is probably the core of the bug. My balance did show in light mode, but that doesn't really count since the wallet isn't synced and there are very few light peers.\r\n\r\nEither way, I'm not even sure that full mode is working because it says I have no states.\r\n```\r\n\r\n> eth.syncing\r\n{\r\n  currentBlock: 1228261,\r\n  highestBlock: 5428668,\r\n  knownStates: 0,\r\n  pulledStates: 0,\r\n  startingBlock: 0\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt does have more CPU usage than previous syncs and is reporting something other than zero for getBlock(\"latest\")",

    "body": "I'm still syncing.  I'd say this is a scam to sell SSD drives but I'm seeing complaints here regarding SSD's also.  So here we are, 28 days later, syncing 24/7 on mirrord storage space (windows raid) and not yet synced.\r\n\r\n{\r\n  currentBlock: 4474824,\r\n  highestBlock: 5658093,\r\n  knownStates: 0,\r\n  pulledStates: 0,\r\n  startingBlock: 4474794\r\n}\r\n\r\nTo be exact I'm 202 days behind the head of this blockchain technology.  In this time I've been able to learn the GO language and start hacking my wallet.  The paranoid locking is obviously the problem but unfortunately I don't have a good enough understanding of the data flow to know which code I can unlock.  I did increase the internal \"ideal batch size\" to 1048576.  Secondly I'd say that 2Mb per file is way too small considering the resource manager says there's an average of about 8Mb per second being transferred to the Hard drive, I don't know how many file handles it has open but based on the file size it must be at least 4 so the hard drive is likely wasting a lot of time waiting for the disk to spin around to where the files are.  If only I could find a way to resize this database I would NEVER go with 2Mb files, maybe 64/128Mb, but at 2Mb I doubt windows explorer can even open the folder at this point. This architecture is bad or a scam to sell hardware. Whatever the case it WILL be hacked, code this bad can easily be hacked.  I already found at least one bug which I know would cause the syncing to freeze because a lock is created and never unlocked... Just bad code and bad architecture, that is what is wrong with geth.\r\n\r\nCan't blame this on cache size either, I've allocated 12Gb to my cache!\r\n\r\n%geth% --syncmode=full --datadir %datadir% --rpc --rpcaddr 0.0.0.0 --rpcapi=\"db,eth,net,web3,admin,personal,web3\" --cache=12288 --maxpeers=15 --trie-cache-gens=480\r\n\r\nOnce its hacked you can bet the functional wallets will be like claymore... Pay to play.\r\n\r\n",
