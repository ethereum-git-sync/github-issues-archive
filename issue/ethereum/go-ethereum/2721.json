The other nodes do not see the ignored, this pressure runs all four cores at 100% and starts to consume RAM that is not released.\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\n\nRandom testing in network with multiple nodes. Occurs around once a day.\n#### Logs\n\n```\nGETH: I0609 16:23:05.689998 core/blockchain.go:964] imported 0 block(s) (0 queued 2 ignored) including 0 txs in 86.576677ms. #657981 [d02b0c4f / 9f79077d]\nGETH: I0609 16:23:06.275904 core/blockchain.go:964] imported 0 block(s) (0 queued 15 ignored) including 0 txs in 441.671828ms. #657996 [211ec474 / 91367e9f]\nGETH: I0609 16:23:06.722845 core/blockchain.go:964] imported 0 block(s) (0 queued 9 ignored) including 0 txs in 279.603043ms. #658005 [da5449d7 / b2edb6d0]\nGETH: I0609 16:23:07.121051 core/blockchain.go:964] imported 0 block(s) (0 queued 10 ignored) including 0 txs in 204.204791ms. #658015 [91b8241e / 8cc66e35]\nGETH: I0609 16:23:08.192393 core/blockchain.go:964] imported 0 block(s) (0 queued 9 ignored) including 0 txs in 259.97379ms. #658024 [85d66046 / 2d053ad9]\nGETH: I0609 16:23:08.978219 core/blockchain.go:964] imported 0 block(s) (0 queued 13 ignored) including 0 txs in 449.585136ms. #658037 [4ede70f8 / 53010fb8]\nGETH: I0609 16:23:09.853744 core/blockchain.go:964] imported 0 block(s) (0 queued 2 ignored) including 0 txs in 63.31047ms. #658039 [15df2f57 / 489bf2ba]\nGETH: I0609 16:23:10.922302 core/blockchain.go:964] imported 0 block(s) (0 queued 45 ignored) including 0 txs in 1.038123637s. #658084 [0edfaaae / c5f266d7]\nGETH: I0609 16:23:14.880169 core/blockchain.go:964] imported 0 block(s) (0 queued 207 ignored) including 0 txs in 3.771540334s. #658291 [51419c57 / 8feaa966]\nGETH: I0609 16:23:31.797717 core/blockchain.go:964] imported 0 block(s) (0 queued 902 ignored) including 0 txs in 16.504417435s. #659193 [cccd4489 / b02f8f8f]\nGETH: I0609 16:23:31.868485 core/blockchain.go:964] imported 1 block(s) (0 queued 0 ignored) including 0 txs in 69.322511ms. #661608 [4550358b / 4550358b]\n```\n\n```\nGETH: I0615 17:25:36.570766 core/blockchain.go:964] imported 0 block(s) (0 queued 2048 ignored) including 0 txs in 38.348947333s. #686346 [c9c70ab9 / ce8c68ff]\nGETH: I0615 17:25:36.727978 core/blockchain.go:964] imported 1 block(s) (0 queued 0 ignored) including 1 txs in 154.422651ms. #690938 [bc695743 / bc695743]\nGETH: I0615 17:25:38.695696 core/blockchain.go:964] imported 0 block(s) (0 queued 109 ignored) including 0 txs in 1.965869307s. #686455 [d928a8a6 / b3b9e5e8]\nGETH: I0615 17:25:38.922285 core/blockchain.go:964] imported 1 block(s) (0 queued 0 ignored) including 1 txs in 163.928007ms. #690939 [156adb20 / 156adb20]\nGETH: I0615 17:26:32.720477 core/blockchain.go:964] imported 0 block(s) (0 queued 2048 ignored) including 0 txs in 51.955291713s. #688503 [b7ec7816 / ee4825a1]\nGETH: I0615 17:26:32.868980 core/blockchain.go:964] imported 1 block(s) (0 queued 0 ignored) including 0 txs in 127.55419ms. #690940 [2942f228 / 2942f228]\nGETH: I0615 17:26:33.024004 core/blockchain.go:964] imported 1 block(s) (0 queued 0 ignored) including 0 txs in 74.949037ms. #690941 [6d9ece0d / 6d9ece0d]\n```\n",
