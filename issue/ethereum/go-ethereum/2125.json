The console simply hangs indefinitely. \n\nI'm running everything on a  MacBook pro with El Capitan and following the frontier tutorial here:  \nhttps://ethereum.gitbooks.io/frontier-guide/content/testing_contracts_and_transactions.html\n\nThe branch of develop I tested on was current up to this commit:\n`5945a33350ea6e8bfc6308826efe16aab0e2e93d`\n\nAs illustrated in the tutorial, I'm launching geth like so:\n\n```\n geth --datadir ~/dapps/testing/00/ --port 30310 --rpcport 8110 --networkid 4567890 --nodiscover --maxpeers 0 --vmdebug --verbosity 6 --pprof --pprofport 6110 console 2>> ~/dapps/testing/00/00.log\n```\n\nMy terminal session is as follows :\n\n```\ninstance: Geth/v1.4.0-unstable-0ab8a175/darwin/go1.5.2\ncoinbase: null\nat block: 0 (Wed, 31 Dec 1969 16:00:00 PST)\n datadir: /Users/aaronstjohn/dapps/testing/00\n> personal.newAccount();\nPassphrase: \nRepeat passphrase: \n\"0xae90d28489034e7bc7adeaf0edbe4fbb6930af12\"\n> primary = eth.accounts[0];\n\"0xae90d28489034e7bc7adeaf0edbe4fbb6930af12\"\n> balance = web3.fromWei(eth.getBalance(primary),\"ether\");\n0\n> miner.start(8);\ntrue\n> admin.sleepBlocks(10);\n[geth hangs indefinitely after this point]\n```\n\nThe output log is attached here:\n[00.txt](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/files/91085/00.txt)\n",

    "body": "I'm closing this issue, because I now realize it was a fundamental misunderstanding on my part about what I should've been expecting from this sequence of commands and how long it takes to actually mine 10 blocks.\n\nFor posterity and anyone else that stumbles on this, since it's not super-duper clear in the frontier guide (at least not to me), I'll spell it out here.  Actually mining 10 blocks, even on a private node can take a loooong time, in my case it took about 1.5 hours (see attached log). So when you run `admin.sleepBlocks(10)`, you're clear to run some errands, meditate, watch a movie, etc...  b.c. it won't return anytime soon unless you're mining on a beastly rig.\n\nHere is the log from geth after mining 10 blocks.\n[mining-log.txt](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/files/93620/mining-log.txt)\n\nI created my geth miner using docker, which helped make this all much clearer for me and used this fantastic tutorial for setting up a custom genesis block.\n\nhttp://adeduke.com/2015/08/how-to-create-a-private-ethereum-chain/\n\nI'm attaching my Dockerfile as it shows the command I used to launch geth.\n\nDocker File:\n[Dockerfile.txt](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/files/93623/Dockerfile.txt)\n\nGenesis File\n[genesis.json.txt](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/files/93624/genesis.json.txt)\n(Note, I used the instructions from the tutorial above to  setup the starting account and give it some eth)\n",
