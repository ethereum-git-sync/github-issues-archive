  "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\n\r\nI have an issue with Geth, I want to compile and deploy a smart contract, and in order to do that, I have added ether to my wallet.\r\nWe can verify the transaction here : https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0b3247c2c1d1f26411486ad3ee4fd47e2a8b71de56af0b0fe6759586dd18f6b5\r\nwhere we can see the transaction is in the 4 679 731th block\r\n\r\nHere, we can verify the amount of ether in the wallet : https://etherscan.io/address/0x704e2b488674afa69069a165d3c8a80a27c30d6f which is 0,075 ether.\r\n\r\nThen,\r\n\r\nI have built a virtual machine with an vanilla Ubuntu, install geth (v1.7.0-stable-6c6c7b2a) and try to sync from the 10-29-2017 to the 12-20-2017.\r\nI launch geth with : geth console\r\n\r\nIn my research, I have found two commands which can determine the progress of the sync :\r\n\r\nvar sync = web3.eth.syncing;sync;\r\ngive : \r\n{\r\n  currentBlock: 1144835,\r\n  highestBlock: 1720228,\r\n  knownStates: 33418,\r\n  pulledStates: 25707,\r\n  startingBlock: 1144067\r\n}\r\n\r\neth.getBlock(\"latest\").number\r\ngive :\r\n0\r\n\r\nI used the following command to check how many ether an account have :\r\nweb3.fromWei(eth.getBalance(\"0x704e2b488674aFa69069A165D3C8a80A27C30D6f\"), \"ether\")\r\ngive : \r\n0\r\n\r\nSo in two month, I'm not sync, and my geth don't know how many ether I have on my account.\r\nI have apparently sync to the 1 144 835th block, and the transaction is in the 4 679 731th block, so I think it's normal, but in two months ?\r\nDo I have to wait 8 months to start using Geth ? It's not acceptable.\r\n\r\nSo I have built a second virtual machine on 12-29-2017 with the same vanilla Ubuntu, install geth (1.7.3-stable-4bb3c89d) and try to sync.\r\nThe difference with the first : I launch with the fast syncmode : geth --fast --cache=1024 console.\r\n\r\nNow, the commands\r\nvar sync = web3.eth.syncing;sync;\r\ngive :\r\n{\r\n  currentBlock: 3872910,\r\n  highestBlock: 4884396,\r\n  knownStates: 3180,\r\n  pulledStates: 2379,\r\n  startingBlock: 3865878\r\n}\r\n\r\neth.getBlock(\"latest\").number\r\ngive :\r\n0\r\n\r\nand\r\nweb3.fromWei(eth.getBalance(\"0x704e2b488674aFa69069A165D3C8a80A27C30D6f\"), \"ether\")\r\ngive : \r\n0\r\n\r\nSo in 12 days, I have sync 4x more, but in the 4 last days, I have the message :\r\nWARN [01-10|01:01:40] Rolled back headers                      count=2048 header=3894230->3892182 fast=3872910->3872910 block=0->0\r\nevery time and it doesn't sync more.\r\n\r\nSo I tried a third time on my personal computer, a windows 8.1, install geth (1.7.3-stable-4bb3c89d) and try to sync from the 01-07-2018\r\nwith command line : geth.exe --syncmode \"full\" console\r\n\r\nNow, the commands\r\n\r\nvar sync = web3.eth.syncing;sync;\r\ngive :\r\n{\r\n  currentBlock: 4881711,\r\n  highestBlock: 4884507,\r\n  knownStates: 34771,\r\n  pulledStates: 26470,\r\n  startingBlock: 4880214\r\n}\r\n\r\neth.getBlock(\"latest\").number\r\ngive :\r\n0\r\n\r\nand\r\nweb3.fromWei(eth.getBalance(\"0x704e2b488674aFa69069A165D3C8a80A27C30D6f\"), \"ether\")\r\ngive : \r\n0\r\n\r\nSo I have reached the targeted block (4 679 731) in one day, but geth always states that I have 0 ether in my account ?\r\n\r\nMy question is : how can I sync so I can start to work with SmartContract ?\r\n\r\nWhen I search on the web, the only anwser I can read is to wait.\r\nI don't want to read this anwser anymore, or tell me a real method that can show me the real progress.",

    "body": "Hi there. This is likely an issue with either your hardware (e.g. if you're using an HDD), or with the flags you used with Geth (e.g. if you haven't set the `--cache` size or used `--syncmode fast`).\r\n\r\nThis isn't really an issue that needs to be tracked on the official bug/issue tracker. It's more of a technical question. I'd recommend joining [Ethereum's Stack Exchange](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/) site, which has various questions/answers on how to speed up the syncing process. (e.g. \"[Help with very slow mist sync](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/603/help-with-very-slow-mist-sync)\")",
