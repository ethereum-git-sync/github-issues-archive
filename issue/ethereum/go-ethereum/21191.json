  "body": "Hi there,\r\n\r\nI am posting this bug which is already discussed but is inactive https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/18402.\r\n\r\nMoreover the bug which I post here is a slight modification of the one posted in [18402](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/18402)\r\n\r\nI have also posted in stack exchange which didn't have much response: https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/83357/geth-clique-block-period-1-fork-of-chain-inconsistency\r\n\r\n#### System information\r\n\r\nGeth version: 1.9.12\r\nOS & Version: Linux\r\nClique PoA\r\nProcessor: Intel i7 - 3770\r\nCPU: 8\r\nRAM : 16 GB\r\nTXPOOL.GlobalSlots: 100000000\r\nBlock Period 1 or 2 (Faster block times)\r\nNo of Sealers/ Nodes : 4\r\n\r\n#### Expected behaviour\r\nBlock Period 1 / 2 / 3  (Shorter block times)  fork is  created but should be resolved or reorged atleast\r\n#### Actual behaviour\r\n\r\nIn my private Clique network with 4 Nodes (A,B,C,D) I noticed a fork in the chain for block period 1.\r\n\r\nI noticed that it happens some times with block period 1 & 2.\r\n\r\nI noticed that the fork happens at block 1678 . Nodes A & D have a similar chain data meanwhile Nodes B& C have similar data.\r\n\r\nAt block 1677, I noticed the difference in data between 2 chains: \r\n1) Block hashes are different \r\n2) Block of one chain is an uncle block while for other chain it has 5000 txs included \r\n3) Both blocks have **same difficulty 2** which means that it was mined in turn\r\n 4) Another complication arises when I noticed it was the **same sealer** who sealed the block.\r\n\r\nThis results in fork of the network and stalling at the end which cannot undergo any reorg in this deadlock situation.\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\r\n1) Setup PoA Clique network with block period 1 / 2\r\n2) No of Nodes/ Sealers : 4\r\n3) Send transactions faster to invoke smart contract method. Eg client available in : https://github.com/cyrilnavessamuel/ethereumissue \r\n4) You will notice fork when the nodes stop mining and when you debug the issue looking at the latest block header.\r\n#### Backtrace\r\n\r\nLatest Block 1678 details in Node A:\r\n![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8938494/84015754-9f304100-a97c-11ea-91ed-4db143bb23ce.jpg)\r\n Block 1677 fork occured between Node A & Node C on 1 fork and other fork having Node B & Node D.\r\nNotice the \r\ndifference in block hash , \r\ndifferent no of txs in block (1 fork has 0 txs and other has 4791 txs)\r\n**same difficulty** in both forks\r\nFork 1 details: Node A & Node D\r\n![2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8938494/84016121-1b2a8900-a97d-11ea-82ed-4fb52e2dd1eb.jpg)\r\nFork 2 details: Node B & Node C\r\n![3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8938494/84016180-30071c80-a97d-11ea-9be6-1b38438932c0.jpg)\r\nNote: Fork 2 image is different since 4791 txs were printed which was too large;\r\n",
