  "body": "(Also commented on a possibly related [Mist issue](https://github.com/ethereum/mist/issues/3292))\r\n\r\nThe 32-bit and 64-bit archives (v1.7.1, v1.7.2 and v.1.7.3) on the [Geth download page for Windows](https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/) seems to download version v1.3.3 instead (at least that is what `geth --version`  shows). I am not sure where Mist is downloading the node from, but when I remove it and let Mist download it, I end up with the same version. My guess is that it is downloading from the same location, and that some people (myself included) have unknowingly ended up on the wrong side of the Byzantium chain split.\r\n\r\nDownloading the Linux binary archive of Geth (64-bit) does give me the right version. So there is probably something wrong with the Windows build/packing/distribution service of Geth. I have not tested the Windows installers.\r\n\r\nNote: I was tipped off by long lasting insane disk usage of geth.exe in Task Manager when syncing (and long sync times). I remember this being an issue in the past, which made me check what was going on.",
