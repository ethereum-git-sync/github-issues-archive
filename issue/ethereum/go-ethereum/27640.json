  "body": "Hi Team,\r\n\r\nWe have a quorum BC network, where we have 2 VMs each with 1 validator and 1 member quorum node apart from one RPC node.\r\n\r\nTill few hours back our network was working fine but some time before because of the temp memory issue in one of the VM, we are not able to process transactions in Blockchain network. So, after resolving the memory issue we have restarted our docker containers in that VM.\r\n\r\nAfter restarting, quorum nodes gets in sync with rest of the quorum nodes, now when we are processing our transactions then those transactions are getting into the memory pool(i.e. pending state). We have around 60 txns in the memory pool and our Blockchain network is not able to build new blocks for these transactions.\r\n\r\nHow can we process those pending transactions so that doesn't stop our network in Block generation for further transactions. Can someone please help with this issue.",
