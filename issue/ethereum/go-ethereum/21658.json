  "body": "Hi, I have a feature request for the GraphQL interface. \r\n\r\nIt can be useful to be able to differentiate between transactions in the `pending` and `queued` part of the txpool. \r\n\r\nThe `txpool_content` JSONRPC method allows for this, returning the txpool in 2 sections, `pending` and `queued`.\r\n\r\nThe only downside with that query is that it can be pretty expensive to run on nodes with a high `txpool.globalslots` config option. \r\n\r\nUsing the GraphQL interface it's much faster to query which hashes are pending in the pool with a simple query, really awesome.\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  pending {\r\n    transactions {\r\n      hash\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe only downside with this method is that it returns transactions from both `pending` and `queued` parts of the txpool. \r\n\r\nIdeally I'd be able to make a query like this\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  pending {\r\n    transactions {\r\n      hash\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  queued {\r\n    transactions {\r\n      hash\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nso it would be clear which txns are eligible for inclusion in a block, and which are 'stuck'.\r\n\r\nI understand it would be a breaking change to the `pending` query, but I think the definition is a little ambiguous as it is right now anyway. https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1767 makes no mention of which part/s of the txpool a `pending` query would return, and given that when using `txpool_content` `pending` very clearly means the part of the txpool eligible for inclusion in a block, I think people could be forgiven for thinking that querying `pending` with GraphQL would also only return txns eligible for inclusion in a block.\r\n\r\nFor my txpool use case at least, this limitation with GraphQL is a deal breaker and I'll need to keep on using `txpool_content` until it's addressed. \r\n\r\nAside from this one instance with the txpool, my experience with the GraphQL interface has been great. Replacing wasteful JSONRPC queries is a special kind of rush ;) Thanks for the awesome work building this in.",
