  "body": "I was running an older geth version which was recently crashing (i guess DOS issues) and now upgraded to the latest release (on Ubuntu). I was previously using plain `geth console` to sync my node and did not specify a custom location for my chain data or any other custom settings.\n\nAfter switching to the latest release I realized that geth seems to re-sync the chain from the beginning (by seeing low numbers like 523 and increasing in the log output). The existing data directory (~/.ethereum) is available and data also seems to get written there. How do I get geth to append to the chain instead of re-starting?\n\nI am on Ubuntu 15.04\n\n```\n$ geth version\nGeth\nVersion: 1.4.16-stable-4fced097\nProtocol Versions: [63 62]\nNetwork Id: 1\nGo Version: go1.6.3\nOS: linux\nGOPATH=/home/someone\nGOROOT=/usr/lib/go-1.6\n```\n",
