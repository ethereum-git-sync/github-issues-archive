They will still pack true. Why this is I'm not absolutely certain but I believe it has something to do with the complex padding scheme for big Ints in the common library seen here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/common/math/big.go#L122-L142\r\n\r\nAssuming that the tests pass this shouldn't be the case, but it appears that the tests aren't running at 32 byte size lengths (it should...RLP is the most commonly worked with format here). \r\n",
