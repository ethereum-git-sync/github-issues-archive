  "body": "Hello to the community of developers. I am worried about something: There are almost empty blocks (less than 30 tx) being mined on the blockchain since the London hardfork block. All of them have in common that the included trasactions have a high gas limit but, with a very low gas consumption. It is posible that setting a high gas limit to normal trasactions, could be used to intentionally attack the network by generating almost empty blocks to produce congestion?\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nhttps://etherscan.io/block/12966835\r\nIn this block the total gas limit was 28,601,046 gwei but the gas consumption was 1,920,428",

    "body": "Most of the empty blocks are not intentional. In the mining procedure the Geth needs to prepare a mining block first, then do the PoW computation base on that. But the mining block preparation(packing transactions from the mempool) is not trivial which can 100-300ms. So in this time window Geth will push an empty block out first for PoW computation and then switch the target.\r\n\r\nIn the miner's perspective, the empty block is kind of the bonus otherwise the mining machines are idle.",
