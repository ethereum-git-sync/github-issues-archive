  "body": "Hi all,\r\n\r\nLong time Ethereum and GETH user here, a few days ago I've started setting up a new FAST synced GETH node but as I keep running into more and more issues and the GO-Ethereum issue list seems to be stuffed with issues from 2017 regarding not getting basic sync functionality to work I would like to summarize that most of these issues are in fact still happening in version 1.8.10 of GETH.\r\n\r\n#### System information\r\n\r\nGeth version: 1.8.10\r\nOS & Version: Windows\r\nCommit hash : N/A\r\n\r\n### GETH FAST sync issues:\r\n`geth --datadir \"F:\\GethChain\" --syncmode \"fast\" --rpc --rpcaddr 0.0.0.0 --rpccorsdomain=\"*\" --rpcapi=\"db,eth,net,web3,personal,web3\" --rpcvhosts=*`\r\n\r\n#### 1. GETH Syncing is quite fast for the first 95% of the blocks and then drops to a halt.\r\n\r\nFast (earlier blocks):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2350015/41192067-f2d30fc2-6bf8-11e8-80fd-14163bc28415.png)\r\n\r\nIncredibly slow (latest blocks):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2350015/41192074-18203f3e-6bf9-11e8-89a7-e805a59b5fa5.png)\r\n\r\nWhy can't it just get the last 1000 blocks in one go and import it like it does with all the older blocks?\r\n\r\nI also read the post here: https://github.com/ethereum/mist/issues/3097#issuecomment-389521963\r\nBut this doesn't explain why we are about 200  blocks behind\r\n\r\n#### 2. Randomly stopping with syncing\r\n\r\nIt was syncing 2 minutes ago and now it is not:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2350015/41192092-55dac13c-6bf9-11e8-80f4-5c0f396ef790.png)\r\n\r\n#### 3. Synchronisation failed: Dropping peer and being silent for 30-120 minutes at a time\r\n\r\nSometimes when I log into my GETH machine in the morning I see that it shows some Warnings and then decided to stop syncing again. After an hour or 2 it decides to continue.\r\n\r\n#### 4. When starting the synchronisation process it doesn't seem to start syncing sometimes untill about 5 minutes into the process\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2350015/41192134-e4161eb0-6bf9-11e8-9cc1-389ad224f4d5.png)\r\n\r\n#### 5. When trying to close the GETH client an error pops up:\r\n\r\n`[06-09|15:31:10] Dangling trie nodes after full cleanup`\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2350015/41192157-34d54c2c-6bfa-11e8-982a-fe4df2162dba.png)\r\n\r\n#### 6. Second time running the GETH sync process it won't do a FAST sync anymore\r\n\r\nIt currently seems to be impossible to get GETH to sync in one go without having to restart it at least a dozen times. So if it only syncs the first few 100.000's of blocks with a fast sync before it's first crash, what's the use of FAST sync?\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2350015/41192323-2df12988-6bfc-11e8-8bad-4e11e18d2aaa.png)\r\n\r\n#### 7. The use of FAST sync\r\n\r\nWhat is actually the use of FAST sync nowadays? It took until the very very end of syncing blocks and chain data before I could see my funds in metamask. Isn't this the thing that FAST sync should try to avoid?\r\n\r\n#### 8. Synchronisation failed, dropping peers when starting the FAST sync:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2350015/41192446-047b3cf4-6bfe-11e8-8e44-2016bdf35259.png)\r\n\r\nThis was another start of the synchronization process on my node that was fully synced a few minutes ago.\r\n\r\nAnother one:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2350015/41192893-abe6da28-6c05-11e8-8e26-24ee12438013.png)\r\n\r\n### GETH LIGHT sync issues:\r\n`geth --datadir \"F:\\GethChainLight\" --syncmode \"light\" --rpc --rpcaddr 0.0.0.0 --rpccorsdomain=\"*\" --rpcapi=\"db,eth,net,web3,personal,web3\" --rpcvhosts=*`\r\n\r\n#### 1. When launching LIGHT sync on an empty folder it seemed to start but then it just stops. Eth.syncing is also false\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2350015/41192215-f24da7f4-6bfa-11e8-84d1-0d35b2a382d1.png)\r\n\r\n(Waited for about 15 minutes here this time)\r\n\r\nAlso connecting to the node with Metamask seems to work but my funds is displayed as 0. So it is in fact not synced up.\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\n\r\nI guess I'm trying to express my frustrations here around the user friendliness and buggyness of GETH more than anything else.\r\n\r\nSo if any of these errors are due to my wrongdoing, also please inform me, but if not it might be good to see how we can work on improving the experience on working with GETH.\r\n\r\nEdit: Tried to run another sync on my local PC:\r\n```\r\nProcessor: 3770k\r\nMemory: 32GB\r\nCache set to: 10GB\r\nStorage: Samsung 960 pro 1TB SSD\r\n```\r\nThe sync itself seemed to run quite okay untill reaching the end where some more random stalls appeared.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2350015/41254357-8350b1aa-6dc3-11e8-9413-c9a97094cba4.png)\r\n",

    "body": "Fast sync only runs the very first time you start geth by default.  After that, you need to add the flag to the command.  I had to jump through some hoops to get geth and the regular GUI java client working together, and outlined my process in the sync issues megathread.  Even with everything seemingly set up perfectly I can't get geth to sync in windows 10 without restarting it multiple times as I outlined in my comment.  I gave up on using anything but the default data dir because both Java client and command line mode only seemed to agree with defaults.  I hope these sync issues are all ironed out over time but for now, it is what it is.  Have you tried a fully default folder and settings sync?  Are you only going to use the console to run geth?  Have you been sure to use the \"geth removedb\" command?",

But, I can't seem to get to get current without geth stalling and just stopping syncing.  Just hanging up after IPC endpoint opened now.  Other times it hangs on Synchronisation failed, dropping peer.... and hangs... and hangs.  Using v1.8.11-stable.",

    "body": "Re\r\n1. GETH Syncing is quite fast for the first 95% of the blocks and then drops to a halt.\r\n\r\nIt's because first you're fast-synching, after sync to the pivot point it actually process every block/transaction from the pivot point up to the chain head. \r\n\r\n4. When starting the synchronisation process it doesn't seem to start syncing sometimes untill about 5 minutes into the process\r\n\r\nIt's probably searching for suitabe peers at that time. Though I agree that 5  minutes is a bit suspisciously long. \r\n\r\n5. When trying to close the GETH client an error pops up:\r\n\r\nThat one I think is fixed. \r\n\r\n6. Second time running the GETH sync process it won't do a FAST sync anymore\r\n\r\nYep, once you've fast-synced, you will have to sync block by block. The alternative is to wipe the database and do a fast-sync from scratch. ",
