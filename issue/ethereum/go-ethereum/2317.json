Most people will run geth with the defaults, so I don't think this is much of an issue, and if it is, then make sure the tools can handle a different path.\n\nHaving a global singleton master path is imho a very bad design decision. Imagine that I have a geth instance working for public apps, and a private instance. I forget by accident to explicitly set the IPC path too for the private instance, and all of a sudden all my apps poke around in my private chain.\n\nI would much rather have sane defaults that play nice together with different scenarios. \n",

Within the datadir is usually a safe starting bet that the correct user can access it, others cannot and that the user actually has permission to open a socket there.\n\nThere are linux distros that have limited access to `tmp`, I've seen OSX versions which use custom `tmp` folders for certain apps to sandbox them, it may not even be a bindable path. Android is again a very strange beast on this front.\n\nLets not dumb down geth to avoid having Mist implement a path selection :P \n",
