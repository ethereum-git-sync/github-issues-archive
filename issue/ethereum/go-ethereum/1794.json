  "body": "Hello,\nI noticed this issue where in my geth console i see that i mined a block but when i verify etherechain.org it seems another miner got it and it even has a different hash. \n\n 935 worker.go:322] ðŸ”¨  Mined block (#217129 / f6984bc9) in my console  and ether chain says the miner was nanopool  and displays wrong hash: 0xffd14cda96ce51d7cdd52e8bbcfe1a0a8818a7351703c52b784f2ccedbeda0f4\n\n 935 worker.go:322] ðŸ”¨  Mined block (#217033 / 6ec36dd2). in my console and ether chain says the miner was coiontron and displays the wrong hash : \nHash: 0x4f9d13f047737be00993a480261f59373d54713b94ddf553f473c1e390fc96f7\n\n935 worker.go:322] ðŸ”¨  Mined block (#217024 / 2399c9b9). n my console and ether chain says the miner was coiontron and displays the wrong hash : \nHash: 0xf39886d870e79072857b364221ec63e07ee1a922c734a4ab2c0237f7a1d2d644\n\n... and so on, i can paste them all day. \n\nWhy are the other miners stealing my blocks ?
