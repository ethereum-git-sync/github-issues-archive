It is usually around 45 when operating normally.\r\n\r\nI usually just reboot to fix it.  This causes \"Slots behind\" to go up and it takes 10 - 15 minutes to recover.  I would like to determine what is causing the loss of peers.  Can you suggest how I might troubleshoot this?\r\n\r\nThis has been happening for months, but I am only now posting this, hoping it would be fixed in the several releases I have installed since it started happening.  I do not recall exactly when it first started happening (i.e., what version).  It was running for almost a year without this happening.\r\n\r\nPlease advise...  THANKS!\r\n\r\n",
