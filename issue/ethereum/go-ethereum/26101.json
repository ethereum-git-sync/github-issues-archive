  "body": "# Rationale\r\n\r\nWhen requesting logs via `eth_getLogs` if the `toBlock` is set to a block in the future that the node does not have (`toBlock > blockNumber`) then the node should return an error.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the node would return the logs it has (`fromBlock -> \"latest\"`), ignoring the fact that `toBlock` is in the future, and there would be no indication to the user that there was a problem or issue with their request.\r\n\r\nIf you are load balancing requests across nodes for instance, you might ask for logs from a block that one of the nodes doesn't have yet and there's no way to detect there was a problem, there is just a lack of logs for the future blocks, detecting that in code is essentially impossible, especially if there really were no logs for a block.\r\n\r\n# Implementation\r\n\r\nThe Avalanche C chain client has this feature, if you request logs for a block in the future, it will return an error instead of silently continuing and returning invalid results.",
