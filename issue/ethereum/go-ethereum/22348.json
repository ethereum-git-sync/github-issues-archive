For some reason it never works as expected.\r\n\r\nI selected 100 peers that I would like my GETH node to use.  Those 100 peers are added in the config.toml file as BootstrapNodes, BootstrapNodesV5, TrustedNodes and StaticNodes.  I also set NoDiscovery to false.\r\n\r\nIf I pull the peers after using such configuration, GETH still has about 50% peers that are not in my list of 100 nodes.\r\n\r\nHow is this possible?  What am I missing?",
