    "body": "For access to all _state_ belonging to old blocks, yes, you need to have had it running in `gcmode=archive` to have that state immediately accessible. \r\nIf you ran a full-sync without specifying `gcmode=archive`, you can still obtain the state, by recomputing it from an earlier point (geth flushes the state every 2 hours of processing time). That's what the `reexec` parameter in the tracing configs it used for. \r\nIf you ran a fast/snap-sync, you cannot obtain the state for any blocks prior to the pivot point. \r\n\r\nIt's fine to stop geth, restart with `gcmode=archive`, and from then on it will not do any in-memory state pruning,  just flush every state to disk. \r\n\r\nIf you want to know more about what blocks you have state for, you can use `debug.getAccessibleState(<from>,<to>)`. For example, to check the latest block you have state (on disk) for : `debug.getAccessibleState(\"latest\", 0)`, and to check the earliest (ignore genesis): `debug.getAccessibleState(0, \"latest\")` \r\n",
