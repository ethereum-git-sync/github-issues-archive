  "body": "Greetings to all SWARM developers)\r\nI accidentally found this project, then the last two months experimented with SWARM and the source code) All this is a terrific idea!\r\nTo my opinion, there is a problem with the transition to the Dapps Web application.\r\nAt this stage of SWARM and Ethereum development, many people do not realize how to apply all this correctly. It will take a while for web developers to dive into Dapps and figure out their own way to make decentralized websites.\r\nThe project needs support for a dynamic web language, such as PHP.\r\nI believe it is possible to be done. Since a node can broadcast HTML content, it shall be able to translate the code and process it with an interpreter which is/would be installed on each node of the network.\r\nI could be wrong since upcoming issue of security, performance or whatever else ....\r\nIt seems to me that such projects lack of a transition period\\stage. In this case, the transition phase would let time-proven web engines and CMS deployed over the network.",
