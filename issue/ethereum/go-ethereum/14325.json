  "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI am trying to create an Ethereum private network that runs across multiple physical hardware like an Intel Edison or a Rasperry PI 3.  The private network would consist of many pieces of physical hardware, so the network does just exist on 1 physical machine.\r\n\r\nI have run into the following situation\r\n\r\n* In --dev mode they can mine, but they can't communicate because networking is specifically disabled. E.g. maxpeers set to 0, listening turned off\r\n\r\n* In 'prod' mode I can get the nodes to discover each other with some work, but I can't get them to mine. I have tried a custom genesis block and set the difficulty, but the generation of the DAG requires too much upfront memory. I can post the stack, but the message says it can't allocate the 2GB of memory needed for the DAG, and that makes sense as the devices don't have that. I also tried computing the DAG on one-machine and sharing the 1GB file, but that also did not seem to work and seems error prone. I also tried increase the swap but that didn't seem to work and is dubious to begin with.\r\n\r\nWould you be open to a PR that allowed networking in developer mode, or have other thoughts on how to make this work?  My plan is to allow another flag to be passed in, --dev-networking or similar and then look at that flag to know whether to disable networking when in --dev mode.\r\n\r\nAny guidance you can offer would be appreciated. I would take of doing the work but wanted to see if this would be accepted. For now I am going to fork/modify and compile locally.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n",
