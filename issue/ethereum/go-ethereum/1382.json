    "body": "@alexvandesande That's simply not what I meant nor implied... I think there's two ways to provide good user experience in terms of installation: have one-click GUI installers/apps (not an option for Frontier) or clear package-based installation steps. Not one-line-cross-your-fingers-it-doesn't-break-halfway scripts. \n\nSorry @cubedro, your script looks great, please don't take this against you, I just think the **only** time a one-line install script is appropriate is for a package manager like brew, nothing else (looking at you meteor...)\nAs a side note, the install command with brew is just `brew install ethereum --devel`, not `ethereum/ethereum/ethereum`, and there's no `--successful` flag for go-ethereum, just cpp.\n\nWhat's wrong with having better documentation for installation and potential issues and steps like:\n\n**Ubuntu**\n\n```\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ethereum/ethereum\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ethereum\n```\n\n**OS X**\n\n```\nbrew tap ethereum/ethereum\nbrew install ethereum\n```\n\n**Windows**\n\n```\nchoco install geth-stable\n```\n",
