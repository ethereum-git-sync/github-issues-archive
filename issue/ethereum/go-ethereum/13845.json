Remix is a smart contract IDE that\nruns in the browser and can be found here http://ethereum.github.io/\nbrowser-solidity/#version=soljson-latest.js. Given the greeter contract I\nassume you are following the greeter tutorial on ethereum.org. The right\npanel in Remix will generate the web3 snippet that you can use to deploy\nthe contract.\n\n—\nYou are receiving this because you authored the thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n<https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/13845#issuecomment-290338830>,\nor mute the thread\n<https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ATGhEhOvWwqKqhmsRFZgnZQMMj_QdF8gks5rq2cKgaJpZM4Mrtl2>\n.\n",

That means that `eth.compile.solidity` as you mentioned in your description will not work anymore.\r\n\r\nNot sure what you are exactly trying to do but you probably want to take a look at the https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin repo. This repo contains a javascript solidity compiler that was generated from the solidity compiler using empscripten. Remix also uses this version.\r\n",
