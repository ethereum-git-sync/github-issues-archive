  "body": "#### System information\n\nGeth version: 1.4.14 && 1.4.15\nOS & Version: Windows 10\n#### Expected behaviour\n\nDownload the full blockchain smoothly when running geth to download the full blockchain.\n#### Actual behaviour\n\nGeth can't download blocknr 2376961. It keeps hanging at 'timed out DAO fork check - dropping' or crashes full out.\nrestarting multiple times, at different places / ISP's, with / without VPN, resyncing internet time, all didn't help.\nI see get downloading all the ldb's later than 681950, but because it can't download the 681950, I can't get through.\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\n\nDownload the full blockchain afresh and see it hang around the mentioned block.\n\nQuick solution:\nIf somebody could share 681950. 681951. 681952. 681953.ldb, I can add these ldb's manually and help Geth get through this tricky spot on the chain.\n(not an elegant solution, but it's a temporary workaround. I know you guys are working hard on solving this issue).\n\nThanks!!\n",
