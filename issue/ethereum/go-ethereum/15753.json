Never synced again, switched to 1.7.3, same behaviour. had 2.5 million stale entries downloaded, after restart of geth it is starting with 0 state entries and 256 missing blocks., downloading ~1000 state entries all 10 minutes. so roughly 50000 minutes for the 50 millions. the block download does not change at all.\r\nstart of sync is wonderfull, 4-6 hours till block ~4.080.000. then totally random behaviour occurs (last block changing/state entries number changing +-) till block ~4.200.000 / 4.300.000, then wonderfull again but never finishing.\r\nlast remark: good sync: state and blocks are downloaded parallel. actual situation bad sync: blocks are downloaded and a few 1000 states. then block download stops and then states are downloaded.\r\nmaybe a firewall/IDS/AV issue that certain traffic is blocked on a few peers and noone notices it.\r\n  {\r\n  currentBlock: 1101600,\r\n  highestBlock: 4872702,\r\n  knownStates: 1668568,\r\n  pulledStates: 1661993,\r\n  startingBlock: 0\r\n}\r\n> eth.syncing\r\nError: EOF\r\n    at web3.js:3143:20\r\n    at web3.js:6347:15\r\n    at get (web3.js:6247:38)\r\n    at <unknown>\r\nthat is the error on stall",

We are aware that sync may sometimes fail for networking reasons.\r\n\r\nA change to move the fast sync pivot block as the chain advances was implemented middle of 2018. This removed many fast sync issues people had. Numerous other sync issues have been fixed since this issue was created.",
