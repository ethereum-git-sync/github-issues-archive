Tonight was the third time it stucked.\r\n\r\nLogs are in attachments.\r\n[geth log.txt](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/files/12393118/geth.log.txt)\r\n[prysm log.txt](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/files/12393119/prysm.log.txt)\r\n\r\nAll started in prysm at 03:52:36 - WARN p2p: Attestation is too old to broadcast, discarding it. Current Slot: 7145661 , Attestation Slot: 7145628\r\n\r\nBut node still worked. Worked for almost an hour, though there was a lot of old attestation warnings.\r\n\r\nThen at 04:45:52 geth started to say Ignoring already known beacon payload number=17,959,321 hash=a1fae9..88f259 age=17s\r\nAnd this is all it sayed for next 3.5 hours.\r\n\r\nAt this time prysm sayed either WARN initial-sync: Block is not processed error=could not notify the engine of the new payload: timeout from http.Client: received an undefined execution engine error or WARN initial-sync: Range is not processed error=Range had no valid blocks to process\r\n\r\nWithin this time there was a lot of peers connected.\r\n\r\nMy setup:\r\nAMD Ryzen 5 5600G\r\n32 GB RAM\r\nWindows 10 x64\r\n",
