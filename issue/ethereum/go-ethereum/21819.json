ignorance is abandunt is the reason why so many project some much larger then you  went bankrupt in past years - either way i do hope i get payment for the poc so i can share it and maybe even help you fix it - but by the looks of it i see it isnt going to happen -\r\n\r\n to all users that will be affected i strongly suggest not to let it slide but file a lawsiuit in your country - when it is both a criminal offence / negelgent and basically scam as you are not seeing my issues as the etherum team closed it before anyone could contact, and thus could take measures to prevent loss of funds that is about to occuer very soon  - then you can file a lawsuit in your country and not where company is registered - there is great logic to that as the people offended are not expected to waste more money to start filing lawsuits abroud, aspeciall ywhen the damage cause to as resident o fyour country ...\r\n\r\nthere  countless legal predecents for these things - one mostt known is when bank of america scammed people and chose to fire people who nknew something was wrong or just silence others - the lawsuits they recived were not limited to the us where bank of america was based!\r\n\r\nthis is not a project that cares about the loyal  user base - and as evidence they even scam security experts like and my firm to file pos for them and he not pay!!!\r\n\r\njust like  legal promises to pay for security bounties and thus im suprised  they made it so far..!\r\n keep in mind some of the largest exchanfges which operated gfor much longer the etherum closed in past years after lawsuits cause courts to declare the company as a scam and basically even the devlopers were left wirth nothing!!\r\nthose exchanges who had layers who though they know law and accountants and programmers - did exactly the same error the etherum team did in past month when they refused to pay a bounty - leavin me no couce but to publish it to main sites dealing with these things.\r\n- i myself also tried to bring to several of those exchange  attention about the bounty i posted for them just before they got hacked after i realed the poc as the said basically you never contacted us - even though i have evidence - just like now i have the email, contact forms and replies and now even here is possible to see no one is taking it seriosly!!!\r\nsince all these platforms share a world of vulnurabilities from so many aspects - sites are usually limited only to xss / sql injection and rfi as well as lfi and several more  - but when u mix 6 diffrent languafges all with immense amount of vulnirabilities the youll be able to see the start of the poc i discovered - ill will in way share after being insulted so lets see what happens afer it goes public...\r\n\r\n ether and similar unsecure crypto have even more vulnurabilities as they simple silence all security specialist and just play games like you can see here - take alook of how many times i tried to warn/start a converstion with a group of around 20 people who decide the fate of all its users....and the redicoulous responses i got from those 20 etherum owners.\r\nthat is exactly why it iwll fail - arrogance never brought good things with it..\r\nso now i just advie all users to do what i said so that at least when the atack starts  (not by me but i can share - that whenever  a poc gets on google hacking databse and many more  - usually hundreds of thousand of script kiddies begin atacking and since this atack is simple to be carried out in numorous ways \r\n\r\n the atack will result in mass lost funds aspecially if u use browser wallets - but also if u use installed wallet locally - so far i can state it work on all android wallets, all web wallets (so exchange owners remove or cmod them to 400 ) \r\nwhich will result in inablity to start the remote code excution (i cant share it now but sufficed to say it is related to a windows feature all computers have - i tried the pos on mac and ios - doent work so you are safe) \r\n\r\n\r\n but it works easily on mobile and again i cant fully disclose yet how it works or why since i am still waiting to see if indeed a bounty will be payed as promised for finding this - took me and my team 2 weeks to find it before contacting the etherum network - hopefully this doesnt affect other netwoeks but the scale of this attack is not limited to a specific coontract likeother low scale atacks ,   but to all wallet adress and the basic mechanist in the entire etherum blockchain is vulnurable thus any node that has a wallet unlocked will be affected without the need for private keys !!\r\n\r\nso if any of you have echanges - trust me disable the etherum nodes as fast as possible - i ve already starded making a you tube video an a locally hosted video in case ether dev try to take it down.\r\n\r\n\r\n if you self host a cold wallet -  it will result in the wallet being unusable ir even worse all funds stolen in a few minutes after unlocked so advice i have is to rename the entire directory under C:\\Users\\Admin\\AppData\\Local\\Ethereum !! to something like d:\\etherum.zip (password protect it of course and wait for fix if you want loose all funds!\r\nafter it is over (depends on how long it will take ether team of \"specialist who lie about bounties ) you can just cope the folder back to its original place.\r\n\r\n\r\ni am really talking to the users to warn them to contact me as the admin of this project keeps removing my comments so other users cant take needed measures be the atack comes  - even though it help all users !!!!!\r\n\r\n if it is removed again i will of course not continue this im not some 20 year old kid - and i believe that wehn some is commiting crime i cannot stop him - i see the dev actually think he knows more about law then me...\r\n\r\n but when the poc hits please dont contact me to come fix it!!!! i gave you plenty of chances and after it is out in the wild even if i wanted i cannot help as it is so wide spread i have no idea how to fix i was trying to prevent it from happening as it is a matter of time till another security expert finds it too and he wont come to to try and share it.\r\n\r\nlaslt to the guy /20 men tea,m who are responsible for bliions of usd users submit to your platfom -  telling me to resubmit the poc over and over afer i contaced you as it wasnt getting fixed  is crazy and borderline criminal  - and most of all very unproffesional - instead of contacting the people you work with to contact me - you belive i need to chase you??? do you really think a security proffesional like me lacks money or is looking to troll ?? that is by itself lawsuit - and trust me i can sue you even if we dont live in the same country!!? i am i trying to help from the kindess of my heart and since i dont want to see etherum go offline in a few month - but if thats the additude (swearing - not answering any question or saying things like there is no wallet.dat - if i wanted to post the poc in a public domain so hundresds of thoudsnds of users can see it please tell - but as i said the second you cursed me secveral time idont think i want to share with you better to just post it publicly...i guess it is for the best as that way users will at least know i want kidding and realize you have no idea what you are talking about .",
