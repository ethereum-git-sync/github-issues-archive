It is a contradiction of its own documentation, compare https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API#hex-value-encoding\r\nAll other endpoints require a clean conversion from numeric values to their HEX representation.\r\npersonal_unlockAccount and its third parameter for the duration is the only method that deviates from this rule and is implemented incorrectly in my opinion.\r\n\r\nApparently other developers got used to it after implementation and it works. But interoperability between different clients is not possible because Geth handles it differently than e.g. Parity/OpenEthereum or Erigon.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @SinErgy84 in https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/15293#issuecomment-1153641734_\r\n\r\n**Expected behaviour**\r\n\r\npersonal_unlockAcount third parameter accepts hex-encoded value like ```personal_unlockAccount('0xaccount', 'secret', '0x100')```",
