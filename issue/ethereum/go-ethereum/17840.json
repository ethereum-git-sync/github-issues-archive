However, the logs for Geth are stuck with `err=\"authentication needed: password or unlock\"` and needs `miner.stop` and `miner.start` to restart.\r\n## Steps to reproduce the behavior\r\n> personal.unlockAccount(eth.coinbase, \"\\<password\\>\", 0)\r\n> miner.start()\r\n> personal.lockAccount(eth.coinbase)\r\n> personal.unlockAccount(eth.coinbase, \"\\<password\\>\", 0)\r\n\r\nAfter this sequence, the node is blocked with `err=\"authentication needed: password or unlock\"`\r\n## Backtrace\r\n`WARN [10-04|14:43:11] Block sealing failed                     err=\"authentication needed: password or unlock\"`\r\n",
