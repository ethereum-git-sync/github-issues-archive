  "body": "Geth has a very precise gas estimator, down to the last wei. This is theoretically very nice, but practically a bit pointless precision. Gas estimation is only truly accurate if the final execution environment and state will be the same as the one during estimation. Since this is never the case, wallet providers tend to bump the estimated gas by some percentage. We should contact them and figure out what they percentages are.\n\nThe reason here is that if the overarching bump is say 10% across all providers, then it is very wasteful do to super precise estimation, we could stop early and save a lot of compute time.
