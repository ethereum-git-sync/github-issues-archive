  "body": "I start geth with `--datadir ./node_data_dir ...`, would it be considered acceptable and/or safe to migrate the `node_data_dir` directory I specify at geth startup of which contains fully synced Ethereum chaindata to another machine (without the use of `geth export` & `geth import`), then start geth on the other machine using the chaindata it has received from fully synced machine?\r\n\r\nI.e.\r\n1) Node A contains fully synched chaindata within `node_data_dir`\r\n2) Node A transfers `node_data_dir` to Node B\r\n3) Node B now starts geth with the chaindata it received from Node A\r\n\r\nI've done this numerous times in the past for a plethora of servers I'm using to run geth instances, and I've had zero issues. But being that geth provides an export/import feature (i.e. `geth export` & `geth import`) I just wanted to ensure that transferring chaindata without the use of `geth export` & `geth import` (i.e. directly copying chaindata directory from one machine to another) is an acceptable means of transferring chaindata from one machine to another.",
