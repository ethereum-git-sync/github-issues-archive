If the number of contracts increase, the GetTransactionReceipt return null after a some minutes of starting the program. When I check the number of opened sockets I see there are more than 10000 TIME_AWAIT half opened socked by port 8545. I don't know how can I revise and debug it. I have tried a lot to increase the time, but nothing changed and I got stuck in the same situation sooner or later.\r\n\r\n",

It should like something is overwhelmed within the system if you put load on it.\r\n\r\nIs `web3` a .NET library?\r\n\r\nTo test if this is a problem within geth or your code base you could open a console by attaching to geth and try to retrieve the receipt from the console.\r\n\r\n```\r\ngeth attach [optional endpoint]\r\n> eth.getTransactionReceipt('<your tx hash>')\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf that returns the receipt than there is something wrong in your code. If you got null the transaction might not be processed. Try to retrieve it with `eth.getTransaction('<your tx hash>')`. If that returns the transaction and block number/hash are null it means that it is not processed. There can be several reasons for it, e.g. transaction is queued. If the result contains a block number and hash and `eth.getTransactionReceipt` is still not giving the receipt than there might be something wrong inside geth.\r\n\r\n",
