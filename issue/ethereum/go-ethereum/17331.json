    "body": "Yeah,I believe so.  Our scenario is: we use ethermint as an abci app to implement ethereum function with tendermint doing the consensus. We can reach approximately 3 or 4 seconds a block (under 1500 threads sending transactions, only 4 consensus nodes.If adding consensus node, the performance will decline)  So we are wondering how we can pack more txs in one block to improve the performance.\r\n\r\nMaybe we can add the code as a feature branch?\r\n\r\nA most easy way is : just send n txs in a request, some nodes implement a new grpc interface to handle the request. Still one tx with one signature, the only advantage is saving the network transfering.\r\n\r\nStill I think the scenario depends on different business logic , that is : is there any nesissaritiy an account needs to quickly send out lots of transactions? That is a bit like a batch processing scenario.",
