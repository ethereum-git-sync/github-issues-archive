    "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nthanks for your improvement suggestion. I'm unsure about the exact meaning of your comment.\r\n\r\nI think you mean that the Ethereum protocol should be changed to compute state changes in parallel. Unfortunately, it is not possible to do this because contracts in different parts of the trie can interact with each other during a single transaction.\r\n\r\nIf you mean that go-ethereum could compute the trie root hash in parallel, then the answer is: yes, it's possible. But we have tried it before and it did not provide a big performance improvement. The overhead of communicating between different hashing threads was larger than the benefit provided by parallel computation.",
