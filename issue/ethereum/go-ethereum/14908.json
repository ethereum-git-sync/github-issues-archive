  "body": "#### System information\r\n\r\nGeth version: `1.6.7-stable`\r\nOS & Version: OSX\r\n\r\n#### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nI expect for transactions send via geth to appear as pending briefly, before eventually being mined. Even if this isn't the case for all of them, I expect it to be be the case for most of them, especially when the gas price is very high. This is the behavior that I observe when using the testnet.\r\n\r\n#### Actual behaviour\r\n\r\nWhen I try to send transaction through geth, each new transaction is stuck as pending. They get added to the eth.pendingTransactions list and the nonce increases. They also briefly appear on etherscan, as pending. But they aren't assigned a block number. I don't think its the gas price, because I've experimented with relatively small levels of gas (20 gwei) up to larger levels (200 gwei) for very simple transactions. I'm also sure that my account is unlocked. I know people have been experiencing something like this on their private net, but I'm experiencing it for the mainnet. Something similar occurs when I try to make a transaction through the Ethereum Wallet. The transaction appears in grey, and then eventually disappears. When I make the same transaction (same sender and recipient) through MetaMask, it works for relatively small amounts of gas (20 gwei), so I imagine the underlying problem has to do with my geth setup.\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\r\n\r\nRun get on my computer. \r\n\r\n#### Backtrace\r\n\r\nThere is no error. This is what a typical transaction look slike:\r\n\r\n```\r\nweb3.eth.sendTransaction({ \r\n\tfrom: '0x35e32828B4b28efC3aa3F48288e39bFd2Cb8596c', \r\n\tto: '0xcE1D7F173B95C4dda0383Cf5b4BFF777880Ab97a', \r\n\tvalue: '100000000000000',\r\n\tgasPrice: '200000000000' })\r\n```\r\n\r\nTHis is my geth command:\r\n` geth --fast --cache=1024 --rpc --rpcport 8545 --networkid 1`\r\n\r\nAnd this is what it looks like in eth.pendingTransactions\r\n\r\n```\r\n}, {\r\n    blockHash: null,\r\n    blockNumber: null,\r\n    from: \"0x35e32828b4b28efc3aa3f48288e39bfd2cb8596c\",\r\n    gas: 90000,\r\n    gasPrice: 200000000000,\r\n    hash: \"0x320ab47569b199fd7486260b62672de2405a0050522942bd770fde89e2b6c28a\",\r\n    input: \"0x\",\r\n    nonce: 59,\r\n    r: \"0x466dbaa6bd34369526a8f7be0a699893a9ae105b108e214a79d11954e3eae9e4\",\r\n    s: \"0x414468a6e35d434fca329c42709e3e7b7c5812b4bb2e10d5aebf16b582924f59\",\r\n    to: \"0xce1d7f173b95c4dda0383cf5b4bff777880ab97a\",\r\n    transactionIndex: 0,\r\n    v: \"0x26\",\r\n    value: 100000000000000\r\n}]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny guidance would be much appreciated!",

    "body": "I figured it out, partially. It seems that the new transactions were being added to the list of pending transactions with higher nonces. Therefore, they weren't being seen by the network. When I executed the transaction again with the correct nonce (in line with the live blockchain) it went through. I still don't know how to clear pending transactions, though. Is that possible?",
