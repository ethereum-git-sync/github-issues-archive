    "body": "It's not very clear what part you're using and want to handle.\r\n\r\nIf you're trying to use the JSON RPC specs, the best source is https://ethereum.github.io/execution-apis/api-documentation/ , the returns are well defined, but the various error types have no designated error codes unfortunately. There have been some efforts to spec it better, but there's not much inclination to invest the time to standardize error codes across clients, so it's a bit hard. You could try and nudge people to do it tho' :)\r\n\r\nIf you're using the Go packages directly, that's a bit of an interesting issue as the internals constantly evolve. New EIPs constantly add new functionality and new potential validation errors. It's not the easiest to keep tracking them beyond \"error or no error\". We try to make the messages meaningful for the user, but they might not be easy to consume for a program. There are always `errors.Is` comparisons with public error types, but you'd still need to surf the code if you want to react to all. Maybe if you're only interested in a couple specific errors (e.g. invalid nonce, insufficient balance) you could use that.'",
