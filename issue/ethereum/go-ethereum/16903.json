  "body": "Hi, because of absence of method to get all transaction by particular address I need to scan every block to find complete list of transactions for my address, doing so with one block at a time takes a lot of resources and time.\r\n\r\nIt would be much faster if I can get list of blocks by from / to blocks numbers, for example with web3: web3.eth.getBlockRange(573700, 573800);\r\n\r\nIt would also be really helpful to figure out the very first transaction and it's block number for particular address, to know from what block to start scanning.\r\n",
