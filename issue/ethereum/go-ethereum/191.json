  "body": "So it appears, and in some of my testing, that any new fork will just take over (note the ShorterFork test is missing in `chain_manager_test.go`). I suspect this is being worked on, but here's a summary:\n\nWhen ProcessWithParent is called, it sums the difficulty by calling `sm.CalculateTD`:\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/poc8/chain/block_manager.go#L258\n\nBut this function simply adds to the difficulty of the chain head, rather than the parent of the block being processed:\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/poc8/chain/block_manager.go#L298\n\n`chain_manager.go` has a similar function (that is never called) that would do this properly, but it depends on `writeBlockInfo` having been called in the past to get the current TD of that block from leveldb:\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/poc8/chain/chain_manager.go#L232\n\nOf course if the parent of the block isn't on canonical, that's a problem. It seems we need a more comprehensive way of dealing with extensions/forks of the chain.\n\nI suspect this is being worked on. But I took a stab at it yesterday by adding a `workingTree map[string]*link` to the `ChainManager` to replace the transient `workingChain`. Chains are added to the tree through `TestChain` if all `ProcessWithParent` passes. `ImportChain` will then establish the new canonical chain either by doing nothing (ie `TestChain` extends a non-dominant fork), adding blocks to the current head (standard), or causing a re-org (ie. `TestChain` extended a fork that now has most TD, where TD is tracked in the links objects).\n\nThe main benefit is that we can persist forks/branches in memory rather than having to get them in totality from the peers/blockpool every time, and we can track their dynamic TD. \n\nI would have to rebase the code and cleanup a bit, but would this be something you'd be interested in seeing in a PR, and possibly for discussion?\n",
