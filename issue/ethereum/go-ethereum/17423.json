Im running a script which generated 300 transactions from 1 account every 3 seconds and Im noticing after a while that the network collapses and a bottle neck occurs on the gateway nodes. Is there anyway to increase or fine tune geth to process more transactions or are there any existing metrics that show what is achievable with various configurations. \r\n\r\nCurrently running all nodes with this basic configuration:\r\n```\r\ngeth --datadir=/mnt/aerum --syncmode 'full' --networkid 1234 --txpool.globalslots 40960  --targetgaslimit \"51000000\" --gasprice \"1000000000\" console\r\n```\r\n",
