  "body": "#### System information\n\nGeth version: v1.4.6 ~ v1.4.8\nOS & Version: Linux Ubuntu 64 14.04.4 LTS\nCommit hash : 98be7cd (from master)\n#### Expected behaviour\n\nPool have to find block efficiently.\n#### Actual behaviour\n\nInefficient than before.\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\n\nJust run wallets above v1.4.5 and mine.\nv1.4.5 works fine. v1.4.6 and above results really bad luck of finding block.\n\nI'm running a pool. miningpoolhub.com\nAbout 1~2% of total share, more than 100 blocks are found from our pool daily.\nI hesitated to submit this issue because it is hard to reproduce, hard to simulate, hard to prove also.\n\nEthereum with v1.4.5 ran fine, but from v1.4.6, block finding luck(efficiency) dropped more than 10%. I believe it's related to some changes about network sync which is included in v1.4.6\nI tried v1.4.6 several times before, v1.4.8 again few hours ago and found that something really affects bad luck everytime I try. This doesn't seem to be just normal bad luck, but I can see significant changes.\n\nI still can't prove the issue. I see fine logs, fine wallet working. Overall pool statistics is the only thing I can judge the efficiency.\nDo you have any idea about this?\n",
