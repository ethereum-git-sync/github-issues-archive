  "body": "The ability to track balance/nonce changes in RPC PUB SUB would be a huge win. Since the only way to get this information currently is by polling rather than subscribing, it has the knock on effect that any applications using the RPC hit far more nonce errors and have performance impacts by continuously querying for balances and the account nonce when similar subscriptions are already implemented for listening to logs/block headers. \r\n\r\nThis was first listed as a potential improvement on the PUB SUB wiki page on Jan '17:\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/RPC-PUB-SUB/7a0c1704737ece636aabda1d08d43f96dd1a619f\r\n\r\nI don't mind picking this work up, but it'd be good to have some pointers to where the existing pub sub implementations are so I can follow best practise. Once done here, can look at implementing the same standard in Parity.",
