  "body": "Running geth on a private network, had a contract account with 10 ether (simple contract, testing deposits / withdrawals).  Tried to withdraw exactly 10 ether and it failed.

However, it succeeded when using 9,999,999,999,999,999,999.  Confirmed the account had exactly 10 ether.  Therefore, it appears the geth >= operator in the EVM is failing the == part of the test.\n",

    "body": "Update: I am seeing this again and have some better information.  It appears to be specifically related to using the Mist-based 'Ethereum Wallet' Linux x64 0.3.7 client to send the transactions.  I can use a node.js command-line prompt to issue the web3 commands directly to geth over RPC and it works.\n\nThe procedure to duplicate is to compile the contract above to get the ABI, and deploy it.  Then use the address and ABI to create a contract 'watch' in Ethereum Wallet.  It should then be easy to observe, using the GUI to send transactions.\n\nIn the geth logs, it appears the transaction fails due to running out of gas.  The Ethereum Wallet client tries to calculate the **exact** amount of gas (in this case 29018) and the 'out of gas' check in the geth logs also shows the gas consumed was **exactly** 29018 (cgas=29018).  So, in theory it shouldn't be failing.  Could the check for gas consumption be failing the equality check????  Why would sending 1 Wei less as a transaction parameter make a difference????\n\nNote that there's no way to adjust the amount of gas from within the Ethereum Wallet gui so I'm not sure where to go from here.  I'm guessing if I bumped it up to 29,019 gas the transaction might go through.\n\nEthereum GUI:\nEstimated fee consumption: 0.0009509 ether (19,018 gas)\nProvided maximum fee: 0.0014509 ether (29,018 gas)\nGas price: 0.05 ether per million gas\n\ngeth logs (verbosity 5):\nI0109 17:58:52.862276    2722 worker.go:350] 🔨  Mined block (#3945 / 2a9788aa).
