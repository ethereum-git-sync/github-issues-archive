  "body": "#### System information\r\n\r\nGeth version: `1.8.23-stable`\r\nOS & Version: `Ubuntu 18.04.2 TLS`\r\n\r\n#### Expected behaviour\r\nI have two separate machines with one node running on each machine. The node on machine 1 has mined 6909 blocks in PoA insta-mining mode (block period 0 in genesis config). \r\n\r\nI started a node on machine 2 and used `admin.addPeer` to connect node 1, after which I expected node 2 to start syncing. \r\n\r\n#### Actual behaviour\r\nOutput of `admin.peers` confirms that the peers are connected, and both nodes are using the same genesis block. \r\n\r\nOutput of `eth.syncing`shows that my second node knows about the blocks on my first node :\r\n```\r\n{\r\ncurrentBlock: 4859,\r\nhighestBlock: 6909,\r\nknownStates: 45954,\r\npulledStates: 45954,\r\nstartingBlock: 6844\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe syncing process however does not actually start. \r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\r\n\r\n1. Start node 1 on machine 1 with unlocked account in PoA insta-mine mode. \r\n2. Start node 2 on machine 2. \r\n3. Add node 1 as peer in node 2 console.\r\n\r\n#### Backtrace\r\nI've created a new chain on machine 1 with a fixed 3 second blocktime instead of insta-mining, leaving all other config options intact. When starting a node on machine 2 and adding machine 1 as a peer the syncing process starts immediately.\r\n",

    "body": "There might be a couple issues here, but the general use case of insta-mining in a private network is not something we'd like to support.\r\n\r\nInsta mining allows you two cornercases that can never happen on any other network: blocks could arrive blazing frequently (thousands per second), or they could have large pauses, never mining a block. The former would need very special handling in the sync code, because we assume that the chain doesn't move too fast. The latter could cause sync not to trigger properly.\r\n\r\nAll in all, the insta-mining was meant for a single node dev mode, mostly for running unit/integration tests through truffle or other tools without having to wait for mining. I'll close this PR as something we don't want to support, but if you do see issues in non-insta-mining network, please open a new issue with all the details you have.",
