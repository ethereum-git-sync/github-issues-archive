If it's not currently supported, can other libs be supported to enable mining through them like OpenGL, CUDA etc.?\n\nBecause I found OpenCL support is not made available for NVIDIA TX1 and TK1 boards. I'm not sure about other boards or platforms, but just wondering if the same could be possible in case there's no possibility to have OpenCL running on system and an alternative is supported.\n\nRef links about OpenCL for TX1 and TK1.

    "body": "The official Ethereum [ethash](https://github.com/ethereum/ethash) implementation only supports OpenCL based GPU mining. As Ethereum targets switching from PoW mining to PoS, there's not much incentive for the Foundation to expend on further fine tuning the mining algos, especially as it's beneficial to miners only, not the ecosystem in general.\n\nHowever, as far as I know miners have indeed picked up the task to maintain their own miner implementation that has all the bells and whistles they themselves need, porting cpp-ethereum over to CUDA too https://github.com/Genoil/cpp-ethereum. You might want to check out this project.\n\nLastly given that C++ will probably outperform Go on pure miner hashrate, and that miners already operate using Geth for the node and `ethminer` for the number cruncher, there's little value to even maintain the GPU miner in the Geth codebase, as there's noone to maintain it. We'll always retain the CPU miner as it's needed for private networks, but a private net doesn't need GPU mining and the mainnet already has better alternatives.\n",
