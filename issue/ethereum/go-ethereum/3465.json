  "body": "#### System information\r\n\r\nGeth version: `geth version`\r\nGeth\r\nVersion: 1.5.5-stable\r\nGit Commit: ff07d54843ea7ed9997c420d216b4c007f9c80c3\r\nProtocol Versions: [63 62]\r\nNetwork Id: 1\r\nGo Version: go1.7.4\r\nOS: linux\r\n\r\n#### Expected behaviour\r\ngeth could check for available disk space before attempting to start activity.  Also, while it is running it could check for available disk space; in case there is an error, it could at least specifically check for lack of disk space and provide a clear error.\r\n\r\n#### Actual behaviour\r\ngeth output a huge error (1379 lines long?) but no indication that it had run out of disk space where .ethash was.\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\r\nCreate a drive with only a little space.  Start syncing a geth node on it.\r\n\r\nIn case it is useful, this is what I went through:\r\n* I had a Google Compute Engine server where i was doing some code\r\n* For a talk/demo that I had to do, I was creating a new node.  So i attached a new disk.\r\n* I set the --datadir to be on the new disk.  \r\n* After the unclear errors in the logs, I did some trial and error to understand that even .ethash takes up quite some space.\r\n\r\n[nohup.txt](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/files/660818/nohup.txt)\r\n",
