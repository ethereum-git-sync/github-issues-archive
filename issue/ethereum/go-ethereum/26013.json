It should be able to sync to the merge-point. \r\n\r\nA way to hack it might be: the operator has to give it some more info, e.g.` geth --syncmode=full --synctarget=< rlp of a header> ` then that's fine too. The rlp header could be used to feed into the catalyst api as if it were a beacon client doing it. \r\n\r\n",
