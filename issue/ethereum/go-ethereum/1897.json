Indexing all transactions would require quite significant storage and most certainly doesn't scale.\n\nOne way to do this is as how we MIP mapped LOGs and use a similar query mechanism, but this is an expensive and CPU/IO intensive operation because there are far more transactions than there are LOGs. \n\nDoing this for LOGs is actually fine since you more or less paid for it where as transactions incurs no additional cost in terms of upfront payment. letting the user decide what to map isn't an option either since it just won't work for light clients. Light clients depend on archive and full nodes for data retrieval and can't make use of this \"user setting\" option because they don't receive any other data than the data that is explicit requested.\n\nI understand this is a much requested feature but understand that it comes at a great, expensive cost and, as I said earlier, difficult to do it right. \n",

It doesn't have to be a requirement so clients that do not have CPU power can just turn the feature off.  \n\nRight now most of the web wallets and mist based wallets are forced to use some external persistence mechanism to have this data available to the user so any efforts to save CPU/etc... becomes a zero sum effort and you add an additional TCP/socket round-trip just to get the data from the blocks and then another connection to the persistence layer.
