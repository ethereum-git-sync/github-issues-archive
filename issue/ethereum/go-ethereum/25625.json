Though due to lack of documents I'm not sure if remotedb can be used in that way.\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "As of now it's not possible to serve RPC using remotedb. If your goal is to have one master node and a few slave nodes, you can try the light-client approach here. In the gist I use the tracing API, but it could work for other methods too.\r\n\r\nThe general idea is you run one full node which also serves light clients, and then run as many light clients as you need which connect to the full node. And then you try to restrict the full node to only your own clients to save on resources.\r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/s1na/ab834d1af2c91b3f67ee9ea692efdf55",
