  "body": "The node is fully synced and is running at around 88% CPU and 25% on an AX101 Hetzer Server. Compared to my GETH BSC Node, it is sitting at around 20% CPU. I am trying to optimize this node for speed (validating blocks) as I am using it as an RPC point.\r\n\r\nHere are my GETH launch settings:\r\n--datadir /home/chain/data --syncmode snap --http --http.addr localhost --http.port 8545 --ws --ws.addr localhost --ws.port 8546 --metrics --cache=64000 --maxpeers 100 --http.api eth,net,web3,txpool,debug --rpc.allow-unprotected-txs --txlookuplimit 0 --ws.origins * --ws.api eth,net,web3,txpool,debug\r\n\r\n1) Are any of these settings hindering the speed and causing high cpu?\r\n2) Is there anything I can change to increase the speed at which the node syncs with new blocks and validates transactions?\r\n3) What is Data Freeze Chain Segment, is this slowing anything down? Can it be turned off?\r\n4) Would disabling --snapshot= be beneficial to this?\r\n5) Is this an accurate test:  Testing the speed of the block processing by comparing the timestamp I get in my terminal to the timestamp given here: https://etherscan.io/blocks?\r\n\r\nAny advice is really appreciated, Thanks!!\r\n",
