  "body": "This is more a documentation request, but I think it would be very helpful as a developer community if we had a mapping of solc to geth compatibility. Right now we're in the dark about what's known to work and what isn't, and it causes a lot of frustration for developers such as myself who want to upgrade between Geth and Solc versions and maintain secure and up-to-date software.\r\n\r\nI've searched and asked on Gitter, Discord, the Ethereum Stack Exchange, and I can't seem to find documentation on this anywhere. Are there initiatives in the works to get a mapping like this published to Github?",

I'm thinking about use cases where users are using older versions of Geth and newer versions of solc where the newest opcodes do not exist, and so compiled contracts will be compiled correctly by solc but the generated ABI code will fail at run-time when they hit Geth, if that makes sense.",
