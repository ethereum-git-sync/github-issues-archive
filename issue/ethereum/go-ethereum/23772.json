  "body": "Please excuse me if that's not the right place or if the question is naive.\r\n\r\nAfter studying how go-ethereum store data in the `Database`, I'm left a bit confused about something.\r\n\r\nIn go-ethereum the block headers, receipts, total difficulty ... are addressed in the DB with both the block hash AND the block number. For example: `headerPrefix + num (uint64 big endian) + hash -> header` (see https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/core/rawdb/schema.go#L79).\r\n\r\nI can't find a good reason for it and as far as I can tell it forces to also store a mapping `hash-->number` in the DB just to be able to read a block from a hash, and many other operations. As far as I can tell, all of those operations use this mapping simply to be able to request the block/receipts... with both hash and number, while they already have the hash. Why not simply address those piece of data with just the hash? This create a lot of unnecessary DB requests and make it more difficult during reorgs because then you have to maintain this mapping up to date as well.\r\n\r\nThe only reason I can think of is to reduce the chance of hash collision but there is simpler way to deal with that problem in the  extremely unlikely case it happens: just refuse the block and wait for one with a different hash.\r\n\r\nAm I missing something? Wouldn't that be a significant optimization/simplification?",
