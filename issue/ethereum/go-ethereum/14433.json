    "body": "Hi. I have had the same issue with --fast --cache=1024, what I've did is changed the disklocation from c...\\Roaming to D:\\Ethereum with parameter --datadir=\"D:\\Ethereum\". Both HDD's are the same. Pagefile is on D, but somehow on C I got lot of sync errors and pending values fluctuates from 10.000 to 8000 and suddenly 25000 again. After changing to D geth becomes much more stable and rows were updated lot lot faster than before. \r\n\r\n(On C: CPU usage of geth was around 5%. Disk max 7MB's (disk = enterprise server disk 160MB/s);\r\nAfter changing datadir (deleting files in roaming\\Ethereum first) to d, geth cpu usages increases to 75%, hdd (D) usage 50MB's and network usage around max. So, it was somehow a good trick ;)\r\n\r\nEdit: on C I waited 2 days but still syncing / processing while I didn't know where it was and how much time it needed or how much retries it needed. \r\nAfter changing to D and restart from 0, it took only 2 hours to get the whole train (4.1 million blocks). \r\n\r\nGrz, John",
