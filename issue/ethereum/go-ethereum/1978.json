    "body": "Thanks for opening the issue here too.\n\nCould you perhaps save a log with the `--vmodule=downloader=6` CLI flag set, and perhaps another one (will be huge) with `--verbosity=6`?\n\nThe issue I see from your log snippets is that the sync gets interrupted quite often, which causes frequent restarts. I am not entirely sure about the cause of the interrupts though. One possibility is if you have limited bandwidth and the downloader manages to saturate it too much. How much do you have available approximately?\n\nAnother thing that may or may not interfere is that the RPI isn't too powerful and the CPU may be saturated too much by keeping many connections active and also processing inbound connection requests. You could try lowering your `--maxpeers` to maybe 10. Another flag I introduced specifically for the RPI to limit the concurrent handshakes was removed a while ago by @fjl in favor of some fancier mechanism that however wasn't implemented until now. Any details about it or ETA (@fjl)?\n",
