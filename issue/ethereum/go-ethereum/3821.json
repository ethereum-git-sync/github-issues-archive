    "body": "Its hard to explain without knowing what your use case is, but all transactions in ethereum need to be sent from an account (key). The transaction will have many fields such as value, gas, data ect... All this data must be signed using the private key. Once it is signed, the transaction can be posted to the ethereum network where it will be propagated by peers, verified and executed (mined) by the miners, and included in the next block.\r\n\r\nYou might be getting hung up on the fact that when using the geth console, your transactions are signed by the unlocked account that is already known to the console. For many Dapps (like the ones that use metamask), you can't expect users to be running a full node with their accounts unlocked. In these cases, the Dapps must create the transaction object on the client side and also sign it with keys on the client side. Now that we have a raw transaction that has been signed on the users client side, all you need to do is post that raw transaction to any RPC enabled node where it will be propagated through the network. Metamask abstracts much of the pain of doing this - check out some of the example projects.\r\n\r\nIn the future, you may want to consider posting questions and issues like this to the [ethereum stack exchange](http://ethereum.stackexchange.com/) page since this isn't a bug in the client.",

    "body": "So technically, its entirely possible to communicate with multiple nodes in a single app (not sure id call it a Dapp). If you are using nodejs and web3 you could code the 4 RPC urls into a config file and switch between them, setting the `web3.setProvider` function. You can't connect to more than one provider at a time but you could use some kind of Promise.then() daisy chain to make requests to each of them from a single function.\r\n\r\nThat said, I'm not sure why you would want to do that. You only really need one blockchain connected node to interact with the network. And again, this is not a bug/issue with geth so im not sure go-ethereum github is the appropriate forum for Dapp level support.",
