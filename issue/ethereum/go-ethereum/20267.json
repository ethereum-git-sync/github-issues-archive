We don't believe the fix is appropriate or even warranted, but the issue should not exist in the first place (not sure what it is).\r\n\r\nOP's screenshot contains a very low difficulty (1054), which is not possible without a modified Geth client. But it might trigger some issue we're not aware of. This issue report is mostly a memo that we need to investigate.",
