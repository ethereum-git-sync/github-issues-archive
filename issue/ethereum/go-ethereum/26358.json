  "body": "Hi, from the doc https://blog.ethereum.org/2019/07/10/geth-v1-9-0, it mentions \"Blocks and receipts that are older than a cutoff threshold (3 epochs) are moved out of LevelDB into a custom freezer database, that is backed by a handful of append-only flat files. \". \r\nSo does it means the blocks are older than 3 epochs which is 3*32 = 96 blocks will be moved into the freezer database? 96 is too small, does it?\r\n\r\nBut I also find the argument FullImmutabilityThreshold? what does it mean? By default, it is set to 90000.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
