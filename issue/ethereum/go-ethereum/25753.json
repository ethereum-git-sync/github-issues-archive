  "body": "#### System information\r\n\r\nGeth version:\r\n```\r\nVersion: 1.10.23-stable\r\nGit Commit: d901d85377c2c2f05f09f423c7d739c0feecd90a\r\nGit Commit Date: 20220824\r\nArchitecture: arm64\r\nGo Version: go1.18.5\r\nOperating System: linux\r\n```\r\nPrysm beacon-chain version:\r\n```\r\nbeacon-chain version Prysm/v3.1.1/653ea3b030c3bb99aa3f3d95a8de9f4d6e147930. Built at: 2022-09-09 17:24:18+00:00\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Expected behaviour\r\nWe expect system should start syncing from scratch both for Geth and Prysm beacon clients\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Actual behaviour\r\nPrysm is syncing: [log1](https://gist.github.com/begetan/ea935fe9c26a4a269d7458b0cfec37eb)\r\nGeth is not able to sync: [log2](https://gist.github.com/begetan/10733dbd611fb85da61030677d2f315e)\r\n\r\nGeth not able to sync with this error message:\r\n`Beacon client online, but never received consensus updates. Please ensure your beacon client is operational to follow the chain!` \r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\r\n\r\n1. Configure geth with systemd unit\r\n2. Configure prysm with systemd unit\r\n3. Create jwt token\r\n3. Start services:\r\n```\r\nsystemctl enable geth.service --now\r\nsystemctl enable prysm.service --now\r\n\r\n```\r\nThis issue is not fully repeatable. It may depend on the startup timings.\r\nIt occurs at  90% tries of deployment of Goerli and 50% of Ropsten deploynment. Mainnet is not affected at the moment, because this check is in Post-Merge code.\r\n\r\nAnother important thing, get in this status provides incorrect sync state:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl -s -X POST -H \"Content-Type:application/json\" --data '{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"method\":\"eth_syncing\",\"id\":1}' localhost:8545\r\n{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":1,\"result\":false}\r\n\r\ndu -shc /data/*\r\n2.2M    /data/geth\r\n4.0K    /data/jwtsecret\r\n325M    /data/prysm\r\n327M    total\r\n```\r\nYou can see that geth data directory is empty at the moment of syncing=false report.  We didn't success to recover geth from dead-loop by restarting geth of prysm services. The only way to recover this situation is to replace geth with binary version 1.10.21\r\n",
