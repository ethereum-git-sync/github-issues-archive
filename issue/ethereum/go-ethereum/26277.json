  "body": "# Rationale\r\n\r\neth_call now allows overriding parts of state. In debug_traceCall we go a step further and allow overriding block metadata. This is a general trend that people want to tweak different parts of the execution in their simulations. This feature entails overriding the CALLER for certain calls in a tx. Similar to Foundry's [vm.prank](https://book.getfoundry.sh/cheatcodes/prank) feature.\r\n\r\nThis will allow simulations to e.g. pretend they are the owner of a contract.\r\n\r\n# Implementation\r\n\r\nDo you have ideas regarding the implementation of this feature? Yes\r\nAre you willing to implement this feature? Yes",
