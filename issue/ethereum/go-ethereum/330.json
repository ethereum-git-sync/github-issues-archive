  "body": "The JSON RPC API sets the CORS `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header to '*', so even fully featured browsers will allow cross origin requests to the JSON RCP API.\n\n**RECOMMENDATION:**\n\nProper Cross Site Request Forgery(CSRF) mitigation requires the following properties from the CSRF token:\n- The token must be of sufficient length and sufficiently entropic to reduce the likelihood of attacks such as hash collisions or brute force.\n- The token must be tied to the session identifier included within the request. In the event the session identifier was not available within the originating request, a new session must be generated and the CSRF token shall be associated to the new session set in the response. This prevents a malicious user from generating a pool of valid tokens to authorize requests sent by others on the system.\n- The token must be reset upon each successful/authorized request to prevent reuse or reply attacks.\n- The token must be required for all sensitive requests or actions.\n- The token must have a lifetime that is less than or equal to the session identifier it is\n  associated to.\n",
