  "body": "While working on an independent peer implementation in ethereumjs, I've came across this weird issue.  This is a decoded `ping` message in DHT (redacted some fields and received a similar from many nodes):\n\n```\n{ version: <Buffer 04>,\n  address: '::',\n  udpPort: 30303,\n  tcpPort: 30303,\n  dstAddress: '42.42.42.42', // changed this, obviously\n  dstUdpPort: 30304,\n  dstTcpPort: 0,\n  expiration: 1452565204,\n  id: <Buffer a9 79 fb 57 54 95 b8 d6 db ... >,\n  port: 30303 }\n```\n\nThe `address` field (from address) is actually the '::' (any/unspecified) encoded in IPv6 over the wire.\n\nThe relevant pieces of code in geth are:\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/p2p/discover/udp.go#L216-L227\nand\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/p2p/discover/udp.go#L246\n\nThe above code does a NAT discovery for the public IP.\n\nIs it possible the node had NAT discovery turned off? Is there some other bug there stopping the lookup from working? Shouldn't such an address (unspecified IPv4 or IPv6) be rejected in the protocol? Should IPv4 and IPv6 addresses be mixed in one ping?\n",

This can happen when NAT punching is off or doesn't work. In this case, it will send the unspecified address because it simply does not know what its externally reachable address is. I mean, we could send 127.0.0.1, but it wouldn't help you either.\n\nIt is better to use the UDP envelope address rather than relying on the address field.\n\n> Should IPv4 and IPv6 addresses be mixed in one ping?\n\nYou are getting a 16-element address because of the internal representation in Go.\nIMHO it shouldn't matter because it is unspecified either way.\n",

    "body": "> It is better to use the UDP envelope address rather than relying on the address field.\n\nI've resorted to doing that in case unspecified is received. Maybe it would make sense to use the PONG response as an alternative to NAT traversal? e.g. update the internal representation if the sender in PING was unspecified and the PONG received has an external address.\n\nAt least documenting that an implementor should use the UDP sender address in case the PING fromAddress is unspecified.\n\nAnd you are right, having unspecified is much better, than localhost if we take the rules above as a result.\n\n> You are getting a 16-element address because of the internal representation in Go.\n> IMHO it shouldn't matter because it is unspecified either way.\n\nI still find a bit weird to have it mixed as they are different protocols.
