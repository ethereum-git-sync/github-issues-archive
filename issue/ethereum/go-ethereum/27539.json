  "body": "# Rationale\r\n\r\nAssume a simple contract which may revert with a custom error:\r\n\r\n```\r\npragma solidity ^0.8.20;\r\n\r\ncontract Foo {\r\n   uint256 public bar = 0;\r\n   error CustomError(); \r\n \r\n   function setBar(uint256 bar_) public {\r\n      if (bar_ > 100) {\r\n        revert CustomError();\r\n      }\r\n     bar = bar_;\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCalling `EstimateGas` on the function when `bar_ > 100` will cause either a `*backends.revertError` or `*ethapi.revertError` to be returned, depending on the network being used. This error struct contains the message `execution reverted` along with the `reason` field set to the 4byte selector of `CustomError`. This is the expected behaviour.\r\n\r\nHowever, because the `revertError` type is not exported, callers cannot inspect the `reason` field without resorting to unsafe pointers. It would be very helpful (almost crucial) in code to be able to determine the reason for a failure.\r\n\r\nI understand there is a larger issue around custom errors for non-gas-estimations being tracked here #26823.\r\n\r\n# Implementation\r\n\r\nOn the face of it it seems like a relatively simple change to export these structs to they may be inspected by callers. A further improvement would then be to update `abigen` to produce code which can map the selectors to some kind of enum/const of the custom errors, but this can be tackled later.\r\n\r\nI am happy to implement this feature if it seems directionally correct.",
