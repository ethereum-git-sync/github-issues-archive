I can create an arbitrary contract and it's purely user interpretation as to what the data storage means.\r\n\r\nIn theory we could track for example all contracts that implement the ERC20 interface and list those as tokens, but that would only be a subset, and it would list a ton of junk.\r\n\r\nIt's up to users to track interesting contracts either manually, or perhaps via some automated tool and whitelisted token lists.",
