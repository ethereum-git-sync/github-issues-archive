It is written that filters are permanent, so I store it hex address and trying to get filter changes (eth_getFilterChanges). \nFor some time it works fine, but when I restart my geth node new filter changes don't appear. So after restarting I can get all logs (eth_getFilterLogs), but can't get only new changes. Because of this, I have to recreate my filter, and get changes by new filter hex.\n",
