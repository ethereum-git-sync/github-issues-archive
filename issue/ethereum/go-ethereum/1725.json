Then try doing the same in bash or zsh - the input goes over multiple lines.\n\nI do have some code in scripts, but I seem to end up with a lot of these long command lines when working in the REPL trying stuff out and experimenting and/or when I'm having problems. In this sort of situation I like to be able to review previous input lines, and copy and paste bits out of old ones, so being able to see the whole thing is very useful.\n\n--Tom\n",
