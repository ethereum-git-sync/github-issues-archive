    "body": "I found a solution here: https://gist.github.com/mingderwang/31bc3d2e7a6ad6272ba7\nwhich talks about downloading the AMD developers toolkit. That resolved the make error for my graphics cards. I am able to use all AMD cards now, however, there is a video problem when the mining begins. Perhaps reducing the allocation to 90% from 95% would give me a clear screen. I have also imported the blockchain from backup successfully. Thank you everyone for the resources! I used SkithUno's Spacience blog (http://spacience.blogspot.ae/2015/05/ethereum-gpu-mining-ubuntu-1404-lts.html) for installation guidance. Much easier to get started with go-ethereum using specific OS versions.\n\nI am also not able to acquire my hashrate in rpc running Geth. The reason for this I found here: https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Mining. The article explains that miner.hashrate is unavailble with geth, while GPU mining. Note hashrate info is not available in geth when GPU mining. Check your hashrate with ethminer, miner.hashrate will always report 0. Then I found this snippit: Best way to check your hash rate with GPU mining is to just do \"ethminer -M -G\" here: http://forum.ethereum.org/discussion/2826/miner-hashrate-in-geth-returns-0-while-ethminer-shows-mining-activity\n",

    "body": "GPU mining requires OpenCL libraries to be installed for your specific video card. That's a prerequisite and not something we could bundle up into our own source.\n\nYou can always ever use a graphics card for one purpose at a time: either display something, or have it crunch something. If the card is doing some OpenCL calculation, it cannot work on display, so you'll see your screen \"freeze\" until the calculation is done. If the calculation is a shorted burst repeated very frequently, then it might just seem \"stuttery\", but you get the picture where this issue comes from. A popular solution is to have an integrated graphics card power the display, and the dedicated one do OpenCL crunching.\n\nRegarding the hashrate, I think it's a long standing issue though not one of particular importance since the miner itself should report its hashrate already, and you don't really have any useful way to programatically react to it. Lastly as the long term goal is proof-of-stake, mining in general has a little less priority (as long as it works properly of course, which currently it seems to do).\n",
