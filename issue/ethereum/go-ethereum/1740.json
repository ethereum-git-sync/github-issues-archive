For example\nfrom, to, value in a contractTx array\n",

    "body": "This is not something that will change anytime soon (if at all). Add functionality to ethereum by programming the contract rather they expansion of the protocol or client them self. \n\nAs @maran already correctly stated is that you could/should use the `LOGn` opcode (`event`s in solidity) to store certain events about your program's state or actions.\n\nEthereum only stores that which is part of the conensus protocol and no additional \"user info\". It's all up to the contract to store (and pay for!) any additional information it wishes to store and thus making it part of the consensus protocol (all clients must agree on the data and events).\n",
