  "body": "Howdy,\r\n\r\nMainly my feature request is about extensing the existing geth to allow easy copy of existing consensus algos and creating custom packages from which, for instance, to modify clique it would be awesome to be able to just drop in another folder with the same code, albeit various API endpoints renamed according to your new package.. also it would be extremely helpfull to be able to extend the existing headers to add custom header fields for use within the new consensus setup..\r\n\r\nI realise it is possible to so this but it does require a heck of a lot of modification and searching through multiple core files etc.. but its not intuitive at all and requires so much trial and error that it makes it unfeasible in the long term.... id settle tor being able to easily add a new header field though :)\r\n\r\nAlso would be handy to have web3 equivalent, or as close as, for various go commands, i know they exist and i do use them.... but ive to dig deep to find them.\r\n\r\nWilling to help out with implementing any documentation if we can open a direct line of contact ;)\r\n\r\n*written on my iphone XIII so excuse the spelling/grammar mistakes",
