    "body": "Ah, I see this is a duplicate of the other testnet issue. The reason why you see these errors it that there's some lone peer that seems to speak Morden, but it has a very bad internet connection and cannot keep up with sending you data in the rate that we request it. Currently we dynamically adapt to a remote peer's bandwidth capabilities (or at least try) at almost all message exchanges, but pulling the headers is still assumed to have some minimal bandwidth (otherwise it would take a really long time to sync up)... so if a peer is really _that_ slow, then better switch to someone else instead of wasting time (of course, if this peer is the _only one_ then there's a problem :)) ). This error should not happen (or very rarely) in a healthy network.\n",
