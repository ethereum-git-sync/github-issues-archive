    "body": "Based on the information you provided, it seems that there is a missing sync committee signature for the block at slot 6160347. This could potentially be a bug in the light client code.\r\n\r\nTo fix this issue, you may need to investigate the light client code to determine why the sync committee signature is missing. You can start by reviewing the code that is responsible for collecting and verifying the sync committee signatures, and checking for any potential bugs or errors.\r\n\r\nYou can also try running the light client code in a test environment and comparing the results to those obtained from the Beaconcha website. This may help you identify any discrepancies or errors in the code that are causing the missing sync committee signatures.\r\n\r\nOnce you have identified the cause of the issue, you can work on implementing a fix in the light client code. This may involve modifying the code to correctly collect and verify the sync committee signatures, or fixing any bugs or errors that are causing the issue.\r\n\r\nIt is also important to keep in mind that this issue may not be limited to just the block at slot 6160347, and that similar problems have been observed on multiple blocks. Therefore, it is important to thoroughly test and verify any changes you make to the code to ensure that they fix the issue across all affected blocks.\r\n\r\nOne potential solution to this problem could be to update the light client code to include additional error handling and logging capabilities. This would allow developers to more easily identify and diagnose issues like missing sync committee signatures, and could help to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the updated code could include additional checks to ensure that all required signatures are present and valid before processing a block. This could include checks for the sync committee signature, as well as other required signatures and attestations.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the updated code could include more detailed error messages and logging capabilities, which would allow developers to quickly identify and diagnose issues when they occur. This could include logging information about the missing signature, as well as any other relevant information about the block or the system.\r\n\r\nOverall, updating the light client code to include additional error handling and logging capabilities would help to improve the reliability and stability of the system, and would make it easier for developers to diagnose and fix issues like missing sync committee signatures.\r\n",
