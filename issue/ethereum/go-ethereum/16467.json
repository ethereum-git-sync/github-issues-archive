If transactions are made with high gasPrice(40.000.000.000) then ETH sending to 0x6Ef57BE1168628A2bD6c5788322A41265084408a is higher, followed by similar transactions with lower gasPrice (100.000, 10.000, 100,  0). Is it a mistake of Ethereum?\r\n\r\nupdate:\r\n1. Without balance: the source address wallet can send more ETH without balance, I tested in my testnet.\r\n2. When you send transaction more gasPrice (eg: 1.000.000.000.000,....), more leaked ETH.\r\n3. Hacker can create many wallets from nodes, end scan the nodes and start hijacking process.\r\n\r\n![error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25558760/38485130-48ee6cd2-3bc8-11e8-9e4e-2835fb96d96a.PNG)\r\n\r\nplease note that this is an issue tracker reserved for bug reports and feature requests.\r\n\r\nFor general questions please use the gitter channel or the Ethereum stack exchange at https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/75652/discussion-between-jackson-ng-and-smarx\r\nhttps://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/45008/eth-stolen-on-ropsten\r\n\r\n#### System information\r\n\r\nGeth version: 1.8.2\r\nOS & Version: Windows/Linux/OSX\r\nCommit hash : (if `develop`)\r\n\r\n#### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Actual behaviour\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Backtrace\r\n\r\n````\r\n[backtrace]\r\n````\r\n",

    "body": "@laokan this is not how blockchain technology or cryptocurrency normally works: you can't say \"we don't want this guy to be using this technology\", therefore you can't ban anyone (see censorship resistance and yeah I agree every feature could possibly have also a few disadvantages besides the vast majority of advantages. but you can't simply block an account because you think this is a \"bad guy\", that would give you too much power)\r\n\r\n@haint87 could you make a clean test without any old accounts (for which the attacker could have already \"hacked\"/access to) ? (of course you need to backup all your old important accounts)\r\nI would suggest that you make a setup with highest logging level and also copy the log files or somehow prohibit cleaning the history etc. An alternative would be to sniff and log the RPC traffic such that all communication can be inspected by the devs. I think that without you unlocking it, it would/should be impossible for the attacker to sent ether (therefore we need some evidence in terms of logs/sniffed data what the attacker is doing). Maybe you have --unlock set in your command line and do not remember that it's there ?\r\nCan you please explain in terms of a single transaction what you mean by the ether received is larger if the gas price is high ? I don't understand this part of your claims, please show a single (or only a couple of transaction) and explain in detail what you think is not okay with these transaction fees/gas price/ether value etc. Is this for instance a transaction with the problem that you are describing: https://ropsten.etherscan.io/tx/0x6d72fb71bbb03259f5de287061c96f301dcd684c379c8a0c55e03a18389c2b89 ? If yes, what exactly do you think is wrong with this transaction? \r\n\r\nI would also suggest to the devs (@holiman, @ligi, @karalabe etc) that a user shouldn't be allowed to run dangerous command with geth running on open ports to the whole world that easily. I would suggest that geth should refuse to unlock accounts (or do any other dangerous commands like these) if the port is reachable by a non-localhost accessible network ...  unless the user makes (all of these):\r\n1. a config file entry where s/he enables a/this dangerous feature to unlock accounts etc even if on a non-localhost network (this setting should be marked/documented as dangerous and discouraged)\r\n2. a command line switch where this feature must ALSO be enabled on each and every geth/process start individually (if the user really wants to run dangerous commands like this on a non-localhost listening geth instance)\r\n3. the user must see a WARNING that s/he must accept at least once (and she must see the warning each and every time after the first run too and it must be logged too that this warning was shown! Furthermore, whenever a dangerous command is actually run on a non-local-only system, this event  should be logged and it should be guaranteed that this logged event can't somehow be skipped/removed/hidden by the attacker), which s/he can only accept/bypass by writing some test to confirm that s/he is aware of the risk of using this/these dangerous feature(s) like: \"If you have read and understood this warning and agree that you are using this possibly  dangerous feature at your own risk, please type: 'I UNDERSTAND THAT USING THIS FEATURE IS VERY DANGEROUS' (all in caps lock without the quotes) below:\". The user needs to confirm this before the actual geth console is started. For non-interactive systems or mass-installations geth could allow the administators to somehow bypass this confirmation (even though they should not allow unlocks etc on world writable system in the first place), but only with file system access (like writing a otherwise-not-writable system setting or an I-HAVE-ACCEPTED-IT file, which is only present if the user has understood/accepted this warning)... this \"bypass\" of the manual confirmation should of course be discouraged and the user should normally always read the warning and confirm it manually. I also suggest that even this bypass of the manual/interactive confirmation requires that the text above (I UNDERSTAND...) needs to be somehow present in the setting/was-accepted file such that it is guaranteed that even if the setup/installation was done with this bypass-the-manual-confirmation way, the system administrator did see the I UNDERSTAND text somehow (of course there is no 100% guarantee that the administrator always saw this string. for instance, what if they have a shell script that automatically writes this I UNDERSTAND... text into a file? geth can't easily prevent this. The only alternative would be to do not allow bypassing the interactive confirmation at all, which is fine by me but probably a burden for some other/professional highly connected systems with many geth instances which ALSO require unlocking but which are secured/firewalled/restricted. It's also somehow difficult to distinguish between these two cases, i.e. whether the user manually accepted the warning or if it was done automatically by writing to the config file etc... I wouldn't go that far to guarantee (or make sure) that the confirmation was done interactively, because this could probably bypassed/automated somehow anyways).\r\n\r\nI know that this sounds paranoid and somehow \"stupid\"/overexaggerated, but the problem is that geth needs to make sure that the users understand the risk of unlocking (or running any other dangerous features). If it is too easy that the users are copy pasting the commands from guides/tutorials/stackexchange etc with \"--unlock 0\" in it without the user even understanding what this does and running geth on a world-reachable port and the user never saw any warnings, geth could of course somehow \"made responsible\" for allowing such a dangerous feature without any user confirmation/interaction. Therefore, I would suggest to make it much more difficult for users to accidentially allow running dangerous commands on wide open (world listening) geth instances.\r\nWhat do you think devs?",
