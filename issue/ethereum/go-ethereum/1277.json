    "body": "I've also noticed this. There isn't any issue in by itself, the weird blocks are not downloaded by your machine but rather are propagated **to** your machine by remote nodes. Whether the propagating node is malicious or not I cannot tell (inclined to believe so because the block numbers are all the same with different hashes).\n\nHowever, I'll leave this issue open since I think it demonstrates the need to filter out very old propagated blocks even if they could otherwise be imported correctly into the chain. It should be the responsibility of the downloader to pull in large forks and not the propagation. Hopefully I can address this some time tomorrow.\n",
