    "body": "@phonikg thanks for the tip but i do not do well with sid too unstable for me.\nI believe my issue was with the fact that i installed golang with apt in addition to the manual with curl and update the bashrc instructions.\nIn result i had two versions of go the 1.0.2 by default and the 1.4.2 in /usr/local. \nEven after setting an alias to the 1.4.2 the build was still failing. So the uninstalled the apt one and followed your instructions.\nAnyway some one should update the install instructions of the repo (do not install golang with apt if you've already installed it manually).  \n",
