    "body": "@tgerring One reason why this could happen with automatic (chosen by geth) nonce values is that the way `xeth` assigns the nonce is inherently racy. It reads the nonce from the txpool's `ManagedState` and then submits the tx. If more than one request does this at the same time, they can assign the same nonce twice. I'm not saying that there should be a lock around tx submission, just noting because you might find this interesting.\n",
