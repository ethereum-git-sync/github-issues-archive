  "body": "Hi I want to use zeromq to communicate with the geth IPC socket, but zeromq doesn't really play nice with sockets that aren't zeromq sockets and I am having trouble figuring out the data encoding seems like it's in utf-16-be form not sure how to decode this for of bytes into JSON. Is it possible to have geth connect to a predefined socket instead of creating a new one, and also can the RPC response encoding be configured in someway. If possible I would use geth as a library to handle most of this stuff.",
