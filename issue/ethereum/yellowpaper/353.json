The double union seems to be defined as follows: take the union of all sets within a set, then the union of all elements of the output of this first union, in order to get the double union. In other words, the double union is the union of the union of all sets within a set.\r\n\r\nThe double union set binary operator is used on p. 30, opcode 0xf0, description column, line. 5.",
