  "body": "Reading critically the equations 1-2-3-4, the time, t, is not expressed correctly. It's also very confusing by designing the same, t, for transactions and blocks to express the future state.\r\n\r\nGiven a transaction, the most powerful system, Gamma, will change locally the state at time, t, to state, t+1 ( assuming that Gamma process the transaction in one unit of time).\r\nProcessing the second  transaction, the most powerful system, Gamma, will change locally the state at time, t+1, to state, t+2.\r\n\r\nLet's assume, we have, n transactions, state at time t+n+1 is defined. \r\n\r\nIn equation (2), the time, t+1, refers to this time  t+n+1. Equation (4) should take into consideration the described process. \r\n\r\nAll these elements will be introduced into the draft after a discussion?\r\n\r\n\r\n",
