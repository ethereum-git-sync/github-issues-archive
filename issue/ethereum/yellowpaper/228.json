  "body": "Currently, previous versions of the protocol are described in the body of the text together with the current one.  The description now involves case distinction based on block numbers.  As we repeat protocol modifications, the number of cases grow and clutter the equations.\r\n\r\nThis issue is about\r\n* creating an appendix that describes the historical changes and\r\n* removing description of older protocol versions from the main text\r\n\r\nI guess LaTeX references allow us to talk about specific equations in the new appendix.",
