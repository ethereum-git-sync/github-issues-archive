  "body": "The gas cost function C is defined in H.1 to be equal to C_call(...) when the instruction is either CALL, CALLCODE, or DELEGATECALL.\r\n\r\nBut the stack indices for CALL and DELEGATECALL are different, because DELEGATECALL doesn't include a value to be transferred.\r\n\r\nThis means that all the components of the C_call sum that make use of μ_s[2] are incorrect in the case of DELEGATECALL.\r\n\r\nPresumably μ_s[2] should be interpreted as 0 in the C_call function for DELEGATECALL, but in fact, μ_s[2] refers to the input offset of the call data.",
