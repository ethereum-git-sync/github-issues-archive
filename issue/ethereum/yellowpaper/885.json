  "body": "The `(77)` defines transaction's final state σ′ where both selfdestructed and empty-but-touched accounts are deleted. This is not how this is implemented in practice.\r\n\r\nWhat YP suggests is the following workflow:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfor tx in transactions:\r\n    execute(state, tx)\r\n    delete_selfdestructed(state)\r\n    delete_empty_but_touched(state)\r\n\r\napply_coinbase_reward()\r\napply_withdrawals()\r\n```\r\n\r\nPractical implementations are done as the following:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfor tx in transactions:\r\n    execute(state, tx)\r\n    delete_selfdestructed(state)\r\n\r\napply_coinbase_reward()\r\napply_withdrawals()\r\ndelete_empty_but_touched(state)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe difference is subtle: in case we apply 0 block reward or 0 withdrawal to an empty account this account will be deleted.",
