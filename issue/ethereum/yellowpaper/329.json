  "body": "- [x] Add [hyperref](url) with PR #345, which has moved to https://github.com/jamesray1/yellowpaper/commits/master, along with the second and last points below. \r\n- [ ] Use the hyperref package, e.g. add cross-references, change external links, etc., using the guides [here](https://mirror.aarnet.edu.au/pub/CTAN/macros/latex/contrib/hyperref/doc/manual.pdf), [here](https://mirror.aarnet.edu.au/pub/CTAN/macros/latex/contrib/hyperref/doc/manual.html#TBL-24), [here](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Labels_and_Cross-referencing#The_hyperref_package) and [here](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Hyperlinks). The first looks like it's the most comprehensive.\r\n- [ ] Add a glossary of all symbols. Issues #272 & #23.\r\n- [ ] Add table of contents. Issue #292\r\n- [ ] Section and paragraph numbers. Issue #319\r\n- [ ] Add an index. Issue #272\r\n- [ ] Reread and where necessary, add clarifications e.g. with examples, footnotes, rewording to avoid ambiguity, etc.\r\n\r\nI want to emphasise the importance of having good, clear documentation for Ethereum so that people who are looking to help with development, like myself, can get up to speed more quickly. At the moment, reading through it there is a lot of scrolling back and forth. For points that take a long time to understand and have to be re-read multiple times, it might be good to have examples, footnotes, etc.",
