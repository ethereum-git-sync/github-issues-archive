  "body": "When mining for Ethereum, even if there are no transactions, blocks and even more uncles are created roughly every minute. . Once people start using Ethereum not all blocks will be empty, but (especially in the start) many of them will be... Although empty blocks aren't very big (~200 bytes) the total of 60_24_365 adds up per year to ~100MB and that is without uncles.\n\nFor empty blocks only the following contain new unique information:\n- `parentHash`\n- `unclesHash` (can be empty string in case there are no uncles)\n- `coinbase`\n- `timestamp`\n- `nonce`\n- `hash`\n\nThe rest can all either be derived or retrieved from parent\n- `number` (parent+1)\n- `difficulty` (calculated based on parent + timestamp)\n- `minGasLimit` (hardcoded to `10000000000000`)\n- `gasLimit` (calculated based on parent & no `gasUsed`)\n- `gasUsed` (because 0 transactions)\n- `stateRoot` (same as parent)\n- `transactionsTrie` (same as parent)\n- `extraData` (currently not used and not defined)\n\nA reduction in storage and network traffic could be implemented for these empty blocks by replacing these items with a single `isEmpty` flag.\n",
