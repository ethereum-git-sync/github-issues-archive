  "body": "With the current way transaction fees are awarded, a miner can include spam transactions in the blockchain at no cost (since all that he spends to create them is rewarded back to himself right away).\n\nThis is a separate issue from #15: #15 exacerbates this problem by making it possible even for a \"poor\" miner to spam the blockchain. Even if that were solved, a rich enough miner (or a collusion of miners) can spam the blockchain.\n\nAs a possible solution, we could \"delay\" the mining rewards.\nFor example:\n- Add a new information in the block header (let's call it `reward`) which starts with a value of 0 in the genesis block\n- When mining, compute the amount of ether that has been spent in gas fees in this block (let's call it `fee`)\n- Reward the miner with `a * reward + b * fee` ether (where `a` and `b` are predetermined numbers between 0 and 1)\n- Recalculate reward: `reward = reward + fee - (a * reward + b * fee)`\n\nThis way the transaction rewards get partially \"diluted\" in future blocks, making it more taxing for an evil miner to include spam transactions in the block he is mining.\n",

Secondly; don't forget you have to be very rich to \"spam\" in one block (+ block gas limit you have to take in to consideration).\n\nEDIT: A larger issue is if the miner had 51% of the network power in which case you could spam in multiple blocks. But we'll have larges issues if there's a 51% attack. \n",
