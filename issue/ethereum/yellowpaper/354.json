  "body": "A phrase in the second last para. of p. 21 is rather hard to read:\r\n> the ceiling of the number of words in size that the memory must be over the current number of words, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_i$\r\n\r\nI think this paragraph and the next relate to formula 225, as well as formula 224.\r\n\r\nBut if it does relate to formula 225 (as well as more obviously, formula 224), note that the definition in the paragraph doesn't quite match up with the formula. The text says \"the maximum of 0 & the ceiling of the number...\", but the formula contains max(s, ceiling(f+l)/32)).\r\n\r\nNote that the second paragraph corresponds to the first line of the piecewise function in formula 225.\r\n\r\nI assume that s = size of the current number of words in memory = mu_i, as is used e.g. in opcodes 0x37, 39, 3c, 51â€“53. Similarly, I assume that f = the first stack item that is actively used in memory, and l = the last stack item that is actively used in memory (in the current environment/program cycle/execution). Perhaps this section could be clarified in a PR?",
