  "body": "Currently only the latest version of the YellowPaper (built based on Master branch) is available for easy download. In order to have access to prev. versions (according to `BRANCES.md` file) one needs to clone the repo, install additional LaTeX tools (~2GB of data) & work through to make their target version available.\r\n\r\nI believe simply maintaining a pdf version of previous versions under this repo (maybe in some `dist` category or the same `build` dir) could make the process much much easier at a very low cost. Some researchers may need to refer to prev. versions for research/historical reasons.",
