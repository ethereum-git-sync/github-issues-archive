But it won't be updated by the Ethereum Foundation, for good reason, due to using the KVM,  \"the first fully executable formal semantics of the EVM\", but can be kept as is for historical purposes, or updated by the community e.g. from my repo.",

  "body": "There are many open PRs and  issues for this repo. Furthermore, the Byzantium EIPS have not even been added to the yellow paper, which means that it is technically also outdated. It would be good to get the yellow paper up-to-date, very readable and reliable. Something else that would be worth doing is to have online modules like Pydocs. Using hyperlinks in LaTeX PDF is not as efficient for reading or writing as modules on a website. Therefore I would like permission from @gavofyork for the public to take the content of the yellow paper and develop into online docs, like on readthedocs, while incorporating Byzantium and future EIPS. I believe I need your permission as the license for this repo is, by default, all rights reserved.\r\n\r\nThis will help anyone who wants to learn in detail about Ethereum, which will be helpful for dapp and core development, and thus help Ethereum. While improving scalability is a high priority, having good documentation is arguably more important as it will help others to contribute to development, and thus accelerate the growth of Ethereum. Additionally by having online docs one can link to a specific section which would be useful for instance for answering questions in Gitter, Ethereum stack exchange, Reddit, Twitter, etc., or providing  supporting evidence for research, articles and blog posts. It will also help potentially would-be investors to more easily make an informed decision. Thus, having better documentation is essential for the continued growth of Ethereum. ",
