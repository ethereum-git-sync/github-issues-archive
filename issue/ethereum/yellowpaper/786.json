This process is described in detail in section \\ref{ch:ghost}.\r\n\r\nHowever, it appears Ethereum has never used any version of GHOST: https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/38121/why-did-ethereum-abandon-the-ghost-protocol.  Furthermore, the referenced section goes on to explain that Ethereum uses the total difficulty along the chain (no uncles used) to pick the \"heaviest\" chain.\r\n\r\n",
