  "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI have read that an account is created by generating a public and private key-pair. This would be totally locally, so no update on the blockchain would be necessary.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the yellow paper it says, that accounts have an associated balance which is stored on the network. \r\n\r\nBut when I locally generate such a pair, the blockchain is not modified and so I do not have an account yet. Does this mean, the balance of an address is first recorded when the address receives money?\r\n\r\nI guess so but unfortunately I couldn't find a reliable source stating that which I need for my bachelor thesis.\r\n\r\nAm I correct and if, can anyone supply me with a source? \r\n\r\nThank you :)",
