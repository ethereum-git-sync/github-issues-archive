Better to use the following:\n\n (w =JUMP ∧ µs[0] not in D(Ib)) V (w =JUMPI ∧ µs[1] != 0 ∧ µs[0] not in D(Ib)) ... if µs[1] = 0, JUMPI is just shifting the pc by one, and it should be an opcode not data assuming that pc+1 is less than the total number of opdodes in Ib.\n\n --^^-- comes to: \n\n(w =JUMP ∧ µs[0] not in D(Ib)) V (w =JUMPI ∧ µs[1] != 0 ∧ µs[0] not in D(Ib)) V (w =JUMPI ∧ µs[1] = 0 ∧ pc+1 > Ic|) \n\nAlso is the coding of JUMPI used µs[1]?\n\nImplicitly the condition related to µs[1] is tested in \"if (m_stack[m_stack.size() - 2])\", is this robust?\n\ncase Instruction::JUMPI:\n        if (m_stack[m_stack.size() - 2])\n            nextPC = verifyJumpDest(m_stack.back(), m_jumpDests);\n        m_stack.pop_back();\n        m_stack.pop_back();\n        break;\n",
