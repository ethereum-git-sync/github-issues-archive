  "body": "Several official tools working with the Ethereum blockchain implement a hard coded list of fund transfer, triggered upon reception of block 1920000.\n\nThese transfers are not part of the specification and thus these tools are not conform to the current protocol, as they create a world state that cannot be reached from the previous world state without the outside knowledge of the exact list of fund transfers.\n\nA third party creating a tool based on the specification would not be able to interoperate with the official clients.\n\nAs these tools are the de-facto standard, the Yellow Paper should probably be updated to reflect it and describe the ad-hoc world state change that has to take place at block 1920000 in order for the blockchain to be valid afterwards. \n",
