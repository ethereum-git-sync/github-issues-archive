  "body": "The `Appendix E.1: Trie Database`  subsection has this quote:\n\n``` latex\nwe simply define the identity function mapping the key-value set $\\mathfrak{I}$ to a 32-byte hash and assert that only a single such hash exists for any $\\mathfrak{I}$, which though not strictly true is accurate within acceptable precision.\n```\n\nThe assertion that this is not strictly true puzzles me, because I currently believe that `\\texttt{\\small TRIE}(\\mathfrak{I})` is defined deterministically in terms of the input and all of its building blocks: `n`, `c`, `HP`, `RLP`, and `SHA3`.\n\nIf that assumption is true, then only a single such hash exists for any `\\mathfrak(I)` without qualifiers, correct?\n\nMy guess is that the statement's logic is switched, or I am misreading it, and it is alluding to the fact that for a given a 256-bit hash value there are an infinite number of `\\mathfrak(I)` inputs for which `\\texttt{\\small TRIE}(\\mathfrak{I})` evaluates to that 256-bit value, but that practically this is not a problem due to `SHA3` collision resistance.\n\nMaybe the paper would benefit from another sentence clarifying what is meant by \"acceptable precision\" - if it's alluding to collision resistance, then it could explicitly state so.  If there is some non-determinism in `\\texttt{\\small TRIE}(\\mathfrak{I})` it should _definitely_ make that clear.\n",
