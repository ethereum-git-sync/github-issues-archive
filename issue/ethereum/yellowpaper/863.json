  "body": "In the description of the CALL and CREATE instructions on page 37, formulas for \\mu'_g are given. However, they seem wrong to me. To my understanding, these definitions would mean that calling an externally-owned account or creating a contract with empty initialization code would essentially be free operations, as no code would need to be executed and hence the formulas would then be equivalent to \\mu'_g = \\mu_g. Clearly, they modify the global state, which should be priced accordingly. So either there is something wrong with these definitions or maybe I am missing something?",

    "body": "It seems like \\mu_g sometimes refers to the amount of gas after deducting the intrinsic cost of the operation, while other times it refers to the amount of gas before that deduction, an issue which has already been discussed in https://github.com/ethereum/yellowpaper/issues/325. This causes the possible interpretation given in this issue. Hence, this issue is probably a duplicate of https://github.com/ethereum/yellowpaper/issues/325.",
