  "body": "[EIP-2200] changes the dynamic cost of `SSTORE` to refund some gas when\r\nsetting a storage location to its original value: i.e., the value to\r\nwhich it would be set if the transaction reverted. But the yellow paper\r\nstill defines `C_{SSTORE}` only in terms of whether the storage location\r\nis being set/reset to zero.\r\n\r\nI poked around at adding this, but couldn't find prior art for notation\r\nabout the original state. Something like `\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^0`?\r\n\r\nIt would at least be helpful to have a note in English referring the\r\nreader to EIP-2200 for more details, as we do for `CREATE2` (EIP-1014).\r\n\r\nEIP-2200 also changed the cost of `SLOAD`, but this is already handled\r\nthanks to #783, since EIP-1884 made the same change.\r\n\r\n[EIP-2200]: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2200\r\n",
