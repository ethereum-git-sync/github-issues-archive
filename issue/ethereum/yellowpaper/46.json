  "body": "What if a malicious miner puts a very high timestamp in his block header. The block should still be valid, since the only condition in the YP is timestamp > timestamp of parent block.  Now he can continue to mine with his wrong clock and all the other miners will always fail on this condition. What is the current solution to this problem? Is it enough to specifiy something in the network protocol for time syncing between peers, or do we need to have something in the YP?\n",
