  "body": "The yellowpaper describes MPT keys as being fixed-depth, i.e. \"256-bit binary fragments\". If that's accurate, then it seems a branch node can never contain a value, as its key would necessarily be shorter than those of values descending from a child.\r\n\r\n~~If that's correct, then to be consistent and avoid confusion, I think the YP should either~~\r\n- ~~Describe MPTs as they're actually used: each key is 256 bits, and branches do not contain values, but for historical reasons there's an unused value field in a branch node's RLP.~~\r\n- ~~Describe the more general MPT construction with variable-length keys. In this case I think 256-bit keys should not be mentioned, or it could be framed like \"in practice, currently all MPTs have 256-bit keys\".~~\r\n\r\nSee also: [Do storage MPT branch nodes contain values?](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/98572/do-storage-mpt-branch-nodes-contain-values)\r\n\r\nEdit: after poking around some implementations, it seems keys are not fixed-length, so branch nodes may have values. My understanding now is that keys are 256 bits for the state and storage tries, but variable-length for the receipt and transactions tries. If that's correct, it seems the description of MPT keys as \"256-bit binary fragments\" is misleading and should be changed.",
