  "body": "For formula 68, if Tt=∅, it uses the formula Λ(σ0,S(T),To,g,Tp,Tv,Ti,0), but Λ is a symbol that is used for logical conjunction [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mathematical_symbols), which doesn't really make sense in this context, unless you assume that an argument is false if and only if it is equal to 0, but you don't want the output to evaluate to true or false, you want it to evaluate to the tuple representing the tuple of the post-execution provisional stateσP, remaining gas g and substate A. Similarly, Θ is used [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mathematical_symbols) to mean the symmetric difference operator, which is not a function. Note that the paper does return other results for Λ and Θ, but doesn't seem to define the functions, just the input parameters. But maybe I need to read it more carefully. At any rate, given that these functions occur for the first time, they should be referenced to what they are or where they are defined.\r\n\r\nNevermind, I think I get it. The LHS can be considered to be the output of the function (or the equivalent of it). The output is also defined in the statement preceding the equation.",
