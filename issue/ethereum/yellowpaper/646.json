  "body": "On [line 1060](https://github.com/ethereum/yellowpaper/blob/master/Paper.tex#L1060), it mentions:\r\n\r\n> The longer the path, the greater the total mining effort that must have been done in order to arrive at the leaf.\r\n\r\nThis is not accurate. It is approximately accurate. But since avoiding forks is such an important concept, we should be much more clear here.\r\n\r\nHere is an example that demonstrates the statement is incorrect.\r\n\r\nThe current mainnet block is 5144488. If I fork at block 2000000 and then mine a few blocks slowly wont this change the difficulty level. Eventually I could get up to 5144488 with less mining effort than mainline. That seems to contradict the statement in the text.",

    "body": "I see that uncles can be combined into the current chain if they are within the past 6 generations.\r\n\r\nBut for a new client syncing from scratch... if they would pick the longest chain then I could peer with them and advertise a longer chain than official. And I could do it with with much less resources than a 51% attack.\r\n\r\nI just start at the genesis block and mine at D_0 difficulty. Then when getting closer to current time I make blocks at smaller intervals. The result is I easily get my block count close to mainline and then blow past it in the end.\r\n\r\nEnd result: my pirate chain gets accepted if that yellow paper is followed exactly.\r\n\r\nFix is easy: evaluate the total difficulty of all blocks, not just the height.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nAlso, I see equations 43 and 44 both define X.
