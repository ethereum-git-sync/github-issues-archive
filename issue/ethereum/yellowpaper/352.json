  "body": "In opcode 0xf0, CREATE, on p. 30, in l. 3 of the description, part of the condition states: \"I_e < 1024\".\r\n\r\nWhen I look at the definition of I_e on p. 11, in the last item in the list in the top of col. 1, it states:\r\n> I_e,   the  depth  of  the  present  message-call  or contract-creation  (i.e.   the  number  of CALLs  or CREATEs being executed at present).\r\n\r\nFor me, these two points (I_e < 1024 and the defintion) is slightly confusing. Based on I_e < 1024, I can ascertain that I_e is measured in bytes. Thus, unless I am mislead, I suggest that the definition be changed to:\r\n> I_e,   the  depth  **in bytes** of  the  present  message-call  or contract-creation  (i.e.   the  number  of CALLs  or CREATEs being executed at present).\r\n\r\nHowever, this may be obvious since the variable is in the execution environment so all data will be in bytes. So for clarity, the list could be prepended with a note, e.g.: \"Note that all of the following variables are in bytes. Then again, this may be obvious, so it may not be necessary. ",
