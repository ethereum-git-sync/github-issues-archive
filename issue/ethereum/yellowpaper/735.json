  "body": "From a suggestion by Péter Szilágyi.\r\n\r\n> Can we please delete section 12.2 (Random Numbers) from the #Ethereum yellow paper? At least drop the \"unknowable\" part. It's been proven time and time again that random numbers based on block hashes are useless (proxy contract can forward a tx on favorable outcome only).\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/jemenger/status/1110975901544517632\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAt line 1244:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/yellowpaper/blob/master/Paper.tex#L1244\r\n\r\n> Providing random numbers within a deterministic system is, naturally, an impossible task. However, **we can approximate with pseudo-random numbers by utilising data which is generally unknowable at the time of transacting**. Such data might include the block's hash, the block's timestamp and the block's beneficiary address. In order to make it hard for malicious miners to control those values, one should use the {\\small \\hyperlink{blockhash}{BLOCKHASH}} operation in order to use hashes of the previous 256 blocks as pseudo-random numbers. For a series of such numbers, a trivial solution would be to add some constant amount and hashing the result.\r\n",
