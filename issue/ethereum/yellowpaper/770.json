  "body": "The Appendix F (\"Signing Transactions\") spells out the use of recoverable ECDSA signatures, but doesn't mention how nonces are computed or included.\r\n\r\nIn particular, this creates a couple of minor problems:\r\n\r\n- `ECDSASIGN` is *not* a function unless the nonce is supplied, so the text is incorrect\r\n- the supplied reference \\[Johnson 2001\\] suggests that nonces be computed randomly, but the Go Ethereum client uses RFC 6979 deterministic signatures. One might argue that this is a choice left to the client, or one might consider it part of the specification (in particular, using deterministic nonces removes the possibility of a class of errors); either way, I think readers would benefit from a sentence of discussion",
