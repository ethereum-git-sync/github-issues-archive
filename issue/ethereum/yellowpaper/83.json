  "body": "https://github.com/ethereum/yellowpaper/blob/master/Paper.tex#L1816\n\nWhen a push operation requires more bytes than exists in the code, the \"c\" function ensures bytes default to zero. The function is defined as applied to an index, but then it's used on an index range in definitions of PUSH2-32 instructions.\n\nIf the meaning is to map c over the range, then the program\n0x7f010203 would be equal to 0x7f0102030000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\n\nThe Go client does not implement the above behavior; rather it considers\n0x7f010203 equal to\n0x7f0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000010203\n\nThe behavior of the \"c' function on index ranges should be formalized.\n",
