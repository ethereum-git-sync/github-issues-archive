  "body": "I've some questions regarding my understanding of the paper's notation and wasn't sure where to post them.  Therefore, let me know if there's a better forum to direct my questions.\r\n\r\nThe paper begins with the following:\r\n(1) **σ<sub>t+1</sub> ≡ Υ(σ<sub>t</sub>, T)**\r\nwhere **σ<sub>t</sub>** represents the current canonical state (version) of the Ethereum World and **T** represents a transaction to be applied to this state.  Once applied by **Y**, **T** yields a new World state.\r\n\r\nSoon after defining the above, the paper describes block-finalization by\r\n(2) **σ<sub>t+1</sub> ≡ Π(σ<sub>t</sub>, B)**\r\nSince **B** is substituted for **T**, the above represents **B** as a Transaction.\r\n(3) **B ≡ (...,(T<sub>0</sub>, T<sub>1</sub>, ...))**\r\nThis defines **B** as containing components some being transactions: **(T<sub>0</sub>, T<sub>1</sub>, ...)** while other components **\"...,\"** aren't defined.  I believe this definition casts **B** as an aggregate Transaction.\r\n\r\n(4) **Π(σ, B) ≡ Ω(B, Υ(Υ(σ, T<sub>0</sub>), T<sub>1</sub>)...)**\r\nIn this equation, **B** on the right hand side becomes **σ<sub>t</sub>** suggesting **B** represents the current canonical state (version) of the Ethereum World.  While its aggregated transactions **Υ(Υ(σ, T<sub>0</sub>), T<sub>1</sub>)...** are substituted for **T**.\r\n\r\nSo here are my questions:\r\n\r\n- In (4) above, **B** presents a duality:  it seems both an aggregate Transaction and the current canonical state (version) **σ<sub>t</sub>** of Ethereum.  Is this true?\r\n- When applying  **Υ(Υ(σ, T<sub>0</sub>), T<sub>1</sub>)...)** the answer is **σ<sub>t</sub>** where **<sub>t</sub>** represents number of transactions in B. Therefore, rewriting (4) generates:\r\n **Π(σ, B) ≡ Ω(B, σ<sub>t</sub>)**\r\n Does (4) violate (1) where **B** should represent **σ<sub>t</sub>** and **σ<sub>t</sub>** should represent a Transaction?\r\n\r\nPerhaps (4) could be written as:\r\n\r\n**(4) Π(σ<sub>t</sub>, B) ≡ Ω( Y<sub>n</sub>(... (Υ<sub>1</sub></sub>(Υ<sub>0</sub>(σ<sub>t=0</sub>, T<sub>t=0</sub>), T<sub>t=1</sub>) ,... ) ,T<sub>t=n</sub>) ,R)**\r\n\r\nWhere **R** represents the rewards Transaction issued to a nominated party.\r\n\r\nThanks for any insight you can offer.\r\n\r\n",
