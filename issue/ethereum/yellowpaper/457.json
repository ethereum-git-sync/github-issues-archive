  "body": "> A formal proof or derivation is a finite sequence of sentences, each of which is an axiom, an assumption, or follows from the preceding sentences in the sequence by a rule of inference. The last sentence in the sequence is a theorem of a formal system. \r\n> -- <cite>Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, 2nd ed.</cite>\r\n\r\nThe word \"formal\" or one of its derivations is used 55 times in the _Yellowpaper,_ but it's frequently  unclear why or how equations, when invoked correspond with formal proofs. A formal proof is made up of a list of **axiomatic statements** which, when taken together, provide the foundation for some **theorematic statement(s)** that derive from the truth of those axioms. If axiomatic base-statements are proven to be false, then the theorems resulting from them cannot be true. If these axiomatic statements do not exist or are unclear, then no theorem exists, ergo _**no formal proof**_ exists.\r\n\r\nThe Yellowpaper as it stands does not clearly document its own formal in a way that makes them clear for the reader. On the contrary, it expands them arbitrarily throughout. This would not be such a problem if the symbolic mathematics invoked were clear and unambiguous in spite of being difficult. But the ad-hoc algebraic alphabet makes it more challenging than it needs to be simply because definitions, notations, and axioms are not laid out in clear order for the reader, giving them one-by-one _**before being taken**_ for granted as evidence of proofs.\r\n\r\nThere are many ways to address this. The first and most obvious way would be to clearly distinguish axiomatic statements and theorematic statements, and clearly distinguish formal proofs  from mere formal assertions. Formal assertions that serve as tautologies may not need to be stated at all, or if they do, they can be footnoted or drawn up in appendices. There should be for the readers a clear set of formal proofs (whichever ones are necessary to prove the ground-breaking concept(s) on which the _Ethereum World Computer_ is based,) and everything else (notwithstanding arrays, stack functions, or other computer operations that need to be represented symbolically) can and should be written in plain English.\r\n\r\nFor particularly complicated proofs, visual aids can be used (see e.g. [this screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/bUOC3) from Donald Knuth's _The Art of Computer Programming_,) but are not necessary.

    "body": "Right you are @pirapira ; but if they're properly defined you will be able to use them in infinitely many proofs. If they're improperly defined you won't be able to use them in any proofs, which defeats the whole purpose of obtaining the mathematical specificity that James mentioned earlier. \r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n**Axiom:**  `lowercase Greek Sigma (σ) is equivalent to Ethereum's Global State`\r\n**Axiom:**  `uppercase Greek Upsilon (𝚼) is equivalent to Ethereum's State Transition Function`\r\n**Theorem:**  `σₜ₊₁   ≡   𝚼(σₜ, T) is equivalent to a Valid State Transition`\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the logic that confronts us in section 2. The only problem is though it seems like a solid theorem, it's not, it's actually just another axiom (it's not relevant that the words \"theorem\" and \"axiom\" are never used, because they are implied and assumed in the algebra) which leaves us with:\r\n\r\n\r\n**Axiom:**  `lowercase Greek Sigma (σ) is equivalent to Ethereum's Global State`\r\n**Axiom:**  `uppercase Greek Upsilon (𝚼) is equivalent to Ethereum's State Transition Function`\r\n~~**Theorem:**~~ **Axiom:** `σₜ₊₁   ≡   𝚼(σₜ, T) is equivalent to a Valid State Transition`\r\n\r\n\r\n...and we begin to see the crest of the problem: The equations and formal alphabet in the Yellowpaper, taken together, are a list of unsorted, unproven, yet nevertheless asserted, axiomatic statements. Don't you agree that that's a problem, when the whole point of a formal specification is to stringently demand exactness of language and meaning from every page? I'm only suggesting that the reader be taken through the steps of something resembling a proof instead of having to suspend disbelief and assume that every equation \"just works\" in the purely general terms they are given. If generalities are called for in a paper like this, I agree with @jamesray1 that natural language is more than adequate for the job.",

Additionally I could make a PR to add a link to Wikipedia's list of mathematical symbols, but eventually for better readability there should be a glossary with hyperlinks. #551. Once you are familiar with the symbols, it's easier to read and re-read.\r\n\r\nYou can have formal definitions without formal proofs.\r\n\r\nI think if there are going to be proofs, then they would be for abstract things, such as a theorem for Turing completeness, and axioms/sub-theorems for properties of Turing completeness. But this isn't a high priority in my opinion, as Ethereum has already been implemented in different Turing complete programming languages with [several clients](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Clients).\r\n\r\nNote that in section 2, those definitions are soon going to link to later definitions with #535.",
