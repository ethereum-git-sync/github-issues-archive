There has to be a \"more understandable presentation.\" I agree wholeheartedly with that.\r\n\r\nThe \"lower 11 bits\" part just means take a modulo 2048.  2 raised to 11 is 2048, so looking at the lower 11 bits gives you modulo 2048.\r\n\r\nThe paris [0,1] [2,3][4,5] are pairs of bytes that you look at as integers which represent (modulo 2048) the bit position to 'twiddle.' (turn on).\r\n\r\nFor each pair, convert to an integer, x, then modulo by 2048 (so you don't shift past the end of the filter) and then shift a 'true' bit that many positions to the left: (1 << (x % 2048)).",
