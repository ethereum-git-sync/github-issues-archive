  "body": "While I see that Appendix G is referred to first in the body of the paper, so should appear before Appendix H, it seems that in order to really understand Appendix G, you need to understand Appendix H first. Moreover, in Appendix H, it defines the gas cost before the instruction subsets, which are in turn defined before the instruction sets. While I know that definitions can be recursive, since you need to understand the instructions before you can understand the instruction subsets, both of which need to be understood before being able to fully understand the gas costs, why not have them written in the order by which they need to be understood (instructions first, then subsets, then the gas costs). Then again, for some instructions, you do need to understand functions like some of the gas fees and the expanded memory function, so I guess it's difficult to say which should go first. I guess that cross-referencing will help.",
