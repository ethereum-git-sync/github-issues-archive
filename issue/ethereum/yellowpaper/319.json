Current equation numbers would need renumbered to fit  new scheme.\r\n\r\nThis sort of sectioning is desirable because the Yellowpaper constitutes post-graduate level work, and people will need to have deep and serious talks about particular paragraphs both in isolation, as well as in the context of other particular paragraphs, without having to count them and try to find where their teacher/friend/instructor is directing them to.\r\n\r\nThis would also make teaching the yellowpaper significantly more doable and productive, as more descriptive parts of the paper could be zero'd in on in a class, in favor of less descriptive parts, the less descriptive parts being read for contextual help, or deeper understanding, but not stimying teaching efforts at the expense of main points and concepts.",
