  "body": "While working on improving the strictness of the RLP decoder in\ngo-ethereum (ethereum/go-ethereum#711), a few questions have popped up:\n## Minimal Size\n\nIn any context (also for non-scalars), the following encodings \nare invalid because their size is not minimal:\n\n| non-canonical encoding | should be |\n| --- | --- |\n| 8102 | 02 |\n| B800 | 80 |\n| B90000 | 80 |\n| BA0002FFFF... | B902FFFF... |\n\n**The paper doesn't seem to resolve this ambiguity. Should it?**\n## Encoding of fixed-size values\n\nSome ethereum values (such as addresses) have a fixed bit width.\ngo-ethereum currently accepts byte arrays of smaller size and pads the\nresulting value with zero bytes.\n\nExample: when decoding into `[20]byte`, the input `8101` would be accepted and\nwould produce `{1, 0, 0, 0, ...}` as the result.\n\n**Should the encoding of fixed size types be restricted so the full number\nof bytes must be encoded?**\n",

    "body": "I believe that this could be indeed closed.\r\n\r\nThe YP defines the encoding function RLP in eqs. (179), (180), etc., and with that, implicitly, the set of valid encodings as the image of that function (excluding \\varnothing). Anything outside that set (e.g. 8102, B800, etc.) cannot be produced by the encoding function, and thus is not a valid encoding as defined.\r\n\r\nDecoding is implicitly defined as the inverse of encoding. A \"relaxed\" decoder that accepts 8102, B800, etc. would be a left inverse of encoding, but not a right inverse. It must reject those to be both a left and right inverse.\r\n\r\nJust for reference, here is a formally verified RLP decoder that I wrote in the ACL2 theorem prover:\r\n- https://github.com/acl2/acl2/blob/master/books/kestrel/ethereum/rlp/decoding-executable.lisp (code)\r\n- http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/manuals/current/manual/?topic=ETHEREUM____RLP-DECODING-EXECUTABLE (documentation)\r\n\r\n",
