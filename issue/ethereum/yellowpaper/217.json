    "body": "I suggest to not use Ethereum 1.0 to mean Frontier, to avoid confusing the term with PoW, non-stateless, non-sharding Ethereum. However, I would say that in both instances when it refers to Ethereum 1.0, the actual meaning of Ethereum 1.0 being full PoW Ethereum without stateless sharding can apply. \r\n\r\n> Two directions exist for ASIC resistance; firstly make it sequential memory-hard, i.e. engineer the function such that the determination of the nonce requires a lot of memory and bandwidth such that the memory cannot be used in parallel to discover multiple nonces simultaneously. The second is to make the type of computation it would need to do general-purpose; the meaning of ``specialised hardware''  for a general-purpose task set is, naturally, general purpose hardware and as such commodity desktop computers are likely to be pretty close to ``specialised hardware'' for the task. For Ethereum 1.0 we have chosen the first path.\r\n\r\n> Ethash is the PoW algorithm for Ethereum 1.0.\r\n\r\nPoW and Ethash is used not just in Frontier, but every release so far as well as planned in Constantinople.\r\n\r\nTherefore I suggest that we keep this as Ethereum 1.0, but explains what it means. You can do this without referring to future releases by simply saying that it is Ethereum with PoW. However, it would be helpful to give context and add what it doesn't include, such as no proof-of-stake and no stateless sharding.",

    "body": "Any comments on how to resolve this?\r\n\r\nIt seems like mentioning future protocol improvements in the specification is objectionable, so perhaps you can say: Ethereum 1.0 uses only PoW. However, to me, it just sounds vague to say this, without clarifying what the planned differences are in future versions, e.g. `Ethereum 1.0 uses only Proof of Work, whereas later versions will use \\href{https://github.com/ethereum/research/tree/master/papers}{Casper} Proof of Stake, initially as a block verification/finality gadget with PoW as the block proposal mechanism, then later with full PoS; as well as other improvements such as for scalability.` While this is more verbose, it will provide an introduction to readers, most of whom I suspect will at least be curious to learn a little about what future improvements to Ethereum will be. Additionally, this can all be as a footnote.",

It is planned that Serenity will be the start of Ethereum 2.0.\r\n\r\nWhat I suggest is that you define Ethereum 1.0 without referring to future versions as follows: `Ethereum 1.0 is all versions up until now of the Ethereum Virtual Machine specification as defined in this Yellow Paper, namely Frontier, Homestead, the DAO hard fork, Spurious Dragon, Tangerine Whistle and Byzantium, all of which are referred to \\href{https://github.com/ethereum/yellowpaper/blob/master/BRANCHES.md}{here}, and excluding the pre-releases prior to Frontier, known as Olympic.` Then when Metropolis is released we'll have to change this and branches.md to include that, and when Serenity is released we'll need to add `and excluding all versions from Serenity onwards`.\r\n\r\nDo you agree?",
