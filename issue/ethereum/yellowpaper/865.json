    "body": "@yperbasis awesome.  Is there anyone else from your team we should seek signoff from?  There's no work required from your end, we'd just like to get consent before making the POAPs available to your contributors.\r\n\r\nWe'll be awarding an annual contributor POAP to anyone who has had a PR merged in a given year.  They will be mintable by going to https://www.gitpoap.io/ & logging in with your GitHub account.  We're working on building some coordination tooling, funding mechanisms, etc on top of the GitPOAP record as well, we'll keep you guys posted.  Users can now also configure their digital resume/profile of sorts, ex: https://www.gitpoap.io/p/colfax.eth\r\n\r\nWe've put together this design, what do you think?  Happy to iterate on it if you have any feedback, or if it's good to go we'll proceed!  Looking at it now, I think we should change \"The Yellow Paper\" to \"Ethereum Yellow Paper\", we'll make that change.\r\n\r\n![telegram-cloud-photo-size-1-5031077519364827604-y](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/914240/176460331-a990dcb2-6d11-4a72-9c4d-1d4f204c0f82.jpg)\r\n",
