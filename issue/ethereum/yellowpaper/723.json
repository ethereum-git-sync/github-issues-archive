  "body": "In section 4.3.4 at equation 49 the PoW function is described as: \"The nonce, Hn, must satisfy the relations:  (...) (n, m) = PoW(Hn, Hn, d).  Where Hn is the new blockâ€™s header H, but without the nonce and mix-hash components\"\r\n\r\nIn section 11.5 at equation 175 we have \"More formally, the proof-of-work function takes the form of PoW: (...) (m,n) = PoW(Hn, Hn, d).\r\n\r\n**Is it (m,n) or (n,m)?**\r\n\r\nIn Appendix J near equation 319 \"With Hn being the hash of the header without the nonce\".\r\n\r\n**Does Hn have the mix-hash components removed or not?  Is it a block header or the hash of a block header?**\r\n\r\nAnd, perhaps not a documentation error but also near equation 319: \"The PoW-function returns an array with the compressed mix as its first item and the Keccak-256 hash of the concatenation of the compressed mix with the seed hash as the second item\"\r\n\r\n**Which one of these two terms is a number 'n' such that (n <= 2^256/Hd)?**\r\n\r\n",
