  "body": "### What is wrong?\r\n\r\nIt's a derivative metric from other metrics we are already showing, but I want to see messages per second as it is indicative of whether a peer we are connected to is *performing* well.  It might even be nice to have a full breakdown in the `trace` logging of individual command types.\r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed\r\n\r\nChange the reporting for peer details to look like:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nETHPeer  <Node(0x5669@127.0.0.1)>: alive=yes uptime=1m3s msgs=1234 (32/s) timeouts=245 most_rcvd=Transaction\r\n```\r\n\r\n- use `yes` and `no` instead of `true` and `false` since they are more concise.\r\n- need a new util to convert a `timedelta` into a nice human readable string.  \r\n- figure out the correct period for the messages/time metric.\r\n  - messages per second seems like it might create too small of numbers\r\n  - messages per minute might be very large\r\n- start tracking timeouts on peers.  Doesn't have to be perfect but we should be able to get close.\r\n\r\nIn addition, sort the peers by uptime, showing longest uptime first.",
