  "body": "### What is wrong?\r\n\r\nThe benchmarking tests are failing because of a dependency resolution error with `web3.py`'s `typing-extensions` dep. It's going to take a bit to get the dependencies resolved, and I want to get Arrow Glacier support in sooner than later. Performance is less important now than it was when trinity was using py-evm to be a mainnet client. I took out the benchmarking CI run in PR #2040. This test run has the dependency resolution chain: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/py-evm/2053/workflows/465fee73-0b8f-47b6-9ae9-7e45803c4dad/jobs/155952.\r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed\r\n\r\nLoosen `typing-extension` dependency restrictions in web3.py and then release. See: https://github.com/ethereum/web3.py/pull/2217\r\n",
