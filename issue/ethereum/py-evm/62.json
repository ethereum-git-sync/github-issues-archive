Currently, all of the `TRACE` and `logging.trace` level logging is simply normal python logging.\r\n\r\nThis issue is about the ability to generate debug information about EVM execution.  See https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Management-APIs#debug_traceblock for the format that go-ethereum uses.\r\n\r\nI had originally hoped that we could facilitate this via the python standard library `logging` APIs.  The idea was use something like [this API on the `logging.Filter` class](https://docs.python.org/3.5/howto/logging-cookbook.html#filters-contextual) to impart the contextual information about the EVM execution state (stack, memory, gas, etc).  Then we could use a special `logging.Handler` to extract the relevant logging statements and extract the data that way.\r\n\r\nI'm not set on this implementation plan, just on having some way to get EVM trace data from transaction and block execution.",

Fast sync just pulls headers and blocks, but doesn't actually process any of them. Then when it catches up, it requests all the state data from peers.\r\n\r\nYou could force a regular sync right away in code. There is no cmd line option to do it yet. One way to do it would be to start from a fresh db, and deleting all these lines: https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/blob/2a6f3cb2c8b3a795e0988b99f6c4564a80d4dcfe/trinity/sync/full/service.py#L39-L76\r\n\r\nLooks like that should skip straight to regular sync, though I haven't tried it.",
