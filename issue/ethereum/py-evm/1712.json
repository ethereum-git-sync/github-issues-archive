Under the state cleaning rules from [EIP-161](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-161) any account which is empty will be deleted, and should be treated as if it does not exist.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure whether this means that `account_exists` should always return the same things that `account_is_empty` would, but this feels like an easy source of bugs. All other instances of `account_exists` should be checked to see if they make the same mistake which was fixed here.",
