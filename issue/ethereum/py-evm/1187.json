  "body": "## Background\r\n\r\n`ethstats` is an Ethereum-specific, opt-in node status reporting service.\r\n\r\nThe original JavaScript implementation was developed by [Marian Oancea](https://github.com/cubedro) (@cubedro).\r\n\r\nThe server component is called [`eth-netstats`](https://github.com/cubedro/eth-netstats); it can be seen on [ethstats.net](https://ethstats.net/) (ETH main-net), [ropsten-stats.parity.io](https://ropsten-stats.parity.io/) (Ropsten test-net), and others, including private/development chains [via `puppeth`](https://medium.com/@gilangbhagaskara/create-a-private-ethereum-network-using-puppeth-2833c06f66ea).\r\n\r\nThe stand-alone client component is called [`eth-net-intelligence-api`](https://github.com/cubedro/eth-net-intelligence-api); this can be used with any node implementing a certain sub-set of Ethereum's JSON-RPC queries required by `e-n-i-a`.\r\n\r\n(An alternative approach - taken, for example, by [`geth`](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum), - is implementing a client as a sub-service in the node itself.)\r\n\r\nClient-server communication happens over WebSockets.\r\n\r\nThis issue is about implementing the functionality in `trinity`, preferably as a plug-in.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n`e-n-i-a` is by now mostly unmaintained; it also expects features that `trinity` does not currently have, like a JSON-RPC-over-HTTP interface, as well as certain JSON-RPC queries (e.g. subscriptions to\r\n\"new block\" events).\r\n\r\nInstead of trying to \"fix\" that, it \"would be nice\" to have this as a plug-in. This eliminates the need for JSON-RPC-over-HTTP (which is itself well-suited to be a plug-in), and allows using internal APIs (event\r\nsubscriptions, timers, etc.).\r\n\r\nThe plug-in APIs in `trinity` are unstable; this work will help produce a \"demo\" of what it takes to write a `trinity` plug-in, as well as shape the APIs themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Inputs\r\n\r\nThese are listed \"for information purposes\"; refer to the existing implementations for actual ones.\r\n\r\nNote that some are or will be implemented as part of a different plug-in!\r\n\r\n(Likely obtained using internal APIs; falling back to JSON-RPC request over IPC socket _could_ be possible, but that would probably show an inconsistency in internal APIs...)\r\n\r\n* Operator-specified (yet human-readable ;)) node name;\r\n* operator-specified \"contact details\";\r\n* node software id/version;\r\n* OS id/version;\r\n* Python impl-n id/version;\r\n* whether active/syncing/mining;\r\n* PoW hash rate (actually mostly useless due to prevalence of grinder proxies);\r\n* chain head: \r\n  * block number/hash/difficulty;\r\n  * transaction count;\r\n  * ommer (uncle) count;\r\n* recommended gas price;\r\n* peer count;\r\n* transaction count in pending transaction pool;\r\n* uptime.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Output\r\n\r\nJSON messages over a WebSocket, to an operator-specified remote server.\r\n\r\nSince `ethstats` is a \"push\" scheme, a \"shared secret\" (essentially a passphrase, also operator-specified) must be used.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\nI highly recommend reading @shazow's notes on the `ethstats` protocol (linked below, in section References -> Server) to get in touch with its quirks.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I found `geth`'s client code slightly more readable than `e-n-i-a`, but I'm very biased.\r\n\r\nAlso, to clarify: I'm not exactly thrilled by the `ethstats` protocol, but it's already got infrastructure around it to be immediately usable.\r\n\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\n### Client\r\n\r\n* `geth`'s [`ethstats` package](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/ethstats/ethstats.go), enabled with the `--ethstats` CLI arg, in Go;\r\n* original [`eth-net-intelligence-api`](https://github.com/cubedro/eth-net-intelligence-api/blob/master/lib/node.js) stand-alone implementation, as a PM2 `node` application, in JS.\r\n\r\n### Server\r\n\r\n* @shazow's [`vipnode/ethstats`](https://github.com/vipnode/ethstats) re-implementation of the collection server, in Go;\r\n* original [`eth-netstats`](https://github.com/cubedro/eth-netstats) server implementation, in JS.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Possibly related issues/PRs\r\n\r\nThese are for further exploration of the topic. Status in parenthesis, at time of posting.\r\n\r\n* PR #1182 (merged) - Convert \"fix-unclean-shutdown\" to plugin\r\n* Issue #979 (open) - Plugin architecture\r\n* Issue #1090 (open) - Convert plugin API to be purely event based\r\n* Issue #1103 (open) - Create guide on how to write plugins",

All I found was some dashboards, the original NodeJS implementation and the half-hearted geth implementation.

It doesn't seem to be something that can be *finished* easily just yet as we need to make changes to our architecture to enable plugins like this. So *figuring out* the right path forward will be a big part of the mission.",

Unfortunately, I have no prior experience in the internal works of py-evm, but would like to learn that as well, so if this issue is not time critical I would like to work on it. Will start by checking out existing implementations, making some rough plug-in with minimal functionality (at least some stats) and then continue by implementing other stats.\n\nLearn more [on the Gitcoin Issue Details page](https://gitcoin.co/issue/ethereum/py-evm/1187/962).\n\n",
