For the same reason we renamed the core module from `evm` to `eth`.\r\n\r\nI was under the impression that the [`py-eth` name on pypi](https://pypi.org/project/py-eth/) was already taken but I recently checked it and sniped it so it is now under my control.\r\n\r\nI think we should rename the package and the repository to `py-eth` also to be back in sync with the module namespace.\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed\r\n\r\n- Rename repository\r\n- Update `setup.py`\r\n- Update `Readme.md`\r\n- Update docs\r\n- set access writes on pypi\r\n- ???\r\n\r\n",
