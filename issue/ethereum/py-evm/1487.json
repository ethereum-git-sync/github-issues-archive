  "body": "### What is wrong?\r\nSimpleSerialize (SSZ) is a new serialization scheme for Ethereum 2.0 a.k.a. Serenity. It’s an alternative to RLP that's much simpler.\r\nCurrently we have the [SSZ specification](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/master/specs/simple-serialize.md) and a reference PoC in Python that doesn’t match the latest spec ([here](https://github.com/ethereum/beacon_chain/tree/master/ssz) and [here](https://github.com/ethereum/beacon_chain/blob/master/time_test.py)). For Trinity, we need a more production-ready version.\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n1. Implement the APIs in the latest [SSZ specification](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/master/specs/simple-serialize.md). It will be helpful to correct the specification.\r\n2. RLP swappable - the SSZ implementation has to be an object-oriented design. It’s recommended to refer to the architecture of [PyRLP](https://github.com/ethereum/pyrlp) and implement the [`Serializable`](https://github.com/ethereum/pyrlp/blob/7904316f3da420d8dda214dfe8fa168a8e866cfb/rlp/sedes/serializable.py#L358) class for SSZ.\r\n3. Write tests for everything!\r\n\r\n",
