However, I think we need to start zeroing in on how we make some of these things generic so that we can work towards a generic simulation runner that can run any of our defined network conditions.  This pattern seems common in some of the other codebases and if done well, it should pay off in lower testing overhead going forward.\r\n\r\n> I'm currently not familiar enough with the innards to know exactly what this should look like but hoping to dig in soon.\r\n",
