  "body": "I was curious how fast py-evm would run in pypy, and it sent me down a rabbit hole. This issue is just a way to note what I learned along the way.\r\n\r\n- pypy won't work out of the box because of the dependency on pysha3 (via eth-bloom), which [fails to compile under pypy](https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/issues/2687/pypy3-is-missing-pystrhexh-breaking-pysha3)\r\n- I ran eth-bloom tests as a rough speed proxy with several different configurations:\r\n  - pysha3: 0.5s\r\n  - [pure python implementation](https://github.com/ctz/keccak/blob/master/keccak.py) in cpython: 25s\r\n  - pure python implementation in pypy: 9.5s\r\n  - pure python implementation in cython: 20.5s\r\n  - after a couple of type annotations in cython: 16.5s\r\n  - cython in pypy: crash at runtime with `TypeError: object.__new__(builtin_function_or_method) is not safe, use builtin_function_or_method.__new__()`\r\n- Optimizing sha3 in cython doesn't matter if it doesn't work under pypy (because we might as well keep the c extension version). Although I do expect that it would be possible to make it work under pypy with some tweaks.\r\n- Punting on pypy and working on a cython trie implementation (which was Piper's first instinct) might be the most fruitful next step",

Pypy3 seems to roughly double the speed of py36. :+1: \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nPerhaps we could convert some/all of the fixture tests to run on pypy3-only. Unfortunately, they have been getting slower as more stuff gets implemented, and some of them are starting to fail regularly. (I think because of the 45min hard limit in travis boxes). The environments `py3{5,6}-{native,rpc}-state-byzantium` seem to fail a lot, for example.\r\n\r\nMy reasoning is: we're testing for python compatibility in other core tests, and we don't need the full matrix of python compatibility and blockchain protocol compatibility. We can just test python compatibility on core tests, and blockchain compatibility on pypy3.\r\n\r\nOur CI situation would go from barely tolerable to unusable if we added pypy3 for every test, and this summer: py3.7.",
