  "body": "### What is wrong?\r\n\r\nWe currently use a stop-gap solution for working around v4 discovery, `p2p.peer.HardCodedNodesPeerPool`.  It contains known nodes to connect to, specifically for LES connections.\r\n\r\nThis approach is problematic because these nodes are not guaranteed to be online or to have capacity so.  If they are, then Trinity will not be able to connect until a slot becomes available.  Worse, there's no way without code modification to add new nodes to this list.\r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed\r\n\r\nExtend how we use this class to to *also* do discovery.  For the first iteration it should treat the hard coded list the same as any nodes that have been connected to via discovery.\r\n\r\nAlso, add a new CLI flag which can be used to add nodes to this list.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ trinity --static-node \"enode://deadbeef...@1.2.3.4:30303\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis flag should be accepted multiple times to allow specifying multiple nodes.",
