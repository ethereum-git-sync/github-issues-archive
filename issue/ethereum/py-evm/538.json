I noticed that when I do a fresh clone, create a fresh `virtualenv` and run `pip install -e . -r requirements-dev.txt` I'm left with a system that doesn't have all dependencies installed to run the entire test suite without failures.\r\n\r\nSo, the TLDR of that issue is that it seems that our current developer guide doesn't leave you with a system that can satisfy all tests and hence isn't complete from a developers perspective.\r\n\r\nIn particular, at this point we are missing the `leveldb`, `web3`, `pysha3` and potentially other libs.\r\n\r\nThis happens both on my local system as well as in a fresh `python:3.6` docker container.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't seem to be a problem on CI though. My naive guess is that the tox setup triggers different installs.\r\n\r\nThe shortest path (that I'm aware of) to get all tests green is to run:\r\n\r\n```\r\npip install -e .[trinity] -r requirements-dev.txt\r\npip install pysha3\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt this point one should have all dependencies installed. \r\n\r\nI just want to double check if running the two commands above is something that is by design and the developer guide should highlight this or if our setup should be adjusted in any way. \r\n\r\nOr, maybe, if I'm just doing it wrong (in which case I really hope I wouldn't be the only person on the planet to run into this).",
