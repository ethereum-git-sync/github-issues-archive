Collect the \"eth2-only\" thing into `eth/beacon/` or `eth/shard/`.\r\n    - `eth/rlp/sedes.py`: e.g., `uint384 = BigEndianInt(384)`\r\n    - `eth/_utils/bls.py`: will be moved to `ethereum/py-ecc` repo\r\n    - `eth/_utils/blobs.py`: blobs and chunks, merkle root tool <- sharding\r\n    - `eth/constants.py`: chunks <- sharding\r\n\r\n    I probably missed something, but it's not much.\r\n2. Add an `eth2` module in `trinity` repo, where `eth2` module has `eth2/beacon` - like what `eth/beacon` is now.\r\n3. Hope `eth2` will be strong enough to go back to `py-evm` one day.\r\n",

I *suspect* that your current scheme can work, but I think it might be worth exploring options that keep the beacon code in the `py-evm` repository, or to at least try them before this approach.  I don't believe that your choice will effect the primary eth1 code for the time being.\r\n\r\nThe primary alternative I see is to work in a branch and pinning the `py-evm` dependency against specific commits and installing it from `git` rather than pypi.  Downside is that you have to work in a branch which means continual rebasing on `master` within the `trinity` repo.",

    "body": ">but I think it might be worth exploring options that keep the beacon code in the `py-evm` repository, or to at least try them before this approach.\r\n\r\nI agree that we should give it a try. I know it is annoying because now PRs need to be reviewed in tandem (\"Please review PR X in Trinity but make sure to test it on top of PR Y in Py-EVM\") but that's the main disadvantage of standalone repos vs mono repos. With just two repositories I think the overhead is still manageable.\r\n\r\nIf it turns out to be too annoying to work under that model I agree that we should do what @hwwhww proposes and introduce an `eth2` module in the trinity repo until things have stabilized. The main danger here that I see is that the `eth2` namespace could turn into a quickfix area of the code base. E.g. consider that we need to change an API that trinity uses from `eth` and this API is used in both the beacon node and the eth1 node. The proper fix obviously is to make the change in the `Py-EVM` repo, cut a release and then make the change in Trinity. But since that's a lot of hassle one might be tempted to just copy and paste the API to the `eth2` namespace and make the changes there.\r\n",

    "body": "Alright, I'm convinced as well. For instance, I just added a stub beacon RPC module in Trinity and I'd like to make it useful by actually giving real responses that are performed against the beacon chain.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/trinity/blob/bf05b916526a21fefd9a6dcc7f52b49543d4bb1a/trinity/rpc/modules/beacon.py#L4-L11\r\n\r\nBut the `BeaconChain` is still sitting in a branch of this repo https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/pull/1693 so I'd need to work against that. And even once it lands it won't be in Trinity before we cut a new Py-EVM release and upgrade it in Trinity. Given how much work is happening around the beacon chain, this is just a lot of friction to deal with.\r\n\r\nLet's move things over into an `eth2`module in Trinity and port it back when it stabilizes. @hwwhww since you have open PRs, do you want to time and coordinate the move?",

    "body": "@cburgdorf yeah, the main problem is that it will be tricky and hard to review when one wants to implement a feature or bugfix that needs to modify *both* `eth` and `trinity`.\r\n\r\n> do you want to time and coordinate the move?\r\n\r\nI'm happy to. 🙂 \r\nSince it will need you guys to help review the migration PRs ASAP to avoiding blocking others, I think it would be nice if we can schedule (i) one day to make `eth2` module in `Py-EVM` repo and (ii) another day to move `eth2` module to `trinity` repo. What do you think about it from your experience of the last migration?",
