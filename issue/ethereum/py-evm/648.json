  "body": "### What is wrong?\r\n\r\n`vm.previous_hashes` hits the database a lot. Caching helps, but it still involves ~`255 * n` DB reads when importing n blocks. There are probably a lot of blocks that never use the `BLOCKHASH` evm opcode, and so these reads are wasted.\r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed\r\n\r\nSend a callable (like `lambda: self.previous_hashes`, though probably not literally that) to execution_context that it will invoke, as needed.\r\n\r\nI would put a [Good First Issue], but the API is changing a lot, and I don't want to ask a new contributor to do a bunch of ugly rebases.",
