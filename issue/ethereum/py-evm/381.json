  "body": "### What is wrong?\r\n\r\nThe `evm.p2p.lightchain.LightChain` extends the `Chain` class.  This is looking to be problematic as I implement the various processes in `trinity`.  The JSON-RPC server needs access to the `Chain` object.   In order to do that as things are written, we'd need to setup a `multiprocessing.Manager` in the networking process to expose the various chain methods for the JSON-RPC process.\r\n\r\nThis is problematic because it allows for requests to the JSON-RPC server to compete with the execution of the networking processes.\r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed\r\n\r\nI would like to create a new class *type* to contain the networking specific code that currently lives in the `LightChain` class.  Maybe something like `ChainNetwork` or `NetworkManager`.  This class can then interact with the `Chain` using a proxy object, much the same way that it interacts with the `ChainDB` object.",

Similarly, JSON-RPC needs it's own process to ensure similar guarantees to keep it from blocking the other processes.\r\n\r\nThe JSON-RPC server needs access to the `Chain` object to serve requests.  Naive approach would be to use the `multiprocessing` Manager pattern to serve it over a socket like we're currently doing with the databases.  This however doesn't work, because it doesn't allow us to serve JSON-RPC requests when we run an LES node because many of the JSON-RPC requests will require us to go out over the networking process to retrieve responses.\r\n\r\n**Conclusion:** Whatever `Chain` object the JSON-RPC server uses must be able to delegate certain requests to the networking process.  This indicates that having the `Chain` and networking code combined as they are now might be the right choice.",
