  "body": "### What is wrong?\r\n\r\nThe way we currently use labels could be improved to enable better issue discovery.\r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed\r\n\r\nI'd like to overhaul and unify the labels in this repo and potentially apply the same rules to other repos as well. This is inspired by https://github.com/machinelabs/machinelabs which in turn is inspired by https://github.com/angular/angular\r\n\r\nHere are two secreenshots to give an idea what it could look like.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/521109/42214872-ff6b4098-7ebc-11e8-9101-fd20fc710f82.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/521109/42214885-0770b4d0-7ebd-11e8-82bc-760d02d9a545.png)\r\n\r\nThe gist of it goes like this.\r\n\r\nWe would create labels that fall into the following categories:\r\n\r\n`comp: <component-name>` (e.g. `comp: p2p`, `comp: trinity`, `comp: benchmark`)\r\n`type: <type>` (e.g. `type: feature`, `type: bug`, `type: docs`)\r\n`effort: <effort-estimate>` (e.g. `effort: hours`, `effort: days`, `effort: weeks`)\r\n`prio: <prio>` (e.g. `prio: P0-critical`, `prio: P1-urgent`, `prio: P2-required`)\r\n`PR-state: <state>` (e.g. `PR-state: wip`, `PR-state: needs review`, `PR-state: blocked`)\r\n\r\nAll the labels that fall into the same category share the same color (as seen on the screenshot). Nothing set in stone regarding concrete labels but I like the core idea of it. I'm happy to do the migration work we want to go that way.\r\n\r\n",
