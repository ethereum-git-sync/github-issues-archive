  "body": "### What is wrong?\r\n\r\n- The properties `validate` and `intrinsic_gas` for a transaction are used in `chain.estimate_gas()`. This is currently not implemented for `UnsignedAccessListTransaction` and `UnsignedDynamicFeeTransaction`, only for the signed `AccessListTransaction` and `DynamicFeeTransaction`. \r\n\r\nThis causes some issues when trying to send a transaction without gas and having it be calculated in `eth-tester` for example. This would also provide some more consistency across the code base as unsigned legacy transactions have these properties.\r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed\r\n\r\n- Add `intrinsic_gas` and `validate` (with the appropriate unsigned fields) properties to `UnsignedAccessListTransaction` and `UnsignedDynamicFeeTransaction`.",
