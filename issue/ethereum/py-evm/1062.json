They both run in the same process right now, so it's possible.\r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed\r\n\r\n- Spawn an RPC process, after networking and database processes are launched\r\n- Track it in a pidfile\r\n- Shut down the RPC process on trinity shutdown\r\n\r\nNow that we're growing to three processes, pay attention to any refactoring that might make sense to make it easier to manage all the spawing/running/shut-down of processes.\r\n\r\nNote that issuing many RPC requests could still cause contention for the database, which could slow down the node. But it's a necessary step in the right direction.",
