  "body": "### What is wrong?\r\n\r\nRight now, `DBDiff` drops any `KeyErrors` that are raised when it tries to delete values in the underlying database. This is mildly annoying because `MissingTrieNode` extends `KeyError` (an unfortunate holdover from an old py-trie version). But also it's unnecessary and might hide issues when we delete the wrong (missing) key, and never get notified.\r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed\r\n\r\nDon't catch the `KeyError` here: https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/blob/master/eth/db/diff.py#L198\r\n\r\nThere is likely follow-up work to do:\r\n- fix anything that breaks in current tests\r\n- update any current tests on the `DBDiff` API that depend on this behavior\r\n- (making sure there are new tests that demonstrate a `KeyError` being raised if it was missing when applied to a DB)\r\n\r\n(Note this will make the re-raise in #1778 unnecessary)",
