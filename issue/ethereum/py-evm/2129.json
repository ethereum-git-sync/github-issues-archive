  "body": "### What happened?\r\n\r\nThe simplified contract:\r\n```solidity\r\n    error MyError(address sender);\r\n\r\n    function returnSender() public {\r\n        revert MyError(msg.sender);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen deploying it in PyEvm, and creating a transaction calling `returnSender()`, the address in the error is always the first genesis address, regardless of the transaction signer.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code that produced the error\r\n\r\nNow that is a bit tricky, since there are some intermediate layers, and I'm not well-versed enough in PyEvm API to produce an MRE. I am using `eth-tester==0.10.0b1` with the PyEvm backend, and on top of that my Ethereum RPC client library (https://github.com/fjarri/pons). And the error was originally produced in an application using that library, but I got rid of that layer. \r\n\r\nI'm hoping that somebody will immediately know what the problem is, or, failing that, point me to some example of deploying and transacting with a contract using `py-evm` only, so that I could make an MRE (although I can immediately produce an MRE with `pons` if that helps).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Full error output\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Fill this section in if you know how this could or should be fixed\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### py-evm Version\r\n\r\n0.8.0b1\r\n\r\n### Python Version\r\n\r\n3.10\r\n\r\n### Operating System\r\n\r\nosx\r\n\r\n### Output from pip-freeze\r\n\r\n_No response_",
