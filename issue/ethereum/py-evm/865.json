    "body": "If we're past block 1920000 and try to *fetch headers* from an ETC peer, we'll fail because we can't find a common ancestor. Currently that will just crash (IIRC), and although we can fix it so that we don't crash, at that time we'd have to stop and request block 1920000 from the peer in order to figure out if it's just a peer on the wrong side of the DAO fork or something wrong on our side (e.g. a reorg deeper than we support).\r\n\r\nAlso, when we start relaying transactions, how would that work for transactions sent to us by ETC peers?  IIUC, they won't apply on our blocks and we'd, again, have to do the is-this-peer-anti-DAO check.\r\n\r\nAnd I bet I'm overlooking other situations in which we would have issues caused by being connected to ETC peers, and in each of those we'd have to check if that's indeed because of an ETC peer or a legit error, so we could end up having to do this is-this-peer-anti-DAO check in lots of different places.\r\n\r\nSince it only makes any sense for us to be connected to an ETC peer up until we've synced block 1920000, it'd be simpler for us to do the check upon connecting, and disconnect if it's an ETC peer, but more importantly I believe that'd save us trouble down the line by ensuring we don't have to worry about checking if an error is because we're trying to sync from an ETC peer",

    "body": ":+1: Now the question is: how do we do that without adding any VM-specific logic into `p2p`. First instinct:\r\n\r\nWhen connecting to a new peer, we iterate through all the VMs in `Chain.vm_configuration`:\r\n- For VM 0, check the genesis header against our own genesis header\r\n- For VM 1-N:\r\n  - Check if the peer is synced to the starting block of the VM. If not, connect successfully\r\n  - Request the header at the starting block of the VM and its parent header\r\n  - Run `VM.validate_header(header, parent_header)`, and disconnect as `subprotocol_error` if validation fails\r\n- If the last VM validates, connect successfully",

    "body": "I'm thinking that it may not make sense to do the fetch-header-and-validate dance for every item in `Chain.vm_configuration` as most of the forks they represent didn't actually cause a chain split (like the DAO fork did). Since for each of them we'd do an extra request-header/wait-for-reply roundtrip, I'd rather avoid that, but in order to do so in a generic way we'd need to somehow distinguish the items in `Chain.vm_configuration` for which we must do the validation dance. How do you guys feel about adding an extra attribute to `BaseVM` for that, something like `caused_chain_split`?",
