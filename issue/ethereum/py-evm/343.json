Maybe there's a nice abbreviation or alternate name we could use?\r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed\r\n\r\nConsider the following\r\n\r\n- use `comp` instead of `computation` for instance names\r\n- rename class to `Execution` and use `exc` as variable name. (maybe too similar to built-in `exec`)\r\n- anyone got any better ideas.\r\n\r\nThis also may not be worth the visual *optimization*\r\n\r\nAlternate approach would be to instead make more shortcut methods on the `Computation` class\r\n\r\n```python\r\ncomputation.gas_meter.consume_gas(child_msg_gas_fee, reason=self.mnemonic)\r\n# becomes...\r\ncomputation.consume_gas(child_msg_gas_fee, reason=self.mnemonic)\r\n# or maybe shortcut accessors...\r\ncomputation.gm.consume_gas(child_msg_gas_fee, reason=self.mnemonic)\r\n```",
