  "body": "### What is wrong?\r\n@justindrake came up with a solution for that we can obsolete the \"empty slots\" in the collator list.\r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed\r\n1. Add another mapping for `collator_address` -> `pool_index`, the collator can use the address to look up the index by address.\r\n1. In the `withdraw` function, after the collator was removed from the pool, there's a new empty slot. Now we move the last element to fill the slot immediately and update the mapping of (1).\r\n\r\nPlease wait for the new specification with new namings.",

When block number is 30 and the length of the collator pool is 10, one collator calls `get_eligible_proposer(shard_id=1, period=10)` and gets the eligible is the last element (`c9`) of the pool.\r\n2.
