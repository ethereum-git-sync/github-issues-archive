  "body": "### What is wrong?\r\n\r\nSome valid string characters, like newline, are invalid in json encoding. This is doesn't seem to be handled by `json.dumps()` with the default encoder. If an exception is triggered in RPC, and that exception message has a newline, then clients who try to naively decode with `json.loads()` will crash.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed\r\n\r\nHandle all of the invalid characters from ECMA-404 as mentioned in [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/42899451/8412986):\r\n\r\n> According to spec: http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-404.pdf\r\n>\r\n> >A string is a sequence of Unicode code points wrapped with quotation marks\r\n(U+0022). All characters may be placed within the quotation marks except for the\r\ncharacters that must be escaped: quotation mark (U+0022), reverse solidus\r\n(U+005C), and the control characters U+0000 to U+001F. There are two-character\r\nescape sequence representations of some characters.\r\n>\r\n>So you can't pass 0x0A or 0x0C codes directly. It is forbidden! Spec suggests to use escape sequences for some well defined codes from U+0000 to U+001F:\r\n>\r\n> > \\f  represents the form feed character (U+000C). \r\n> > \\n  represents the line feed character (U+000A).",
