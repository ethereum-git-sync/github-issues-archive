  "body": "Implement some APIs for shard chain validators to call the `validator manager contract` on main chain.\r\n\r\n* contract code: https://github.com/ethereum/sharding/blob/develop/sharding/contracts/validator_manager.v.py\r\n* previous implementation (with pyethereum): https://github.com/ethereum/sharding/blob/develop/sharding/validator_manager_utils.py\r\n\r\nImplementation should probably remain *low* level.  A simplistic `Contract` class with the following API should suffice.\r\n\r\n* Base class with `factory` class method which accepts `abi` and returns a `ContractClass`\r\n* `ContractClass` as returned by `BaseContract.factory` can be instantiated with a single `address`.\r\n* A method on the `ContractClass` for constructing a transaction (TODO: should this be a dictionary, a `Message` class, or something else?)\r\n\r\nThere are likely some other convenience APIs that should be added around this functionality to make common tasks easier as we find what those are.\r\n\r\nI think this code should live in something like `evm.utils.contracts`.",

Previously I used the `web3.py` contract object.\r\nBut after, I changed to generate the tx data of the contract call transaction on our own, using `eth_abi`. (referenced from [here](https://github.com/ethereum/eth-tester/blob/99dfc5a8f39988316f6bd6ede3c6942d8a2bb389/eth_tester/utils/math_contract.py))\r\n\r\nNow performing a contract call is performed by [send_vmc_tx](https://github.com/mhchia/sharding/blob/rpc/sharding/rpc/vmc_handler.py#L94-L112), specifying the `function_name` and `args`. A constant call is implemented similarly by [call_vmc](https://github.com/mhchia/sharding/blob/rpc/sharding/rpc/vmc_handler.py#L87-L92)\r\nThe implementation underneath: [`VMCHandler.send_vmc_tx`](https://github.com/mhchia/sharding/blob/rpc/sharding/rpc/vmc_handler.py#L66-L83).\r\nI did this is because I used `web3.py` and `eth_tester` as the backends of `vmc_handler`. The parameters taken for the `sendTransaction` of both packages are the same.\r\nSo I can just generate one parameter for both backends using the same function [`mk_contract_tx_obj`](https://github.com/mhchia/sharding/blob/rpc/sharding/rpc/vmc_utils.py#L152-L174).\r\n\r\nIf it is better to use web3.py contract object, I can change to that:)\r\nBut this way I will need to figure out a prettier solution.\r\n\r\n",

Web3.py ships with a special provider `web3.providers.eth_tester.EthereumTesterProvider` which uses `eth-tester` under the hood.  That would allow a single handler implementation that just delegates to `web3.py` or potentially for you to remove the chain_handler all-together.",
