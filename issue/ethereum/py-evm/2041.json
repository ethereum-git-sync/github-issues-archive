  "body": "I'm trying to test smart contract security issues with py-evm. Suppose i execute a set of transactions, check out the contract state after the transactions and find no loophole triggered.  The problem is how can i undo the latest one or two executed transactions (for further test)?  Or, how can i set the chain state to the precise state where several designated transactions are executed? \r\n\r\nHope to know, thanks a lot!\r\n",
