  "body": "### What is wrong?\r\n\r\nBlake2b compression takes way too long in the all-python implementation. It's now trivial to DoS trinity & py-evm by filling a block with ~~calls to the precompile~~ one call to the precompile, specifying millions of rounds.\r\n\r\nSee #1818 for rough analysis:\r\n> It takes 25 seconds to run 2 million rounds (which is 2M gas). At that rate, it will take:\r\n> \r\n> * 100 seconds to run a full 8 million gas block _(just confirmed, it took 91s)_\r\n> * 14 hours to run test vector 8, which has 4 billion rounds\r\n> \r\n> So it's about 6 times too slow, at a minimum, assuming 15s blocks.\r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed\r\n\r\nIdeally, write a python wrapper around the C implementation that is already distributed the stdlib blake2b module.\r\n\r\nIt should meet the same API as the current implementation:\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/blob/7696779d2f17e4000198d14d5c017f705bb6cf67/eth/_utils/blake2/compression.py#L71-L76\r\n\r\nIt is *not* a requirement that everything beneath that ^ API is in C. If you want a python layer that prepares & returns the appropriate types, that's fine/great. The primary requirement is that it runs fast enough.\r\n\r\nIt should run 8 million rounds in under 8 seconds (of course, faster is better).\r\n\r\nA working PR should include a hypothesis test that shows equivalence between the all-python implementation and the new API. It should also include a test showing that it runs fast enough, maybe run 100k rounds to make sure they complete in under 0.1s.\r\n\r\n*Note that some of the nomenclature on the types and variable names may be a little funky, since the author (@carver) was not familiar with the internals of Blake2. Bonus points for identifying better names, with citations. (Especially for variables and types like message, block, and state)*",
