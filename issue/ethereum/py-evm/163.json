  "body": "### What is wrong?\r\n\r\nThe `evm.constants` module has a number of values that are *fork specific* such as `FRONTIER_DIFFICULTY_ADJUSTMENT`.  Having these in the `evm.constants` module feels *wrong* since the core Py-EVM library is supposed to be largely agnostic about specific fork rules.\r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed\r\n\r\nThese variables would be more appropriately located if they were located under the fork module that they apply to.  Move each of the fork specific and chain specific constants into a new module at  `evm.vm.forks.<fork-name>.constants` or `evm.chains.mainnet.constants`.",
