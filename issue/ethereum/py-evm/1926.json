I have a rough implementation and are now trying to work myself through the test cases that are specified in the EIP.\r\n\r\nI also believe that some familiarity with the code base would be good to work on this issue. That said, if you think this would make a great code challenge for you then I'm happy to throw my code away and take yours!\r\n\r\nI propose to put my code away for some days and wait for you to create a PR to show some progress on the issue. I would recommend to base your work on #1933 which has the basic boilerplate code to support the upcoming *Berlin* fork.\r\n\r\nYou may also want to look into `test_opcodes.py` to get a sense for how the other opcode tests are written.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you want to take a stab on that or find something else. For instance, there's also #1927 that needs to be tackled for the upcoming Berlin fork.",
