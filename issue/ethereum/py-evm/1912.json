There is a state root mismatch.\r\n\r\nIt [seems](https://github.com/ethereum/trinity/issues/1478#issuecomment-579715506) that if a contract is created and deleted within the same block, then we're erroneously re-creating its storage as \"empty\".\r\n\r\nProbably has something to do with how accounts and their stores are marked \"dirty\" when they're created/destroyed.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/ethereum/trinity/issues/1478 for much more debug details, traces, etc..\r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed\r\n\r\nThere is quite some indirection there - journals, caches...\r\n\r\n[Bisect showed](https://github.com/ethereum/trinity/issues/1478#issuecomment-575335557) the culprit to be https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/pull/1735.\r\n\r\n[Debug-tracing showed](https://gist.github.com/veox/bbc4586e5d59f44c3cdc089ee801481a#file-the-diff) the following (diff between good/bad `py-evm` versions in linked gist):\r\n\r\n```\r\n>   DEBUG2  01-29 13:33:37      AccountStorageDB  Deleting all storage in account 0xb214cbce30676bd117f95a8695d34427295cd6f7, hashed 0x88593f406750a4f40bdf82a1efbacbec6a5297e62830ee1a8942f083de97ad14\r\n> ...\r\n>   DEBUG2  01-29 13:33:37             AccountDB  Updating account 0xb214cbce30676bd117f95a8695d34427295cd6f7 to storage root 0x856157ca7b18901a14648a8d426b568dcba060e3997d5a409c25fe09d77351b6\r\n> ...\r\n>   DEBUG2  01-29 13:33:37             AccountDB  Updating account 0xb214cbce30676bd117f95a8695d34427295cd6f7 to storage root 0x856157ca7b18901a14648a8d426b568dcba060e3997d5a409c25fe09d77351b6\r\n> ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n* First, seems we're going through the \"dirty\" list twice.\r\n* Then, the \"deleting all storage in account\" message can be slightly misleading: the \"hashed\" value `0x8859...` printed is a hash of the address, `0xb214c...` - not sure this is intended; if anything, I'd expect the account's storage root to be here instead, or at least also present.\r\n* More importantly, _this_ is the snippet that seems to show the account's storage is deleted, and then re-created.",
