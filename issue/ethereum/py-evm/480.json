  "body": "### What is wrong?\r\n\r\n#383 was recently merged, bringing a generic transaction executor to be used as mixin in different VM state classes, thereby allowing us to achieve better code reuse across forks.\r\n\r\nA good candidate that can benefit from a similar refactoring is the [`BaseVMState.make_receipt`](https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/blob/73662176575c82f64be26ccda91a1e7b34fb0a99/evm/vm_state.py#L306) method. This method is currently called inside [`BaseVMState.add_transaction(transaction, computation, block)`](https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/blob/73662176575c82f64be26ccda91a1e7b34fb0a99/evm/vm_state.py#L253), though receipt generation has nothing to do with adding the transaction to a block. A better place to make the call is in [`BaseTransactionExecutor.execute_transaction`](https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/blob/73662176575c82f64be26ccda91a1e7b34fb0a99/evm/vm_state.py#L359). It therefore  also makes logical sense to move `BaseVMState.make_receipt` to the [`BaseTransactionExecutor`](https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/blob/73662176575c82f64be26ccda91a1e7b34fb0a99/evm/vm_state.py#L358) class, which has all the necessary information for receipt generation, i.e. vm state (via `self`), `computation`, and `transaction`.\r\n### How can it be fixed\r\n\r\n1. Add `make_receipt` as an `abstractmethod` to `evm.vm_state.BaseTransactionExecutor`.\r\n2. Move the call to `self.make_receipt` in the `evm.vm_state.BaseVMState.add_transaction`, to `evm.vm_state.BaseTransactionExecutor.execute_transaction`.\r\n3. Implement `make_receipt` in `evm.vm.forks.frontier.vm_state.FrontierTransactionExecutor`.\r\n4. Use proper inheritance in other forks, notably in `ByzantiumVMState`.",

Alternately, we can call the `add_receipt` method in  `execute_transaction` and modify [this line](https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/blob/73662176575c82f64be26ccda91a1e7b34fb0a99/evm/vm_state.py#L293) to be: `block.bloom_filter |= self.receipts[-1].bloom`.\r\n\r\n",
