    "body": "There are now two incompatible proposals (the latter a counter-proposal by Parity Tech due to their implementation specifics):\r\n\r\n* [EIP-1087: Net gas metering for SSTORE operations](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1087)\r\n* [EIP-1283: Net gas metering for SSTORE without dirty maps](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1283)\r\n\r\n-----\r\n-----\r\n\r\nA copy-paste from [gitter/ethereum/AllCoreDevs](https://gitter.im/ethereum/AllCoreDevs?at=5b6f2bf4a6af14730b2088a4):\r\n\r\n@veox\r\n\r\n(...)\r\n\r\n**EIP-1087 introduces a map (of `bool`s) for marking \"dirty\" storage,** but doesn't make comparisons to the original values until the post-processing step. Post-processing can be delayed until a transaction's execution is complete, so that the refund logic can be applied outside the EVM.\r\n\r\nEIP-1283 needs a \"cache\" (a map, most likely - of `uint256`s) of original storage values, so that it can determine `gas_used` when doing a write (20000 or 5000). This cache must now necessarily reside within the EVM. In other words:\r\n\r\n**EIP-1283 introduces a map (of `uint256`s) for \"original\" value look-ups.**\r\n\r\n(The above might not make sense depending on how your favourite implementation delineates \"inside the EVM\". Or maybe I'm battling a chimera here, to understand the trade-offs. Sorry if noise.)\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nTo which the author of EIP-1283 responds:\r\n\r\n@sorpaas\r\n\r\nNot quite the case, actually. EIP-1283's \"map\" is needed to be kept for every client right now -- all clients already have this information because they need to handle it in case a transaction reverts. Just like a storage slot's _current value_ and _new value_, most clients won't need any new extra structs to fetch that info.\r\n\r\nThe issue with EIP-1087 is that the \"dirty map\" concept is in conflict with one of the optimization we do after EIP-658, so for parity-ethereum, we can't have that without getting an extra struct.\r\n\r\nSo you may say:\r\n\r\n* EIP-1087 needs a map (of `uint256`s) for \"original\" value look-ups, and introduces a map (of `bool`s) for marking \"dirty\" storage.\r\n* EIP-1283 needs a map (of `uint256`s) for \"original\" value look-ups.\r\n\r\nThe first is needed any way by other operations as well.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n-----\r\n\r\nA few questions, somewhat abstract:\r\n\r\n* Which of the two (if either) would more closely describe the situation in `py-evm`?\r\n* Would implementing either require pushing the \"cache for original values of storage items\" deeper? Or is that already available at the point where gas-use metering is done?",

Or is that already available at the point where gas-use metering is done?\r\n\r\nImplementing 1283 will require exposing information about the cache (the journal) deeper as to make it available within the `SSTORE` opcode function.  I suspect this will be best done as a combination of a formal API on the `AccountDB` for checking storage slot status.  I believe this will involve simply querying the `self._trie` which should return the original value, and `self._journaltrie` which should return the current value.",
