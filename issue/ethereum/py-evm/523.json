One thing to look into would be changing the lookup keys (e.g 'transaction-hash-to-block') to something shorter\r\n\r\nApart from the (probably unnecessary) extra disk space usage, this causes DB operations to be significantly slower, which is specially problematic during a fast sync since that makes tons of reads/writes from/to the DB",

    "body": "> I've been interested in exploring using a relational db (like sqlite) for some of this structured metadata:\r\n> - txn hash -> block hash, txn_index\r\n> - canonical block number -> block hash\r\n> - canonical chain head\r\n> - block_hash -> total difficulty\r\n> - canonical header chain with just a limited subset of the header data: (hash, number, ??)\r\n\r\n \r\n It looks like geth is using leveldb to build the relationship:\r\n\r\n#### 1. Store blockReceipts in one entry:\r\nIn py-evm, storing receipt:\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/blob/5525c12fd1e1860fe5e885d68b9eb4d38009a833/evm/db/chain.py#L598-L601\r\n\r\nIn geth, storing the entire `BlockReceipt` into a single entry with prefix (`blockReceiptsPrefix`) instead of separate receipts key/value:\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/7605e63cb9dda7fc5bb619abf1eb1f74ac3f6cc1/core/database_util.go#L464-L480\r\n\r\n#### 2. Store block body in one key-value store includes both transactions and uncles\r\nWhen they want to access a transaction, they have to look up `blockHash, blockNumber, txIndex` via transaction hash, get the block body, and then get the specific transaction:\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/7605e63cb9dda7fc5bb619abf1eb1f74ac3f6cc1/core/database_util.go#L284-L295\r\n\r\n#### 3. Rough comparision\r\nSomething geth doesn’t store, but py-evm does:\r\n1. The way store receipts: in trie db, each receipt takes one key-value store.\r\n2. The way store body:\r\n\t1. Uncle: in trie db, each uncle takes one key-value store\r\n\t2. Tx: in trie db, each tx takes one key-value store\r\n\r\nSomething py-evm doesn’t store, but geth does:\r\n1. Meta data\r\n\t1. block_hash -> total difficulty\r\n\t2. block_hash -> block_number \r\n\t3. block_number + block_hash -> block receipts\r\n\t4. receipt_hash -> transaction/receipt lookup metadata (block_hash, block_number, transaction_index)   # py-evm only has txHash -> blockHash\r\n\t5. bloom bits\r\n2. The way store receipts: one key-value store per block\r\n3. The way store body: one key-value store per block\r\n\r\n---\r\nIt’s still unclear for me to compare the trade-off between more key-value stores for the actual data and more lookups, but the way we get a specific block may be inefficient when other nodes want to download data from Trinity. It seems Trinity has to query and decode the block body from every transactions and uncles to rebuild the block body:\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/blob/f7bc89f7c05bcc2e721cacf56408f1bf821ad887/evm/vm/forks/frontier/blocks.py#L88-L104\r\n",
