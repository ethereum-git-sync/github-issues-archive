  "body": "Need to support a transaction lookup by hash for the json-rpc method `eth_getTransactionByHash`.\r\n\r\nFirst impression for an approach:\r\n- add transactions to the key-value store (even pending transactions should be retrievable)\r\n- key = hash, value = transaction root & index (so that we can reuse logic/data in `chaindb.get_block_transactions` and don't store the whole transaction twice in the db)\r\n- need to add transactions in these scenarios\r\n  - import block\r\n  - create transaction locally\r\n  - ?\r\n\r\nAlternatives:\r\n- Store the transaction body once with a key of the transaction hash, and store the transaction hash under the key= transaction root & index (the reverse of the suggestion above, since transaction lookup by hash might be more common and the cost of a double lookup might be high)\r\n\r\nOpen questions\r\n- some kind of garbage cleanup for pending transactions that never get included in a block",
