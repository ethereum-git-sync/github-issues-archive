  "body": "### What is wrong?\r\n\r\nThe syncing code in `p2p.chain` under `BaseHeaderChainSyncer._sync` makes an assumption about the received headers which is not necessarily correct.\r\n\r\n### What I think is going on (please confirm)\r\n\r\nIn trying to understand where these are coming from, I'm working to understand the syncing logic and want to be sure I have it correct.\r\n\r\n- [`p2p.chain.BaseHeaderChainSyncer._sync#L205`](https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/blob/3dbad6b8ea82b2f325b3fce6d96a7f0dc2b5642f/p2p/chain.py#L205) requests headers from the chosen `peer`\r\n- [`p2p.chain.BaseHeaderChainSyncer._fetch_missing_headers#L253`](https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/blob/3dbad6b8ea82b2f325b3fce6d96a7f0dc2b5642f/p2p/chain.py#L253) issues a request to the peer for some headers.\r\n- [`p2p.chain.BaseHeaderChainSyncer._fetch_missing_headers#L256`](https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/blob/3dbad6b8ea82b2f325b3fce6d96a7f0dc2b5642f/p2p/chain.py#L256) waits for new headers to show up in the `_new_headers` queue.\r\n- When the new headers show up, [`p2p.chain.BaseHeaderChainSyncer._handle_block_headers#L276`](https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/blob/3dbad6b8ea82b2f325b3fce6d96a7f0dc2b5642f/p2p/chain.py#L276) puts the new headers in the `_new_headers` queue.\r\n\r\nSo, IIUC, if **any** peer sends us a `BlockHeaders` message, the new headers will end up in the `_new_headers` queue and the `headers` returned in [`_fetch_missing_headers`](https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/blob/3dbad6b8ea82b2f325b3fce6d96a7f0dc2b5642f/p2p/chain.py#L256) are not guaranteed to originate from the peer they were requested from.\r\n\r\nAlternate explanation of what I'm trying to understand.\r\n\r\n1. We request headers from peer `A`\r\n2. Peer `B` sends us a `BlockHeaders` message before peer `A` responds\r\n3. The headers from peer `B` end up in the queue.\r\n4. We treat the headers received from peer `B` as if they were sent from peer `A`.\r\n\r\nIf this is the case then I believe we have a systemic problem that we need to solve.\r\n\r\n### How we can solve it (maybe)\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that there is no `id` for these types of requests so we cannot do `id` based linking between requests and responses.\r\n\r\nWithout an `id` based way to link requests and responses, I think we have to do it in a probabilistic manner.\r\n\r\n1. instead of a single queue for headers, lets use a queue per peer.\r\n2. use the [`PeerPoolSubscriber.deregister_peer`](https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/blob/3dbad6b8ea82b2f325b3fce6d96a7f0dc2b5642f/p2p/peer.py#L706) API to clear out stale queues.\r\n3. maintain list of *header requests* that are awaiting responses.\r\n4. on receipt of `BlockHeaders` message, we only put it in the queue if it has a corresponding *header request* which is satisfied by the headers contained in the message.\r\n\r\nDefining *header request*:\r\n\r\n- A *header request* would be defined as the requesting parameters in the `GetBlockHeaders` message.  \r\n- A match would be defined as a non-empty set of headers which is a subset of the full set of headers that could be generated by the request.\r\n\r\nAny received headers that cannot be correlated to a specific peer and header request should be logged and discarded.",
