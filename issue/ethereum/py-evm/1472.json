  "body": "### What is wrong?\r\n\r\nWe already have some form of integration tests that spin up a real Trinity node in the same way a user would, and then scan the output for various issues.\r\n\r\nThis has proven to be extremely valuable as a last line of defense. For instance, before we had this, we sometimes had bugs slipping through where booting trinity with certain parameters would just crash (e.g. `trinity --ropsten --light`).\r\n\r\nWith these tests in place, bugs like this get caught in CI.\r\n\r\nIt would be extremely valuable to go one step further and have tests that spin up one Trinity node and then run `trinity attach` in as second command to test out some basic interaction. E.g. attaching to a trinity instance and then running `w3.net.version` should print out `1`.\r\n\r\nIn fact, I started to write such tests a while back but got stuck at the point where I needed to feed in STDIN.\r\n\r\nMy attempt can be found here: https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/pull/1054\r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed\r\n\r\n1. Figure out how to feed in the commands\r\n2. Look at https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/pull/1054 as a starting point\r\n3. Add a basic test that tests the interaction of `trinity attach` using something as simple as `w3.net.version`\r\n4. Profit\r\n",

    "body": "Apology for the late update. There are a few issues that I have to workaround to setup the dev env on my mac and run the test. It's requires more time than I initially expected so I'll release this bounty for now for other people who'd like to take a look at the issue. I'll come back to this when I have more downtime.\r\n\r\nFor future reference, here are issues I encountered and the workarounds I did although they require proper fix:\r\n\r\nI use OSX 10.14.1.\r\n\r\nWhen running `pip install -e .[dev]`, I encountered the following error: `error: command 'clang' failed with exit status 1` due to clang not being able to locate leveldb.h even though I installed it via homebrew. To solve this issue, I had to install plyvel which depends on leveldb, separately with the following command where I overwrote the paths: `pip install --global-option=build_ext --global-option=\"-I/usr/local/include\" --global-option=\"-L/usr/local/lib\" plyvel`.\r\n\r\nWhen running `pip install -e .[dev]`, I encountered another error where it complains that there is a version conflict with pluggy. Some requires a version less than 0.8.0 but 0.8.0 got installed via package dependencies. I resolved it by manually installing `pluggy==0.7.1` first.\r\n\r\nWhen running `pytest -s tests/trinity/integration/test_trinity_cli.py -k test_web3`, I encountered the following error: `OSError: AF_UNIX path too long`. It's due to OSX using longer prefix path name for $TMPDIR than the test file expected as noted in [here](https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/pull/1054/files#diff-65654463a4049baf3b3285cb6316d27dR10). One workaround is to create a symlink to to the temporary directory path that is much shorter and set it as the $TMPDIR .",
