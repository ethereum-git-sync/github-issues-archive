  "body": "The `peer.handshake()` coroutine gets passed a `CancelToken` so that it can be cancelled, but that token is only used during the auth handshake (it gets passed to the `auth.handshake()` coroutine), and not during the p2p/sub-proto handshakes as those are implemented as methods on the `Peer` class and there we use the instance's own `CancelToken`. The problem is that the instance's token cannot be triggered externally until after the `peer.handshake()` coroutine has returned the instance itself (i.e. after the p2p/sub-proto handshakes).\r\n\r\nWe could change the `Peer` constructor to take an optional `CancelToken` and chain that with a new one to obtain its own, but that would cause the `Peer` instance to finish when the original `CancelToken` is triggered. I think that makes sense when the original token comes from a `PeerPool`, but will have to double check that this won't have unintended consequences in other cases",
