Doesn't need to be comprehensive, but ideally something that demonstrates the basic *happy-path* functions as expected.",

    "body": "@pipermerriam  For implementing this am planning to port most of the code from #298 in trinity:main module with slight modifications.\r\n\r\nAfter this, running `trinity console` will call console() method. Which in turn will start an IPython or a Python REPL. Running `trinity console --vanilla-shell` will start a default Python REPL(even if IPython is installed).\r\n\r\nThis new shell will have `chain` object in the shell instance and the examples in quickstart(http://py-evm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html) document will work.\r\n\r\nTesting this is a bit tricky.\r\nI am thinking of returning shell instance from the `start_ipython_shell` and `start_python_shell` and doing assertions over its types and variables associated with the instance.\r\n\r\nAre these tests good enough for the basic happy-path testing?\r\n\r\ncc @gitcoinbot ",
