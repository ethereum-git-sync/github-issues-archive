It would be nice to have a basic implementation of it.\r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed\r\n\r\nImplement a stand-alone API for merklizing code.  I'd recommend something loosely using the following structure:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom typing import NamedTuple\r\n\r\nclass MerklizedCode(NamedTuple):\r\n    code_hash: Hash32  # keccak(...)\r\n    code_root: Hash32  # the actual merkle root\r\n    code_length: int\r\n    version: int\r\n    chunks: Tuple[[Tuple[bytes, int], ...]\r\n\r\ndef merklize_code(code: bytes) -> MerklizedCode:\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `MerklizedCode` class above is just a suggestion after a quick perusal of the spec.",
