    "body": "So, I've spent most of today on this and although I haven't managed to connect to a Parity node yet, I at least have a better idea of what is going on. First, we have a bug in `p2p.Server`, which always replies with a plain auth-ack even when it receives an EIP8 auth msg. However, even when we reply with an EIP8 auth-ack, parity still disconnects from us as soon as it receives our Hello message. I'm trying to get help from Parity developers because it's not easy to figure out what exactly is causing Parity to behave this way",
