  "body": "### What is wrong?\r\n\r\nNothing is wrong with current flow. This will be an improvement to current Py-EVM lightchain_shell.py module interactive mode shell.\r\n\r\nIPython is very widely used Python REPL. It provides tab completion/hinting, command history, command autocomplete, history navigation and many such handy features that help in development.\r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed\r\n\r\nlightchain_shell.py file can be modified to add support for running shell from the code. By default run the IPython shell if it is installed on the current PYTHONPATH. If an import error is raised run the default Python REPL with improvements like tab completion and history navigation through up key.",
