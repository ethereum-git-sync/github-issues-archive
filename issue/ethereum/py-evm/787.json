So if the UPnP device on the same `/24` address space is the second one listed, NAT port mapping fails.\r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed\r\n\r\nIf the first device mapping fails, keep iterating through the devices until one succeeds (or you run out of devices).\r\n\r\nI have a very dirty PR on my machine. I haven't pushed it yet because it's not critical path to get the alpha out the door.",
