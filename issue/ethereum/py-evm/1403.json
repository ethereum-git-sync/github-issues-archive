  "body": "### What is wrong?\r\n\r\nWhen running `trinity`, there are several warnings like this:\r\n```\r\nResourceWarning: unclosed resource <TCPTransport closed=False reading=False 0x2ab9dc8>\r\n```\r\n\r\n_You'll probably find more helpful results online with `ResourceWarning: unclosed transport <_SelectorSocketTransport ...`._\r\n\r\n_The text in the original quoted warning is produced by `uvloop` which reports the error differently and has less hits on a web search._\r\n\r\nThis is one of many different kinds of warnings mentioned in #1370 \r\n\r\nThe goal is not simply to hide these warnings but to resolve them.\r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed\r\n\r\nIt will take some investigation. You should be able to see stack trace info for the warning by starting trinity with:\r\n```sh\r\nPYTHONWARNINGS=error::ResourceWarning trinity\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nIt looks like roughly the solution is to do an `await asyncio.sleep(0)` in between closing a transport and letting the variable go out of scope (or explicitly deleting the instance). Or maybe there is a transport that is never being explicitly closed.",
