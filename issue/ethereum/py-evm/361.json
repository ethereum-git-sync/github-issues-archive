  "body": "### What is wrong?\r\n\r\nCurrently, all of the networking code lives under `evm.p2p`.  The *long* term plan is to split the core DevP2P components from this code into a separate library (probably the existing `devp2p` python library).  To prepare for this, we should start drawing firmer lines between the different sections of code that currently live in this repository.\r\n\r\n1. Py-EVM code: deals specifically with the EVM\r\n2. DevP2P code: deals with the generic DevP2P protocol\r\n3. Trinity code: deals with running an Ethereum node over the DevP2P protocol using the `py-evm` EVM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed\r\n\r\nPerform the following code re-organization.  This should be done in multiple steps to keep the pull requests smaller.\r\n\r\n1. Everything from `evm.p2p` to a new root level module `devp2p`\r\n2. Move everything from the new `devp2p` module which is not *strictly* DevP2P protocol code to `trinity.p2p`\r\n3. Find *any* imports in either of these sections of code which import from `evm.utils.*` and change them to use their own local utilities, **or** migrate the utility to `eth-utils` so it can be shared.\r\n",
