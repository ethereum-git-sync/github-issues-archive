We should figure out how to properly resolve this.\r\n\r\nThis is responsible for the recent [failing tests](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/py-evm/2188/workflows/163f52c4-adb8-4f7e-aea6-029334f59531) on `master`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nedit: It seems like this will be added back into default eventually, as noted [here](https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2022/10/18/rmd160-and-the-legacy-provider/). Not sure how long this will take. Perhaps it's best to xfail the tests for now until they start passing again? ðŸ¤” ",
