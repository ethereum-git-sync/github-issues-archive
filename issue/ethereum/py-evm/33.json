  "body": "### What is wrong?\r\n\r\nCurrently, PyEVM is using the `MemoryDB` from `py-trie` for it's database.\r\n\r\n1. We need to use something \"local\" to the project since this is not a dependency we want to have.\r\n2. We can't go forever using an in-memory database.\r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed\r\n\r\nThis can be done in multiple steps, but the general plan should be:\r\n\r\n1. Define the API for a database backend.  In general I think the `MemoryDB` class from the `py-trie` library is a good starting point.  This should go in `evm.db.backends.base`\r\n2. Create a local `MemoryDB` in PyEVM at `evm.db.backends.memory` and replace all uses of the `py-trie` version with the one local to the project.\r\n3. Create a new backend that is backed by something like RocksDB or LevelDB\r\n    - http://rocksdb.org/\r\n    - http://leveldb.org/\r\n4. If it seems useful/helpful create an API for getting these backends in much the same way as the ECC backend system works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFill this in if you know how to fix it.\r\n",
