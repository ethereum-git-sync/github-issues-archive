  "body": "### What is wrong?\r\n\r\nAll peer messages are put into a queue for later processing by `ChainSyncer`, and it is possible that by the time it reads a given message, the peer which sent it has already disconnected. When the msg contains data we requested, it makes sense for us to still process it normally, but when it is a data-request msg (e.g. `GetBlockHeaders`), we should simply ignore it.\r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed\r\n\r\nCurrently we have separate methods to handle each msg type, so we'd need to modify them all to return early when the peer is already disconnected. A better approach may be to add a flag (e.g. `is_data_request`) to the `Command` class, and have our dispatcher method (`_handle_msg()`) use that to ignore the data requests from peers that have already disconnected\r\n",
