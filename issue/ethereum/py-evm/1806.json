  "body": "### What is wrong?\r\n\r\nPrevious to https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/pull/1805 we had classes like `eth.vm.BaseVM` that served as the reference.  Now, we have interfaces defined in `eth.abc`.\r\n\r\nThere are now two primary problems.\r\n\r\n- Many of our docstrings might still refer to the wrong class.  Most class references in docstrings should be referencing the abc base classes now.\r\n- Most of the methods and properties on our abc base classes don't have docstrings.\r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed\r\n\r\nNeed to update existing docstrings to point to the right classes and add docstrings to all of the methods in the `eth.abc` directory.\r\n\r\nBonus points for documenting the class properties too.",
