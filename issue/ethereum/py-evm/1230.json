The end game should be that plugins can be just installed through pip and probably a config file manages them (enable/disable etc).\r\n\r\nConfig file doesn't need to be part of step one.\r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/pull/996#discussion_r201421200\r\n\r\nI might tackle this at some point but at the same time I think it's a great issue for anyone else interested.

I *guess* we can even keep it a manual method invocation at this code place. It should just be something like `plugin_manager.discover_plugins()` instead of passing a fixed list of plugins.\r\n\r\nDoes that give you the right pointer to explore further?",

Just a couple of things got along in the way this week. I will give you a final update on Sunday, either with a pull request or with the issues I am facing. I hope this is not too late, please do let me know if it needs to be done earlier and I will try my best to conclude on this sooner, if possible. ",
