  "body": "* py-evm Version: 0.2.0a11\r\n* OS: win\r\n\r\n### What is wrong?\r\n\r\n`pyethash` won't build on Windows, and probably won't anytime soon. See ConsenSys/ethjsonrpc#5\r\n\r\n >   The ethash code is C99, which is not well-supported under Windows.\r\n\r\nThis makes it impossible to install `py-evm` on Windows, as well as any package that depends on `py-evm` like the test suite in `web3.py`. (See https://github.com/ethereum/web3.py/issues/166)\r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed\r\n\r\nA couple options come to mind:\r\n\r\n1. Skip the `pyethash` install on Windows, so that Windows users can install the EVM without mining capability\r\n2. Move the `pyethash` dependency to an \"extra\" called something like `mining`.\r\n\r\nNumber 1 seems better, because it supports mining with a default installation, in non-Windows environments. Number 2 requires an install like `pip install py-evm[mining]` to support mining.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone see problems with 1 or 2, or a better solution?",
