The following note is present in the `_sync` method:\r\n\r\n> Fetch a batch of headers, in reverse order, starting from our current head, and find the common ancestor between our chain and the peer's.\r\n\r\nThis indicates that we *want* to do something similar to the approach in #832 \r\n\r\nSome thoughts:\r\n\r\n1. We need *intelligent* peer selection to handle this type of case where the client synced with the *wrong* chain.\r\n2. For the `_sync` loop I think we need a binary search approach to finding the common ancestor in a reasonable number of requests.\r\n3. When we do have to go back into history to find a common ancestor we **might** need to set an upper limit on how big of a chain re-org Trinity will allow.\r\n4. Maybe some sanity checks for each chain can be baked into the client with a *hint* for a minimum height that will be accepted for the pre-configured chains.",
