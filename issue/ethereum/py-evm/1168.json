The same behaviour is observed when running the commands manually (from within the same `virtualenv`).\r\n\r\nIt does indeed seem to be a race condition; not sure of the cause.\r\n\r\nThe issue is exacerbated by the fact that, upon failing to create/open the socket file, and printing the error message, the `trinity` process hangs indefinitely, preventing `systemd` from attempting a clean-up/restart (as specified by `Restart=on-failure`).\r\n\r\nI'll update the system (it still has Python 3.6 in the `virtualenv` and `trinity` trinity-v0.1.0-alpha.13) and see what can be done.",
