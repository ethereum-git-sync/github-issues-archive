It looks like a major reason for each of them is `uuid` which is spending 4.3% of total blocktime in `__hash__` and another 2.7% in `__eq__`.\r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed\r\n\r\n- Look into uuid alternatives\r\n- refactor the data store to always keep the latest data and have the changesets be backwards-facing diffs (since gets get is called 17k times, commit called 43k times, and `discard` only called 274 times, we should optimize for the \"happy path\" where everything gets committed).\r\n\r\nI think this will wrap up the `import_block()` performance sprint for now (`HexaryTrie` is the next major contributor, but that will take some serious new features, and I think it's fast enough to make Beam Sync progress)",

Since the journal itself only exists on one thread/process, and mostly invents its own checkpoints, I expect that to work fine.\r\n\r\nI can't think of a reason that checkpoints need to be unique across instances/runs",
