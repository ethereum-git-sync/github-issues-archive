  "body": "### What is wrong?\r\n\r\nThe current *snapshot* mechanism for rolling transactions back won't scale.  We can't expect to take a snapshot at the beginning of every transaction in real situations.\r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed\r\n\r\nWe need the ability to do fast rollbacks when transactions fail.  I believe that Journaling is best way to accomplish this.  Looking through the go-ethereum codebase, they store a list of actions that have occurred on the state database with sufficient information to *unroll* all of those changes.  It seems reasonable to copy this approach.\r\n\r\nAlternatively we could do what pyethereum does and keep all changes in a local cache and manually commit them when the transaction succeeds.\r\n\r\nI'm inclined to try the journaling approach first.",
