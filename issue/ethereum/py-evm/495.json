  "body": "`ChainDB.persist_trie_data_dict()` is yet another bottleneck I've found when running a full-node sync: it takes between 3 to 9 seconds to persist a batch of (128) bodies or (256) receipts, and most of that was spent on `JournalDB.set()`, which does a `wrapped_db.get()` before setting the new value.\r\n\r\nThis is specially problematic when performing a chain sync, but at the same a chain sync doesn't need a journaled DB, so maybe in that case we can just use a custom, non-journaled, DB class? Can anybody think of possible problems with that? Also, does that mean we'd need to extend trinity's DB-serving process to also offer a non-journaled chaindb?",
