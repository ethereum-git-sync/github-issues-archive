  "body": "Hi There,\r\n\r\n### What is wrong?\r\n\r\nI'm trying to create a contract with an account that has a nonce of 0 and it's failing due to the address generation. I can see here that the 1 is subtracted from the sender nonce: https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/blob/44e0ee4cb1756522ffe294a379d4735a25701003/eth/vm/forks/frontier/state.py#L68.\r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed\r\n\r\nIs this intentional? If so, are there ways around it?\r\n",
