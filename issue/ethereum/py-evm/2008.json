  "body": "* py-evm Version: 0.4.0-alpha.4\r\n\r\n### What is wrong?\r\n\r\nThe documentation mentions `MiningChain` at the bottom of `docs/cookbook/index.rst`, however `docs/guides/understanding_the_mining_process.rst` does not show an example of `MiningChain` instantiation. A `chain_class` is assumed to exist from the start of the mining guide.\r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed\r\n\r\nMaking the code in `docs/guides/understanding_the_mining_process.rst` self-contained (so, including a `MiningChain` instantiation) would help a lot. As a total noob, I have had a lot of trouble getting the mining example to work.",
