  "body": "* py-evm Version: master @ 942765d\r\n\r\n### What is wrong?\r\n\r\nI *think* this is what's happening. I'm debugging a different part of the stack, so can't dive in this moment:\r\n\r\nI built a chain using `eth.tools.builder.chain.build()` and it created transactions in a block that would not be permitted by that block's gas limit. It came back to bite me when I tried to sync off the built chain on another instance (which correctly identified that the gas limit was exceeded).\r\n\r\nI used something like:\r\n```py\r\nchain = build(...)\r\nchain.apply_transaction(txn)\r\nchain.mine_block()\r\n```\r\nThe transaction was added, but the gas in the transaction was above the limit.\r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed\r\n\r\n:man_shrugging: I don't know the builder code very well. It seems like it should just be passing through the `apply_transaction` method, which I expect to validate (since `chain.apply_transaction()` calls `vm.apply_transaction()`, which calls `vm.validate_transaction_against_header()`).",
