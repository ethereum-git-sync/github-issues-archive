  "body": "\r\n### What is wrong?\r\n\r\nThis is somewhat related to #1272 but yet different enough to create a separate issue about it.\r\n\r\nThe revealed type of a function such as `LightPeerChain.get_block_header_by_hash` is currently `Any`. This means, we can call it as `LightPeerChain.get_block_header_by_hash('foobar`), `LightPeerChain.get_block_header_by_hash(1, 2, 3)` or in any other way without `mypy` noticing anything at all.\r\n\r\nLet's take a look at the function definiton.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@alru_cache(maxsize=1024, cache_exceptions=False)\r\n@service_timeout(COMPLETION_TIMEOUT)\r\nasync def get_block_header_by_hash(self, block_hash: Hash32) -> BlockHeader:\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are several problems, one is further outlined in #1272. Let's remove the decorators and notice what `mypy` things about it then.\r\n\r\nTurns out, once we remove the decorators the revealed type becomes `def (self: trinity.sync.light.service.LightPeerChain, block_hash: Any) -> typing.Coroutine[Any, Any, eth.rlp.headers.BlockHeader]`\r\n\r\nThe problem here is that the decorators redefine the function without type information. This has already been [discussed here](https://github.com/ethereum/eth-utils/pull/88) once. \r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed\r\n\r\nDo one of the following things:\r\n\r\n- either create type stubs\r\n\r\nor \r\n\r\n- dive into [PEP561](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0561/) and  https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installed_packages.html and see if we can get type safety for external libs without stubs by now.\r\n",
