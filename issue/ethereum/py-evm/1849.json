This works fine with the mainnet pow based consensus where we can validate each header without relying on any external data (not entirely true as it relies on a cache that it maintains locally).\r\n\r\nIt crumbles with clique consensus though. In clique consensus, to validate headers you have to reach out to the database to load and save snapshots that hold a set of currently legal signers per checkpoint.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/7b32d2a47017570c44cd7f8a83612a29656c9857/consensus/clique/clique.go#L348-L426\r\n\r\nMaybe anyone has other clever ideas but I *think*  we'll have to lift `validate_header` and `validate_seal` to become instance methods so that they can depend on a consensus engine which in turn depends on the database.
