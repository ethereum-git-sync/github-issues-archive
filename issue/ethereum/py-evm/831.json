I think invoking that command should always be a deliberate decision by the user and note done automatically because e.g. \"Adress already in use\" may be a totally legitimate thing in some situations and may not be necessarily caused by an unclean shutdown.\r\n\r\nThis is obviously more a workaround than a proper fix so I'm just throwing this idea in as an interim solution.\r\n",

The socket file isn't removed for me on shutdown, but that doesn't seem to be a problem for starting trinity back up. Maybe an OS-specific behavior?\r\n\r\n_Edit: oh, or a running process still had a lock on the socket. Removing it didn't stop the hung process, but did allow a second process to create a new IPC socket._",
