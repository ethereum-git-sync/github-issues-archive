Unfortunately, that means we are missing out to measure pretty much all optimizations that are about reducing the number of hits to read/write to the database.\r\n\r\nIn other words, if some optimizations save e.g. two hits to the DB we will barely see any difference in the benchmarks as data updates in-memory are just super fast compared to the actual cost when we hit the disk (which will be the case with something like `LevelDB`.\r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed\r\n\r\nRun at least *some* benchmarks against `LevelDB`. I say *some* because the one argument against this, is that it will increase our CI times.\r\n",
