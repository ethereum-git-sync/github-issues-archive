  "body": "### What is wrong?\r\n\r\nCurrently, the `Computation` object houses *lots* of information and sub-APIs for things like maniputlating the stack, consuming gas, etc.  This creates a lot of public API surface area since we are effectively support *two* public APIs for anything needed from a sub-property of the `Computation` object.\r\n\r\n- `Computation.memory` is the API for getting at the `Memory`\r\n- `Computation.memory.read` is the API for reading from memory.\r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed\r\n\r\nI propose moving **all** sub-APIs to private properties and only exposing them through a single public API on the `Computation` object itself.\r\n\r\nFor example.\r\n\r\n- `Computation.memory -> Computation._memory`\r\n- `Computation.memory.read() -> Computation.memory_read()`\r\n\r\nIn the process we should organize the body of the `Computation` object by subject/sub-API meaning that we co-locate all of the *memory* APIs together, and so on for each category.\r\n\r\n#### Maybe use abbreviated suffixes\r\n\r\nSome of these accessors can be long:\r\n\r\n- `Computation.gas_meter.consume_gas`\r\n\r\nFor APIs that are unambiguous like this one we can just use:\r\n\r\n- `Computation.consume_gas()`\r\n\r\nHowever, some APIs will need to be prefixed such as `Computation.stack.pop()`.  In cases like this we should use a prefixed method name:\r\n\r\n- `Computation.stack_pop()`\r\n- `Computation.memory_read()`\r\n\r\n#### Common base class\r\n\r\nThe  `BaseComputation` class should be converted to have only STUB implementations of these methods with `NotImplementedError` exceptions being raised in the methods.  \r\n\r\nThen, a `Computation` class can be created at `evm.computation.Computation` which contains all of the current implementations of these methods.\r\n\r\n#### Documentation\r\n\r\nThis should also include a page in the `docs/` that lists all of these APIs and has a basic human readable description of what they do.",

    "body": "👍  Occasionally it's nice to be able to `dir()` at the repl, so `dir(computation)` would be much nicer this way.\r\n\r\n> `Computation.gm_consume_gas()`\r\n\r\nMaybe this could even just be `Computation.consume_gas()`. It seems unambiguously named. The fact that it's called gas meter seems like an unnecessary implementation detail.\r\n\r\nThe other main modules seem to work follow the memory example nicely:\r\n- stack\r\n- memory\r\n- code\r\n\r\nLike: `Computation.stack_pop()`\r\n\r\n> A possible argument against this is that the sharding changes may introduce new APIs which are not used pre-sharding, and in some cases, potentially removing APIs which are no longer part of the sharding EVM.\r\n\r\nSeems like BaseComputation should just shrink, then, to the intersection of the APIs. I imagine there would still be a useful subset of methods to document.",

We're only going to consider an issue as formally claimed at the point where a pull request has been opened demonstrating active work on the issue.\r\n\r\nThis is meant to prevent people from \"claiming\" something on a Monday with the intent to work on it later in the week or that weekend.  This is **not** meant to discourage people from claiming issues, but rather to incentivize people to only claim things when they have the time to actively work on them.  \r\n\r\nWe exercise some common sense, granting some leeway to claim something and get a pull request open later that day.  This policy is directed towards a claim on gitcoin that shows no work after a day or two.\r\n\r\nWe're working on getting some formal procedures in place for bounties which will document these policies.",
