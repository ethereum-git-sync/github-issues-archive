    "body": "@johnys222 gotcha. So you basically want to write your own program that uses `py-evm` as a library. You should be able to just specify `py-evm` as a `install_requires` in your `setup.py` file and then install dependencies through pip.\r\n\r\nBut here's the deal, using `py-evm` as a library is one of the major uses cases that we want to support so let me roll up my sleeves and write a quick guide for our documentation that will walk you through creating a simple application/script that uses Py-EVM to e.g. measure the gas cost of some task.\r\n\r\n",
