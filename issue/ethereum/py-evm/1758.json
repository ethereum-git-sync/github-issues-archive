  "body": "Extract `ExecutionContext` out as something that's adjacent to `State` instead of embedded in it. When you want to execute, you run it through the `VM` which combines state with the execution context generated with the header in order to actually build a computation.\r\n\r\nThis makes State as easy to initialize as `AccountDB` was.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking something like:\r\n\r\n- move `BaseState.execution_context` -> `BaseVM.execution_context`\r\n- move `BaseState.get_computation` -> `BaseVM.get_computation` (which builds with its local execution context)\r\n- rename `ExecutionContext` -> `BlockContext`\r\n- Computation learns about `BlockContext`, like it knows about `TransactionContext`\r\n- `BaseState` now only needs a db and state root to be generated\r\n\r\nNote that there is some hacky code in `eth.chains.base.Chain.from_genesis` should be cleaned up when `State` is easier to initialize.\r\n\r\ncc @lithp\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @carver in https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/pull/1755_",
