We could benefit a lot from using them.\r\n\r\n[This stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32557920/what-are-type-hints-in-python-3-5) does a great job at describing their main benefits.\r\n\r\n[pyannotate](https://github.com/dropbox/pyannotate) would come in handy if it had support for py3-style annotations, but meanwhile we can add them manually\r\n\r\n[monkeytype](https://engineering.instagram.com/let-your-code-type-hint-itself-introducing-open-source-monkeytype-a855c7284881) may actually be more useful than pyannotate as it generates py3-style annotations\r\n\r\n### Definition of done\r\n\r\n- type hints for all of `evm`, `p2p`, and `trinity` modules.\r\n- individual `mypy` CI runs for each of these modules using `mypy --follow-imports=silent --ignore-missing-imports --check-untyped-defs --disallow-incomplete-defs -p <module>`\r\n\r\nThis should not be done as a single pull request, but rather many small ones to iteratively add type hints, slowly expanding the `mypy` coverage as hints are added.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

My personal preference is \"yes\" but I'm ok to have tests be treated as an exception to this rule if there's some pushback on this.\r\n\r\nPlease let's not do that. Type annotations are mainly useful as documentation and in allowing us to run checks for code that is not tested in an automated fashion, which is not the case for our test functions. Also, pretty much any errors reported by mypy on test code would also cause test failures/errors, making mypy completely redundant there. If there was absolutely no effort involved in adding them and they didn't reduce legibility it'd be a different matter, but that's not the case.",
