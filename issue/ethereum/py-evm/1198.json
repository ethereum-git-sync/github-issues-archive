  "body": "### What is wrong?\r\n\r\nThe `PeerPool` is used widely across most components.  Our current model for sharing APIs across process boundaries is using the `Manager` and `Proxy` object pattern from the `multiprocessing` module.\r\n\r\nThis is however proving an untenable solution.\r\n\r\n- Significant overhead and *setup* needed.\r\n- Hides the *overhead* of cross process communication\r\n- Doesn't cooperate well with type checker.\r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed\r\n\r\nAs proposed here: https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1075#issuecomment-413489849\r\n\r\nWe'll establish a central event bus for message passing between components.  The `PeerPool` will then expose an external *public* API through the event bus from which consumers of the peer pool APIs can interact.\r\n\r\n> Note: This likely extends to the `Peer` classes themselves as well since components will need to do more than just talk with the peer pool, but also, interact with the peer instances themselves.",

    "body": "@pipermerriam  Here's just a quick recap of our recent call. Feel free to edit to make changes.\r\n\r\n**PeerPoolAPI**\r\n\r\n```py\r\nclass PeerPoolAPI:\r\n\r\n    def __init__(self, event_bus: Endpoint):\r\n        self.event_bus = event_bus\r\n\r\n\r\n    async def get_peer_count() -> int:\r\n        response = await self.event_bus.request(PeerCountRequest())\r\n        return response.peer_count\r\n\r\n    async def other_peer_pool_thingy() -> Whatever:\r\n        ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis `PeerPoolAPI` can be instantiated and used in any process (and hence also any isolated plugin) that holds a connection to the event bus (which by default all plugins do)\r\n\r\nIn general, the return values of this API will be shallow DTOs and hence there will exist similar APIs e.g. for specific peer protocol operations that consume such DTOs as call parameters and will match them in their local process against a specific peer (fat object, non-dto sibling) and invoke specific actions.\r\n\r\n**EventBusHandler**\r\n\r\nInside the current `PeerPool` there should run an `EventBusHandler` that listens for all incoming events and responds to them. Same thing for other APIs (e.g peer APIs).\r\n\r\nThis should run as child services.",
