  "body": "This is a follow up of [this discussion](https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/pull/459#discussion_r174853525)\r\n\r\n### What is wrong?\r\n\r\nWe currently have many API that take/return `bytes` [1] where we could really benefit from stricter type checking by introducing [`NewType`](http://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/kinds_of_types.html#newtypes)s. In short a `NewType` lets us create a substitute for a type (e.g. `miles` for `int`) so that an API that takes `miles` as inputs can not be called with any arbitrary `int` instead. These kind of errors already killed NASA missions when `km` and `miles` where [accidentally twisted](http://edition.cnn.com/TECH/space/9909/30/mars.metric.02/)\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] also applies to other types (e.g. `int`) but is mostly problematic with `bytes` in our case\r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed\r\n\r\n1. Create NewTypes for types that we currently define to loosely (mostly `bytes` but we should check also our usage of `int`)\r\n\r\n2. Put them in a new library `eth_typings` that can be distributed on `pypi` so that it can be shared across different projects",
