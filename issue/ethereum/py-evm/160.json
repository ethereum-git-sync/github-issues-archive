  "body": "### What is wrong?\r\n\r\nThere are a few cases where we need to make multiple database updates and have them either all succeed or all fail.\r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed\r\n\r\nImplement a new class `BatchDB` in a new module `evm/db/batch.py`\r\n\r\nThis class should serve as a *wrapper* in much the same way as the current `JournalDB` found in the module `evm/db/journal.py`.\r\n\r\nThis class should be usable as a context manager similar to the following:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nwith BatchDB(db) as batch_db:\r\n    batch_db[b'a'] = b'arst'  # doesn't write the key to the database but rather to a local cache.\r\n    assert batch_db[b'a'] == b'arst'  # intelligently returns the value from the cache\r\n    batch_db[b'b'] = b'tsra'  \r\n# upon exiting the context, it writes all of the keys from the cache into the underlying database.\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr via an alternate API that requires manually committing the batch.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nbatch_db = BatchDB(db)\r\nbatch_db[b'a'] = b'arst'  # doesn't write the key to the database but rather to a local cache.\r\nassert batch_db[b'a'] == b'arst'  # intelligently returns the value from the cache\r\nbatch_db[b'b'] = b'tsra'  \r\nbatch_db.commit()\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf an exception is raised before committing (or leaving the context when used as a context manager) none of the changes should be committed to the database.",
