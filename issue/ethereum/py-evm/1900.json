With the upcoming refactoring of the consensus mechanism (currently brewing in #1899), there's an explicit mechanism of a `ConsensusContextAPI` that can be used to provide state to the consensus engine that should remain static across the lifetime of a chain (or potentially across the lifetime of a chain segment under a specific fork)\r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed\r\n\r\nAfter #1899 landed, refactor PoW handling to use that mechanism.",
