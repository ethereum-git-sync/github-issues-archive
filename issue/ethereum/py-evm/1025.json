That seems to cause them treat us as a useless peer and disconnect.\r\n\r\nIt'd explain why when running on ropsten trinity can keep a high peer count but on mainnet most nodes disconnect shortly after the initial handshake.\r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed\r\n\r\nNeed to handle data requests while performing the DAO fork check. Or maybe keep ignoring them during the DAO fork check, but re-queue them once the check is completed\r\n",

    "body": "Ideally we would want to perform the DAO fork check before adding the peer to the pool and letting the `ChainSyncer` handle its messages (e.g. reply to data requests), that's why I thought about having `peer.ensure_same_side_on_dao_fork()` re-adding the ignored messages to the queue, but since that runs before the peer has been added to the pool, there are no subscriber queue(s) to add those messages to. \r\n\r\nOne possible solution would be to have the `PeerPool.start_peer()` call `peer.ensure_same_side_on_dao_fork()` (changed to return the messages it ignored) because it can then re-add those messages to the subscribers at the same time it finally adds the peer to its list of connected nodes.",

I've been running it on mainnet and it's syncing reliably keeping a peer count of 25, but it still hasn't synced up to the DAO fork block and I know geth will treat peers differently depending on whether their announced chain HEAD is past that, so it'd be great if you could give it a spin in case you have a DB synced past the DAO fork block",

    "body": "Another way of fixing this would be to let peers be added to `PeerPool` without the DAO fork check, and then perform the check in `ChainSyncer` by keeping a list of peers for which the check is pending and having its `_handle_msg_loop()` do the following for every msg read from the queue:\r\n   1. If peer has passed DAO fork check, process msg normally  \r\n   2. Else if cmd is not BlockHeaders, add it to the list of msgs received by that peer and return\r\n   3. Else if cmd is BlockHeaders\r\n    3.1 If DAO fork check is successful, handle all previously received messages from the peer\r\n    3.2 Else disconnect from peer and discard all previous messages\r\n\r\nEDIT: Some issues with this approach are:\r\n1. The `PeerPool` does not guarantee that peers are on the same side of the fork as us, so we might end up having to duplicate the check in other `PeerPoolSubscriber`s\r\n2. The msgs from peers pending the DAO check will be added to the `ChainSyncer` queue, and there may be a big backlog of msgs from other peers, which makes it hard for us to decide when to timeout and give up on a peer that is pending the DAO check\r\n",
