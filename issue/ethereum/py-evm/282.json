  "body": "### What is wrong?\r\n\r\nOur `PeerPool` currently provides no API for its clients to choose the _best_  peer when they need to make a request, so they end up picking one randomly.\r\n\r\nThe `PeerPool` also has to either use a hard-coded list of peers or run the discovery bootstrap from scratch every time it is initialized since we don't have a persistent DB with peer details (i.e. peer ID, chain ID, genesis hash, supported sub-protocols, latest hash/difficulty)\r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed\r\n\r\nWe need to keep peer details/reputation in a persistent store so that the `PeerPool` can reuse known good peers from previous runs as well as provide APIs for clients to pick the _best_ peer for a request.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how to define _best_ here, but I believe a weighted round-robin based on a peer's latency would be a good start. Although we may also need a way to restrict the choices only to those peers that are at least at a certain block height/td\r\n",
