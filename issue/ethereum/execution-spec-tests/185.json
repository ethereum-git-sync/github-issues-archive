    "body": "> This is only partly and temporarily useful.

The comparison would be made within the execution-spec-tests framework and the test case would fail if any of the generated test fixtures fail. In which case you could absolutely run this process locally or as part of your dev tooling. You would just have the other t8n tool(s) as dependencies. \r\n\r\nWould it be useful in that case?\r\n",
