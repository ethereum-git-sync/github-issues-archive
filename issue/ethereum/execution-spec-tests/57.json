They use different forknames and chainid. \r\nwould be nice to have a config file options that specify following:\r\n\r\n- t8n tool to use (path or smth)\r\n- chainid to generate transactions with. \r\n- forknames map (testName -> actualName that is sent to t8n)\r\n\r\nor support it as cmd options when running the test generation. \r\nthis is a request feature low priority.
