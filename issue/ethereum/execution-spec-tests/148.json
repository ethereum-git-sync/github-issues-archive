    "body": "This had nothing to do with solc or its compilation time. This long delay was triggered when `test_yul[large]` failed due to specifying  `--evm-version Shanghai` to solc. This test case was failed due to the solc compiling \"6000\" to \"5f\" (PUSH0), so that the produced bytecode differed from the (hardcoded) expected bytecode.\r\n\r\nThe delay appears to rather occur in pytest and is probably due to the large and complicated diff that pytest performs on the two very long byte arrays. Indeed, the delay was only visible when pytest was ran with `-v` (without `-v` presumably only the start of the byte arrays were diffed).",
