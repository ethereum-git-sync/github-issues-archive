    "body": "Great! Yeah that sounds correct.\r\n\r\n_Although you have it working I am going to leave this here for future reference:_\r\n\r\nHere is a fast way to build geth from source in order to get the most up to date `evm` binary:\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum.git && cd go-ethereum\r\nmake all\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo add the built `evm` binary to PATH, the most flexible option is to create a symlink to the binary. I use linux so for me this is: \r\n```\r\nln -s build/bin/evm /usr/bin/evm\r\n```\r\nThis allows you to change branches and re-build the `evm` binary on the fly. ",
