    "body": "> test format missing `genesisRLP` field\r\n\r\nIs this field used anywhere? AFAIK, all clients initialize the genesis block using the genesis config and them import all blocks after genesis via `import`-like subcommand. This is how hive works across all clients.\r\n\r\n> genesis block has difficulty != 0, but also has withdrawalsRoot defined which makes it Merge. Merge block has difficulty = 0.\r\n\r\nNot sure if this is true. In the `env` argument to `t8n`, yes, difficulty must equal 0 when post-merge and a prevRandom value must be provided. However, the genesis header in the filled test is a normal block header encoded in json, which currently [does not support](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/blob/939255f467f9c5700a65426159afdfc0e0a66060/src/schemas/block.yaml#L1) prevRandom.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
