  "body": "about the x.  here is the idea. \nx is a set of actions that we want to test. Y is a vector of post conditions for F(x)=Y. we need a template that will take x\nand execute it in different context (create tests). For each context i we need to verify that Fi(x)=Yi (transition for set of actions x on a template i makes post Yi)\nThe contexts are templates (but not limited to):\n```\nX is in transaction deployment code (create transaction)\nX is in CREATE init code \nX is in CREATE2 init code \n\nX is in the contract code (being called by transaction)   and [OOG, REVERT, SELFDESTRUCT, NOTHING] happens\nX is in the contract code (being called by CALL) and [OOG, REVERT, SELFDESTRUCT, NOTHING] happens\nX is in the contract code (being called by CALLCODE) and [OOG, REVERT, SELFDESTRUCT, NOTHING] happens\nX is in the contract code (being called by DELEGATECALL) and [OOG, REVERT, SELFDESTRUCT, NOTHING] happens\nX is in the contract code (being called by STATICCALL) and [OOG, REVERT, SELFDESTRUCT, NOTHING] happens\n```",
