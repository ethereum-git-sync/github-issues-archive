Forks older than Constantinople have been deprecated as of Solidity [0.8.22](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.8.22).\r\n\r\nFrom the release notes:\r\n> IMPORTANT NOTE:\r\n> This release deprecates support for EVM versions older than Constantinople for the reason of ruling out the need to maintain multiple complex code paths or workarounds for ancient EVM versions. In case you rely on the support for such EVM versions, please reach out to us.\r\n\r\nWe need to decide whether it's ok for us to just use the oldest supported fork available. Should be ok, but worth discussing.",
