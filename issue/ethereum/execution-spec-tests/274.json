As of ec18f1e5be520e6d0bc10bf183e8497379c312e2 / 25 Aug 2023 both repos use v17, which doesn't \"properly\" support Python 3.11. According to the [v18 releases](https://github.com/ofek/coincurve/releases/tag/v18.0.0) adds Python 3.11 support.\r\n\r\nWhilst we haven't observed any problems using v17 with Python 3.11, extra dependencies are required to install it on macOS:\r\n```\r\nbrew install autoconf automake libtool\r\n```\r\nUpgrading to v18 removes this extra dependency requirement; confirmed by @spencer-tb.",
