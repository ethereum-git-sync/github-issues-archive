  "body": "execution-spec-tests and [execution-specs](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs) has [coincurve](https://github.com/ofek/coincurve) as a dependency. As of ec18f1e5be520e6d0bc10bf183e8497379c312e2 / 25 Aug 2023 both repos use v17, which doesn't \"properly\" support Python 3.11. According to the [v18 releases](https://github.com/ofek/coincurve/releases/tag/v18.0.0) adds Python 3.11 support.\r\n\r\nWhilst we haven't observed any problems using v17 with Python 3.11, extra dependencies are required to install it on macOS:\r\n```\r\nbrew install autoconf automake libtool\r\n```\r\nUpgrading to v18 removes this extra dependency requirement; confirmed by @spencer-tb.\r\n\r\nUpdate: As we install execution-specs as a dependency, we won't be able to update to coincurve 18 unless execution-specs also upgrades to v18.\r\n\r\nHere's the output of install execution-specs-tests as `pip install -e .[docs,lint,test]` if we upgrade to 18:\r\n```\r\nINFO: pip is looking at multiple versions of ethereum to determine which version is compatible with other requirements. This could take a while.\r\nERROR: Cannot install test-filler and test-filler[docs,lint,test]==1.0.0 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.\r\n\r\nThe conflict is caused by:\r\n    test-filler[docs,lint,test] 1.0.0 depends on coincurve==18.0.0\r\n    ethereum 0.1.0 depends on coincurve<18 and >=17\r\n\r\nTo fix this you could try to:\r\n1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified\r\n2. remove package versions to allow pip attempt to solve the dependency conflict\r\n\r\nERROR: ResolutionImpossible: for help visit https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/topics/dependency-resolution/#dealing-with-dependency-conflicts\r\n```",
