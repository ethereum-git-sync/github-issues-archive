    "body": "From  #328:\r\n> I think it's a great idea to add the \"file system\" implementation of evaluate() from evmone into TransitionTool so that other tools can use it.\r\n> \r\n> However, I would prefer to not have Geth as a default and instead insist that all t8n tools that should be used provide an interface. I don't think this is unreasonable, as the interface module is < 40 lines (see the evmone interface, in this, PR for example).\r\n> \r\n> So while I'd like to keep _evaluate_stream() and _evaluate_filesystem(), I would prefer to add a separate interface for your custom t8n which must provide either a -v or --version flag which contains its name to make it identifiable.\r\n> \r\n> The reason being, is that I'd like to avoid ambiguity about which features a t8n tools supports and which not, like tracing, for example. I'd prefer to have this explicit in the implementation and not stumble over bugs/inconsistencies because the tools are consistent.\r\n> \r\n> Further reasoning, is that we still need to signal to GethTransitionTool which version of the evaluate function to use. Currently, in this implementation, it defaults to \"filesystem\" which changes the current behavior, which should stay as \"stream\", imo. To be entirely flexible with a \"default\" fallback tool, we'd have to add a command-line flag which defines whether to use \"stream\" or \"filesystem\", this clutters the interface; again, I'd prefer to keep it consistent.",
