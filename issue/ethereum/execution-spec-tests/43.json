I think it would be nice to refactor this a bit on a different PR to make a clear distinction that block structure is the source of the test information, but env is the structure that should contain all the correct information at some point.\r\n> \r\n> I think this same mistake could be present in the StateTests, it's just that we don't have any withdrawals tests written in the StateTests format.\r\n",
