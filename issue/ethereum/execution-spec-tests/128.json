  "body": "The execution-spec-tests Python code is [black formatted](https://github.com/psf/black) which is checked via tox (and enforced in Github Actions). Without proper tooling this check is tough, especially for non-Python developers, who may not even be used to an enforced coding style (black). \r\n\r\nVS Code's [`ms-python.python`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) and [`ms-python.black-formatter`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.black-formatter) allow the user to format the current file with black formatting in the editor, even automatically upon auto-save. Documenting and providing reasonable default settings that allow this could save a lot of pain for developers looking to contribute to tests, but don't use Python day-to-day.\r\n\r\nTodo:\r\n- [x] Reasonable default settings.\r\n- [x] How to handle `.vscode/` in `.gitignore`.\r\n- [x] Settings file name: `.vscode/settings.json` or `.vscode/settings.{default,recommended}.json`, see also https://github.com/danceratopz/execution-spec-tests/pull/11#discussion_r1192650811.\r\n- [ ] Check usefulness of specifying an [editorconfig](https://editorconfig.org/) to offer a solution to developers who don't use VS Code.\r\n- [ ] Can we and do we want to set a default Python interpreter/environment? That aligns with `./venv`in the docs, for example.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/danceratopz/execution-spec-tests/pull/11 introduced a first version of the settings (which seems to work well with no user settings `$HOME/.config/Code/User/settings.json`) , this ticket is to remind us to complete the job.",
