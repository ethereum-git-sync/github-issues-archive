    "body": "> * Better check the error that the client returns when the blockchain test is executed, and verify that the client detected the invalid transaction\r\n\r\nThis check could be performed either in:\r\n1. `blocktest` directly, or\r\n2.  In a wrapper to blockest (like `consume`?) that inspects the fixture for expected exception behavior and checks that this matches the log/stderr output from `evm blocktest`.\r\n\r\nOption 1. is perhaps achievable, but could be tricky, as it requires re-ordering the test execution logic by checking exceptions, if specified in the test, before checking state/transaction roots. This may be out of the question, as some checks which happen within the EVM itself can't simply be re-ordered. \r\n\r\nAdding 2. could be a helpful check that gives us more confidence in our tests and assures us that we're not seeing false positives. However, it seems a poor approach to depend on this entirely if the `blocktest` command can't detect fails directly and requires external tooling.\r\n\r\n> * Include the test type `TransactionTest` in `execution-spec-tests` for this kind of tests, and also `StateTest`\r\n\r\nThis seems to be the approach to focus on for invalid txs as we don't need the additional data and checks.",
