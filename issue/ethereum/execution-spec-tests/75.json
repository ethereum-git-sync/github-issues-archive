    "body": "Thanks for this! We tried to address the latter in this PR as I was having issues debugging tests in hive for the same reason: #69 \r\n\r\nI am open to adding the file name to the name within the fixture, as I assume if I am a client developer using the tests I will have only have `000/shanghai`. When running these tests in hive I preprocess the file name and append it to the head of the latter. If its for versioning maybe you could try the same?\r\n\r\n> The end result of the PR: #69 was that if the fixture_name in `<fixture_name>.json` was descriptive enough we did not need the name added within the test i.e. `000/shanghai`. We chose to keep it like this as we could simply use `fixture_name/000/shanghai` to determine the test (as the fixture_name correlates directly to the test_case name in a (python) module, i.e. `test_use_value_in_contract()` in `withdrawals.py`).\r\n> \r\n> If however, we have multiple tests that are distinctly different within a fixture file (testing _slightly_ different things within a module), we would add a `tag` to the yielded test. For example in `multiple_withdrawals_same_address.json` we have 2 tests. \r\n> - The first test `000/shanghai` or using the test name `multiple_withdrawals_same_address/000/shanghai` tests that withdrawals can be done to the same address multiple times in the same block. \r\n> - The second test `001/multiple_blocks/shanghai` does the same thing but for multiple blocks hence has the `tag=\"multiple_blocks\"`. With the fixture name this is: `multiple_withdrawals_same_address/001/multiple_blocks/shanghai`.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
