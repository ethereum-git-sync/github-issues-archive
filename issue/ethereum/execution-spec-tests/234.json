  "body": "When using a custom genesis environment to set a custom gas limit, it results in an invalid gas limit value being set for blocks 1 and after, since no gas limit is specified for these later blocks, the default is used, which would be outside of the allowed increase/decrease of gas limit in a 1 block period.\r\n\r\nE.g. if `gas_limit` is set to 10_000_000_000 in `genesis_environment`, and no `gas_limit` is set for any of the blocks in the test, the environment gas limit for block 1 reverts to the default value (100_000_000_000_000_000) in this line: https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/blob/d88a26ddb1a03d881f841b43cdb686a705ba3f0a/src/ethereum_test_tools/spec/blockchain_test.py#L268\r\n\r\nThe default `gas_limit` is much higher than the allowed increase per block, therefore the block is invalid, and the block processing will fail:\r\n```\r\nblock #1 insertion into chain failed: invalid gas limi\r\nt: have 100000000000000000, want 10000000000 +-= 9765624\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe need to either:\r\n1) take into account the parent gas used before setting a default value in the block 1\r\n2) check the gas limit delta from block to block and warn the tester when the value is invalid",
