This test also performs multiple withdrawals from the same validator index to multiple addresses, which is an unusual test case in itself (there is a 1-1 mapping between validator and withdrawal index and this can not be changed). Surely it's good to test this, but perhaps we should additionally test with more typical values, as found on the beacon chain?",
