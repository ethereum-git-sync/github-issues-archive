  "body": "The issuance graph on the launchpad shows maximum validator return of 21.6% (at 524,288 ETH staked) and 4.9% return at 10m ETH staked. However, digging into the code that generates these numbers (https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-deposit/blob/83f34b82a967ba52532f58e7c28467982429a4a2/src/utils/calculateEth2Rewards.ts) it seems that this is based on average network participation of 95% and individual validator uptime of 99%. These assumptions are important and should be stated clearly on the launchpad.\r\n\r\nAlso the `calculateEth2Rewards` function seems to rely on a quadratic approximation of the expected inclusion delay reward using `rewardAdjModifier`. However the rationale for this approximation is not documented anywhere. How was this approximation derived? It looks as though it assumes a fixed penalty for every slot delay (`oneSlotLatePenalty`) but this isn't consistent with the spec, which indicates that inclusion delays lead to an inversely proportional scaling of the reward, not linear.\r\n\r\n@flamingYawn ",

    "body": "To add to this, it looks like this calculation may be based on a previous version of the eth2 spec which used a linear inclusion delay reward (see [this version from August 2019](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/469f3d84a36a72453db503d32c5f2d370b401a1c/specs/core/0_beacon-chain.md#rewards-and-penalties-1)).\r\n\r\nThe mainnet version of the spec scales the delay inclusion reward by the inverse of the delay (i.e. for delay n the reward is scaled by 1/n). The expected reward for below 100% participation can be calculated by [summing the geometric series](https://github.com/hermanjunge/eth2-reward-simulation/blob/master/assumptions.md#attester-incentives).",
