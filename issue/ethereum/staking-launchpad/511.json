    "body": "Yeah, I think see your point. @remyroy are you saying that even if users check off all these boxes, they will still have a few things to do before the actual upgrade?\r\n\r\nThe intent was certainly not to imply that, and I can definitely see how it could add some confusion. \r\n\r\nAssuming I understand you correctly, I agree with @hwwhww that we should just make a note of this. Hesitant to remove everything entirely as it's otherwise public info that is out there, just consolidated to help stakers get ready. @hwwhww I kind of like the idea of adding a final checkbox that is disabled, regarding setting the TTD, and we can add a note to make it clear this is not yet available, and to stay tuned. \r\n\r\nI am happy to put up a fix for this",
