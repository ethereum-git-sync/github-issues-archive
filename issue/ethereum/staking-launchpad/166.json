  "body": "When I set up 30 validators on launchpad I had enough GöETH for only 3 validators so I funded only those at first. after I got more GöETH I launched the launchpad website and skipped all the way to the point of dropping the depoist_data JSON file into the browser, at that point it showed me the list of validators for funding - I was not aware that those that have already been funded are also listed as they all show a \"start\" status - so I ended up with a validator with 64 ETH unintentionally. In the main-net this would have been pretty frustrating - not sure if thats a bug or by design, but I would definitely show those validators as \"funded\" with an option to \"add funds\" for example, or hide them altogether, but if thats not an option then I would at least have a visible alert saying \"PLEASE NOTE THIS LIST MAY ALREADY INCLUDE FUNDED VALIDATORS\" \r\n\r\nOn that note, now after alll validators have taken a hit last week, how can I send them another ETH to be at 32+ balance for max earnings? Launchpad can only send 32 ETH and no option to send 1 for example. Is there a way to do that? \r\n\r\nThanks!",
