If it's possible to integrate those tools in this demo website it should be possible to do so in the Launchpad https://bls-keygen.com/. \r\n\r\nThere is a strong UX argument to keep those tools in the same platform and to not force users to install and use python on top of the eth2 client they pick. Arguments against this would be for security, pishing, etc? The launchpad could offer instructions for both, offline key generation and browser key generation.",
