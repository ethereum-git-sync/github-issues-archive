  "body": "At this time the only way to access client configuration steps is by completing all of the previous steps on launchpad. It makes sense that the launchpad design should provide client setup instructions first, and only then permit users to deposit funds to a contract (potentially with a sanity check to ensure the user has successfully set up a client). In the meantime, it makes excellent sense to provide users with a direct link to the client configuration links at any time in the process.\r\n\r\nAn image of the client configuration page I'm referencing:\r\nhttps://storage.googleapis.com/ethereum-hackmd/upload_501896fb6add073be24b3cd4351acb1e.png\r\n\r\n",
