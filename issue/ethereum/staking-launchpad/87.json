    "body": "As it turns out, IE, Safari, and Safari-iOS all do not support BigInts. (Although support has been added to the Dev-build of Safari.) BigInts are a part of ES2020, but clearly there isn't universal support yet. Unfortunately it cannot be transpiled as it uses `+`, `-`, `<<` etc as symbols for the associated methods. The particular syntax that it is not happy with here is `1n` which is shorthand for `BigInt(1)`. Unfortunately, this is not easy to fix because even ignoring this issue, it will still fail at runtime when `BigInt` objects are used.\r\n\r\nOne solution is to swap out `BigInt`s for the [JSBI](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/jsbi) library's implementation which is a native JS version of the same thing (but uses incompatible syntax). It should be noted that this problem is not something we induced, but via a dependency we use for checking the merkle root ([@chainsafe's persistent merkle root](https://github.com/ChainSafe/persistent-merkle-tree)).\r\n\r\nPossible solutions:\r\n\r\n* Don't support IE & Safari Entirely\r\n* Change the syntax (remove `1n`) in persistent-merkle and just not verify the root in Safari/IE (note that the `DepositMessage` is still verified by the deposit contract, but there is scope for loss of funds\r\n* Move over to [JSBI](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/jsbi)",

    "body": "Hiya, chainsafer here, just stumbled upon this issue.\r\n\r\nI think if we use the `BigInt()` syntax instead of bigint literals, in the persistent-merkle-tree dependency, that you should be able to verify the deposit roots here w/o an issue. The persistent-merkle-tree code is only activated when operating on full merkle-tree-backed objects, whereas here we're just using javascript objects. The hashTreeRoot implementation operating on javascript objects doesn't involve gindex calculations or anything else that we're using bigints for, so I don't think we will hit any runtime errors calculating the merkle root.\r\n\r\nOne other thing that would need to change is the use of `BigIntUintType` for the amount.\r\nOne solution would be to use the `NumberUintType`, which will only start overflowing after 3.2M+ Ether (with accounting in gwei), well beyond the practical limit for a single deposit.\r\nAnother solution, we could implement another Uint type using JSBI, BN.js, etc. that can handle the full range of uint64 values w/o using bigint.",
