    "body": "I've been discussing this at length with various community members. The idea is very nice, but the implementation is less easy. IMO, simply adding a GPG signature is security theatre as users are unlikely to verify the Pubkey. Eg, Prysm's verification is done against [a GPG key in the Makefile](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/master/prysm.sh#L15) which is cool, but it is easy to swap out the key before the verification.\r\n\r\nI think a better way of handling this is via package managers. While it introduces another layer of trust, these tools are already trusted with other high security packages so assumedly they have a high degree of security.",

    "body": "Can understand how the presence of a GPG signature could provide a false sense of security to users.  However, I would contend that even if a portion of users do not opt to verify the PubKey, there is a communal benefit.  In a situation where an individual is unable to verify the signature in question, they would alert the community, and thus users would exercise caution until a resolution is reached.  Furthermore, there is a sense of personal responsibility that implores everyone to exert the effort to verify.\r\n\r\nGiven the money at stake, as well as the fact that the deposit-cli files only need to be downloaded once, I personally believe the hash files and GPG signature would be a relatively trustless solution and inspire confidence.  Reflecting on experiences in the Monero community, all releases include these verification components. Won't pretend to understand the difficulties in implementation, but here are a pair of guides, which would useful if you decided to proceed with the Hash / GPG verification route.\r\n\r\nhttps://src.getmonero.org/resources/user-guides/verification-windows-beginner.html\r\nhttps://src.getmonero.org/resources/user-guides/verification-allos-advanced.html",
