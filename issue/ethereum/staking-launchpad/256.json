    "body": "Thanks for raising this issue, we are looking into it urgently. Indeed, it looks like it is tied to eth1 problems, the page appears to crash at the moment it queries the deposit contract to show how many deposits have been made.\r\n\r\nAs @hwwhww mentioned, it is likely tied to Infura being down (which you can track here: https://status.infura.io/). You can run site locally if you wish to make deposits now. Note that if you plan on using Metamask as your wallet to make these deposits, you'll have to connect it to the RPC endpoint of your own Ethereum node as Metamask also depends on Infura. Instructions on how to configure Metamask for a custom RPC endpoint [here](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043227612-How-to-add-a-custom-Network-RPC-and-or-Block-Explorer).",
