  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI've been following a process to set up the validator node on my Mac but have got stuck and am wondering if someone can help me - if this is the wrong place to post, apologies, but as a someone with moderate to poor technical skills trying to set up a validator node, others may find this helpful.\r\n\r\nStep successfully completed:\r\n-added goeth to my metamask\r\ninstalled docker\r\npulled the validator and beacon images\r\nran and sank the beacon node (it took about 2 days to complete!)\r\n\r\nNow, when setting up the validator client, I'm stuck. The code I have run is: docker run -it -v $HOME/.eth2:/data \\gcr.io/prysmaticlabs/prysm/validator:latest \\accounts create --keystore-path=/data --password= _ _ _\r\nIt's given me my deposit and public key data; however, I'm unable to copy and paste my deposit data into the page on step 3 of the medalla testnet. I can't see the json file anywhere on my computer (I can't seem to find Home/.eth2 etc anywhere even though this is the address I used from the start of this process).\r\n\r\nI tried creating my own json file in visual studio but clearly have the wrong format for it to work.\r\n\r\nHas anyone got any ideas of either the correct format or how to find where the deposit data key might have been stored.\r\n\r\nAny support or ideas to simplify this process would be very welcome.\r\n\r\nThanks",
