  "body": "Top Up page presents a modal that has no close button and clicking outside the modal does not close it. \r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Go to https://pyrmont.launchpad.ethereum.org/en/top-up or https://launchpad.ethereum.org/en/top-up\r\n2. See modal pop-up, but cannot click anything in background to go back.\r\n(More natural flow would be to click on the Top Up button on the page, which would still allow a user to navigate \"Back\", but a direct link leaves you completely stuck)\r\n3. It does go away if you connect a wallet, but if you don't, you're stuck.\r\n\r\nSuggestion\r\n1. Allow user to click outside the Top Up modal area to return to page before Top Up. \r\n2. First go to the non-modal Top Up page, with a modal that can be launched from that (instead of popping up directly from the nav button), again with logic to be able to exit it. ",
