  "body": "Hey there,\r\n\r\nI was reading the FAQ in https://launchpad.ethereum.org/faq and these two particular answers stood out to me:\r\n\r\n> **How much ETH does a validator need to stake?**\r\n> Before a validator can start to secure the network, he or she needs to stake 32 ETH. This forms the validator’s initial balance.\r\n\r\n> **Is there any advantage to having more than 32 ETH at stake?**\r\n> No. There is no advantage to having more than 32 ETH staked.\r\n> Limiting the maximum stake to 32 ETH encourages decentralization of power as it prevents any single validator from having an excessively large vote on the state of the chain.\r\n> Remember that a validator’s vote is weighted by the amount it has at stake.\r\n\r\nOn my first read, I was confused as to how a validator's vote is weighted by the amount it has at stake. I understood that both the minimum and maximum ETH required to stake is 32, whereas it's a bit more nuanced.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think that this would be clearer if we mention the following: 32 ETH is the minimum needed to initially active the validator. You can eventually stake less than that (e.g if you withdraw in the future, or penalties lower you below 32) but to **start** staking you need 32.\r\n",
