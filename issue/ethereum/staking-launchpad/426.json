  "body": "## Background\r\n\r\nHi, I'm James from Prysmatic Labs. We have been doing some research into the UX of becoming a validator and have thought about various changes that could improve this experience. I prepared a doc [here ](https://hackmd.io/@prysmaticlabs/validator-ux)\r\n\r\n### Major Points\r\n\r\n- currently key actions ( syncing eth 1 and eth2 nodes ) from advisories section 9 (checklist) is easily missed \r\n    - can we provide more warning on the select a client pages to ensure users are fully synced after installation or linked back to the check list\r\n    - possibly even adding more warning on advisories section 9 to include risks for not completing checklist prior to deposit.\r\n- currently mentions \"While you can use a third-party service like Infura, we recommend running your own client in order to ensure the network stays as decentralised as possible.\" is this the case for Test net as well ( reduces hardware requirements for testing)? \r\n- can we add during \" choosing client sections \" that setup should be for specific network ( launchpad network) that it's for x testnet so users are not accidently syncing on the wrong network, also repeating advisories on setup for the eth2 client?\r\n  - perhaps provide some warning that without prior setup you may be subject to premature penalties ( activated validator without the validator running properly on machine)\r\n- provide more information on how to get initial eth for testnet onboarding\r\n- stretch: change UI design ( like color ) and possibly some of the risks based on network selection to distinguish Mainnet from Testnet pages ( even though url is different it would be more clear to initial users)\r\n- stretch: provide a launchpad for advanced users that would like to skip the checklist warnings ( suggestion detect if user already went through launchpad once somehow )\r\n    - use case for advanced users or ones that have been through the process prior or for users who need to go through this for multiple deposits/system setups",

    "body": "Thanks for the write up @james-prysm, definitely some good suggestions here! The accompanying doc is amazing too.\r\n\r\n1. More fully synced warnings - Definitly, I'll look into it\r\n1. Recommendation to run own eth1 client on testnets - I'm reluctant to remove this as I want to encourage users to get used to configuring their own \"eth1\" node. (It enhanced the 1st point above)\r\n1. \"add during choosing client sections that setup should be for specific network\" - agree this is beneficial\r\n1. more info on faucets - this seems doable\r\n1. stretch: change UI design ( like color) - I think this sould be easy to implement with a filter/overlay so as not to have to design a new colour pallet.\r\n1. stretch: skip checklist warnings - as a part of our policy of not having any storage/cookies, I don't see how we can make this automatic. Offering a button/page without these checks should be possible tho\r\n",
