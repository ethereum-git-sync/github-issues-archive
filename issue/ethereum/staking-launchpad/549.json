  "body": "Reported by @fredriksvantes (ðŸ™Œ). Quote his words:\r\n\r\n### Issue\r\nMy tests shows that metamask-ledger works fine on websites like app.uniswaporg, but not on the launchpad. i tested with two different OS and two different browsers on each OS, and the latest ledger firmware. it provides this error message:\r\n\"Ledger: Condition of use not satisfied (denied by user?) (0x6985) after pressing confirm in metamask.\r\n\r\n### Possible root cause\r\n\r\nLocally, i updated the web3, web3-utils, all @ethersproject and all `@web3-react packages` to their latest version, but it's still not working. my guess is something stopped working with the `@web3-react/injected-connector`, which can't be updated as it has been deprecated in favor of the \"metamask\" package: https://github.com/Uniswap/web3-react/tree/main/packages/metamask\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nHi @wackerow, do you have bandwidth to help investigate how to switch our metamask package dependency?\r\n\r\nI suppose it has to be fixed based on the node.js & web3 package upgrade fix (#543)\r\n",
