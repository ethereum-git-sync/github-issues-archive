  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nFrom a security standpoint, wouldnt it be wise to link to a specific release for the binaries as well as list the checksums on the launchpad itself?\r\nOtherwise if one of the main contributor's github account gets compromised users might use a malicious tool to generate their keys. Verifying the checksums wouldn't help. If the checksums would be listed on the launchpad, both github and the lauchpad would need to be compromised.",
