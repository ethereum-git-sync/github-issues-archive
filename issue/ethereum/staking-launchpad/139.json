    "body": "Multi language would be very cool. There are two sides that we'd need to get right, the CLI, and the Launchpad itself.\r\n\r\nThe CLI supports multi-language mnemonics, but not multiple languages in the flow itself. The interactivity is supplied by the Click library. We could bundle the arguments into subcommands per language.\r\n\r\nOn the launchpad side, the logic is largely separated from the content, but there would be quite a lot of refactoring work required to support more languages. It should be doable by either switching out the content on the fly, or by having different pages.",
