  "body": "I hope you're all doing well!\r\n\r\nWhile Beaconscan works well, I've noticed that it sometimes experiences lag in providing data, which makes it somewhat pointless to me since I prefer to use Beaconcha.in for quicker data.\r\n\r\nWith this in mind, I'd like to propose the idea of considering Ethstakers.club as a potential replacement for Beaconscan. Ethstakers.club is a platform that I personally even prefer over Beaconcha.in. One key advantage is that it is ad-free, as I value a clean and uncluttered system and appreciate not having to install an ad blocker on my deposit machine. It always freaks me out when I accidentally click on an ad.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, it would be great if you could add it as a third option.\r\n\r\nRelated: I think it would also be great to add it as an alternative API provider to add some diversity. This could address issues, such as #435. I just don't like that it currently always sends everything to Beaconcha.in.",
