I'm still not getting this error on my end... @calumtomeny would you mind also noting the OS you're using, or even what terminal software you're using?\r\n\r\nI'm using latest macOS with the default terminal using bash. If I use the Copy button on Beaconcha.in to copy the withdrawal credentials as you noted, I do not receive an error (while keeping the `0x` in the string).
