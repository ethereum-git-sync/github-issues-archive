The site does currently warn that funds cannot yet be withdrawn, and also warns that slashing will result in forced exiting from the network. Given that, there is a gap here that could be filled still by making sure users realize that any slashed funds will be exited, and locked until the ability to withdraw and transfer funds is enabled via Shanghai. The inability to re-stake these funds until Shanghai could be made more explicit.",
