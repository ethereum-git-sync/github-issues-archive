  "body": "I've come across a minor issue.  When I first went to deposit my validator, I took too long getting into my hardware wallet and timed out, so the wallet and launchpad marked the transaction as failed.  Best practice at this point (in my view) is to retry the same transaction from within my wallet since it handles the nonces and will re-send with the same nonce rather than creating an opportunity to accidentally double up, as client pages sometimes do.\r\n\r\nSo I did that, but then the launchpad was unable to detect that I had re-sent the transaction, so it just left it marked as failed even after the transaction confirmed.  This definitely creates a danger for double-sending via the \"try again\" button.",
