  "body": "Obviously everyone should keep their mnemonic safe, but in the event that a mnemonic is compromised and the user doesn't know it, my understanding is that it is safer to deposit using a private relay like flashbots, just in case. I have heard (on the staking discord) that a hacker with your mnemonic can watch the mempool for your deposit and use MEV to put their own 1ETH deposit in front of yours with a different withdrawal address, thereby stealing the entirety of your new deposit.\r\n\r\nIt seems like it would be a good idea to have the launchpad recommend using a private relay, just to be extra safe.",
