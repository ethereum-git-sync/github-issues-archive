  "body": "Walking through the steps [here](https://medalla.launchpad.ethereum.org/generate-keys) with this configuration:\r\n\r\n```\r\n1. How many validators would you like to run? 1\r\n2. Current operating system? Mac (Mojave 10.14.4)\r\n3. Install developer libraries? Already installed\r\n4. Generate deposit keys using Ethereum Foundation tool? *Encountered issue here!*\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I run `./deposit.sh install`, it walks me through generating a keypair through mnemonic, asks me to write down the mnemonic, etc. However, when I run the next command on the line, `./deposit.sh --num_validators 1 --chain medalla`, it walks me through the *same* generation process. \r\n\r\nIt's confusing from a UX standpoint, because it seems like I'm running the whole process again (exact same instructions). \r\n\r\nEDIT: It does seem to be an unnecessary duplication, creating two sets of validator keys.",
