There are plenty of very good reasons a user might have to stop and restart the deposit process:  not enough ETH in wallet, browser/computer/internet/etc issues, and so on.  The expected behaviour should be that the page shows the same deposit indications even if the user has been forced to close it and re-upload the json in order to resume depositing.
