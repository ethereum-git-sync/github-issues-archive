  "body": "Yesterday, Infura was down for hours and then the Launchpad was also down since it couldn't render the deposit progress on the landing page. (#256)\r\n\r\nSome potential solutions to prevent it from happening again:\r\n- Use both EF-operated RPC endpoints and Infura services. If the default one breaks, try another one.\r\n- Check RPC service status before calling `queryContract` so that users can at least see the landing page.\r\n",
