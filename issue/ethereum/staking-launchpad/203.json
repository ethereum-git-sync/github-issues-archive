  "body": "**Deposit transaction not always correctly marked as successful**\r\n\r\nI just deposited some new Medalla validators, and the 10th deposit transaction, though it was successfully confirmed along with the others (verified on etherscan), was not marked as successful by the launchpad deposit page (screenshot attached).  As a result the bottom button remained with the warning symbol instead of changing to the normal continue button.\r\n\r\nMay be considered related to #166 since the page is in general unable to update its opinion of deposits which have already occurred.  In this case it appears that there was an error (perhaps a timeout or lost message) in the API response that should have marked the transaction as successful, and the page does not attempt to re-check beyond this initial attempt.\r\n\r\n![Mislabelled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4242428/95662449-06195e80-0b05-11eb-92df-bf2e45fcc476.jpg)\r\n\r\n",
