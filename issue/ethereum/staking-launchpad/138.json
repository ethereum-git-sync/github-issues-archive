    "body": "@Battenfield \r\n\r\nLearn from the recent feedback, I think the workflow could be changed to:\r\n1. Provide (i) binary executable file and (ii) `virtualenv` options: we concerned that using `virtualenv` requires the user to download extra packages and learn about how to use it, but now I feel it's just too difficult to make everyone's environment clean and no conflicts.\r\n    - List binary file as option 1 since its instruction is shorter.\r\n2. Remove `git` installation: the git users can download it via git, but for the non-technical users, they can just download it from the GitHub website.\r\n3. Remove `deposit.sh` one since it doesn't fit for all Windows users.\r\n4. Add some \"hints\" to the instruction\r\n\r\nI'm proposing the instruction revisions (feel free to overhaul the wording):\r\n- Windows users: https://hackmd.io/MPLCgqZDSbWX4PcW2-6LMA\r\n- For macOS or Linux users: https://hackmd.io/IoMvowW0SmeBZGOmIE3sJg\r\n    - the only the status-quo content and “Generate deposit keys using the Ethereum Foundation deposit tool” command are different.\r\n\r\nIt's a bit similar to the deposit-cli README.md steps. IMHO we have to combine header 3. and 4. if we provide two options.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n> Is there any impact on section 3 content?\r\n\r\nSee above\r\n\r\n> Shall the link go above the code emulator? Mention the preferred method?\r\n\r\nSee above, I'd say set it to \"option 1\".\r\n\r\n> Should it link out to the general releases page or the specific 0.2.1 tagged release?\r\n\r\nGood question, I'd say general releases page would be fine since we should not change the commands in the future. I noted \"the latest deposit-cli release\" on the above proposals.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThanks! :)\r\n\r\n",
