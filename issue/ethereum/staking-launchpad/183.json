  "body": "There is another bug in the transaction handling process. Basically, it is possible to initiate the same transaction multiple times by clicking start more than once without signing the actual TX. This occurs because we check that the status is `READY` before initiating a transaction, but it is only updated once the user clicks sign. Between these two moments, the user can launch as many instances of the same transaction as they want.",
