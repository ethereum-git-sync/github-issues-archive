The complexity of different nets is not entirely captured by this model. and so it should be extended to support multiple configurations. Each net can vary in the following parameters:\r\n* is_tesnet\r\n* network name\r\n* deposit amount\r\n* deposit contract address\r\n* fork version\r\n* eth1 network (Goerlli vs mainnet etc)\r\n\r\nThese options are all properties of the network and should be swapped out depending on which one is active. As discussed in #83, all these parameters can be populated as envVars which possibly default to the mainnet configuration. ",

For instance, do we want `witti.launchpad.ethereum.org` to be a deployment with a witti config similar to block explorers like`goerli.etherscan.io`? If so, this would be a much lighter of a lift as we could just have a configuration per deployment. For this case, we could have links or a dropdown that would navigate users to the appropriate deployment URL. \r\n\r\nOr\r\n\r\nDo we want one testnet deployment with a dynamic config that is changed by a dropdown? This would mean that the user toggles the eth2 network on the Overview page and it switches the config in application state, allowing the user to access all eth2 testnets on this single deployment. We could also put in place a Mainnet environment variable which will override the testnet configs and not render the dropdown on the Overview page.\r\n\r\nEither would work, we just need clarification on which as it drastically changes the UX and DevOps.",
