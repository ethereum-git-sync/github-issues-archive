Your instructions to them should get them to the download. @raunchy-mx, if you still can't find it I recommend trying [this link](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-deposit-cli/releases/tag/v0.2.1).\r\n\r\n@mccabesville, did you choose the \"medalla\" option when asked witch network you were using? If you just hit enter when the prompt asked about it, you'd end up with keys which can only be used on mainnet.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt should look like this:\r\n```text\r\nPlease choose how many validators you wish to run: 1\r\nPlease choose your mnemonic language (czech, chinese_traditional, chinese_simplified, english, spanish, italian, korean) [english]: english\r\nPlease choose the (mainnet or testnet) network/chain name (mainnet, witti, altona, medalla) [mainnet]: medalla\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote the last line where `medalla` is typed. Hopefully this helps. ",
