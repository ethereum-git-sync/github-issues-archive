  "body": "After the genesis deposit threshold is reached the progress bar needs to change to reflect the new state of the network.\r\n\r\nCurrently:\r\n* The \"Launch threshold\" is negative\r\n* The label \"Launch Threshold\" does not match up with the value displayed before the threshold is reached. It should read \"XXX ETH to go!\" and I think \"Already staked\" is a more appropriate title for the current staking balance\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2020-07-08 at 5 01 56 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12530043/86936986-fd4c7180-c13e-11ea-94ea-c3d44dc5e153.png)\r\n\r\nI propose we fix the launch threshold in place and allow the current staking value to overtake it when the balance is larger like in the below image:\r\n\r\n![Combined](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12530043/86937016-03dae900-c13f-11ea-8a7c-b2dc8fbdc767.png)\r\n",

    "body": "Yes, this is a bug. Originally our initial thoughts on this were to leave the bar full and flip the copy as you were suggesting. I like the line that shows the genesis threshold, Although, I am wondering how it should look when it's just over the threshold, say 21,000 ETH for instance.\r\n\r\nWe should also replace the \"The eth2 network needs to react at lease 20,480ETH...\" copy with something along the lines of \"We have successfully reached the Genesis threshold of 20,480ETH...\"\r\n\r\n@georgeweiler thoughts?",
