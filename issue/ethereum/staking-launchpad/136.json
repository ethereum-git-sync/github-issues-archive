    "body": "Support this too. The user should be comfortable with a beacon node, and fully synced, before starting to deposit or validate. Before genesis this is less of a problem, but getting a beacon node running is an essential first step. And good to test those ignorant enough to not start a node or validator client at all. Deposits are part of the start process, there's more to staking, which some users seem to forget.\r\n\r\nMaybe the beacon node should sign some message with the imported keystore acknowledging that it's fully synced and ready to use a particular validator? To then verify in the launchpad process before making the actual deposit? This can be an aggregate signature too, too keep it small and simple to copy paste. It can be bypassed if needed (i.e. can still deposit, contract doesn't change), but the user should know that they are taking on risk by doing so.",
