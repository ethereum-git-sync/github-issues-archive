Ethereum.org currently has this property (though it should be rounding to an integer = bug). If this property doesn't hold in the revised version, maybe place a comment nearby explaining how this calc is done / the logic behind it? Just to avoid any confusion.\r\n\r\nThanks,",

Fix to be merged shortly\r\n\r\n> My only (personal) suggestion is: it would be nice / intuitive if whichever amounts are displayed for \"Total ETH stake\" & \"validator count\" have the property that multiplying \"validator count\" by 32 = \"Total ETH stake\". \r\n\r\nOnly issue with this is that \"validator count\" * 32 will not equal total ETH stake, since 32 is the MAX a validator can have, but some are below this. Total stake will always be somewhat lower than \"validator count\" * 32.\r\n\r\nThe new endpoints used in the #602 pull the correct numbers. Ethereum.org also updating to match.",
