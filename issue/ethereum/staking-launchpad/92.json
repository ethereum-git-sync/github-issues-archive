    "body": "I was under the impression that web3 did not support historical logs (beyond when you started watching), but I was mistaken. That said, there is a chance we run into the limits of a given web3 provider if the user is using one which has limits on the how many events can be returned (eg. Infura only returns 10000 events). That said, it is not my area of expertise, @Battenfield, can you weigh in on the feasibility of using [`myContract.events.allEvents([options][, callback])`](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.9/web3-eth-contract.html#events-allevents) with a filter on the pubkey?\r\n\r\n\r\n@dankrad, while I agree a user should not be stoped from making a deposit for an existing validator, they should be warned and ideally taken through the separate top-up deposit flow (which is a planned feature).",

That said with adjusted hysteresis earlier this year, there shouldn't be much incentive to initially deposit more than 32ETH.  I also think we should have another flow for that and at least warn the user. Otherwise I foresee a bunch of users depositing twice accidentally or thinking that they can deposit for 2 validators and having their funds stuck there until transfers are possible. \r\n\r\nIdeas for workarounds (not great but better than nothing) if the event log history is too limited:\r\n* Use cookies / local deposit log\r\n* Use timestamp in deposit data name to limit event log queries\r\n* Use centralised service to keep track of deposits",

    "body": "> I was under the impression that web3 did not support historical logs (beyond when you started watching), but I was mistaken. That said, there is a chance we run into the limits of a given web3 provider if the user is using one which has limits on the how many events can be returned (eg. Infura only returns 10000 events). That said, it is not my area of expertise, @Battenfield, can you weigh in on the feasibility of using [`myContract.events.allEvents([options][, callback])`](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.9/web3-eth-contract.html#events-allevents) with a filter on the pubkey?\r\n\r\nWe currently leverage events to pick up on signing and confirmations. However, I do not believe we can use web3 in this way for historical data. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs @Phistr90 points out, we have a few options for tracking deposit data:\r\n\r\n> * Use cookies / local deposit log\r\n\r\nWe explored this option early on for persisting data through refreshes and decided against it as it would be a form of tracking the user and unreliable. This option will not work when the user is on a different browser, rejected tracking, or if they did not use the launchpad to make their first deposit.\r\n\r\n> * Use timestamp in deposit data name to limit event log queries\r\n\r\n@Phistr90 could you elaborate on this?\r\n\r\n> * Use centralised service to keep track of deposits\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, our best option if our goal is to prevent users from depositing twice. We could use an external API to check their pubkey in the Transaction table step. If the user had previously deposited with that pubkey, we could render a warning to them. We could even block them and point them to the future topup feature in cause they were seeking that. ",
