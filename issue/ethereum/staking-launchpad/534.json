    "body": "Hi @remyroy, thanks for the report!\r\n\r\nI just tested it, it turns out the issue was not at the network name but at the minimum `deposit_cli_version` requirement:\r\n1. Goerli launchpad now requires [v2.3.0](https://github.com/ethereum/staking-deposit-cli/tree/v2.3.0) since we had some security updates.\r\n2. Around https://github.com/ethereum/staking-launchpad/blob/c72ab78c58a0d0693197cf8ecda18256dae7b5e3/src/pages/UploadValidator/index.tsx#L221-L228\r\n    - If user uses an old deposit data file, `checkJsonStructure` would fail, but we printed the *incorrect* error message with `handleWrongNetwork`.\r\n\r\nSo we have to update the error messages for sure.\r\n\r\nBack to the old prater users issue itself, I'm not sure what's the best way to make it backward-compatible... we may have to rethink the `MIN_DEPOSIT_CLI_VERSION` mechanism. I'm now thinking if we should only update it when there are incompatible updates. /cc @CarlBeek \r\n",
