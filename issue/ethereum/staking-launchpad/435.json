    "body": "Thanks for raising this @paulmillr!\r\n\r\n1. I think it is important to point out that the failure mode here is not that a user is unable to make a deposit, but rather that the users sees a warning that the automated system for detecting double-deposits is unable to verify that this validator does not exist.\r\n2. I agree. That said, it is not clear cut which is the lesser evil: risking users making double deposits or the risk that beaconcha.in gets pwned.\r\n3. As mentioned in a reply to your issue in #425, a failure here does not stop a user from making deposits.\r\n\r\nI like the idea of using a local node for checking for double-deposits, but the API provided by your local node is not the same as that provided by beaconcha.in. Specifically in relation to what is returned when there are new validators being added. Currently the delay between making a deposit and it being available via your local BN's API is 16 hours and it gets worse from time to time. So given the effort of connecting to a local BN and the marginal improvements against double-deposit footguns, I am not convinced that it is worth adding this functionality.",

    "body": "> a failure here does not stop a user from making deposits \r\n\r\nThe application silently fails without any errors. What would a user think? Is there any possibility they would find a way to make an errorneus second deposit? Have you actually reproduced the error? It completely ruins the deposit process.\r\n\r\n> the API provided by your local node is not the same as that provided by beaconcha.in\r\n\r\nCan be easily fixed in <100LOC python / node.js / whatever webserver. What's the point in aiming to have client diversity with 5+ consensus clients, and having the **most important part of staking** rely on one centralized website?",
