  "body": "### Issue\r\n\r\n1. Eth2 spec `v0.11.x` is not compatible with `v0.12.x` due to BLS signature. To support [Altona testnet](https://github.com/goerli/altona/blob/master/altona/README.md), both the launchpad (this repo) and [deposit-cli](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-deposit-cli) have to upgrade to `v0.12.x` compatible.\r\n2. It's difficult to sync the version of the launchpad and `deposit-cli` now: the instructions currently ask the user to download `https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-deposit-cli.git` `master` branch.\r\n\r\n### How to solve it\r\n\r\n- [x] 1. **[deposit-cli]**: Cut a release of the current `deposit-cli` master, and make it clear that it's in development.\r\n- [x] 2. **[launchpad]**: Make launchpad point to the new `deposit-cli` release branch.\r\n    1. Update `README.md`.\r\n    2. Parameterize https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-deposit-cli.git (https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-deposit/blob/0d03f61b870c1f0adfdbe2115f52d389738888cd/src/pages/GenerateKeys/LinuxInstructions.tsx#L26) and update all instruction files.\r\n- [ ] 3. **[launchpad]**: Merge `dev` to `master` and cut a `v0.11.x` release of the launchpad\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then we can merge the `v0.12.x` PRs to `dev` branch, and cut a new release for Altona testnet.\r\n\r\n@georgeweiler @Battenfield @CarlBeek what do you think?\r\n",

As such, I think we should just move forward onto v0.12.x and make that the initial release.",
