The launchpad should include a very strong and visible warning that running the same validator keys in two locations will lead to slashing.\r\n\r\nReference: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethstaker/comments/jxro3n/slashing_causes_and_consequences_phase_0/\r\n\r\nThis is a very well-known event in the intermediate & advanced user communities, but it is likely to be unknown to beginner stakers.",
