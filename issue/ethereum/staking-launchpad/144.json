So the statusbar should only display those. Otherwise, the statusbar will be at 100% before the genesis threshold is reached. According to my lighthouse client there are currently ~200 invalid deposits.\r\n\r\nEdit: The statusbar on https://medalla.beaconcha.in/ seems to show the correct balance.",

    "body": "Indeed it does, this is a known limitation. The number is also inflated by double-deposits / top-ups. This is done to preserve the property that Launchpad runs without a corresponding server. If we wanted to accurately track the number of deposits, we'd need to also run a server connected to a Beacon Node. While this is possible, we have try to avoid going down that path as it reduces the independence of this DApp.",
