  "body": "Right now [approximately 65% of validators](https://twitter.com/sproulM_/status/1440512518242197516) run Prysm. In my opinion there should be a disclaimer about the importance of client diversity (not only for the network health but also because of the increased financial risk due to inactivity penalties if all Prysm validators went down). Maybe there could even be a warning if the user chooses Prysm",
