  "body": "A while ago we had the notion of offering raw transactions as a wallet type (I'm not sure where along the line we dropped it). Basically, instead of using one of the wallets we offer, download/copy the raw transaction into your favourite wallet and take it from there. This is friendly to those stakers who have coldstores who wish to keep them offline. IMO we don't need to offer the functionality to send the transaction when they are done, such users can find their own way of doing so.",
