  "body": "## Abstract\r\n\r\nTakes array of call objects and executes them one after the other.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nThe `eth_call` executes the call on the latest state. When someone wants to inspect a state that would be, after a transaction would go through, currently it involves a non cheap way, i.e. using the mainnet fork (like ganache/hardhat network/anvil) to confirm the first tx and then query state on it, which makes a lot of rpc calls. Having a `eth_multicall` can be achieved by the clients cheaply.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\n`TransactionCallObject` be the type/interface for first arg of `eth_call`.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\neth_multicall(calls: Array<TransactionCallObject>, blockTag?: number) -> Array<Bytes>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first arg `calls` is an array and required, while the second arg `blockTag` is optional.\r\n\r\n\r\nBased on the [discussion](https://discord.com/channels/717003406484701255/717009571536699571/1001035589304471573) in EF JS discord.",
