  "body": "This issue is to keep track of the conversation started at the JSON-RPC session at devconnect.\r\n\r\nMost state-related methods which take in a blocktag allow users to specify \"pending\". The semantic difference to \"latest\" is that the EL keeps track of a pending state by applying all of the pending transactions on top of the current state.\r\n\r\nWe're questioning the practical use of this tag as it depends heavily on the local view of the txpool. The mempool is fluid, there is no guarantee that the transactions there will be mined. Moreover different nodes within an RPC provider infrastructure have different views on the mempool and some notable ones do not serve pending state.\r\n\r\nThe most useful aspect of the pending state seems to be to get the latest nonce for an account. Taking this into account, the most-widely accepted solution to deprecating \"pending\" is to revert to \"latest\" on all cases except `eth_getTransactionCount` where the node tries to return the latest nonce.\r\n\r\nThis will alleviate some load from nodes to maintain the pending state.",
