  "body": "I noticed that the `eth_estimateGas` method’s _Block_ field is specified to only accept a block number or tag (i.e. “latest”, etc.). However, other related methods (specifically `eth_call`) are also specified to take a block hash. `eth_estimateGas` seems like the odd-method-out in this regard and I was wondering if this was intentional or an oversight from when more methods transitioned to accepting block hashes as parameters.\r\n\r\nFWIW, experimentally nodes seem to accept block hashes for `eth_estimateGas`.",
