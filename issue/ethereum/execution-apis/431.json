API Reference - https://ethereum.github.io/execution-apis/api-documentation/\r\n\r\nFor the docusaurus website, we have 1 + N pages by default:\r\n(the metamask plugin renders 1 page for each of the N methods in the spec)\r\n\r\n1. Homepage - https://anukul.js.org/execution-apis/\r\n2. `eth_accounts` - https://anukul.js.org/execution-apis/docs/reference/eth_accounts\r\n3. `eth_blockNumber` - https://anukul.js.org/execution-apis/docs/reference/eth_blocknumber\r\n...\r\n\r\nThese N links are shown in the sidebar on a different page. But where does the user go from the homepage?\r\n\r\n> The metamask plugin renders links to each method's page in the sidebar, so there's no one specific link to go from the button on the homepage (\"API Reference Documentation\").\r\n\r\nThe question is between a static page (worth discussing what content), or a page that lists all methods, possibly with description, and a link to each method's page.\r\n",
