    "body": "`receiptRoot` discrepancy is what have been annoying me for some time, but then I forgot about it. It's not intentional and has been borrowed from the geth code, where it is named [`ReceiptHash`](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/core/types/block.go#L75). The name seems correct as it's a short sample of \"the hash of the root of a receipt(s) trie\" -- I guess either form of receipt word doesn't break the grammar. We might want to rename it to `receiptsRoot` for conformance with JSON-RPC API.\r\n\r\n`number` in the context of `ExecutionPayload` sounds a bit off, `blockNumber` hints at EL block and distinguishes it from a \"slot number\".",
