  "body": "Existing Engine API specification states that a method version must be updated whenever behaviour or parameter set of the method has changed, including the case when a datatype version is advanced, e.g. a switch from `ExecutionPayloadV2` to `ExecutionPayloadV3` causes the `newPayload` version bump. This approach makes sense as whatever change to a method specification is considered as a change to its semantics.\r\n\r\nThe problem of the above approach is that in some cases when datatype is updated method's behaviour remains unchanged, i.e. datatype change only affects the underlying block processing routines. For instance, `newPayload` itself does not use newly added `withdrawals` field and defer it processing to downstream handlers.\r\n\r\nThus, we may consider avoid bumping method's version if there is no change in its behaviour and instead just extend already existing method to work with newly added datatype. In other words, explicitly say that `newPayloadV2` is modified in Cancun and the only modification is support of `ExecutionPayloadV3` datatype in addition to already supported `V1` and `V2`.",

So if we wanted an out-of-fork change to the data type rather than the behaviour, we'd need some other way of synchronizing thus making getCapabilities redundant I think",
