  "body": "# Specification \r\n\r\n- The interface should be similar to `eth_call`.\r\n- It should run the bytecode in `to` in the storage context of `from`.\r\n\r\n# Motivation\r\n\r\nThis can be useful when contracts have separated storage and logic architecture (proxy patterns). Complicated view functions need to be implemented in the logic contract's bytecode (for the frontend to be able to `eth_call` it). However, it consumes bytecode size. If `eth_delegatecall` exists, the bytecode of the logic contract can be minimized (to not include view functions in the logic contract), and there can be a lens contract that is used to read state with complicated view functions.\r\n\r\n# Rationale \r\n\r\n- When contracts are already deployed, it is not practical to add another view method to it, for UI to be able to display a variable (which was not marked public) for example. Hence `eth_delegatecall` may help in such cases.\r\n- Currently, contracts have to include view methods in their logic. For external readers (outside of EVM), `eth_getStorageAt` is available, which can be useful to read simple values like variables, and hence engineers can minimize bytecode by getting rid of simple view functions. However, when getting rid of complicated view functions, it involves writing logic in the external reader (frontend) that does multiple calls to `eth_getStorageAt`. Hence it can be more efficient to just deploy a lens contract that implements logic for the complicated view function and the external reader can delegatecall from the storage contract.",
