    "body": "Thanks for pointing this out @aathan. I've taken a look and you are indeed correct, it is not intended for `0x` to be accepted as a `uint256`. However, it is acceptable as a `Byte` value in general. This is a better definition of the storage keys.\r\n\r\nI've created a new type `BytesMax32` in #305 to be used in places where storage keys are referenced. PTAL at the PR and let me know if the solution seems acceptable to you.\r\n\r\nRPC endpoints SHOULD accept hex encoded byte values of length < 66 bytes. I apologize for the error in the specification.",
