  "body": "Brownie strips source files of comments, then generates a hash from the code. It also stores a dependency list for each contract based on inheritance and linking. All this information is used to determine which contracts must recompile when a source file is modified.\r\n\r\nCurrently we have no test cases written for this.  Expected behavior that we should be testing for:\r\n\r\n#### should recompile:\r\n- [ ] modifying a contract\r\n- [ ] modifying the pragma statement in a source file\r\n- [ ] modifying a base contract recompiles all contracts that inherit it\r\n- [ ] modifying a library recompiles all contracts that link to it\r\n\r\n#### should NOT recompile:\r\n- [ ] unmodified contracts\r\n- [ ] modifications to comments or formatting when minification is active \r\n- [ ] modifying a contract that inherits does not recompile the base\r\n- [ ] modifying a contract that uses a library does not recompile the library",
