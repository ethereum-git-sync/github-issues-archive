I am trying to get a persistent local chain by attaching to an already running \r\nlocal `ganache-cli` chain. Here's the error I get when running `network.connect`. \r\n\r\n> Brownie v1.8.9 - Python development framework for Ethereum\r\n> \r\n> BrownieProject is the active project.\r\n>   File \"brownie/_cli/__main__.py\", line 58, in main\r\n>     importlib.import_module(f\"brownie._cli.{cmd}\").main()\r\n>   File \"brownie/_cli/run.py\", line 43, in main\r\n>     network.connect(CONFIG.argv[\"network\"])\r\n>   File \"brownie/network/main.py\", line 45, in connect\r\n>     rpc.attach(host)\r\n>   File \"brownie/network/rpc.py\", line 145, in attach\r\n>     proc = next(i for i in psutil.process_iter() if _check_connections(i, laddr))\r\n>   File \"brownie/network/rpc.py\", line 145, in <genexpr>\r\n>     proc = next(i for i in psutil.process_iter() if _check_connections(i, laddr))\r\n>   File \"brownie/network/rpc.py\", line 393, in _check_connections\r\n>     return laddr in [i.laddr for i in proc.connections()]\r\n>   File \"psutil/__init__.py\", line 1178, in connections\r\n>     return self._proc.connections(kind)\r\n>   File \"psutil/_psosx.py\", line 334, in wrapper\r\n>     return fun(self, *args, **kwargs)\r\n>   File \"psutil/_psosx.py\", line 521, in connections\r\n>     rawlist = cext.proc_connections(self.pid, families, types)\r\n>   File \"/Users/taylorbrent/.pyenv/versions/3.8.2/lib/python3.8/contextlib.py\", line 131, in __exit__\r\n>     self.gen.throw(type, value, traceback)\r\n>   File \"psutil/_psosx.py\", line 363, in catch_zombie\r\n>     raise ZombieProcess(proc.pid, proc._name, proc._ppid)\r\n> ZombieProcess: psutil.ZombieProcess process still exists but it's a zombie (pid=5462)\r\n\r\nI've also tried going under the hood and accessing `web3` and `rpc` directly, while using brownie in python package mode. Same ZombieProcess issue. \r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed?\r\n\r\nI believe what is happening is that in [this function]( https://github.com/iamdefinitelyahuman/brownie/blob/95cf14a4a24a3c2b079e06fec26d9b592164824c/brownie/network/rpc.py#L391) the iteration is raising a `psutil.ZombieProcess` exception. I think it can be solved by doing something similar to [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/51990233). \r\n\r\nHappy to provide any other information I can. From looking at recent issues it looks like attaching to a local chain, be it ganache or something else, should work. ",

Based on the stackoverflow answer you reference, it probably makes sense to expand this `except` statement to also catch `ZombieProcess` and `NoSuchProcess`.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/iamdefinitelyahuman/brownie/blob/95cf14a4a24a3c2b079e06fec26d9b592164824c/brownie/network/rpc.py#L392-L395\r\n\r\nI can probably get to this tonight or tomorrow, but if you have time sooner I'll gladly accept a PR :)",
