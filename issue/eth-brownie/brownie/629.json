  "body": "### Overview\r\nExpose `hypothesis` phase settings via the config file and (maybe) disable `shrinking` by default.\r\n\r\n### Specification\r\nAdd the following values to the default configuration.\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nhypothesis:\r\n  phases:\r\n    explicit: true\r\n    reuse: true\r\n    generate: true\r\n    target: true\r\n    shrink: false\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is a slight complexity here because this deviates from how hypothesis [handles this setting natively](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/settings.html#hypothesis.Phase). But we have to build the enum regardless, so this feels like a good approach imo.\r\n\r\nre: disabling shrinking by default - this is the reason I need this setting exposed. As soon as shrinking begins, the `max_examples` value is now ignored..  if you're using sufficiently complex strategies or a state machine, the process can be _very slow_. There is definitely a value in producing a minimal example, but given the environment we're using hypothesis in I'm not sure if this behavior is more often good or harmful. cc @fubuloubu - any thoughts?",
