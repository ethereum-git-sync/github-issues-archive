I have two contracts : token and master (of the token).\r\n\r\nCompiling is OK, Token deployment works, but not Master where I'm stuck on a perpetual \"Waiting for confirmation...\" :\r\n\r\n```python\r\nmaster = Master.deploy(token.address, {\"from\":acct}, publish_source=True)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nTransaction sent: 0x4f29f5b3a26a0eab08ae90756e24942154c0219076623afc7d9ecc0905e3f73c\r\n  Gas price: 10.0 gwei   Gas limit: 2384969   Nonce: 6\r\nWaiting for confirmation... \r\n````\r\nHere's the log : https://bscscan.com/tx/0x4f29f5b3a26a0eab08ae90756e24942154c0219076623afc7d9ecc0905e3f73c\r\n\r\nI've tried to start another session console and recover the deployed contract using the abi with Master.at([address]), but then Brownie just freezes.\r\n\r\nDo you have any idea what is happening ? Could it be a RPC problem ?\r\n\r\n[edit] : I deployed it through Truffle and verified it. Interestingly enough, running this freezes Brownie too :\r\n```python\r\nmaster = Contract.from_explorer(\"0x6E8d868F4a973F198162d638b6970f657B51f0c4\")\r\n````\r\n",

In the short term though, you can get around it by adding `web3._remove_middlewares()` as the first line in your script.  Or just downgrade to `1.13.4` until a new version releases.",
