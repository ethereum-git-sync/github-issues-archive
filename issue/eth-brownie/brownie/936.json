We can actually compile and deploy that code in remix (using the github syntax instead of the @ syntax. [See here for an example](https://remix.ethereum.org/#gist=03a079b9055f42d993d0066d6f454c6f&optimize=true&version=soljson-v0.4.24+commit.e67f0147.js&runs=200&evmVersion=null).)\r\n\r\nRight now, the workaround is to just copy-paste the whole code into my repo, obviously breaking DRY (don't repeat yourself) and risking having my contract be out of sync with the most up to date version of the contract I want to work with. \r\n",
