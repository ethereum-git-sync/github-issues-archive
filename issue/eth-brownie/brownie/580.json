  "body": "### Overview\r\nBecause Brownie itself is a pytest plugin, there is extensive use of `__tracebackhide__` to indicate to pytest that a module/class/function should be omitted from a traceback. This is useful for not drowning end users in gigantic tracebacks, but makes it difficult when dealing with failed tests within Brownie itself.\r\n\r\nAs a workaround, `setup.cfg` includes the `--full-trace` flag which overrides the traceback pruning. The problem is - this means we also get the entire traceback for pytest's internals.\r\n\r\nI haven't tested that it works, but I'm hoping we can find a middleground where instead of \r\n\r\n```python\r\n__tracebackhide__ = True\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe could instead say:\r\n\r\n```\r\n__tracebackhide__ = CONFIG.foo\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere `foo` is normally `True`, but capable of detecting that pytest is active and swapping itself to `False`.\r\n\r\nThe challenge is that this value is set while module are being imported, so it cannot be modified after the fact during `pytest_configure`.\r\n\r\nThis will take some thought, but I think it's necessary - the overly long tracebacks are getting to me :grimacing: \r\n",
