  "body": "\nHi, Tom from [Codecov](https://codecov.io) here.\n\nWe noticed that you are using Codecov with fairly high frequency, and we’re so excited to see that! However, because you are not using our app, you may have experienced issues with uploading reports or viewing coverage information. This is due to rate-limiting issues from GitHub.\n\n**In order to prevent any future outages, we ask that you move over to our [GitHub app integration](https://github.com/apps/codecov).**\n\nThe process is extremely simple and shouldn’t require more than a few clicks, and you should not expect any downtime. By moving to our app, you will no longer need an admin or separate account to manage the relationship with GitHub as the team bot.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions, or if I can help at all with this process.\n",
