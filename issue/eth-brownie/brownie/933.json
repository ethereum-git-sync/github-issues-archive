    "body": "There are two main reasons Brownie handles networks the way it does:\r\n\r\n* Defining networks within a project's config file means you have to define them for every single project you create. It also creates challenges launching Brownie and connecting to a network when there is no active project.\r\n* How you connect to mainnet might not be the same as how I connect to mainnet.  If the networks are defined within a config file, it creates challenges with version control when multiple people are collaborating on the same project\r\n\r\nI do feel that the current CLI setup is kinda clunky, but I think the approach of per-project network definitions is worse :laughing:  You can edit `~/.brownie/network-config.yaml` directly as a workaround to using the CLI.",

    "body": "Hmmmm. I see what you're saying. I also don't like the per-project connections of an ETH client. \r\n\r\nDo you think it makes sense to add an optional `network-config.yaml` to the project level that would override the config at the brownie level? Maybe that's also sort of gross. The issue is that you can't just \"fork a repo and go\" like you can with hardhat or truffle. \r\n\r\nBut yeah... both are sort of gross... wonder if there is an elegant solution we are missing. ",
