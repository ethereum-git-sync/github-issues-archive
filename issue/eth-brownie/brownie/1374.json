  "body": "### Overview\r\nAs Brownie already helps to verify the code automatically on Etherscan while using its own API, and passing the verification by True in the code already does all. As SnowTrace is pretty much the same as Etherscan, I believe it can also be added to the list of automatic verification of contracts while using Brownie.\r\n\r\n### Specification\r\nI wanted to make sure that SnowTrace verification is not really supported at the moment by Brownie before moving to develop it. So, while also providing SnowTrace API in the `.env` file as done for ETHERSCAN, if the deployment is done on Fuji testnet, then `verify=True` is going to verify on SnowTrace as well if the correct API token is given.\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\nThere is not any other dependency I believe as all of the processes are done through the API, which is almost exactly the same as Etherscan according to my research. If any directions were given, I would also be happy to implement this feature.\r\n",
