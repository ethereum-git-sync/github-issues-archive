This prevents third-party tools to analyze the contracts (for example https://github.com/crytic/slither/issues/638)\r\n\r\nIt would be great if all the json could be available after compilation\r\n\r\n",

Slither creates a dictionary of core contract definitions and here's the output of yearn-protocol with the single Token contract.\r\n```\r\nSlitherSolcParsing:cores {'Token': <slither.core.declarations.contract.Contract object at 0x10196cb50>}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen debugging slither with the Hegic repo I noticed:\r\n\r\n```\r\nINFO:SlitherSolcParsing:cores {'HegicOptions': <slither.core.declarations.contract.Contract object at 0x109a26af0>, \r\n...\r\n'SafeMath': <slither.core.declarations.contract.Contract object at 0x10971b0d0>,....\r\n```\r\n\r\nBoth `HegicOptions` and `SafeMath` are json files in `/build/contracts`.\r\nI have tried copying all the JSON files in `~/.brownie/packages/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts@3.1.0/build/contracts/*` but this still doesn't work :(\r\n\r\nI haven't dig into truffle's logic yet, but they are not copying/compiling the whole openzeppelin library, just a few contracts. Do you know why truffle moves the json files to the project's build/contracts dir?\r\n\r\n",
