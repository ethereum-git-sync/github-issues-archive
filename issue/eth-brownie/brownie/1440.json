  "body": "### Overview\r\nEthereum offers some precompiles, defined in [`contracts.go`](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/core/vm/contracts.go). Currently, these are read-only precompiles which are used via [inline assembly in Solidity](https://medium.com/@rbkhmrcr/precompiles-solidity-e5d29bd428c4) to execute cryptographic operations which would otherwise be too expensive gas-wise.\r\n\r\nOther EVM-compatible chains have started offering precompiles which also allow the modification of state, for example, [Harmony](https://github.com/harmony-one/harmony/blob/main/core/vm/contracts_write.go), [abeychain](https://github.com/abeychain/go-abey/blob/main/core/vm/staking.go) and [Moonbeam](https://docs.moonbeam.network/builders/tools/precompiles/staking/).\r\n\r\nWith the contract ABI and the address of these precompiles, it should ideally be possible to interact directly with them using brownie to stake. However, doing so produces a `ContractNotFound` since there is no bytecode at these addresses. This feature request is to **allow the instantiating of contract objects (using `Contract.from_abi`) to not require deployed bytecode** (perhaps with a flag?).\r\n\r\n### Specification\r\nA temporary hack is listed [here](https://github.com/MaxMustermann2/brownie/commit/8ae2995159c06eddd7e2098a984e08d27542b79f)\r\n```diff\r\n757,758c757,758\r\n<         if not self.bytecode:\r\n<             raise ContractNotFound(f\"No contract deployed at {address}\")\r\n---\r\n>         #if not self.bytecode:\r\n>             #raise ContractNotFound(f\"No contract deployed at {address}\")\r\n\r\n```\r\nI am happy to work on a PR with further changes suggested by the team.\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\nNone that I could find.\r\n",
