  "body": "### Overview\r\nAdd an `interfaces/` folder to the standard project structure.\r\n\r\nThis is needed because Vyper interfaces are not always valid contracts. Currently it is impossible to import outside of the `contracts/` folder, and all files within that folder are included for compilation, so it is not possible to use imported Vyper interfaces in Brownie.\r\n\r\n### Specification\r\n* Allow interfaces to be saved in the `interfaces/` folder\r\n* When compiling Vyper, include interface sources within the `interfaces` field of the JSON input\r\n* When compiling Solidity, include interface sources within the `sources` field of the JSON input, and filter the return data to exclude these source files\r\n\r\n### Considerations\r\n* Must be able to handle Vyper interfaces in `.vy` and `.json` formats\r\n* Changes to an interface file should trigger a recompile of dependent contracts\r\n* When a project uses multiple versions of Solidity, include all compatible interfaces with each compiler run\r\n* When building an ethPM manifest for a project that includes interfaces, prepend source paths with `./contracts` and `./interfaces`",
