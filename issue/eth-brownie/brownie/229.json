  "body": "## The Issue\r\nBrownie allows you to use multiple compiler versions within the same project. However, if a `0.4.x` contract wants to interact with a `0.5.x` contract (or vise versa), there are issues when attempting to import to access the interface.\r\n\r\n## Possible Solutions\r\nNow that [`abi2solc`](https://github.com/iamdefinitelyahuman/abi2solc) is a thing, it could be used to ease this friction point in a couple of ways.  Starting with the most invasive approach:\r\n\r\n  1. ~Introduce a comment flag, similar to how `// dev: error` revert strings work - something like  `// brownie: as interface` that when placed immediately after an import statement, tells Brownie to automagically replace the contract import with one pointing to a compatible interface. The interface is generated on the fly, included in the compiler input json, and forgotten. The end user never sees it.~\r\n\r\n  2. Generate / update interfaces in an `/interfaces` folder at the same time as compiling, initiated by an ``--interfaces`` flag (or similar). Users point at them with regular solidity syntax, no voodoo is required.\r\n",

    "body": "Currently, with other environments, there is no way to use multiple compiler versions in the same project -- correct?  So this is an issue that no one struggles with at the moment.\r\n\r\nBy introducing approach #1 you would make it invisible to the end-user but you're solving a problem that doesn't yet cause anyone pain.\r\n\r\nGiven that using contracts compiled with diff versions is more of an \"advanced user\" approach -- you should know the benefits and detriments to doing this rather than doing it blindly -- I'd tend towards the second approach. Especially if it is a lot less work to implement.  Then if the feature is used, #1 could be the next phase.",
