Including this value enables the functionality.\r\n`gas_price_interval`: the frequency to rebroadcast at.  If not given, should use a sensible default (1 minute seems good)\r\n\r\n`pymaker` already [does this well](https://github.com/makerdao/pymaker/blob/master/pymaker/__init__.py#L525) - it would be good to look at their implementation for inspiration and solutions to problems I've not yet considered.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n#726 ",
