  "body": "### Overview\r\nBrownie's CLI is currently built with `docopt` and a liberal dose of hackiness. As the CLI continues to expand the limitations of `docopt` are becoming more and more apparent, and the relative benefits ever smaller.\r\n\r\n[`click`](https://github.com/pallets/click) is a well supported library. It's already a part of the dependency tree because of `pythx`. I haven't gone deep into the API but it looks like it has solutions for a lot of the things I've had to hack my way around in `docopt`.\r\n\r\nUseful links:\r\n\r\n* [Github Repo](https://github.com/pallets/click)\r\n* [Documentation](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/)\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\nAlthough this change shouldn't break anything, it does require refactoring a significant amount of code. Adding this to the Brownie `2.0.0` milestone list...  if it happens sooner, awesome.",
