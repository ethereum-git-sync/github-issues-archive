  "body": "### Environment information\r\n\r\n* `brownie` Version: v1.18.1\r\n* `ganache` Version: v7.0.5\r\n* `ganache/cli` Version: 0.1.6\r\n* Python Version: 3.8.13\r\n* OS: osx\r\n\r\n### What was wrong?\r\n\r\nI'm running into an issue with using a later version of Ganache that changed the default command from `ganache-cli` to `ganache`.  Trying to run anything in Brownie by default results in the error `No such file or directory: 'ganache-cli'`. \r\n\r\nOne workaround I've found is to open another terminal session and run the `ganahce` command. Brownie is able to detect this.\r\n\r\nWhile that works, I am trying to use the Ganache GUI as well, and I cannot get Brownie to connect to the Ganache GUI RPC without running into the `ganache-cli` issue.\r\n\r\nBased off the information [here](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/v1.0.0_a/test-rpc.html), I'm trying to use `brownie-config.yml` to set the new command line argument. I've added the following, but it doesnt seem to work\r\n\r\n```\r\nnetworks:\r\n  development:\r\n    test-rpc:\r\n      cmd: \"ganache\"\r\n      port: 7545\r\n    host: \"http://127.0.0.1:7545\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAm I correct in thinking this can be fixed by changing the `cmd` setting in the config? What is the correct way to do this?",
