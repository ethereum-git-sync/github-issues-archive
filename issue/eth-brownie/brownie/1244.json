  "body": "### Overview\r\n\r\nIt will be great to be able to pack Ethereum projects as Python packages that can be used with minimal dependencies, for non-solidity developers that just want to be able to use/test a set of smart contracts.\r\n\r\nJust the **ABI** should be required for interacting with deployed contracts and **ABI+bytecode** should be enough to de able to deploy too.\r\n\r\nSo, if I have a folder with .json files (similar to the ones generated in `build`, but perhaps without the sources), I should be able to do:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport brownie\r\nbrownie.project.load_from_compiled_project(\"/path-with-jsons/\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then start using the contracts.\r\n\r\nThis way Ethereum projects can be easily distributed as a Python library, with brownie as a dependency, including the **ABI** and bytecode (even if the project itself doesn't use brownie) and perhaps additional python code with helpers or wrappers.\r\n\r\nFor my case, it will be very useful because I have my public repository using brownie with the Solidity code (https://github.com/ensuro/ensuro/). But I want to do other projects using my contracts that perhaps won't be public or need to be separated from the main repository.\r\n\r\n### Specification\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport brownie\r\nbrownie.project.load_from_compiled_project(\"/path-with-jsons/\")\r\n```\r\n",
