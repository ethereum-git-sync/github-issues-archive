Apparently due to [some issue](https://github.com/eth-brownie/brownie/issues/956) which is not identified.\r\n\r\nI only want to compile once with `brownie compile -all`. That's it.\r\nI work on the frontend side, I don't modify the contracts, I just need a local fork and run some scripts.\r\n\r\nCurrently it's slow as hell to work because depending on the network, the fork dies quickly. Skipping the compilation step would help speed things up.\r\n\r\n### Specification\r\n\r\nI'd like some flag / CLI arguments that would tell brownie console to run with the currently compiled contracts and not even attempt to recompile.\r\n\r\nSomething like `brownie console --no-compile`",
