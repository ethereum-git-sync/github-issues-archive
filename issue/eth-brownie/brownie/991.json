    "body": "Strict pins are to avoid breaking changes within dependencies that sometimes occur on minor or patch releases.  For example, brownie works fine with web3 `5.11.0` but aspects will break using `5.16.0`.  `eth-account` is a similar situation, going beyond the currently pinned patch version will break some functionality.  At one point the `semantic-version` library broke brownie with a breaking change in it's `2.8.1` release. There is some irony in that a library focused on semantic versioning doesn't adhere to semver :)\r\n\r\nPoint being, with floating pins it's possible that a version of brownie that works on the date of it's release will stop working at some point in the future due to a breaking change within a dependency. This leads to projects that rely on brownie having sudden CI failures when nothing has changed, and then a sudden urgency to solve the dependency-created problem and push a new patch release.\r\n\r\nFor this reason I respectfully disagree with you that this an antipattern. The best solution in my mind is to install brownie in it's own virtual environment - `venv` exists precisely to isolate installations so we can avoid dependency conflicts. If you have a hard requirement for brownie to work with a newer version of `web3` I'm open to a pull request. I unfortunately haven't yet found the bandwidth to take care of this myself.",

Even the semver package had a breaking patch version.\r\n\r\nGiven that brownie is primarily a command line tool, I think we need to keep hard pins as the default. However, I definitely see the argument when using brownie as a library. This is more python's fault for not handling packages that can be a library and a package well.\r\n\r\nI think #993 might keep everyone happy:\r\n\r\n1. Normal users doing `pip install eth-brownie` will get hard pins from .txt that won't surprise anyone.\r\n2. People using brownie as a library do `export BROWNIE_LIB=1` and then they can have soft pins.\r\n3. When brownie is going to release, the dev does `pip-compile --upgrade` and tests things. if something is broken, they can tweak the soft pins and re-run pip-compile.",
