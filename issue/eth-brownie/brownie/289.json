  "body": "Currently if you attempt to deploy a contract without explicitly declaring `from`, brownie raises `AttributeError: Contract has no owner, you must supply a tx dict with a 'from' field as the last argument.`\r\n\r\n1. This error is confusing.  It's meant to be given from an already deployed contract.\r\n2. It should be possible to declare a default account, similar to `web3.eth.defaultAccount`, that contracts will be deployed from.  Brownie already has the `default_contract_owner` config setting, so perhaps expand on that?",
