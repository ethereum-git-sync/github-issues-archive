  "body": "### Overview\r\nImprove the method to increase the nonce for an unlocked account to a desired value.\r\n\r\nUse case: Deploy a contract at a specific address (calculated from sender address and nonce).\r\n\r\nCurrently we have to loop empty transactions which creates a lot of spam in the console (each tx is printed).\r\n\r\n### Specification\r\nNaive: I added a PR with an example on how to implement it. \r\nBetter: Ganache support to increase nonce. [See here.](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli/issues/736)\r\nAlternative 1: Implement a batch transaction method where we can pass a list of transactions and get a list of receipts back, executing the transactions silently.\r\nAlternative 2: Add a silent argument to the transaction method.\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\nMaybe https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli/issues/736\r\n",

    "body": "Ideally this is handled in Ganache , but I'm not sure how long we'll be waiting for that so probably best to assume it isn't an option.\r\n\r\nI like the idea and I can see the use case.  But with a dedicated `increase_nonce` function I'm unsure how to the transaction history and `rpc.undo` functionality. Should the empty transactions be included in the history and the undo buffer? Or better to be collectively batched as a single action, somehow? I lean towards the latter but I'm not sure what it looks like.\r\n\r\nExposing `silent` within `Account.transfer` is a very simple solution and makes it easy for the user to run a for loop..  at which point they should be well aware of the consequences of the action re: the history.",

    "body": "Agreed. Do you think batching the transactions would have any benefits other than it potentially being one history element? If batching does not lead to a performance increase or another tangible benefit, then I see little reason to implement it. \r\n\r\nIn my use case, I need to get the nonce of some addresses to high double / low tripple digit numbers to deploy contracts at addresses with specific properties (like only being 15bytes instead of 20bytes long). I would already be very happy to have `silent` exposed to suppress the console output and if eventually this can be done faster via ganache, that would be awesome!",
