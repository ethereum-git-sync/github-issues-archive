  "body": "### Overview\r\nStateful tests can take a _long_ time to execute. This can cause timeouts when using CI, and frustration for impatient users.\r\n\r\n### Specification\r\n1. When running a stateful test, rotate through `|/-\\|/-\\`, writing the next symbol each time a new run of the state machine begins.\r\n2. One a test runs fails and the test is reducing the strategies prior to the final output, change the color of the symbol to red.\r\n3. Try to find a way to also make this work when combined with `xdist` - I think it might be more hassle than it's worth, but it's worth investigating.\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\nNone.",
