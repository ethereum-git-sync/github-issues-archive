  "body": "### Overview\r\nIt should be possible to:\r\n\r\n1. Use a contract that includes an import from a URL such as Github\r\n2. Use contracts that import from NPM (`@openzeppelin-whatever`)\r\n3. Import contracts outside of a Brownie project (via the `allow_paths` cli command in solc)\r\n\r\n### Specification\r\n1. Use regex to parse URLs from import statements and include them in the compiler input JSON. Downloaded source files should be stored in a subfolder within a project and only redownloaded when explicitly told to do so, `compile --all` or some new variant.\r\n\r\n2. Take a look at how Truffle handles this, I think it will involve more regex and use of the `allow_paths` field in the input JSON. 0x uses NPM imports so ensuring their [contracts](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-monorepo/tree/development/contracts) compile is a good target.\r\n\r\n3. I think the best approach is to allow users to add an optional `allow_paths` field in the config file, which is then passed into solc during compilation. Paths added in this manner should _not_ be included in checks for changed contracts when deciding if a recompile is necessary. This must be well documented.",
