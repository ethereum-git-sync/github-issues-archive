  "body": "[Fe](http://fe.ethereum.org/) is an emerging smart contract language that is currently in alpha. Since brownie is a popular tool to develop smart contracts we (the Fe team) would love to see Fe support being added to brownie.\r\n\r\nA few caveats:\r\n\r\n- Fe is currently only distributed as binaries via our [release page](https://github.com/ethereum/fe/releases). I don't know how much that should be a blocker. I think brownie could leave it up to the user to make the `fe` command work on the system and then just work based on that assumption. Or alternatively let the user specify a path to the fe binary or something like that.\r\n- We currently only support Linux and Mac but binaries for Windows will be supported in the future as well\r\n",
