  "body": "### Overview\r\nI haven't looked into it enough to determine the feasibility (as it's written in js), but openzepplin's upgrade plugin is a really powerful tool for building applications with minimal and upgradeable proxies. \r\n\r\nThis would make it easy to have out-of-the box functionality to deploy smart contracts with a proxy, making them easier to upgrade. \r\n\r\nFor reference, see: https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/\r\n\r\nNot exactly sure what this would look like, and I'm aware you can map openzepplin in brownie with the mapping feature but might be nice to have built-in support. \r\n\r\nThis is more of an idea than a fully thought out issue.
