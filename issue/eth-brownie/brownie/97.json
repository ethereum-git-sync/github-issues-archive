  "body": "### What is wrong?\r\nThe only time ``always_transact`` is useful is when evaluating test coverage.  Having it as an optional setting via the command line and config file is more likely to confuse users than to result in it being used correctly.\r\n\r\n### How to solve it?\r\nThis should not be an optional flag. It should be default behavior for coverage analysis, disabled otherwise, and largely hidden from the user.  There can be an argument to disable it for specific tests during coverage, similar to how ``pending`` and ``skip`` work.",
