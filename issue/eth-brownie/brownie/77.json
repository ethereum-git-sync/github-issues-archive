  "body": "When a setting is missing in a project's `brownie-config.json` the current behavior is to default to the value in the package `config.json`.  This could be very confusing for users.  We cannot eliminate pulling settings from the default config because brownie needs some of these even if a specific project hasn't been loaded.  So the best solution, I think, is to give explicit warnings about each missing value when a project is loaded.",
