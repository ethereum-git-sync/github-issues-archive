  "body": "### Overview\r\nIn truffle and hardhat, I'm able to reference contracts outside of my project simply by referencing the package (or remapping in brownie's case) in my javascript code. I'm able to do something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst { LinkToken } = require('@chainlink/contracts/truffle/v0.4/LinkToken')\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis imports the LinkToken contract inside my javascript, so I don't have to import it into the `contracts` section as well. It would be great to be able to reference these packages as well inside the brownie code so we don't have to manually recreate the contracts in our contracts folder. \r\n\r\n### Specification\r\n\r\nIt would then, look maybe something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom brownie import Oracle, accounts, network, chainlink_contracts_LinkToken\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr something of that nature. Maybe even:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom brownie import imports\r\n\r\nimports.get('@chainlink/contracts/truffle/v0.4/LinkToken')\r\n```\r\nor something like that\r\n\r\n",
