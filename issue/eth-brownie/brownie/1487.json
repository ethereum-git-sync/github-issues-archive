  "body": "### Overview\r\nMost hosted nodes have rate limiting. It would be great if brownie had some helpers to avoid hitting these limits.\r\n\r\nIt would also be nice to automatically retry if the limits are hit, but doing that in a way that works with every provider will be challenging.\r\n\r\n### Specification\r\nThe simple solution can be either a requests session hook or a web3 middleware. It would just keep track of its request counts locally and limit itself. This should work on any provider so long as you aren't sharing an api key and as long as you got the limits right.\r\n\r\nA more robust solution would need both a hook and a middleware.\r\n1. a requests session hook that checks response headers for x-rate-limit\r\n2. a web3 middleware that sleeps before sending if the rate limit is reached\r\n\r\nI wish we could do this with just a middleware, but it doesn't appear to have access to the headers. Maybe I'm missing something though.\r\n\r\nRelated: https://github.com/eth-brownie/brownie/issues/1486",
