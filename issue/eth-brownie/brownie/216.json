  "body": "### The Issue\r\nBrownie currently does not support the [Ethereum Name Service](https://ens.domains/).\r\n\r\n### Implementation\r\n`web3py` [already supports ENS](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ens_overview.html), so all we have to do on this side is remove the check for a valid hexstring before passing along addresses.  If a given address ends with `.eth` allow it with no checks, otherwise proceed as normal.\r\n\r\nOne issue is that attempts to resolve an ENS address via `web3py` raises an `InvalidAddress` if not connected to the main net. In situations where the user is using a different network we should connect to the main net via a temporary `web3` instance, resolve the name, and disconnect. This will require a mainnet host declared in `config.py`, which means defining a standard name for that network. A similar behaviour will be needed for #175  - these two issues will likely end up handled together.\r\n\r\nWe should also be caching the resolved addresses on a per-session basis to avoid repetitive lookups.",
