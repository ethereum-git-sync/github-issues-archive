  "body": "When running the tests, there are a variety of deprecation warnings returned from [`docopt`](https://github.com/docopt/docopt). It seems this project hasn't been updated in a long time :/\r\n\r\n1. The last release of docopt was in 2014, however there have been 68 commits to master since then. Possibly the issue has been fixed, and including docopt within Brownie rather than as a dependency is a solution.\r\n2. There is a more recently updated fork, [`docopt-ng`](https://github.com/bazaar-projects/docopt-ng), that might be a good candidate for a replacement.\r\n\r\nActually implementing this should be trivial, but I need to check the code for both projects and see which is a better option.",
