  "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI am currently running into an interesting issue where a smart contract that I have names a function which conflicts with one of the `Contracts` member function. \r\n\r\n```py\r\npython3.8/site-packages/brownie/network/contract.py:786: BrownieEnvironmentWarning: Namespace collision between contract function and brownie `Contract` class member: 'Treasury.info'\r\nThe info function will not be available when interacting with Treasury\r\n  warnings.warn(\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is a tough design choice question, but I think in case of conflict we should suppress `Contract`s method instead of other way around. i.e. we should not do early return in `_check_and_set`. \r\n\r\nThe rationale here is that a user is constructing that contract to interact with it, and not having that contract's functions defeats the purpose. \r\n\r\nLet me know what you think about this.",
