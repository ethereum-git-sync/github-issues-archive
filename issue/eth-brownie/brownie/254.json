  "body": "### Current Structure\r\n* `network.main` contains methods for connecting and disconnecting from networks that are defined within the config file\r\n* `network.web3.Web3` is used to make RPC calls\r\n* `network.rpc.Rpc` launches `ganache-cli` and handles non-standard RPC calls (e.g. snapshots and rewinds)\r\n* information about which network is currently active is obtained either by calling `network.main.show_active`, or by looking at `CONFIG['active_network']['name']`\r\n\r\nThe original idea was for the methods in `main` to handle all connectivity - users should not directly call connect/disconnect methods in  `Rpc` or `Web3`. But this has resulted in inconsistencies within the code re: where information should be accessed, and how to best call a functionality.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Changes\r\nI think a much cleaner design would be to consolidate everything within `Web3`:\r\n\r\n* move connect and disconnect methods directly to `Web3`\r\n* make `Rpc` a member of `Web3` similar to `web3.eth`\r\n* remove the `active_network` field from `CONFIG` and store this data within `Web3`.\r\n\r\nThis will be a breaking change and so cannot be implemented until version `2.0.0`.",
