  "body": "### Overview\r\nSometimes users want to write to the console during testing. Pytest allows this with `-s` but the flag isn't available through `brownie test`. The output can also be somewhat difficult to read.\r\n\r\n### Specification\r\n1. Allow the `-s` flag in `brownie test`. Include a note that it won't work in combination with `-n`.\r\n2. The first time `print` is called in a test, prepend the output with a newline. This will make the output more readable.\r\n",
