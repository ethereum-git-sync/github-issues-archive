  "body": "### Overview\r\nA look at the infura dashboard for Brownie's test suite shows that `eth_getCode` accounts for 25% of all calls, and 90% of traffic!  If we cache this data, it should have a decent impact on the amount of data Brownie is pulling from Infura.\r\n\r\n### Specification\r\n1. Use a middleware!\r\n2. On a call to `eth_getCode`, check in `deployments.db` for bytecode at the address.\r\n3. If the bytecode is known, check for existence of the `SELFDESTRUCT` opcode.\r\n4. If it can't be selfdestructed, return the cached code.\r\n5. If the code is unknown, query it and then store it in the database.\r\n",

Then, any view function that does _not_ access one of these slots can be permanently cached.  This is useful for e.g. `ERC20.decimals()`",
