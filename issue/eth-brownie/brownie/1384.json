    "body": "I was able to publish source after deploying a contract with constructor arguments. As contracts are deployed, they are stored under a Contract Container in Brownie. The Contract Container is basically an array of contracts deployed. An example is probably the best way to show how to publish the source.\r\n\r\nLet's say you have a contract called MyContract. You have deployed several versions of it and want to publish the source for the 3rd version.\r\n\r\nThe Contract Container is called `MyContract` and the contract you want to supply to `publish_source` is `MyContract[2]`.\r\n\r\nThe final function call should look like this\r\n`MyContract.publish_source(MyContract[2])`\r\n\r\nYou can run this in the Brownie Console or in a script. Hope this helps!",
