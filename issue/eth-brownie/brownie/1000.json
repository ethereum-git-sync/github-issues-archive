  "body": "### Overview\r\nI'd love to see brownie support a `.env` file for environment variables. For new engineers, or a project that doesn't want to keep a ton of environment variables running, a `.env` file is a warm welcome. Truffle and Hardhat (the javascript smart contract frameworks) have really nice config files that allow them to work with .env files. A bit of a quality of life improvement.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, we have to call in the `.env` file in all our script manually, seems pretty redundant to do so. \r\n\r\n### Specification\r\nNot sure how this is normal done in yaml, but would like to see something like:\r\n`dotenv: true`\r\n\r\nAnd then they can load via a `.env` file. We could just use https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/ to load at the start of all the scripts.\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\nhttps://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/\r\n\r\nWhat do we think? \r\n",
