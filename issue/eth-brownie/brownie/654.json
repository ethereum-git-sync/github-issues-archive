  "body": "`TransactionReceipt` can be useful for debugging mainnet transactions that weren't broadcasted from Brownie, but there are some minor issues that need to be addressed:\r\n\r\n1. Creating a new object assumes the tx was broadcast, and so there is a console output of \"tx was broadcast, confirmed, blah blah\".  This could be refactored so it happens somewhere in `network/accounts.py`.\r\n2. Each new `TransactionReceipt` adds itself to `TxHistory`. If you create multiple for the same transaction, they're both added. This is weird.  The add should be happening elsewhere, and only when the tx was broadcasted from within Brownie.",
