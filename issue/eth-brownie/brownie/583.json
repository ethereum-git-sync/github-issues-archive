  "body": "### What was wrong?\r\nBrownie cannot use POA networks such as Rinkeby:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n$ brownie console --network rinkeby\r\nBrownie environment is ready.\r\n\r\n>>> web3.eth.getBlock('latest')\r\n  File \"web3/middleware/validation.py\", line 64, in check_extradata_length\r\n    raise ValidationError(\r\nValidationError: The field extraData is 97 bytes, but should be 32. It is quite likely that you are connected to a POA chain. Refer http://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/middleware.html#geth-style-proof-of-authority for more details. The full extraData is: HexBytes('0xd88301090e846765746888676f312e31342e32856c696e757800000000000000f7c64a4f0cae89e657eeb51811c451d11c4ed6e04468c7d4f8343521c77348560343fbe65619d6ffcd698e8be87b74cf6125235d010f6f21571f0ac9ce2d730101')\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed?\r\n\r\nWe must implement the `geth_poa_middleware`. From the web3 [docs](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/middleware.html#geth-style-proof-of-authority):\r\n\r\n> There is no strong community consensus on a single Proof-of-Authority (PoA) standard yet. Some nodes have successful experiments running, though. One is go-ethereum (geth), which uses a prototype PoA for it’s development mode and the Rinkeby test network.\r\n\r\n> Unfortunately, it does deviate from the yellow paper specification, which constrains the extraData field in each block to a maximum of 32-bytes. Geth’s PoA uses more than 32 bytes, so this middleware modifies the block data a bit before returning it.\r\n\r\nI see two potential solutions:\r\n\r\n* Add a network settings flag to indicate that a network is POA, which triggers adding the middleware.\r\n* Upon connecting to a new network, make an RPC call and catch `web3.exceptions.ValidationError` if raised. If the exception message includes a mention of too much `extraData`, add the middleware.\r\n",
