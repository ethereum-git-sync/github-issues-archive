  "body": "A recent update to the `semantic_version` package has deprecated some of the methods that Brownie uses, and broken the build. Brownie should be updated to use the newer features and stop relying on those that are being deprecated. If this is ready before a new version of `semantic_version` releases, then a new Brownie version should be pushed to pypi.\r\n\r\nMore generally, this issue makes a great argument for fixing exact dependency versions in `requirements.txt`.\r\n\r\nRelated issue: https://github.com/rbarrois/python-semanticversion/issues/82",
