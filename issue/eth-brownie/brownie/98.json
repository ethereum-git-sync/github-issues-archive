  "body": "### What is wrong?\r\nThe behaviour documented in [Unit Testing - gas_limit](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tests.html#gas_limit) is very unintuitive.\r\n\r\n### How to solve it?\r\n* Transactions that will revert should __always__ or __never__ broadcast. This shouldn't be related to the gas limit.\r\n* Which behavior occurs can be a network-based setting in the config file. In a local dev environment it's fine to broadcast reverting calls, but when connected to the main-net this behavior is less desirable.\r\n* When set to always broadcast, the ``ContractTx.call`` method can still be used to check if the call will revert.",
