  "body": "### Overview\r\nInstead of using ReactJS which is supported by Brownie, I would like to maximize my use of Python for deployment and minimize the Javascript. However, it is not apparent of a direct way to import. From my limited understanding, Brownie appears to be predominately a command line interface.\r\n\r\nWhile looking at the code, it seems that I could clone the repository and manually integrate into my source so that I can instantiate contracts and query them using the Brownie approach for a contract deployment project. However, that seems like it is a very fragile and error-prone approach.\r\n\r\n### Specification\r\nI am requesting an approach in which to include Brownie within a Python web server deployment project like Flask so that contracts and web rendering logic can managed within the minimal number of languages (e.g. Python and Solidity instead of Python, Solidity and Javascript). \r\n\r\n### Misc\r\nMy guess is that Brownie is currently set up to instantiate its CONFIG singleton which reads the contents of the YAML files. The CLI appears to assert an order of operations so that things get initialized appropriately. It appears that a direct import of Brownie would require the developer to manually do that step. Anything else? Is that a correct understanding?\r\n",
