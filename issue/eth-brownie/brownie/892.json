My use case is doing exactly what you described (\"pull deployment data and interact with a specific deployed instance of a contract\"), except that I want to do it on a ganache fork. \r\n\r\nI can see how there is a bit of overlap between `live` networks, and `development` networks using the `fork` feature. I could see two ways to address it: \r\n1. enable the `fork` functionality on `live` networks. \r\n2. enable `Contract.from_explorer` on `development` networks",
