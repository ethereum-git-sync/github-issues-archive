  "body": "### The Issue\r\n1. The test cases in `tests/cli/test_cli_main.py` are poorly designed. Tests are using a custom class `CliTester` which provides a similar functionality to `monkeypatch.setattr` and `mocker.spy`, but is difficult to understand on first glance.\r\n2. Test coverage for some cli modules is lacking, especially `brownie/_cli/analyze.py` and `brownie/_cli/ethpm.py`.\r\n\r\n### Completion Requirements\r\n1. Rewrite tests in `tests/cli/test_cli_main.py` to use `monkeypatch` and  `pytest-mock`. The `CliTester` class should no longer exist.\r\n2. Increase test coverage for all files in `brownie/_cli/` to >=90%\r\n\r\n### Implementation Notes\r\nFunctionality that is exists outside of the `brownie/_cli/` folder is already covered elsewhere in the test suite. To maximize speed of the tests, you should patch these methods. The important thing is to verify that the CLI is correctly calling the intended methods.",
