    "body": "A big part of the reason Brownie offers a limited subset of `pytest` flags is because of the amount of voodoo happening to allow things like with isolation and coverage.  The test surface is exponentially larger when you add in all the extra flags, almost definitely something will end up breaking.  Forcing the user to type `python -m pytest` in my mind is akin to an acknowledgement of \"I'm doing something that might not be supported\".\r\n\r\nThat said, I'm not inherently opposed to this change. Perhaps raising a warning with it's use that \"here be (maybe) dragons\" - this would be even more explicit than the current approach.",
