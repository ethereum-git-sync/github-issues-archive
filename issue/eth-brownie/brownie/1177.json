  "body": "Right now, Infura is the default for environment variables and connecting to accounts.\r\n\r\nForking from infura right now is _really_ slow, but I've found forking from Alchemy to be *much* quicker. \r\n\r\nPerhaps having a built-in `ALCHEMY_MAINNET_URL`  environment variable would be nice too. Or `ALCHEMY_PROJECT_ID`.\r\n\r\nMight be a little tricky to support both though... This is definitely just a \"nice to have\" ",
