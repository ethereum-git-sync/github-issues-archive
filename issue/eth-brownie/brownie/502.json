  "body": "### Overview\r\nRebuild the [Travis Mix](https://github.com/brownie-mix/travis-mix) to instead use Github Actions.\r\n\r\nActions is superior because it has a lower barrier to entry - anyone with a github account can simply fork the repo and they immediately have CI, without having to sign up for Travis.  This is also much simpler to understand for new users.\r\n\r\n### Specification\r\n1. In [`brownie-mix/travis-mix`](https://github.com/brownie-mix/travis-mix), rewrite `.travis.yml` as `.github/workflows/main.yml`\r\n2. Update `README.md` for the mix and rename the repo\r\n3. Update references to the mix within the Brownie documentation\r\n",
