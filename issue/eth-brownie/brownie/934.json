  "body": "### Overview\r\nProvide a simple overview of what you wish to see added. Please include:\r\n\r\nAs L2's become more popular, more and more people will be looking at side chains like Matic, xDai, and Optimism to deploy their smart contracts. Having native integrations for Brownie would be an easy way for engineers to start using the with Brownie. \r\n\r\n### Specification\r\nOn the networks config page, maybe add an EVM-side-chain or something. And underneath have `mumbai` and `sokol` for starters (Matic testnet and xDai testnet)\r\n\r\nLiterally, everything else is the same.\r\n\r\nFor reference, I have deployed on these two chains with Brownie here, for [Matic](https://github.com/PatrickAlphaC/matic-brownie) and [xDai](https://github.com/PatrickAlphaC/xDai-brownie). \r\n\r\n",

Not having an API to pull sources and ABIs from significantly reduces the brownie user experience.  Now that polygonscan is live, matic support should be present in the next release.\r\n\r\nI'm also speaking to the blockscout team about adding an API, so then we can properly support chains that use it (notably xdai).",
