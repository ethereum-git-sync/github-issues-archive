  "body": "### What was wrong?\r\n`brownie bake` assumes that the primary branch of a repository is named \"master\". Github's recent change of the default branch name to \"main\" means that this will inevitably create an issue for new mixes.\r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed?\r\nProbably there is an API endpoint that can be called to check for the name of the primary branch on a repository. This should be called first, prior to attempting to download a mix, so that any branch name will work.\r\n",
