  "body": "### Overview\r\nThe default gas price seems to be 20 gwei (actually, `brownie-config.yml` says `false`, so who knows what that means)\r\n\r\n### Specification\r\nHave the default be 0.\r\n\r\nFor testing purposes, it doesn't really matter what the gas price is, since really we're only interested in the amount of gas a contract uses, not how much it costs (cost is only a DDoS-prevention mechanism on public networks). It also streamlines the testing of Ether value transfers, because now you don't have to worry about the small differences from paying for gas.\r\n\r\nSo, in reality, it's quite a sensible default.\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\nShouldn't have any issues, but unsure if ganache has problems with this for whatever reason.",
