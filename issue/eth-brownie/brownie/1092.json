  "body": "### What was wrong?\r\n\r\nBrownie caches interfaces the same way it caches contract metadata from compiling from source. This can mess with the user expectations when they simply meant to poke at a contract to see if it responds to methods of a certain interface.\r\n\r\nIn Solidity interfaces are ephemeral, we should follow the same behavior and not associate a potentially incomplete or erroneous ABI with a contract address. Current workaround after using an incorrect interface is to call `Contract.from_explorer` on that address to overwrite the metadata.\r\n\r\nEphemeral interfaces would allow things like testing whether an unknown code at address follows a certain interface without worrying it would break further invocations. An example could be discerning between Uniswap/Balancer/Curve pools.\r\n\r\n### How can it be fixed?\r\n\r\nDon't cache `interface.Something(address)` as canonical ABI for the `address`, handle it like Solidity does.",
