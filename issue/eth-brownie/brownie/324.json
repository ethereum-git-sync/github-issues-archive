  "body": "### Overview\r\nProper test isolation is a good practice. More often than not users will want their tests isolated, and those who do not probably are coming from mocha and simply don't realize it's possible. Instead of offering isolation as a feature, it should be the standard behavior.\r\n\r\n### Specification\r\n1. Remove `fn_isolation` and `module_isolation` fixtures, and apply function isolation as a standard behavior.\r\n2. Create a decorator `@run_after(other_test)` that forces a test to run immediately after another test, without a rewind in between. If the previous test fails, the decorated test will be considered to error during it's setup phase.\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\nNo issue dependencies, but this will be a breaking change.",
