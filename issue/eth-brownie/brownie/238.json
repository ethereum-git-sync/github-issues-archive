  "body": "## Idea\r\nBy examining the trace and looking for `CREATE` or `CREATE2` opcodes, we could return contract instances even when deployment is the result of calling a contract function.\r\n\r\n### Pros\r\n* This would be awesome :sunglasses:\r\n\r\n### Cons\r\n* It means querying the trace even for successful transactions, something we aren't currently doing.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it would be possible to build a function association map, so that we know which functions might eventually lead to a contract being deployed?  This will get very confusing though, in cases where `.call` is used.  Not sure how realistic this is, but it's worth exploring.",
