    "body": "Hey @jmarty-cyber! Sorry for the late response\r\n\r\nIt did end up working, and if I remember correctly I uninstalled both versions (pip and pipx) and then reinstalled pipx. After having pipx again I believe I just followed the readme, and made sure to install eth-brownie only via pipx (not pip).\r\n\r\nI only chose to reinstall pipx over pip because pipx is the newer version of pip, but I think it will work with any of the two.\r\n\r\nHope this helps and feel free to ask any other questions you may have",
