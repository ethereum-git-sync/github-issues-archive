  "body": "### Overview\r\n\r\nWhen running multiple test workers, brownie currently sets the port to port+1. This works most of the time, but only if there is a range of open ports. \r\n\r\nMore robust, would be to tell each node to bind to port 0 and then let the system decide which open port to use. Then we update brownie's config to use the assigned port and everything should work as normal.\r\n\r\nAt this time, I don't think we should change the default to 0 (though I think it is a better default). Instead, we should just make `pytest -n` do this and also support it if its assigned to 0 in `network-config.yaml`.\r\n\r\n\r\nHardhat currently supports binding to 0. Ganache does not (https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache/issues/2643). ",
