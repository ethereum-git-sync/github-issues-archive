  "body": "### `network.connect`\r\n1. Currently `connect` takes a string for a network name, which is checked against config file to determine how to connect.  This is fine when using brownie directly, but if importing into a regular python script it doesn't provide a very granular level of control.\r\n\r\n   I think it should be structured as `connect(url=None, ipc=None, ws=None)` where one of the 3 kwargs has to be supplied.\r\n\r\n2. `connect` is modifying the providers list in the underlying `web3` instance, but there is no check afterwards to confirm that it actually connected to the new provider. There should be a final check to `web3.isConnected()` and it raise if this returns `False`.\r\n\r\n### `Rpc`\r\n3. The call to launch the RPC is dependent upon which network is considered active based on the config file. This relates to the unintuitive behaviour of point 2 above - you have to use network.connect to set the \"active\" network, then you can launch the RPC, then `web3` is actually connected.\r\n\r\n   `Rpc.launch` should take the entire command string as an arg and not be dependent upon the config file in any way. This would also allow use of other clients besides `ganache-cli`.\r\n\r\n4. Based on these changes it might make sense to remove the `launch_rpc` and `kill_rpc` kwargs in `network.connect` and `network.disconnect`",
