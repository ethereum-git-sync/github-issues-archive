  "body": "### Overview\r\nThere are a lot of options in `brownie-config.yaml`. This could be bad because:\r\n\r\n1. It can be overwhelming / confusing for new users\r\n2. There is a lot of potential variance in Brownie's behavior \r\n\r\n### Specification\r\n- [ ] Remove the `networks` field and create a new CLI section, `brownie networks`, where these settings are defined.\r\n    - [ ] Share network settings across all projects. Allow new networks to be added manually, imported and exported to JSON\r\n    - [ ] Default to automatic gas price and gas limit for non-local networks, 0 gas and block-gas-limit for test networks.\r\n- [x] Make all pytest-specific settings optional. Include them in the documentation but do not require them in the config file.\r\n- [ ] Make compiler settings optional. Default to the latest EVM and determine the solc version from the pragma statement. Document possible config settings and allow the default behavior to be over-ridden.\r\n- [x] Remove options for customizing colors\r\n   - [ ] add single (optional) setting to toggle all color use\r\n- [x] Remove the option to minify source and perform this action by default.\r\n\r\nRelated to this, there can be some significant refactoring of how `CONFIG` and `ARGV` are handled internally.\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\nMost of these changes can be made without breaking anything, so long as the configuration fields are made optional without changing their structure.\r\n\r\nSome changes, particularly to `network`, probably _should_ eventually break things, so this may not be complete until Brownie `2.0.0`.",
