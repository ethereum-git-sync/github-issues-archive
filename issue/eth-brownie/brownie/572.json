Some functionality will not be available.\r\n    warnings.warn(\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n> What exactly is the functionality that is not available? Maybe the warning could have a link to the docs with more information.\r\n\r\n### The Issue\r\nBrownie does not support compiler versions prior to `0.4.22`, but there are many actively used smart contracts that use earlier versions.\r\n\r\n### Short Term Fix\r\n- [ ] The above warning message should be improved.\r\n* What functionality is missing?  (Contract cannot be compiled and so only ABI-related functions will work)\r\n* A link to the documentation that goes into more detail about why this is a thing, and which versions this applies to (`<0.4.22`)\r\n\r\n### Longer Term Fix\r\n- [ ] Add support for older compiler versions.\r\n\r\n* The main reason support begins at `0.4.22` is because this is the version where revert strings were added.\r\n* `py-solc-x` can install and compile as far back as `0.4.11`, so it _might not_ be that difficult to add support that far back, which would at least cover Kyber.  OTOH, It's also possible that earlier versions will handle source map offsets differently, or use different optimizations, and things like coverage analysis could be hard.\r\n* Prior to `0.4.11` installation requires building from source which can be problematic for users\r\n* Prior to `0.4.10` there is no JSON compiler interface so the compilation process would have to be rebuilt\r\n",
