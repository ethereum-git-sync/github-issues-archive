The process is currently buried within the [config file documentation](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html#the-configuration-file).\r\n\r\nYou need to edit the configuration file for your project and point it at your local geth client, or add your own API token if you want to use Infura.  Then when running Brownie, include the `--network` flag to specify which network to connect to.\r\n\r\nIf you encounter any bugs while working on a non-local network please raise an issue, or feel free to reach out to me on gitter :)",
