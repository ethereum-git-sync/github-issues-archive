  "body": "### Overview\r\n\r\nFirst, thanks for the awesome work! I just started using brownie and it's an amazing library!\r\n\r\nNow, onto my feature request. I am trying to build an automated trading bot using Brownie. For additional security, I want to use Fireblocks as well, a crypto custody platform that allows me to set custom rules to prohibit unwanted transactions like sending crypto to an address that doesn't belong to me. Fireblocks provides a signing-api where you give it the transaction and it signs it if it meets the previously mentioned transaction criteria. The issue that I have with Brownie is that it seems to assume that you are using private keys to sign and doesn't allow one to do the kind of custom signing I need. So I can't use Fireblocks to sign a transaction.\r\n\r\n### Specification\r\n\r\nMaybe a possible way to implement this would be to allow creating transactions without deploying/signing them and then having another function to send a transaction.
