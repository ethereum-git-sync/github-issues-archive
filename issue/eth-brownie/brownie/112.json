  "body": "### What is Wrong?\r\nCoverage tests execute calls as transactions in order to access their stack trace. This means tests run during coverage analysis differ from tests run regularly:\r\n * The block height is different\r\n * Account balances are reduced from gas costs\r\n* It is possible that callable functions have modified the state.\r\n\r\n### How to Fix It?\r\nhttps://github.com/HyperLink-Technology/brownie/blob/3fcfa0ec8f70d730183df919e40b11622389308f/brownie/network/contract.py#L369-L371\r\n\r\nAfter generating the stack trace, this transaction should be reverted. This will ensure there is no possibility that coverage analysis alters the outcome of the test itself.\r\n\r\nIt will require some tweaks to how the ``TransactionReceipt`` objects are obtained for analysis.",
