This should be expanded to include the following modes, which should be possible to activate for property based tests and / or stateful tests:\r\n\r\n- skip\r\n- run but don't evaluate coverage\r\n- run, evaluate coverage but only for transactions (no calls-as-txs)\r\n- run with full coverage eval\r\n\r\nOther possible ideas, not sure how realistic these are but worth bike-shedding:\r\n\r\n- only evaluate coverage for the first test run\r\n- for state machines, disable coverage while running invariants\r\n",
