  "body": "Hi devs,\r\nBrownie is proper, well done and thank you. I had a recent issue with contract verification that was resolved by upgrading to 1.17.0. Since then testing on Rinkeby has been a breeze with contract deployment and multiple token creation working as expected. \r\n\r\nDeploying to mainnet has been a problem though. The mainnet wallet has 0.0238ETH and I've double-checked the PRIVATE_KEY. The infura mainnet api WEB3_INFURA_PROJECT_ID is good because I can see the stats counter incrementing, however as soon as I run the contract deploy script:\r\n$ brownie run scripts/deploy_contract.py --network mainnet\r\n\r\nBrownie v1.17.0 - Python development framework for Ethereum\r\nBizarreBatzProject is the active project.\r\nRunning 'scripts/deploy_contract.py::main'...\r\nActive network:  mainnet\r\nContract record ./nftcontractfile.json not present. Contract has not yet been instantiated on the blockchain.\r\nDeploying Contract BizarreBatz to the blockchain.\r\nBrownie Contract Info: <brownie.network.contract.ContractContainer object at 0x7f89b61eeb50>\r\nSolidity source upload and verification: True\r\n  File \"brownie/_cli/run.py\", line 50, in main\r\n    return_value, frame = run(\r\n  File \"brownie/project/scripts.py\", line 103, in run\r\n    return_value = f_locals[method_name](*args, **kwargs)\r\n  File \"./scripts/deploy_contract.py\", line 13, in main\r\n    record = contract.deploy()\r\n  File \"./scripts/contract_oop.py\", line 41, in deploy\r\n    record = self.contract.deploy({\"from\": self.dev}, publish_source=publish_source)\r\n  File \"brownie/network/contract.py\", line 521, in __call__\r\n    return tx[\"from\"].deploy(\r\n  File \"brownie/network/account.py\", line 508, in deploy\r\n    receipt, exc = self._make_transaction(\r\n  File \"brownie/network/account.py\", line 743, in _make_transaction\r\n    exc = VirtualMachineError(e)\r\n  File \"brownie/exceptions.py\", line 85, in __init__\r\n    raise ValueError(exc[\"message\"]) from None\r\nValueError: insufficient funds for gas * price + value\r\n\r\nThis script completed perfectly on rinkeby. Is there something I'm missing?\r\n\r\nThank you for any assistance you can offer.\r\n",
