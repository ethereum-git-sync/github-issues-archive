  "body": "### Overview\r\nIt should be possible to broadcast a transaction that will revert.\r\n\r\n### Specification\r\nCurrently, would-be reverting transactions in a live environment are blocked twice:\r\n\r\n* if a gas limit is not set, the call to `eth_estimateGas` will revert.\r\n* if `reverting_tx_gas_limit` is not set in the config, `Account._check_for_reverting_tx` is called. This uses `eth_call` to verify that a tx will not revert prior to broadcasting.\r\n\r\nUsually this is a good thing, but in some cases (such as simulating a failing tx on a testnet) it's not desirable.  It should be possible to disable this behavior, either by a config setting or a parameter in the transaction dict such as `{\"allow_revert\": True}`.\r\n\r\nIn cases where a transaction is blocked by either of these actions, the error message should be improved to explain what has happened and how it can be circumvented.\r\n",
