  "body": "It's a bit confusing right now that the `develop` branch is the \"primary\" branch used. I figure there are a few options to make this more clear:\r\n\r\n1. Just note in the README and contributing guidelines that PR's should be made into develop. I don't like this because surely people will forget and it's not very intuitive.\r\n\r\n2. Move everything from develop into master and just start working out of master. I'm fine with this but @iamdefinitelyahuman I know you seem to like having a development and stable branch separate.\r\n\r\n3. Make develop the \"default\" branch. Instructions available here: https://help.github.com/en/articles/setting-the-default-branch. \r\n\r\n2 or 3 would be great, in my opinion. Open to other options. Let me know what you think.",
