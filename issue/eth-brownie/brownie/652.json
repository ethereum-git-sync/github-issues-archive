    "body": "Hi!\r\n\r\nLooks like you're trying to install globally without adequate permissions.  While installing globally is possible, I don't recommend it as it's likely to conflict with other packages you've installed. That error message shows a conflict with `jupyter-console`.\r\n\r\nThe recommended way to install is to use [`pipx`](https://github.com/pipxproject/pipx):\r\n\r\n```\r\npython3 -m pip install --user pipx\r\npython3 -m pipx ensurepath\r\npipx install eth-brownie\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you prefer to manage the installation yourself, I highly recommend creating and installing into a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) so that the install is isolated.\r\n\r\nAlso, your version of `ganache-cli` is a bit outdated. Brownie is tested against `v6.8.1`, I'd recommend upgrading so there's no chance of running into issues there.\r\n\r\nHere's an article I wrote that goes into detail about the installation process, it might be helpful: [Getting Started with Brownie](https://medium.com/@iamdefinitelyahuman/getting-started-with-brownie-part-1-9b2181f4cb99)\r\n\r\nIf you have any further questions I'll leave this issue open for now, or you can always find me on [Telegram](https://t.me/ethbrownie) or [Gitter](https://gitter.im/eth-brownie/community).",
