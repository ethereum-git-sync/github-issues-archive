  "body": "### Environment information\r\n\r\n* `brownie` Version: v1.19.2\r\n* `ganache-cli` Version: Ganache CLI v6.12.2 (ganache-core: 2.13.2)\r\n* `solc` Version: solc-linux-amd64-v0.8.1+commit.df193b15\r\n* Python Version: 3.9.2\r\n* OS: Linux 5.15.76-v8+ (Raspbian,  arm64)\r\n\r\n### What was wrong\r\n\r\nHi,\r\nwhile trying to create a Contract object by using the \"from_exlorer\" method, brownie automatically downloads the necessary solidity compiler binaries. Unfortunately, in my case they dont work. I hope I am at the right address with this problem since it might be a problem with solc itself on my platform. I wasnt able to find a clear answer whether the released binaries work for a amd64 architecture or not.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91961898/203664670-19c3b147-e130-4075-89a1-3aa9f5f6ef66.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91961898/203664877-9a5e634c-f83f-49f8-8ed6-add24a29b7f9.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91961898/203664928-4f6dc41b-b046-4508-8df4-e13f70a4a769.png)\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nThe problem can be fixed by manually building each compiler version from source when needed. However, my application has to work for arbitrary contracts, so I would have to build all compiler versions, which would suck.\r\nCan anyone help me out here?",
