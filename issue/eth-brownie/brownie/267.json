  "body": "## The Issue\r\nThe current data folder location is a bit inaccessible. For users looking to edit the default config file or manually add accounts, this could be a challenge.  The way it's structured also means that manual installs via `setuptools` don't have access to config data from the previous install.\r\n\r\n## Proposed Fix\r\n* Create a data folder `~/.brownie` and place all brownie data inside it.\r\n* Continue to maintain an original copy of the config file at the previous location\r\n* Check the existence and validity of data in the new folder each time brownie loads, recreate it if checks fail",
