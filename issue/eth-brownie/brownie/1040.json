  "body": "### Overview\r\nRight now, when importing dependencies from github, we only pull from the `contracts` folder if one exists. If one doesn't exist, an error is thrown. \r\n\r\nFor example, the [Chainlink](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink) repo has all the contracts in a folder named `evm-contracts`, and when looking to import, it errors out. The current workaround is to have a separate repo dedicated to renaming this folder to just `contracts`. \r\n\r\n### Specification\r\nDescribe the syntax and semantics of how you would like to see this feature implemented. The more detailed the better!\r\n\r\nIdeally, a config file could look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndependencies:\r\n  - smartcontractkit/chainlink/evm-contracts@0.10.3\r\n ```\r\nOr something of the like. If a path exists after the initial org/repo, then that path would be used as the location of the `contracts`. \r\n",
