Replace `~/.brownie/network-config.yaml` with the file from `brownie/data/network-config.yaml` so that networking tests would pass\r\n3. Ran `python setup.py develop` instead of `python setup.py install` for my virtual environment\r\n4. Running `pytest -p no:pytest-brownie -k <TEST_NAME>` to run a single test instead of docker. I wasn't able to get docker to work. ",
