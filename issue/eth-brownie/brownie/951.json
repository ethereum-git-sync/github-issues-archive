  "body": "### Overview\r\nWhen working with Solidity or Vyper contracts, the ability to monkeypatch named constants in source code (e.g. address literals, parameter defaults, etc.) would be really handy.\r\n\r\n### Specification\r\nThis would require that the language had support for AST node searching and reconstruction e.g. look through compiled artifacts for a given named constant, replace it's value with a specific value (that is compatible with it's type), and then recompile the re-constructed source code for the monkeypatched contract.\r\n\r\nThe following is an example where I am doing something like this in a custom fixture for testing:\r\nhttps://github.com/iearn-finance/yearn-vaults/blob/39109bac7709b96e07a7426a10ed1131580e7cd5/tests/conftest.py#L71-L81\r\n\r\nThe suggested interface for this might be:\r\n```python\r\nfrom brownie import ContractType\r\n\r\nmonkeypatched_contract = ContractType.monkeypatch(\"constant_name\", value).deploy(...)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the interface could catch the condition where the replacement doesn't actually change the source (and thus just returns the compiled artifact instead of re-compiling, for efficiency)\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\nNo dependencies",
