  "body": "### The Issue\r\n\r\nThe Brownie code base does not make any use of [PEP484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/) annotations, and sometimes variable types are changed mid-function. This makes for less readable code which can be discouraging for would-be new contributors.\r\n\r\nImplementing annotation is an important step towards taking Brownie out of beta. It should be a multi-stage process, starting with the most developed areas of the code.\r\n\r\nIn this first step to an annotated code base, the targets are:\r\n\r\n- [`brownie/*.py`](https://github.com/iamdefinitelyahuman/brownie/tree/master/brownie)\r\n- [`brownie/network/*.py`](https://github.com/iamdefinitelyahuman/brownie/tree/master/brownie/network)\r\n- [`brownie/project/*.py`](https://github.com/iamdefinitelyahuman/brownie/tree/master/brownie/project)\r\n\r\n### Completion Goals\r\n\r\n1. Running [MyPy](http://www.mypy-lang.org/) with the following configuration file should complete without any errors.\r\n\r\n```ini\r\n[mypy]\r\ndisallow_untyped_defs = True\r\nignore_missing_imports = True\r\nfollow_imports = silent\r\nfiles = brownie/*.py,brownie/network,brownie/project\r\n```\r\n2. API Documentation must be updated. Each function should include the same annotations as the source code. The following files will require updating:\r\n\r\n    - [ ] [`docs/api-brownie.rst`](https://github.com/iamdefinitelyahuman/brownie/blob/master/docs/api-brownie.rst)\r\n    - [ ] [`docs/api-network.rst`](https://github.com/iamdefinitelyahuman/brownie/blob/master/docs/api-network.rst)\r\n    - [ ] [`docs/api-project.rst`](https://github.com/iamdefinitelyahuman/brownie/blob/master/docs/api-brownie.rst)",

I've done similar tasks on ethereum py-evm in the past. https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/pull/1792\n**2) [crawfordleeds](https://gitcoin.co/profile/crawfordleeds) has been approved to start work.**\n\nHey, I'm very interested in contributing. I'm curious to develop a better understanding of Brown and this seems like a great way to do so. I've never used it but it looks great. Love that solc is built in.\n\nI just saw a talk on these annotations and have a bit of experience working with them now.\n\nI'd start with a few of the easier fixes just to make sure I'm on the right track. Then I'd quickly dive into the more problematic areas, especially functions with variables that change types mid-function. Once those look good to you I'll likely have a few remaining functions before completion.\n\nGenerally, I like to update docs after milestones. Likely, these milestones would be grouped by the grouping provided in the docs. For example, update docs/api-brownie.rst after completing all the functions referenced in api-brownie.rst.\n\nThanks!\n**3) [dherykw](https://gitcoin.co/profile/dherykw) has applied to start work _(Funders only: [approve worker](https://gitcoin.co/issue/iamdefinitelyahuman/brownie/164/3344?mutate_worker_action=approve&worker=dherykw) | [reject worker](https://gitcoin.co/issue/iamdefinitelyahuman/brownie/164/3344?mutate_worker_action=reject&worker=dherykw))_.**\n\nI am interested in carry out this task, I am looking for an open source project to start contributing and brownie would be an awesome one. This task will help me to familiarize with the code and have a good understand of it.\n**4) [sea212](https://gitcoin.co/profile/sea212) has applied to start work _(Funders only: [approve worker](https://gitcoin.co/issue/iamdefinitelyahuman/brownie/164/3344?mutate_worker_action=approve&worker=sea212) | [reject worker](https://gitcoin.co/issue/iamdefinitelyahuman/brownie/164/3344?mutate_worker_action=reject&worker=sea212))_.**\n\nI will add PEP484 conform annotations (parameters &amp; returns values) to all functions in question. You can see how this would look like in another project that I developed alone: https://github.com/sea212/winternitz-one-time-signature/blob/master/winternitz/signatures.py\nAs far as I can tell you are using sphinx to generate the documentation, which is ideal since the types will be automatically included into the generated module reference. You can see an example of this at the documentation of the project I have referenced before (as a PEP484 example): https://winternitz-one-time-signature.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/winternitz.html\nI'll verify the correctness of my type additions using the preferred static type checker MyPy.\nFinally, I'll add the updated type information to the relevant api-*.rst files and check whether the documentation can be generated properly.\n\nLearn more [on the Gitcoin Issue Details page](https://gitcoin.co/issue/iamdefinitelyahuman/brownie/164/3344).\n\n",
