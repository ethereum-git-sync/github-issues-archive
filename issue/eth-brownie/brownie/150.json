  "body": "Possible Improvements:\r\n* if many test modules call an identical setup process, there is no need to repeat the setup for each module\r\n* if multiple methods in a module are executing the same transactions, snapshots could be taken mid-test to reduce repeat transactions\r\n* if tests share identical methods and one test fails, we can assume the other tests fail identically without running them\r\n\r\nHow to Implement:\r\n* For users, offer something similar to pytest's `conftest.py` fixtures where common setup conditions can be given for an entire folder of modules.\r\n* Use ASTs to compare functionality across tests and group them so as to minimize the number of repeated transactions. This is more or less the same process, just happening automatically.\r\n\r\nIn implementing this, it may be necessary to expand the internal snapshot functionality of `network.Rpc`.\r\n\r\nUltimately the most time consuming part of running tests is the call to `debug_traceTransaction` and so the fewer transactions that need to occur, the better.",
