  "body": "### Overview\r\nProvide a simple overview of what you wish to see added. Please include:\r\nWhen a transaction fails in a script or a test case, it would help to see a decoded transaction output just like what one can see on ethtx.info or while using the debug feature on tenderly.co where you can see the state at every step in the txn.\r\n \r\n* What you are trying to do\r\nTrying to improve the debugging process and thus greatly increase the dev ux.\r\n\r\n* Why Brownie's current functionality is inadequate to address your goal\r\nIt shows what the error is for eg. IntegerOverflow but doesn't give any details as to what are the values of the variables at the time the overflow occurred and how were these values reached.\r\n \r\n### Specification\r\nDescribe the syntax and semantics of how you would like to see this feature implemented. The more detailed the better!\r\n\r\nRemember, your feature is much more likely to be included if it does not involve any breaking changes.\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\nInclude links to any open issues that must be resolved before this feature can be implemented.\r\n",
