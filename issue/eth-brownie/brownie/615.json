  "body": "### Overview\r\nDue to the issue explained in #614, we are handling calls as transactions by performing the transaction and then reverting and making the call. This is the safest way, but it could be more efficient.\r\n\r\nSince every transaction has it's trace expanded already, we could be checking the trace for the presence of any of the following opcodes:\r\n\r\n```\r\n0x40 BLOCKHASH\r\n0x41 COINBASE\r\n0x42 TIMESTAMP\r\n0x43 NUMBER\r\n0x44 DIFFICULTY\r\n0x45 GASLIMIT\r\n```\r\n\r\n* If any are encountered, we have to assume the result could have been affected by the new block being mined and we make a call after reverting.\r\n* If none are encountered, we can safely use the return value from the transaction.\r\n\r\n### Specification\r\nThis logic will all happen under the hood - probably in a middleware after `v2` is implemented.\r\n",
