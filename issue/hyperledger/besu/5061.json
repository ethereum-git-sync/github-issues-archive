  "body": "### Description\r\nPR #3911 removed the check, because in a PoS environment the height of a peer is not updated any more. The removal of the check can lead to request that can not be satisfied by the peer, because they have not reached the necessary block height to deliver the requested header/block, which results in an empty response from that peer. This can lead to disconnection from that peer, when 5 useless responses are recorded in within 1 minute (see class PeerReputation).\r\n\r\nThe checks for the block height should be reinstated for PoW and PoA networks.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
