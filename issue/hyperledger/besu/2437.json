  "body": "### Description\r\nAs a user, I want to be able to switch consensus protocols so that when I build my use case around Besu using one protocol, and more efficient or robust consensus protocols are being developed, I am not locked in and can take advantage of new developments.\r\n\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n* After a network has been created, initialized and used for some time, it should be able to change the consensus protocol to a different implementation.\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\nThis is similar to the problem Ethereum has with hard forks when a new breaking update comes out (such as the Berlin update). They solve this issue by announcing the block at which the new features are enabled. Perhaps, a similar solution could work for Besu. Namely, we could announce that at block X, the consensus protocol to be used will be Clique/IBFT2 etc. Then, resyncs should still work up until that block using the old protocol, after which you switch over to the new block. Perhaps easier said than done, but maybe this could be something for future investigation.\r\n",
