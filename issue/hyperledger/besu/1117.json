  "body": "If a private transaction fails validation during block-processing, no receipt is produced, as the EVM wasn't invoked - thus the transaction disappears, leaving behind no indication of its attempted execution.\r\n\r\nThis is different from the public state, where if a transaction fails validation, the block is deemed invalid, and rejected.\r\n\r\nFor example, it is possible for 2 private transactions, from the same sender, in the same privacy group to have the same nonce - the first transaction will be executed and produce a receipt - the second however will fail \"pre\" validation (due to illegal nonce), and will not produce a receipt.\r\nQueries for the transaction receipt will turn up empty - rather than showing the error.\r\nIt should be noted, TransactionReceipts do not support the idea of reporting \"illegal nonce\" - as that would invalidate a block in the public world (rather than producing a failing receipt).",
