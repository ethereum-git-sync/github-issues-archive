  "body": "### Context\nAnecdotally we've been hearing that other Ethereum client nodes are disconnecting Besu nodes. If this is true, this will affect Besu's ability to hear about transactions fast and undermine decentralization and security. However, these have been only anecdotal stories and we don't have a specific incident where we can investigate the root cause. This GH issues is attempting to set up tooling and mechanisms that will help us pinpoint at an event where other peer nodes disconnect from Besu. \n\n### Desired Outcome\n- Come up with a way to note when non-Besu peer nodes disconnect from Besu canary nodes.\n- Store these information on disconnection events somewhere so that we can look back in the future.\n- Provide ability to filter through these events so that we are not overloaded with less-meaningful disconnection events (Most clients periodically drop peers for security reasons and these are not what we are interested in investigating) \n\n### Note\n- Talk to Fabio regarding his idea\n\n\n\n\n",
