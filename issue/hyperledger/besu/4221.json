    "body": "Ok, I think besu has been incorrectly blamed for this one - it is slow responding to eth_getLogs requests and it may be worth optimising that but there are two factors which are causing this to suddenly show up so often and persistently, both issues in Teku:\r\n\r\n 1. When switching from `eth1-endpoint` to `ee-endpoint` there are tighter timeouts applied (8 seconds maximum for a request which is from the execution engine API spec).\r\n 2. Those tighter timeouts surface out of the HTTP client Teku uses slightly differently so we _weren't_ reducing the block rage of eth_getLogs events and so would repeatedly hit the timeout for the same request.\r\n\r\nBoth issues are fixed with https://github.com/ConsenSys/teku/pull/6061 so I'm going to close this one. Optimising eth_getLogs is much less of a priority and can just be handled as part of normal optimising efforts, it doesn't appear to be significantly worse than it was in the past.",
