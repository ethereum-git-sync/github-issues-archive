  "body": "RocksDB has been upgraded from 8.3.2 to 8.9.1 in #6377, but was found by @siladu that it can prevent a Forest node to start, since it gets stuck (indefinitely?) at the initial compaction step, a specific node was stopped after being stuck there for 45min, and a restart didn't help\r\n```\r\n16T22:54:50,765\",\"level\":\"INFO\",\"thread\":\"main\",\"class\":\"RocksDBKeyValueStorageFactory\",\"message\":\"Existing database detected at /data/besu. Version 1. Compacting database...\",\"throwable\":\"\"}\r\n```\r\nReverting RocksDB to 8.3.2 (#6419) solves the issue, so further investigation is need to identify the source of the issue.\r\n",
