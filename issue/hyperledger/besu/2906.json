  "body": "Hello, I have a question. I have been testing Hyperledger Besu on my local machine. And now I need to deploy it on AWS instances. Now, I'm going to need to use Metamask and I don't know if I can do it if I choose a VPC type architecture, since it would be a private network.\r\nCan a VPC with a public gateway be used for these cases? I haven't found any guide.\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n",

    "body": "Hi @damianlluch \r\n\r\nWe've got setups that you can use to deploy to AWS https://github.com/ConsenSys/besu-terraform/tree/master/aws \r\n\r\nThe thing that you'll need to remember is you will need some form of public access to one node that you connect to Metamask. So you've got several options:\r\n\r\n1. Deploy n validators, bootnodes, and RPC nodes in private subnets and use a load balancer (public subnet) to connect to selected instances (private subnets)\r\n2. Deploy n validators, bootnodes, and RPC nodes in private subnets and 1 instance in a public subnet and connect to this IP.\r\n3. Deploy n validators, bootnodes, and RPC nodes in private subnets and use a VPN or tunnel (similar to what you would do with RDS for example) to connect to Metamask\r\n\r\nThe thing to be aware of is that for anything that is made public, please ensure you restrict access to your local IP and ports and not leave it open to 0.0.0.0/0\r\n\r\nLet me know if the above makes sense or if you have any more questions.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n",
