  "body": "## Description ## \r\n\r\nAs a user, I would like to have an allowlist/reject list for certain types of transactions. Besu should have an aware reject-list where when transactions from certain (configurable) addresses enter my mem pool, I can eject them without much fuss. Or specify a certain allowlist where _only_ transactions from this list are accepted. This can be useful for certain private networks and public networks use pertaining to regulations or ethical concerns. \r\n\r\n## Acceptance Criteria ## \r\n\r\nReject List\r\n1. User defines a list of addresses that they want to reject from executing. \r\n2. Besu's mem-pool receives a transaction from an address on this list. \r\n3. Besu's mem-pool ejects the transaction and logs in the console what it has done. \r\n4. User does not execute reject list address tx.\r\n\r\nAllow List\r\n1. User defines a list of addresses from where they are interested in executing transactions. \r\n2. Besu's mem-pool receives a transaction from an address on this list. \r\n3. Besu's mem-pool executes the transaction. \r\n4. User executes accept list address tx.\r\n\r\n2a. Besu's mem-pool receives a transaction from an address _not_ on the list.\r\n3a. Besu's mem-pool ejects the transaction outright. \r\n4a. User does not execute transactions not on the allow-list.\r\n",
