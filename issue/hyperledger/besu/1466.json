    "body": "I know that the onchain permissioning is based on smart contracts and that some change of the rules needs a consensus and it is not immediate. The problem occurs when a transaction is sent. It is assumed that when sending the transaction, it is evaluated against the smart contract, if the account that sends the transaction is allowed, then the smart contrat will return true or false. When this response from smart contract reaches Besu, it does not return any response to the client(web3, openzeppelin or metamask). I think it should return the same response that the permissioned file returns which is \"Error: Sender account not authorized to send transactions\". The client is stuck waiting for the answer from Besu, but it never arrives.",

    "body": "Thanks for the feedback @ccamaleon5!\r\n\r\nThe reason the tx isn't immediately discarded is due to the fact that, depending on the order of blocks and txs being processed, that transaction might be valid. Imagine you have two transactions, Tx1 is whitelisting account A1 and Tx2 is from account A1 to deploy a contract.\r\n\r\nIf in a node in the network Tx2 is processed by a node before Tx1 and immediately discarded, and on another node Tx1 is processed first (and subsequently Tx2), the outcome for the user is even worse, as it might look like the tx succeeded (from node 2 point of view), but if the chain followed by node 1 is the canonical chain, it hasn't succeeded.\r\n\r\nSo, at a specific moment in time, the tx might be valid or invalid, depending on the view of the network that the node has (of course eventually they'll converge into a single canonical truth, but it can take a few blocks). This is in part due to the asynchronous nature of how tx are propagated and blocks added to a chain.\r\n\r\nWe believe our approach is better because the client can always call the permissioning contract before sending the tx to check if the sender is allowed.\r\n\r\nHowever, I do understand that in some private networks, the tx propagation delay isn't that high, and rejecting the tx straight away might be useful. I'll discuss with the team if we should implement a config option to change this behaviour, so users can opt-in to this \"ahead of time enforcement\", but atm the default behaviour won't change. If the pending tx is an issue for your use case, you can add a call to the permissioning contract before submitting the tx and only proceed if they response is true.",
