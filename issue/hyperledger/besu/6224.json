  "body": "### Description\r\nI'm running the following on a single laptop, not running in docker/K8S - just running from locally built code.\r\n\r\nOne node is started with minimal config to act as a boot node. Enable `TRACE` to monitor the address used to send a `PONG` packet back to node 2:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbesu --data-path=data --genesis-file=genesis.json --min-gas-price=0 --p2p-port=30303 --nat-method=NONE -l TRACE\r\n```\r\nAnother node is started with similar config but with a different `p2p` port to avoid a clash, a custom but valid `--p2p-host`, and `--bootnodes` to refer to the first one. No need to enable `TRACE` for this node:\r\n```\r\nbesu --data-path=data --genesis-file=genesis.json --min-gas-price=0 --p2p-port=30304  --bootnodes=enode://beea7aa3a6e1f862870a456239dbf9a232d9a69e58edfeda92193f679bdbf3960bb7f41bc6f0d574c4d0c6baa2324c7279045405ef8a240906bc13d3145ccc14@127.0.0.1:30303 --p2p-host=192.168.0.1 --nat-method=NONE\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\n\r\nMy expectation is to see a line like this in the `TRACE` for node 1:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTRACE | DiscoveryProtocolLogger | <<< Sending PONG  packet to peer 0x9bd8b72c3b53fbe116e7f5be942e159f (enode://9bd8b72c3b53fbe116e7f5be942e159f274bb36989ebf192f67b89629ade816c0129e59d383d8d71e349c0c16db064d60d2317f7064e11719386a6c57897ae0c@192.168.0.1:30304): Packet{type=PONG, data=PongPacketData{to=Endpoint{host='Optional[192.168.0.1]', udpPort=30304, getTcpPort=30304}, ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** \r\n\r\nWhat I actually observe is the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTRACE | DiscoveryProtocolLogger | <<< Sending PONG  packet to peer 0x9bd8b72c3b53fbe116e7f5be942e159f (enode://9bd8b72c3b53fbe116e7f5be942e159f274bb36989ebf192f67b89629ade816c0129e59d383d8d71e349c0c16db064d60d2317f7064e11719386a6c57897ae0c@127.0.0.1:30304): Packet{type=PONG, data=PongPacketData{to=Endpoint{host='Optional[127.0.0.1]', udpPort=30304, getTcpPort=30304}, ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe pertinent difference is the `127.0.0.1` in the `to` endpoint and URL, rather than the expected `192.168.0.1`.\r\n\r\nThe connection works as expected because `127.0.0.1` is valid. However, the node receiving the `PING` is not honouring the host address specified in the `PING` packet.\r\n\r\nThere seems to have been various discussion around the behaviour of `--p2p-host`, most of which appears to be related to exactly what a node advertises in different situations. The docs (https://besu.hyperledger.org/public-networks/reference/cli/options#p2p-host) state:\r\n\r\n\"The advertised host that can be used to access the node from outside the network in P2P communication. The default is 127.0.0.1.\"\r\n\r\n The following docs issue from 2020 seems to describe clearly the affect that `--nat-method` should have on the advertised host:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/hyperledger/besu-docs/issues/332\r\n\r\nChanges to the code in this area include issues with malformed `From` fields in `PING` packets: https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1236\r\n\r\nBut before these changes (which go back to 2020) it looks like the `host` has always been pulled from the `UDP` packet, not the `PING` packet.\r\n \r\nI've tested and raised a PR that gives the behaviour I expect based on reading the docs. However, it's slightly surprising that this hasn't been noticed before. I'm wondering if it's because often the source address of the `UDP` packet is perfectly fine for connectivity to succeed. But it would seem to suggest that the advertised host specified by `--p2p-host` is never used as the address to connect to (unless of course it happens to be the same as the `UDP` source address.)\r\n",
