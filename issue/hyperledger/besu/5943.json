Execute any call without providing strict parameter to eth_call in any version post 21.1.7. Call should be performed with an account that doesnt have any balance.\r\n2. Error returned Upfront cost exceeds account balance from Besu\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\nNot providing the strict parameter should work as intended as defined in changelog 21.1.0:\r\nhttps://github.com/hyperledger/besu/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#2110-breaking-changes\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:**\r\nError returned Upfront cost exceeds account balance from Besu\r\n\r\n**Frequency:** \r\nAlways\r\n\r\n### Versions (Add all that apply)\r\n* Software version: [`besu --version`] Any version > 21.1.7\r\n",
