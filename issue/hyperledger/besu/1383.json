  "body": "\n\n### Description\nThe check if a user has access to a certain privacy group is currently done every time data from that group is accessed. There is a MultiTenancyPrivacyController class that implements the checks. \nWhen pantheon privacy is used the check includes a call to enclave.retrievePrivacyGroup that retrieves the members of the privacy group, in the case of on-chain privacy checking membership is done with a call to the privacy groups management contract to get the participants of the privacy group. \nOne example: Eea_sendRawTransaction will do multiple checks: One check in the class itself. When validating the private transaction, group membership is checked twice, once in the method itself, and once when determining the nonce. \nThe greatest number of group memberships checks happen when a new participant is added to an on-chain group and group membership is checked for each private transaction that is added to the data blob that is sent to the new participant.\n\n\n",
