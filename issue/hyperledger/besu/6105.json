  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nHi, I'm working on replacing the default RocksDB KV storage with another KV database that does not support transactions. However, I can't find the documents regarding the transaction ACID requirements. I'm not familiar with the source code of Besu, and I'm trying to read it. I've noticed that the usages of transactions don't seem to care about conflicts, and there is only one [TODO item](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/blob/e814886d4aa9f64b0f24360e7246e22f3bff574b/ethereum/core/src/main/java/org/hyperledger/besu/ethereum/bonsai/worldview/BonsaiWorldState.java#L204) using the rollback function in bonsai mode. Does this mean that the implementation of the KeyValueStorage transaction allows weaker semantics than RocksDB? \r\nI would like a more detailed description of the KeyValueStorage interface, especially concerning transactions. Can you guys help me? Thanks a lot!",
