Here're the logs shared by the user. \r\n\r\n```\r\nAug 30 10:50:40 xxxxxx besu[65329]: 2022-08-30 10:50:40.874+00:00 | EthScheduler-Services-1022 (importBlock) | INFO  | FastImportBlocksStep | Completed importing chain segment 15438477 to 15438776 (300 blocks in 11488ms), Peers: 28\r\nAug 30 10:50:41 xxxxxx besu[65329]: 2022-08-30 10:50:41.469+00:00 | EthScheduler-Services-1022 (importBlock) | INFO  | PipelineChainDownloader | PipelineChain download complete\r\nAug 30 10:50:41 xxxxxx besu[65329]: 2022-08-30 10:50:41.797+00:00 | EthScheduler-Services-1022 (importBlock) | INFO  | DefaultSynchronizer | Sync completed successfully with pivot block 15438799\r\nAug 30 10:50:41 xxxxxx besu[65329]: 2022-08-30 10:50:41.801+00:00 | EthScheduler-Services-1022 (importBlock) | INFO  | BesuControllerBuilder | Initial sync done, unsubscribe finalized block hash supplier\r\nAug 30 10:50:41 xxxxxx besu[65329]: 2022-08-30 10:50:41.844+00:00 | EthScheduler-Services-1022 (importBlock) | INFO  | FullSyncDownloader | Starting full sync.\r\n``` \r\nI asked for thread dumps to check if there is any thread contention, the user shared three different thread dumps, threads_1.txt, threads_2.txt and threads_3.txt, listed in chronological order.\r\n[threads_1.txt](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/files/9459996/threads_1.txt)\r\n[threads_2.txt](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/files/9459995/threads_2.txt)\r\n[threads_3.txt](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/files/9459993/threads_3.txt)\r\n\r\nWe can notice a thread contention in the first thread dump, 7 threads blocking on a lock held by another thread nioEventLoopGroup-3-7.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"932\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5099602/187635806-a80b3409-c672-442e-ac1f-c3b4a12592fe.png\">\r\n\r\nThe thread that held the lock was executing [this code in EthPeers.java](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/blob/main/ethereum/eth/src/main/java/org/hyperledger/besu/ethereum/eth/manager/EthPeers.java#L169)\r\n```\r\nvoid reattemptPendingPeerRequests() {\r\n    synchronized (this) {\r\n      final Iterator<PendingPeerRequest> iterator = pendingRequests.iterator();\r\n      while (iterator.hasNext()) {\r\n        final PendingPeerRequest request = iterator.next();\r\n        if (request.attemptExecution()) {\r\n          pendingRequests.remove(request);\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe worker threads were blocking when [executing this code](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/blob/main/ethereum/eth/src/main/java/org/hyperledger/besu/ethereum/eth/manager/EthPeers.java#L144)\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic PendingPeerRequest executePeerRequest(\r\n      final PeerRequest request, final long minimumBlockNumber, final Optional<EthPeer> peer) {\r\n    final PendingPeerRequest pendingPeerRequest =\r\n        new PendingPeerRequest(this, request, minimumBlockNumber, peer);\r\n    synchronized (this) {\r\n      if (!pendingPeerRequest.attemptExecution()) {\r\n        pendingRequests.add(pendingPeerRequest);\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    return pendingPeerRequest;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce the lock was released (see threads_2.txt and threads_3.txt), the chaindownloader seems to be broken, all the worker threads are just waiting.\r\n\r\nThread contention may have no link with the chaindownloader issue if locking on this  was intended and wanted to protect pendingRequests collection. \r\n\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\nBesu doesn't stuck after block import step is finished.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce (Bug)\r\nThis is very difficult to reproduce.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]\r\nFull Sync import step should start just after block import step was finished.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]\r\nBesu stuck for more than 2,5 hours after switching from block import step to full import step.\r\n\r\n**Frequency:** [What percentage of the time does it occur?]\r\nrare.\r\n\r\n### Versions (Add all that apply)\r\n* Software version: besu/v22.7.1/linux-x86_64/openjdk-java-17\r\n* Java version: openjdk 17.0.4 2022-07-19\r\n* OS Name & Version: Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional Information (Add any of the following or anything else that may be relevant)\r\n* System info :  Intel i5 (i5-9500 @ 3.00GHz, 6 core), 16GB, with SSD NVMe\r\n",
