  "body": "\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nWorking with private and permissionated network, many times the allow-lists aren't updated with a new IP (domain name)\r\nLabels xdns-enabled and xdns-upda-enabled are active\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce (Bug)\r\n1. Configure in every node the same allow node-list. The enodes are created using public key and domain name validator1-0.besu-validator1.besu.svc.local and so on\r\n3. Start one or two bootnodes. The other nodes (validators and members stay stopped)\r\n4. Using RPC we check the allow-node list in a bootnode. Every domain name is coverted in 127.0.0.1. Its ok as the others POD arent started yet\r\n5. Start the rest of the nodes (4 validators, 3 members and one rpc node)\r\n6. Many times one of them is refused to connect to some boot node. When this happens and we check the allow-list in the boot-node, its domain name remains at 127.0.0.1. The rest of lines (rest of the nodes in the allo-nodes list) are ok, using the domain address\r\n7. In this case the affected node (validator) keeps isolated. Only solution is to restart the node\r\n8. Same behavior using docker desktop and openshift 4 \r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** \r\nAll the items in the allow-nodes list should appear with the domain name, not 127.0.0.1\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** \r\nSome times a node stays in the list with address 127.0.0.1 so that node can't connect with the owner of the list\r\n\r\n**Frequency:** [What percentage of the time does it occur?]\r\n50%\r\n",
