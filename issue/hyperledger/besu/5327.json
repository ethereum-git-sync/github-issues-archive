This configuration has resulted in reducing IO reads for Besu, likely due to the additional OS cache that is available when using less memory (note that cache reads are not counted in IO reads).\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5099602/231120623-48422fd8-3921-4f38-a9d7-774e927eddde.png)\r\n\r\nSystem OS cache + buffer when using OpenJ9 JRE\r\n<img width=\"1649\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5099602/231122858-d6fa838b-c085-4a72-a13c-97acca391df0.png\">\r\n",
