  "body": "Possible regression with upcoming 22.10.4\r\n\r\nLooking at a couple of updated instances (and a report from @benjaminion), it seems that much less transactions are filling the txpool.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85905982/213011460-7efc293b-e8bf-425c-a455-a0114db34c21.png)\r\n\r\nFor example the graph above show how instance tagged with 1 after the upgrade is very slowing adding transactions to the pool, while for comparison restarting an instance (tagged with 2) still on 22.10.3 result in the txpool filled nearly immediately.\r\nThere are no specific changes on the txpool between .3 and .4, but there are some changes to the peers code, so we should look to revert some of them to see if we can found the regression.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our testing, it seems the txpool behavior changed with [this commit](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/commit/2b17e040e1782390b04683f17ec9180bd7ba82f0). It seems unrelated to the txpool, so requires investigation. ",
