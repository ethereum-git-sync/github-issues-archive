  "body": "### Description\nThe flag `--fast-sync-min-peers` actually impacts SNAP and CHECKPOINT sync on non-POS networks. This ticket should remedy that by aliasing it with a new `--sync-min-peers`. We also need to update the documentation to reflect this fact.  <img width=\"1780\" src=\"https://api.zenhub.com/attachedFiles/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBK1IvQWc9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--3a0ab4a9739d97e199e6fb838993e9b3c477886a/image.png\" alt=\"image.png\" /> \nSomething like \"This flag only impacts non-Proof of Stake networks.\"\n\nOne other thought for `--sync-min-peers`. FULL sync could be changed to tolerate it and just give a warning, instead of preventing node startup. Other options seem to be treated that way and that slightly more permissive approach is can be helpful in certain circumstances.",
