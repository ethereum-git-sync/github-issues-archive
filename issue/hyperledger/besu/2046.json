  "body": "When sending a private transaction using flexible privacy the information about the members of the groups and the version of the privacy group is done with two seperate calls to the on-chain management contract. The two calls are both made against the chain head, but if the head changes in between the two calls and the group membership has changed the result would be inconsistent. \nTo fix that we could:\n\n- make sure the two calls are happening against the same block (less changes)\n- return the version of the group and the members from the management contract in one call (more changes incl. management contracts, but makes sure that there cannot be a race condition)",
