  "body": "### Description\r\nPerformance profiling of the core EVM execution loop has revealed that some of the core tasks are inefficient because they are evaluated two to three different times.\r\n\r\n[`org.hyperledger.besu.ethereum.vm.EVM#executeNextOperation`](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/blob/ccefada736850eee6db58d1503f079482ff254a0/ethereum/core/src/main/java/org/hyperledger/besu/ethereum/vm/EVM.java#L69) performs three distinct tasks that are never evaluated separately (apart from possibly unit testing).  The separation of data leads to execution time inefficiency as some calculations are reevaluated.  Some of the data structure choices (for example EnumSet) are also not conductive to \"hot\" operation.\r\n\r\nIt is proposed that we take these methods (`org.hyperledger.besu.ethereum.vm.Operation` `cost`,`executeOperation`, and `exceptionalHaltCondition`) and fold them into a single method where the return value is a larger object containing the gas cost, the gas refund from execution, and the exceptional halts arising from the operation itself (example: EIP_1706 gas minimums).\r\n\r\nThis will involve a large amount of code changes as all operations depend on these three operations, and some halt logic (jumpdest analysis) is distributed out of the operation and may need to remain there.\r\n\r\nIt is also proposed we stop using EnumSet and only track one exceptional halt condition.  If the particular kind of halt matters down stream perhaps instituting a hierarchy of evaluations to ensure the most relevant reason is recorded.  It is presumed in this proposal that having two different reasons to halt at the same time does not matter.\r\n\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n* All reference tests pass\r\n* There is evidence that this improves execution time (EVMTool runs for example).\r\n\r\n",
