Besu has locked my computer up twice although the bigger issue is what I brought up in the tittle not giving any feedback seeming not to sync since the database file is not getting bigger. Tried native and docker instances of besu have had the same issue of no progress. I might be missing something obvious\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce (Bug)\r\n1. it should be as simple as running the docker command with a mounted directory and network set to host, example:\r\nsudo docker run  --network=\"host\" --user 1000:1000 --mount type=bind,source=/media/otna/besu/besuDatabase/,target=/var/lib/besu hyperledger/besu:latest --data-path=/var/lib/besu --data-storage-format=BONSAI --sync-mode=X_SNAP --engine-jwt-secret=/var/lib/besu/token.txt\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** Besu to sync up with the EL\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** Besu does nothing and sometimes freezes my machine\r\n\r\n**Frequency:** Every time\r\n\r\n### Versions (Add all that apply)\r\n* Software version: hyperledger/besu:latest, v22.7.2\r\n* Java version: hyperledger/besu:latest \r\n* OS Name & Version: kubuntu\r\n* Kernel Version: Linux ethValidator 5.15.0-47-generic 51-Ubuntu SMP Thu Aug 11 07:51:15 UTC 2022 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\r\n* Docker Version:\r\nClient:\r\n Version:           20.10.12\r\n API version:       1.41\r\n Go version:        go1.17.3\r\n Git commit:        20.10.12-0ubuntu4\r\n Built:             Mon Mar  7 17:10:06 2022\r\n OS/Arch:           linux/amd64\r\n Context:           default\r\n Experimental:      true\r\n\r\nServer:\r\n Engine:\r\n  Version:          20.10.12\r\n  API version:      1.41 (minimum version 1.12)\r\n  Go version:       go1.17.3\r\n  Git commit:       20.10.12-0ubuntu4\r\n  Built:            Mon Mar  7 15:57:50 2022\r\n  OS/Arch:          linux/amd64\r\n  Experimental:     false\r\n containerd:\r\n  Version:          1.5.9-0ubuntu3\r\n  GitCommit:        \r\n runc:\r\n  Version:          1.1.0-0ubuntu1\r\n  GitCommit:        \r\n docker-init:\r\n  Version:          0.19.0\r\n  GitCommit:        \r\n\r\n\r\n* System info - 48GB DDR4, I9-9900KF, KINGSTON 2TB NVME main boot drive for OS and teku and another 2TB NVME KINGSTON for besu database\r\n\r\n### log:\r\notna@ethValidator:~$ sudo docker run  --network=\"host\" --user 1000:1000 --mount type=bind,source=/media/otna/besu/besuDatabase/,target=/var/lib/besu hyperledger/besu:latest --data-path=/var/lib/besu --data-storage-format=BONSAI --sync-mode=X_SNAP --engine-jwt-secret=/var/lib/besu/token.txt\r\n2022-09-16 20:43:15.444+00:00 | main | INFO  | Besu | Using LibEthPairings native alt bn128\r\n2022-09-16 20:43:15.446+00:00 | main | INFO  | Besu | Using the native implementation of the signature algorithm\r\n2022-09-16 20:43:15.449+00:00 | main | INFO  | Besu | Starting Besu version: besu/v22.7.2/linux-x86_64/openjdk-java-11\r\n2022-09-16 20:43:15.685+00:00 | main | WARN  | Besu | --rpc-http-host has been ignored because --rpc-http-enabled was not defined on the command line.\r\n2022-09-16 20:43:15.688+00:00 | main | WARN  | Besu | --rpc-http-host has been ignored because --rpc-http-enabled was not defined on the command line.\r\n2022-09-16 20:43:15.689+00:00 | main | WARN  | Besu | --graphql-http-host has been ignored because --graphql-http-enabled was not defined on the command line.\r\n2022-09-16 20:43:15.690+00:00 | main | WARN  | Besu | --rpc-ws-host has been ignored because --rpc-ws-enabled was not defined on the command line.\r\n2022-09-16 20:43:15.691+00:00 | main | INFO  | Besu | Static Nodes file = /var/lib/besu/static-nodes.json\r\n2022-09-16 20:43:15.691+00:00 | main | INFO  | StaticNodesParser | StaticNodes file /var/lib/besu/static-nodes.json does not exist, no static connections will be created.\r\n2022-09-16 20:43:15.691+00:00 | main | INFO  | Besu | Connecting to 0 static nodes.\r\n2022-09-16 20:43:15.693+00:00 | main | INFO  | Besu | Security Module: localfile\r\n2022-09-16 20:43:15.703+00:00 | main | INFO  | DatabaseMetadata | Lookup database metadata file in data directory: /var/lib/besu\r\n2022-09-16 20:43:15.737+00:00 | main | INFO  | RocksDBKeyValueStorageFactory | Existing database detected at /var/lib/besu.

Had to switch to nimbus which is syncing for the last 10 hours already synced 40% without issues. I'll experiment with besu and nimbus when the sync completes. I had also a case of besu syncing normally a few days ago/before the merge but for some reason did not let it complete I think it froze my PC but not sure.

You are not required to be a validator in order to run a full node. You just need a beacon node and engine api configured (with the execution client). \r\n\r\nWhere are you at in your sync? It's weird that importing validator keys made a difference, I may try generating/importing keys just to test behavior.",

Instead of having a cl client pointing to multiple el clients you now have to have a cl client for every el client and the failover is established at the validator client level, where you can point to multiple cl beacon nodes.",
