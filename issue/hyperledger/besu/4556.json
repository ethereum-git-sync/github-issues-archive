The responses from `eth_syncing` and the Engine APIs report different statuses.\r\n\r\n It should be investigated whether these responses can be made more consistent.\r\n\r\nRelated ticket: #4436 \r\n\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n`eth_syncing` returns a response consistent with Teku's reporting of Besu's sync status.\r\n\r\n### Versions (Add all that apply)\r\n* Software version: 22.7.5",

But eth_syncing seems under-specified; the highestBlock might not be known to be valid, and syncing execution layers are importing blocks without knowing if they are valid. In a Github discussion (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/25845#issuecomment-1259447646) @M H Swende (holiman) points out that an execution client doesn't have enough information to know whether it is actually behind anymore, and wants eth_syncing to refer to a subset of catching-up behaviors, distinguishing state sync from importing. I mostly want it to be the same API because of my own usage, but it would not be a problem for us if there was a separate eth_behind flag.\n\nIn the same vein, the execution layer seems to require some additional information from the consensus layer in order to be able to know whether it is behind. I think it can be accomplished by adding a block number to one of the ForkChoiceUpdated parameters. My preference would be for there to be a block number for each of head, safe, and finalized.",
