We believe this is taking way too long and would like to investigate the root cause of this slowness so that we can improve the sync time.\n\n### Desired outcome\n- Set up an archive node with metrics, logs, performance profiling so that we can monitor and identify anomalies in syncing speed\n- Identify root cause for slow syncing \n- Propose potential solutions to improving sync time",
