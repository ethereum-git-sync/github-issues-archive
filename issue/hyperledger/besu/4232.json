    "body": "I would not recommend changing `--Xsynchronizer-fast-sync-full-validation-rate=0.0001` to be the default. That reduces the security of fast/snap/checkpoint sync because it doesn't verify as many headers fully. It's ok if you know you've done it and pay attention to the final sync result but probably doesn't make a good default. While it may make importing the blocks faster, it shouldn't affect the ability to keep peers around which was the major impediment to sync I was hitting - the two reduced sizes are much more likely to be the reason besu kept peers better.",
