Client 1 starts with chain G -> A.\r\n1. ForkchoiceUpdated is sent to Client 1 with A as Head.\r\n1. Two PoS blocks are produced on top of A.\r\n1. Client 2 starts with chain G -> B -> C.  \r\n1. Blocks A and C reach TTD, but have different heights.  \r\n1. ForkchoiceUpdated is sent to Client 1 with C as Head.  \r\n1. PoS Chain is continued on top of C.\r\n1. Verification is made that Client 1 Re-orgs to chain G -> B -> C -> ...  \r\n\r\nAfter (3), Client 1 height is 3, then it connects to Client 2 and received a FcU to C, but Client 1 is not able to reorg because Backward Sync only ask for block headers with height >=3\r\n\r\n",
