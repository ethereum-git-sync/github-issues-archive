  "body": "In order to do performance testing for Bonsai Tries and EIP-1559, we need to be able to create a testnet with a large state. To do this, we should create a new proof of work testnet where we gradually increase the number of accounts and storage slots used in the testnet, from 10,000 accounts and storage slots, all the way to 100 million (~mainnet's size), increasing by 10x after each successful run. \n\nOn the first block, we should deploy a contract which has a very large ETH balance (100m+) and which both sends 0.1 ETH to an address and creates a storage slot for that address in its internal storage. We should keep doing this until we reach the limit we want for that testnet (e.g. send to 0x0...01, 0x0...02, etc. up to the 10,000th address for the first network, 100,000th for the second, etc. up to 100 millionth address). It does not matter that we do not have access to these addresses. \n\nThe transaction format used should be 1559-style transactions to ensure we are testing this appropriately. Ideally, we should manage the rate at which we send transactions to have short bursts of high TPS, which raise the base fee for a short period of time, and then a lower rate to keep it relatively stable. \n\nFor each network, we should keep an export of the blocks saved as well as any other relevant data so that we can stand it up quick if needed. Once we are  confident enough in the stability of these networks and start approaching 1/10/100m accounts, we should reach out to different teams to get them onboarded on the testnet as well. ",
