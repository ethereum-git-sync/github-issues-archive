  "body": "### Description\nAs a staker, I may want an option that is a middle ground for disk and being a good citizen on the networkI can serve old blocks when requested and have a reasonable sized disk for home staking. \n\nAs this profile does not provide new defaults, it can serve two purposes:\n1. As a placeholder for future staking-specific options (specifically snap server)\n2. To give the user the impression they are more properly configured. \n\n### Acceptance Criteria\nThe profile implements no new defaults over the defaults specified in #5391\n",
