  "body": "I am trying to spin up an ethereum node using Besu software so that I can eventually stake some Eth. I have a RP4 with a 1 TB ssd and am trying first with the Goerli network since I know that I need at least a 2 TB SSD for an actual node.\r\n\r\nI can not get the Besu software to run properly after working through installing Java and some other needed software. When I try to run Besu, I receive this message:\r\n\r\nbesu --config-file config-besu-goerli.toml\r\nError: Could not find or load main class org.hyperledger.besu.Besu\r\nCaused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.hyperledger.besu.Besu\r\n\r\nFrom my reading that does not specifically have the answer, I inferred that it could be a configuration issue with Java and Besu. Or it could be that Besu needs to be compiled since I downloaded the 22.7.0 package and installed it through the CLI.\r\n\r\nAny help is greatly appreciated as I work to increase my knowledge about Eth nodes!",
