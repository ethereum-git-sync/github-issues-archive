  "body": "### Description\r\nAs an enterprise user planning to set up a permissioned chain, I want to be able to choose a TX pool that's more suitable to my requirements, and isn't called `legacy` which implies it might be deprecated.\r\n\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\nA new transaction pool name for what is currently called the `legacy` pool is decided, and either `legacy` or the new name can be set as a value for the `--tx-pool` configuration parameter.\r\n\r\nFor maintainers and community members to vote on the most suitable term for the pool, I've added a comment for each option that was discussed in the 1[1/28/2023 EMEA/AMER contributor call](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/BESU/2023-11-28+Contributor+Call), with a short explanation. People can vote with a thumbs-up on the one they are most happy with and after a week or two I'll raise a PR with the new name.\r\n\r\n**Note:** I've included a couple of \"anti-suggestions\" so people can see some of the options that were generally ruled out in the contributor call discussion. Thumbs-up on this will be taken to mean people agree that they are not suitable.\r\n\r\nI've started the ball rolling with a vote for `sequenced`.\r\n",

Since the legacy pool has had changes recently to make it more FIFO-like in its behaviour (see for example https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/6106 / https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/6022) and thus a little \"fairer\" from the point of view of individual senders, `sequenced` describes a little about its implementation and about how TX selection is done.",
