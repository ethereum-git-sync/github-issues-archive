  "body": "### Description\nWhen a peer is initiating a connection with us (RlpxAgent handleIncomingConnection() there is a very good chance that they have gone through the bonding process in the discovery layer. When filter on ForkId is enabled there is a good chance that we have received the ForkId from that peer. That ForkId should be used to check whether that peer is on the same chain and whether we want to connect to it\n\nThis task is related to #5272\n\nAlternatively we could try to find the peer in the PeerTable before we are doing the Handshake. The Handshake for inbound connections is started in NettyConnectionInitializer, in the method inboundChannelInitializer()\nThe problem with that is that we do not know the peer id at that point, only the IP address. We could search the PeerTable using the IP address, but there could potentially be multiple nodes using the same IP address. \nThe benefit of doing that would be that we potentially don't do a handshake with a peer on a different chain. Handshake uses ECIES, which is expensive.\n",
