Private Besu network running with Kafka appender for Log4J set in config.\r\n2. Kafka servers crash or not avaliable\r\n3. Network's performance start to decrease\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\nAlthough the logs show the Kafka's warning messages, the performance of the network should not be affected.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** \r\nNetwork's performance start to decrease.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Logs\r\n\r\nHere starts the warning logs.\r\n```\r\n2023-06-13 11:25:00.126+02:00 | EthScheduler-Workers-66018 | INFO  | PersistBlockTask | Imported #15,293,893 / 0 tx / 0 om / 0 (0.0%) gas / (0x5145aec319d7c6f69a085e144f19931f39afd67867a1eabc0319f3052936fe6\r\n2023-06-13 11:25:05.160+02:00 | EthScheduler-Workers-66019 | INFO  | PersistBlockTask | Imported #15,293,894 / 0 tx / 0 om / 0 (0.0%) gas / (0x899530055a74b3f2b4ac664cdb509d31dcbf24bb618e8a1ec953763e130e4cf\r\n2023-06-13 11:25:10.164+02:00 | EthScheduler-Workers-66020 | INFO  | PersistBlockTask | Imported #15,293,895 / 0 tx / 0 om / 0 (0.0%) gas / (0xc0d12c17975246e40aca0c1dcd83a1cd884e5aaf383d2edd0448e2f8d5be3df\r\n2023-06-13 11:25:15.161+02:00 | EthScheduler-Workers-66021 | INFO  | PersistBlockTask | Imported #15,293,896 / 0 tx / 0 om / 0 (0.0%) gas / (0x74b555e88808b4f9fd5d0587f3f9bc834b37552dc1bffe67d776d158ca09edd\r\n2023-06-13 11:25:20.139+02:00 | EthScheduler-Workers-66022 | INFO  | PersistBlockTask | Imported #15,293,897 / 0 tx / 0 om / 0 (0.0%) gas / (0x36dc60d2783adf67e749d8b3da3822ec578666fefbc270902d32e4bd2f5590f\r\n2023-06-13 11:25:25.133+02:00 | EthScheduler-Workers-66023 | INFO  | PersistBlockTask | Imported #15,293,898 / 0 tx / 0 om / 0 (0.0%) gas / (0xf213a57929e6949ed9355014a66d188162917d562cb096482a03c0884430642\r\n2023-06-13 11:25:30.187+02:00 | EthScheduler-Workers-66024 | INFO  | PersistBlockTask | Imported #15,293,899 / 0 tx / 0 om / 0 (0.0%) gas / (0x513bb5725d93bef62ed612230728d076c8e24fb9d79926c89b36ab719c2f46d\r\n2023-06-13 11:25:35.166+02:00 | EthScheduler-Workers-66025 | INFO  | PersistBlockTask | Imported #15,293,900 / 0 tx / 0 om / 0 (0.0%) gas / (0x0bee2f641493d16cc7659d7c246481d86228f6077b65dbc88dc483951dacca5\r\n2023-06-13 11:25:40.161+02:00 | EthScheduler-Workers-66026 | INFO  | PersistBlockTask | Imported #15,293,901 / 0 tx / 0 om / 0 (0.0%) gas / (0x2ce9de04c4f01496b52580400df73db173cc9f0b93952ae245689fe1e74c427\r\n2023-06-13 11:25:45.193+02:00 | EthScheduler-Workers-66027 | INFO  | PersistBlockTask | Imported #15,293,902 / 0 tx / 0 om / 0 (0.0%) gas / (0x5cca66c9722a43f6b255ae3dffb901af976d7812f8f8979043bc775eeeaec8f\r\n2023-06-13 11:25:50.400+02:00 | EthScheduler-Workers-66028 | INFO  | PersistBlockTask | Imported #15,293,903 / 0 tx / 0 om / 0 (0.0%) gas / (0xb3d6e2815c4b7944b86752760e44a5285e6b46a68d88a16e3a005d9183656bc\r\n2023-06-13 11:25:55.201+02:00 | EthScheduler-Workers-66029 | INFO  | PersistBlockTask | Imported #15,293,904 / 0 tx / 0 om / 0 (0.0%) gas / (0xb34b1dad5e776d63ef6fd43a1578e7d4dab62bfb6508f1d50f15a3b4c2cb08c\r\n2023-06-13 11:26:00.117+02:00 | EthScheduler-Workers-66030 | INFO  | PersistBlockTask | Imported #15,293,905 / 0 tx / 0 om / 0 (0.0%) gas / (0x6c7853e469defcb377b875a71a52419a555a71474c43b28f7605f8105a3692e\r\n2023-06-13 11:26:05.126+02:00 | EthScheduler-Workers-66031 | INFO  | PersistBlockTask | Imported #15,293,906 / 0 tx / 0 om / 0 (0.0%) gas / (0x48fcbb4b9b1aea0365214d1ac5b2b06e7953b9430e7b44a6bba41971a56f20f\r\n2023-06-13 11:26:09.793+02:00 | kafka-producer-network-thread | producer-1 | INFO  | NetworkClient | [Producer clientId=producer-1] Node 3 disconnected.\r\n2023-06-13 11:26:23.816+02:00 | kafka-producer-network-thread | producer-1 | INFO  | NetworkClient | [Producer clientId=producer-1] Node 2 disconnected.\r\n2023-06-13 11:26:33.422+02:00 | kafka-producer-network-thread | producer-1 | INFO  | NetworkClient | [Producer clientId=producer-1] Disconnecting from node 4 due to socket connection setup timeout.
