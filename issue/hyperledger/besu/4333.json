  "body": "### Description\r\nAs a non-developer syncing Besu, it would be helpful if Besu's log messages included summaries of what Besu is currently doing and its progress in a non-developer friendly way.\r\n\r\nJust to set some context, you'll see in the Discord messages in the Besu channels on the hyperledger server as well as on the ethstaker server that many solo stakers are using logs to determine how their sync is going. Most of the messages are coming from people who aren't fully aware of how Besu works internally (its syncing mechanisms, its codebase, etc). Grafana dashboards provide some of this functionality but in an overly summarized way for people who want to know \"minute by minute\" if things are healthy and functioning properly. There are a couple things that could catch people out currently:\r\n\r\n1. It would be nice to better delineate the different block import stages. For example, during the longer initial sync phase, it seems you aren't able to restart the Besu process without at least some risk of it needing to resync entirely over again, but there is nothing in the logs to warn you against doing that as far as I could see.\r\n2. The world state syncing and healing process is communicated as a percent, but block importing is not. When I synced Besu the first time, I had a naive view of what \"world state\" meant and assumed the percent represented the sync percent.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce (Bug)\r\n1. Start a fresh Besu sync\r\n2. Open the log output\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\n\r\nInclude the current sync stage (initial sync, final sync) in the progress messages as well as a percent:\r\nCurrent: \r\n```\r\nCompleted importing chain segment 435601 to 449600 (14000 blocks in 10089ms), Peers: 25\r\n```\r\nMaybe something like: \r\n```\r\nInitial sync 2.9% complete after importing chain segment 435601 to 449600 (14000 blocks in 10089ms), Peers: 25.\r\n```\r\n\r\nInclude a warning at the state of the initial sync stage to keep Besu running.\r\nCurrent: \r\n```\r\nmain | INFO  | DefaultSynchronizer | Starting synchronizer\r\nmain | INFO  | SnapSyncDownloader | Starting sync.\r\n```\r\nChanging to something like:\r\n```\r\nmain | INFO  | DefaultSynchronizer | Starting synchronizer\r\nmain | INFO  | SnapSyncDownloader | Starting initial sync\r\nmain | WARN | SnapSyncDownloader | Do not restart Besu during the initial sync phase. That could lead to Besu needing to restart its sync\r\n```\r\n\r\nInclude a message that more clearly delineates the initial sync from the final sync:\r\nCurrent:\r\n```\r\nPipelineChain download complete\r\nSync completed successfully with pivot block 15426018\r\nInitial sync done, unsubscribe finalized block hash supplier\r\n```\r\nAdding something like:\r\n```\r\nInitial sync completed, switching to final sync to catch up to the head of the chain. It is now safe to restart the Besu process.\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:**\r\nThe logs require some level of knowledge of how Besu works \r\n\r\n**Frequency:** 100%\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n* Software version: 22.7.1",
