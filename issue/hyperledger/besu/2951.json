This mocks should either be deleted (when only mocked in a single test), or prefixed with `lenient()` if the same mock is shared in multiple tests of which only some use it.\n\nThis issue should be timeboxed; hard cases should be moved to separate issues.\n\nIf tests are identified as ineffective because they do not call a critical mock, this should be flagged (or fixed if easy).\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n* As many test as possible run using `MockitoJUnitRunner`\n* Tests classes that do not use `MockitoJUnitRunner` should be marked as such (so that it is easier later on to deal with them)\n* Newly failing tests are fixed",
