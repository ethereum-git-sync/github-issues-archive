Other peers are disconnecting with Besu nodes (addressed by #3980)\n3. Peers list are not filling up (addressed by #3897 and #3982)\n5. There's a risk of malicious actors connecting as peers (addressed by #3981)\n6. Number of peers exceeding the max number specified (not really an issue)\n\n### Goal\nNode operators can quickly start syncing/importing blocks by having \nBesu find \"good\" peers fast and consistently have good ones.\n \n### How Will We Know We Are Successful?\nCompare the **time to complete a snap sync** before and after a set of improvements we make in peering \n\nBaseline metrics: #3853\n\n### How Are We Defining Good Peers?\n- Provides correct world state data fast\n- Has a matching pivot block\n- Has fast response time\n- Delivers the data we ask for\n- Has \"heaviest\" chain \n- Gets and gossips new blocks early\n",
