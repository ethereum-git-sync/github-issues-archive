Thanks for your help",

    "body": "Hi! I'm glad to hear that you want to explore the Besu codebase. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, we don't have any documentation on how to add a new consensus algorithm in Besu. I'm afraid your best option is to analyse the commits history and find out the last time we have added a new consensus algorithm and try to map the required changes. You can find most of the consensus-specific logic in this package https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/tree/main/consensus.\r\n\r\nI have to warn you that it is likely to be a big change and take considerable time to do so. The changes can span across multiple modules and it can be tough to do it on your own.\r\n\r\nIf you have plans to contribute your work to the project, I suggest that you join the contributors call (https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/BESU/Agendas) and make your case. Depending on the community feedback you might be able to get some extra hands to help you with the development.\r\n\r\nHere is some useful information on how to contribute with Besu https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n\r\nAnd we also have a RocketChat channel where you can talk to other people working on Besu: https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/besu\r\n\r\nI am going to close this ticket as it is not going to be a development item that will be undertaken right now. In the future, if it is accepted in the call, we can create a tracker ticket for it.",
