  "body": "Some of the points I discussed with Stefan about the DNS issues some users have been reporting:\n\n- [x] Setup a rocket pool besu node (seems more likely to encounter DNS issues)\n- [x] Evaluate the possibility of hiding the DNS timeout warning when node already has peers.\n- [x] Re-check interval we use to resolve the DNS (we retry every 10 minutes when DNS gets updated every 12 hours) Maybe only re-check if we haven't successfully resolved the DNS yet.\n- [ ] Investigate a more complex improvement which would be not collect all DNS entries at once and try in batches.

Also it provides no improvements since after Tuweni DNS resolves the tree it keeps track of the latest seq number resolved and won't retry resolving the tree.\r\n4 - Has also been attempted before and suggested to be done in Tuweni (see #1707 and )",
