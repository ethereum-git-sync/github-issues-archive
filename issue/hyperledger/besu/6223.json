I think there were more previously but I wasn't able to capture a heap dump when there was a high amount of GC occurring.\r\n\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n* Able to sync without high GC or high heap usage\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce (Bug)\r\nCheckpoint sync on mainnet. I don't know the exact steps I have only seen this occur once. Likely due to specific network conditions.\r\n\r\n### Versions (Add all that apply)\r\n* Besu version 23.10.3-dev-3765aaf3",
