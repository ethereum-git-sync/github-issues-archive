Well it will make it esay for people who want to rent hashrate and solo mine on their own node. \r\nSo when miner connect to the node so at first connection the diff set to 0. So if you want to mine with NH you will be disconnected. Im not sure if you can use Extranonce to set diff at first connection or something.
