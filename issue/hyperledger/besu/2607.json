Upon encountering the first JUMP instruction, all valid jump locations are computed and stored in a bitmap on the Code object. Unfortunately, that Code object is not retained for future use, so this analysis must be repeated on the first JUMP instruction of every contract, every time it is run.\r\n\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. Reuse of jump destinations on all subsequent contract executions. \r\n2. Runtime speed improvements proportional to the number of jump dests in the contract. Pathological EVMtool test case [attached](https://gist.github.com/jflo/6f46fd44fd706c3f26deaacadf5b1a45), should speed up considerably.\r\n3. Cache entries must be evicted on Account deletion.\r\n4. Cache entries must be evicted on contract self-destruct.\r\n5. Entries should expire out of cache in LRU order when total cache weight is hit.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
