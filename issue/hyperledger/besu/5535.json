When we will have optimize the blockchain part it would be interesting to check the worldstate part\n\nFor the worldstate part we can play with:\n- the size of stacktries for storage and accounts,\n- increase the number of accounts and slots retrieved by requests\n- increase the number of threads that the pipeline can manage.\n- parallelize persist state if IO is not a problem\n- optimizations at the code level (do not generate the tree fragment several times to validate the proof and persist)\n",
