Currently those endpoints are explicitly added in WebSocketMethodsFactory, and will likely need to be accounted for in the engine endpoint.\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n* engine api serves eth_subscribe and eth_unsubscribe\n\n### Steps to Reproduce (Bug)\n1. connect nimbus to besu execution engine\n2. observe that deposit contract tracking fails due to \"unimplemented method\"\n\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]\nThe full set of web service eth_* methods are available on the execution endpoint, including eth_subscribe and eth_unsubscribe when the connection is upgraded to web socket\n\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]\n\n**Frequency:** [What percentage of the time does it occur?]\n\n### Versions (Add all that apply)\n* Software version: [`besu --version`]\n* Java version: [`java -version`]\n* OS Name & Version: [`cat /etc/*release`]\n* Kernel Version: [`uname -a`]\n* Virtual Machine software & version: [`vmware -v`]\n* Docker Version: [`docker version`]\n* Cloud VM, type, size: [Amazon Web Services I3-large]\n\n### Smart contract information (If you're reporting an issue arising from deploying or calling a smart contract, please supply related information)\n* Solidity version [`solc --version`]\n* Repo with minimal set of deployable/reproducible contract code - please provide a link\n* Please include specifics on how you are deploying/calling the contract \n* Have you reproduced the issue on other eth clients\n\n### Additional Information (Add any of the following or anything else that may be relevant)\n* Besu setup info - genesis file, config options\n* System info - memory, CPU\n",
