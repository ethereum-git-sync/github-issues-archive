The spec doesn't say it clearly, but the intention was announcing the tx size without the length prefix, because the canonical tx format (the one we use in sendRawTransaction) does not have it.\"\r\n\r\nBesu will need to be updated to not include the RLP string envelope for typed transactions into its size.
