Utilize and monitor with prometheus ``besu_synchronizer_in_sync``\r\n2. Set an alert for anytime it's below 0.9\r\n3. Notice that periodically it'll hit that alert.  It currently seems to be that the client is indeed in sync so I assume those are errorneous.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** Not to go below 1.0 if it's in sync with head.\r\n\r\n### Versions (Add all that apply)\r\n* Software version: ``22.7.1``",
