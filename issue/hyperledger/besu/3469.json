  "body": "_Note: This should be looked at in conjunction with https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/issues/3146\nPotentially #3146 will fix this. This issue is kind of the reverse of #3146: we need to perform IBFT operations on the previous block once we're in the QBFT context._\n\nBefore migration, IBFT uses IbftExtraDataCodec to create the extra data for the block preceding the migration.\nUpon migration, the MigratingMiningCoordinator stops the IBFT BftMiningCoordinator and starts the QBFT BftMiningCoordinator. \nAt this point, the next block to be created will go down the appropriate QBFT code paths. \nPart of validating a new block (the first QBFT block) is the AncestryValidationRule which has this line:\n`if (!header.getParentHash().equals(parent.getHash())) {`\n\nThe parent.getHash is recalculated (TODO check why it's not memoized?) and this depends on the IbftExtraDataCodec however this code path only has QbftExtraDataCodec available.\n\nThere may be other points in the code apart from the AncestryValidationRule that have the same issue.",
