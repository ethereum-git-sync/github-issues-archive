The messaging is between the app nodes and not besu nodes (although the messages can travel via besu nodes if needed).\r\n\r\nThe messages can be simple with json payloads for example. It may or may not be encrypted. Point-to-point. Http/tcp would be fine as the messages won't be continuous like chat but a one-off.\r\n\r\nFor example, let's say, I have 2 application nodes named, **x** and **y** connected to 2 separate besu nodes. I just want to make a simple http/tcp call from \"x\" saying send message \"abc\" to \"y\" and that should be it. I shouldn't care about node discovery and the address conversion from \"y\" to its IP address etc. should be handled by the API.\r\n\r\nAs Besu already does some sort of private messaging via Orion to support its Private Transaction feature, I was wondering if I could use the same API or extend it for my usecase.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
