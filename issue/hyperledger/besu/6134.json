  "body": "From Pari\r\n\r\n> Someone working at the EF with ERC-4337 bundlers reached out and asked if we can point more sepolia validators towards mev-relays. Currently the number is ~40%, goerli is the highest at 64%(but deprecated) and mainnet has ~94%. So ideally they want to move from goerli to sepolia, but would need a higher % to be using mev-relays.",
