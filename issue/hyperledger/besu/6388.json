Besu and geth are not idempotent and returns an error. dapps (MM included) do not distinguish this case from any error and consider the tx failed.\r\n\r\nThere could be multiple causes for the duplicated requests, [for example](https://nginx.nginx.narkive.com/FbCAKZEy/proxy-seems-to-send-twice-the-same-request-to-the-backend):\r\n> With keepalive connections, it is possible that server will close\r\n> the connection and the client will start sending a request a the\r\n> same time. This case is specifically outlined in RFC 2616,\r\n> https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-8.1.4\r\n\r\n\r\nProposal; make Besu idempotent in this case, so the duplication is invisible for dapps.\r\n",
