    "body": "Hyperledger Besu permissioning logic is split between enforcement and rules management. The enforcement of the rules is carried out by the client and this by design is decoupled from the rules engine that is supported by custom smart contracts. The current set of smart contracts only support binary account permissioning, defining if an account is allowed to transact on the network or not. This is not fine-grained enough to meet requirements where accounts may be able to carry out certain types of transactions or meet a defined set of rules. This might be achieved by adding further customisation flexibility to the permissioning smart contracts.\n\nRequirements\n\n- Ability to define which set of Ethereum accounts are able to submit transactions to the network. This could be only accounts that belong to a certain organization, a particular set of accounts, or a combination of both.\n- Required account permissioning rules: \n- Value transfer (yes/no/limits)\n- Execute code on a contract (yes/no/specific contracts only)\n- Create a contract\n- Sender/Target restrictions (can only interact with address A, B, C and not others)",
