Currently we are using a Quorum based Ethereum client with private transactions. Would like to know if there are any constraints in migrating from Quorum to Bessu?  \r\n\r\nAlso, what will happen with the private state data available in the GoQuorum and Tessera nodes.  Is it possible to migrate the private state completely from Quorum to Besu?\r\n\r\n",

PMT's are not yet implemented. I am looking for replacing all my Quorum nodes with Besu.\r\n\r\nI believe below are some of the key differences between both EVM implementations.\r\n1. Quorum is managing Private states for each account while Besu manages Private states per privacy group. \r\n2. Private Transactions in Besu are always PMT's. Currently we are using Internal Private Transactions in GoQuorum\r\n3. Tessera for Besu operates in \"orion\" mode. The underlying private states are managed for each Privacy Group\r\n4. GoQuorum uses Level DB as its State Database where Besu uses RocksDB as State DB.\r\n\r\nWill it be possible to migrate from Quorum to Besu without losing the current private transactions?\r\n\r\n",
