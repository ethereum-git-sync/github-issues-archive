Currently we are using a Quorum based Ethereum client with private transactions. Would like to know if there are any constraints in migrating from Quorum to Bessu?  \r\n\r\nAlso, what will happen with the private state data available in the GoQuorum and Tessera nodes.  Is it possible to migrate the private state completely from Quorum to Besu?\r\n\r\n",
