    "body": "Hello @ItayPodhajcer,\r\n\r\nThank you for sharing your feedback and I can see how my previous answer might have caused some frustration there with seemly unrealistic expectation. I meant to say that contribution in any way (however small or big) is welcomed not to mean that we are expecting a community member to implement the entire migration. \r\n\r\nIBFT 2.0 is equally production-grade and we have several enterprise customers using it in their production environment. We are only encouraging new users to use QBFT because weâ€™d like to converge on a single PoA consensus protocol and sunset IBFT 2.0 in the future. When we plan on doing that is still to be determined at the moment. However till we make that decision, we are going to support both IBFT 2.0 and QBFT plus before we sunset IBFT 2.0, we will provide a migration path so that the upgrade process is seamless. \r\n\r\nMay I ask you why youâ€™d like to migrate to QBFT? There shouldnâ€™t be much difference between IBFT 2.0 and QBFT in terms of user experience but Iâ€™d like to understand what you are looking for in QBFT. Thank you!",
