    "body": "Thanks that was fast!\r\n\r\n@shemnon I know the code is there, I'm just saying the json needs additional processing before it's readable by a human.\r\nTypically this means taking the code, and disassembling it (not decompiling, just getting human readable opcodes from bytes), and mapping them to the PC in the json. This is a lot harder to do when you're on a phone, reading a trace someone pasted on slack for you to read :)\r\n\r\nThe geth-style (I'm guessing EIP-3155) traces from the `debug_` endpoints are great for that, and I'm happy to see there's one available for simulating transactions!",
