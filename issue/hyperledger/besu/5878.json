We have observed continuous DNS lookups to **raw.githubusercontent.com**, which I believe are unnecessary for this setup.\n\n**Setup Details:**\n\nBesu Version: 23.4.0\n\nOS: Linux RHEL 8\n\nNumber of Nodes: 4\nAll nodes are running on the same VM, as part of different **docker containers using besu docker image** and are part of the same internal docker network.\n\n**IBFT** algorithm is used for blockchain consensus protocol as part of this network.\n\n\n**Expected Behavior:**\n\nGiven that my nodes are all on an internal network and  not relying on external configurations/scripts, I would expect no external DNS lookups, especially continuous ones.\n\n**Actual Behavior:**\nContinuous DNS lookups to raw.githubusercontent.com.\n\nWhat could be the expected resolution for this.\n\nHere is the reference in the [code](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Ahyperledger%2Fbesu%20raw.githubusercontent.com&type=code).\n\n",
