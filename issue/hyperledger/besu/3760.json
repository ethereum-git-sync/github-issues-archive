(https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/blob/main/src/engine/specification.md). \r\n\r\nFor a rollup to be censorship-resistant, rollup operators need to be able to create a new block with a specific list of transactions, defined externally to the operator (e.g forced directly through L1). The Current [Execution API specification](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/blob/main/src/engine/specification.md) does not allow such functionality. Moreover, this functionality would be valuable to have because it would simplify block creation logic/flow in the Operator.\r\n\r\nTo support such functionality, `engine` api can be extended with a new  method with the following arguments:\r\n- **parentRootHash** - hash of parent block, upon which new block should be created;\r\n- **transactions** - list of transactions to be included in the block, in the specified order;\r\n- **suggestedFeeRecipient** - recipient of the transaction fees;\r\n- **blockGasLimit** - limit of gas to process the transactions;\r\n- **skipInvalidTransactions** - if true, when an invalid transaction (e.g nonce) is in the `transactions` list, the execution engine should  skip it and carry on processing the remaining transactions;\r\n   - invalid transactions should be reported the why not executed/reverted because the operator needs to justify why the transaction cannot be executed.\r\n\r\n### Method: `engine_createNewBlock`\r\nExtend engine API with a new method, e.g `engine_createNewBlock` (or any other name more suitable and semantically correct. engine_processNewBlock?)\r\n\r\n### Request\r\n```\r\nengine_createNewBlock(\r\n   parentRootHash: 0xAF01..., \r\n   transactions=[], \r\n   suggestedFeeRecipient = 0xBF01..., \r\n   blockGasLimit=..., \r\n   skipInvalidTransactions=false\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Response\r\n- result: `Object`\r\n    -  status: `Object`\r\n       - `INVALID_TERMINAL_BLOCK` - when `parentRootHash` does not exist;\r\n       - `INVALID_TRANSACTIONS` - when a transaction is invalid and `skipInvalidTransactions` is false;\r\n       - `BLOCK_GAS_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` - when the processing of `transactions` exceeds `blockGasLimit`;\r\n       - `PROCESSED` - when block was successfully processed;\r\n  - `executionPayloadV1`: `Object` - defined when `status = PROCESSED` as in [ExecutionPayloadV1](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/blob/main/src/engine/specification.md#ExecutionPayloadV1)\r\n  - `failedTransactions`: `Array of Data` - list of receipts of failed transactions. Defined when `status = PROCESSED, skipInvalidTransactions = true`\r\n- error: `Object` - `code` and `message` set in case an exception happens while processing the request.\r\n\r\n### Specification\r\n1. Engine looks for the block with `parentRootHash`, if not present returns failure status `INVALID_BLOCK_HASH`\r\n2. Engine process a new block in the given list of `transactions` in the given order. \r\n2.1. Engine validates that block does exceed `blockGasLimit`. The engine may return `BLOCK_GAS_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` as soon as it checks that `blockGasLimit` is exceeded;\r\n2.2. Invalid transactions: \r\n- `skipInvalidTransactions = false` the block processing is aborted and returns with `INVALID_TRANSACTIONS` status;\r\n- `skipInvalidTransactions = true` engine discards the current transaction and continues to process the remaining transactions until it finishes.\r\n3. Engine responds to the call when successful with \r\n  - ```{ result: status = PROCESSED, executionPayloadV1:  ExecutionPayloadV1, failedTransactions: [...]}``` \r\n",
