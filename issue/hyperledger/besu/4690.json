  "body": "### Description\r\nAs a user, if I encounter a catastrophic issue with my worldstate, I want to be able to resync JUST the world state with snap or checkpoint sync, so that I can keep my database intact and greatly reduce sync times.  \r\n\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n* User with corrupted worldstate can resync\r\n* Database remains intact through the resync \r\n* BWS or forward sync imports remaining blocks between the end of the chain download and the head of the chain\r\n* Stalled sync can resume downloading both worldstate and blockchain without issue \r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce (Bug)\r\n1. DB hits a catastrophic failure\r\n2. Only recourse is to delete the database to trigger a resync \r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]\r\n* User can trigger a resync in another way, or\r\n* Besu is intelligent enough to know the failure is catastrophic and trigger a resync of just the worldstate on its own and then complete the chain download\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]\r\n* User is frustrated and must trigger a full sync \r\n\r\n**Frequency:** [What percentage of the time does it occur?]\r\n* All the time with catastrophic DB failure",
