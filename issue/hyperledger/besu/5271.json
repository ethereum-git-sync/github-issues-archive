  "body": "### Description\nAt the moment we have \"switching\" tasks, that go through the list of our peers when it is necessary to retry a task, and we have \"retrying\" tasks, that select the \"best\" peer every time we need to retry that task. As the best peer was selected the first time this task was called, there is a very good chance that we are selecting the same peer to retry that task. It makes more sense to select a different peer, which the \"switching\" tasks do.\n\nMake sure that all tasks behave the same when getting a \"useless\" response. At the moment we have cases where we are returning an Optional.empty() and cases where we throw a IncompleteResultsException.\n\nMake sure that we are doing the switch to another peer when needed. I think that we are not always doing that for \"useless\" responses.\n\nThere are tasks that we want to call with a specific peer, like getting a block or transaction when it was announced by one of our peers. We need to make sure that this can still happen.\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n* There are no 'retrying' tasks left\n\n",
