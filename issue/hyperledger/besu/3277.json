  "body": "Currently to build besu you need to have solidity installed. \n\nWe did this recently to get around the web3j gradle plugin needing to contact an internal server that was down. Long story. But \n* the server is back up\n* the gradle plugin is soon/already updated to avoid contacting this internal server (check if there's an updated version)\nso shouldn't be a problem in the future.\n\nWe want to go back to using the bundled solc that comes with the plugin. \n\nMost helpful would be to look at the recent PR that made the change to circle CI config to install solc\nhttps://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/3183/files\nTwo changes that need to be reverted\n* don't install solc on CI executor\n* don't specify solc path/version in acceptance-tests/tests/build.gradle\n\nSee discussion here https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/besu-contributors?msg=jysJnqTRZxWc77Zoj",
