    "body": "Probably not a bug so much as a feature with unintended consequences. \r\n\r\nIt make sense to partition bad blocks by fork since they blocks may be valid/invalid depending on different fork rules.\r\n\r\nIt does mean that the previous fork's bad blocks are unavailable in the debug_getBadBlocks endpoint, however that's a very minor edge case, probably not worth the effort so closing this.\r\n\r\nIf we implemented the \"archive\" cache mentioned in #5460 and made it agnostic of fork/protocol schedule then that may fix this issue as well.",
