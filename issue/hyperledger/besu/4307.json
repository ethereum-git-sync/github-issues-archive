  "body": "Hello!\r\n\r\nI ran into a problem: I need to restrict the blockchain from users who should not be able to deploy contracts on the network, but only use those contracts that were deployed from a specific address.\r\n\r\nFound that Besu has an API for [tracing and filtering](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/22.7.0/HowTo/Troubleshoot/Trace-Transactions/#transaction-trace-filtering-apis) (well, or something like that). However, I don't understand how it can be used. I have to specify somewhere in the configuration files what the blockchain should reject, but how do I do it?\r\n\r\nAt the same time, it is desirable that the method of solving the problem does not involve paying for gas in the network (now I have a Besu configuration that does not require paying for gas).\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** \r\nWhen attempting to deploy a contract from a regular user address (without privileges), the transaction must be rolled back.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** \r\nAny user can deploy a contract (including those who do not have ether).\r\n\r\n### Versions \r\n* Software version: hyperledger/besu:22.7.0\r\n* Java version: 18.0.2.1\r\n* Docker Version: 4.11.1",
