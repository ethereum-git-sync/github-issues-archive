    "body": "This method does return a signing key that has been set against the privacy node. \nThis key is used in a lot of ATs because it usually does not matter which key is used to sign a private transaction. \nIn cases where the signing key used does matter we do usually pick certain ones, e.g. a key that is not the owner of an on-chain privacy group.\nSigning keys in general (public or private TXs) are not bound to a certain node. I think this method is more like a convenience method to have a signing key available.\nI would propose that we keep this method as it is and close the issue.",
