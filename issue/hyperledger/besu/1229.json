  "body": "Umbrella issue for the \"Bonsai Tries\" effort.\r\n\r\nBonsai Tries aims to add a new database storage mode that instead of a multi-trie key value store (the forest) it is one trie, one set of indexed leafs, and a series of diffs that can be used to move the trie forwards or backwards (one well-manicured and smaller sized trie). The diffs can be used to serve up historical queries in most cases with just the diff.  This will reduce chain head account and state read and write amplification from its current 10x-50x levels to 1x-5x for non-committed access.\r\n\r\nCurrently envisioned as three deliverables:\r\n* State based backup and restore\r\n  Provide enterprise chains an offline backup of trie state that can be restored without syncing.  This will establish and work the trie reconstruction code prior to leaf piles.\r\n* Leaf Piles\r\n  Provide the leaf part of the Bonsai Tries, where leafs will be available for the current head.  Includes roll forward and roll bacward support for leafs.  Possibly two small deliverables: read mode and write mode, but it is not certain yet that one can be done without the other.  Trie branches will still be managed in the forest mode.\r\n* One Manicured Trie\r\n  Add on the support for the trie branches in the one trie approach.",
