  "body": "There is no need to keep all the trie logs for a near-head node as the state for old blocks is rarely needed. This will place a configurable limit on how many trie logs are kept reducing storage needed for a node.\n\n* Add configurable limit for number trie logs to be kept\n* Prune old trie logs that are not needed\n* Trie logs are stored by block hash so there will need to be a way of determining with block hashes to remove the trie logs for\n* The logic used for the block pruning which keeps a list of block hashes for each block number could possibly be reused for pruning the trie log",
