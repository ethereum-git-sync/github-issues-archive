  "body": "### Description\nAs a user, I need my backward sync session to be performant enough to reach the chain head. With Bonsai's structure, backwards sync will often trigger large reorg-like roll-forwards/backwards with Bonsai that eat CPU, block threads, and cause issues with the sync.\n\nCurrently, when the CLs gets out of sync, they will handle a return to the chain head differently. \n* Nimbus will walk through blocks at a \"wall-clock\" pace to try and bring itself and Besu close to head\n* Prysm spams new payloads in sequence without a FCU, causing issues with Bonsai \n* Teku \n* Lighthouse\n\n#### Besu could:\n* Optimistically set the chain head to the tip when receiving FCU \n* Start a heal when the head is too far \n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n* Backwards sync is as performant as forward snap-sync for reaching the head ",

    "body": "My node went down today for around 12 hours before i could get it back online again.\r\n\r\nIt is going to take ~4 hours to resync the 12 missed hours because blocks are importing sequentially in 4 or 5 seconds intervals. \r\n\r\nAs a user, this makes a moderate amount of downtime quite a pain to recover from. As a staker, this makes Besu client look unattractive as an EL client choice as we need multiple clients of roughly equivalent performance.",
