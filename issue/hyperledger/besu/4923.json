I want to be able to make large and repeated queries to the RPC layer that spawn new processes and do not block the main loop. This may require separating dependencies for RPC and the database layer, when accessing state/DB info and doing things like EVM traces. \r\n\r\nThis issue is to track a SPIKE that will investigate how to efficiently separate and scale the RPC layer. The current implementation in Besu is not suitable for use-cases like rollups that require large amounts of tracing or repeated RPC calls that can run asynchronously. \r\n\r\nSome ideas are .......\r\n1) \r\n\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n* \r\n",
