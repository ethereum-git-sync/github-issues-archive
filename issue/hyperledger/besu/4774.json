We recommend using at least Java 17 because that will be the minimum requirement in the next Besu version series.\r\n\r\n[Source](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/public-networks/get-started/install/binary-distribution/)\r\n\r\nHowever, the `latest` docker containers seem to use `Java: openjdk-java-11`\r\n\r\nI don't know if this is intentional but I would assume the Docker should use the recommended version, no?\r\n\r\nIt looks like there is a `latest-openjdk-latest` but it still seems counter intuitive for the tag most people will run to not run the recommended version.",
