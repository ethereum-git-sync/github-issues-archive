Checkout https://github.com/joshuafernandes/besu-sample-networks/tree/test-nct \r\n2. Branch `test-nct`\r\n3. Run `./run.sh -c ibft2`\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** \r\nWhen specifying  host-whitelist=['localhost', '127.0.0.1']  here https://github.com/joshuafernandes/besu-sample-networks/blob/test-nct/config/besu/config.toml#L10 the nodes connect and blocks are produced but I dont see any metrics in prometheus or grafana. Updated to add 'prometheus' to that list and expected it to work but still got nothing. Even created a network with fixed IPs for each container and add that IP to the list  host-whitelist=[\"prometheus\",\"172.24.2.16\",\"localhost\",\"127.0.0.1\"] and got nothing going to prometheus. The only thing that seems to work is [*].  Note that at the nodes and chain progresses fine, this is just applicable to metrics being pulled from the prometheus container. Is this bad config I've got or a bug?\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** \r\nAm able to get metrics only with a host-whitelist of ['*']\r\n\r\n**Frequency:** \r\n100%\r\n\r\n### Versions \r\n* Software version: latest as at 31/3/2020\r\n* Java version: 11\r\n* OS Name & Version: ubuntu 18.04 host - running docker containers via compose\r\n* Virtual Machine software & version: n/a\r\n* Docker Version: 19.03.7, build 7141c199a2\r\n* Cloud VM, type, size: n/a\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\ncc: @EdJoJob @jakehaugen \r\n",

    "body": "+1 to finding out exactly what's going on first and we probably should validate this with real experts, but...\r\n\r\nI believe it would be safe to allow requests with no `host` header.  The key reason for the domain whitelisting is to prevent DNS redirection attacks which allow any website to send a request to `mycustomdomain.com` and have `mycustomdomain.com` resolve to `127.0.0.1` and thus allow the request to be sent to the node.\r\n\r\nBrowsers always include a `host` header so requests without it didn't come from such an uncontrolled source.\r\n\r\nIf we're being paranoid (and we probably should be) then supporting a `<none>` option in the whitelist might be a suitable option as well.",
