Once the checks above have passed for sanity:\r\n\r\nrun unitTests\r\nany test failures will be annotated on the PR.\r\ntests will be sharded based on prior runtimes.\r\nOnce the PR is approved, the following can be run in parallel.\r\n\r\nrun acceptanceTestsPermissioning\r\nrun acceptanceTestsCliqueBFT\r\nrun integrationTests\r\nrun acceptanceTests\r\nrun referenceTests\r\nTest results can then be posted back to the PR, and any failures would prevent merging. If all pass, then the following artifacts are created, unique to the commit for this workflow.\r\n\r\ntarball created\r\nzipfile created\r\ndocker images created\r\nShould a release be decided on for this commit, the creation of a draft release would trigger:\r\n\r\npublishing of prior created artifacts with the release name and an RC1 suffix.\r\ncreation of a release branch, should additions be necessary for an RC2.\r\nWhen a release comes out of draft, and is approved:\r\n\r\nall artifacts are published as a non RC version number.\r\ndocker latest tag is moved.",
