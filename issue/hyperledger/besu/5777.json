  "body": "The transaction RLP module which is being built atm requires a few features that aren't available at the moment, chief among them:\r\n- [ ] access to the raw RLP string of the transaction (including the signature)\r\n- [ ] access to the RLP string deduced from the transaction (everything save the signature itself) which must be hashed and which is used as an input to the ECRECOVER method to retrieve the public address of the sender\r\n- [ ] access sets as already mentioned in #5731 with the following caveat:\r\n  - [ ] the order in which order matters\r\n  - [ ] repetitions (if any) matter and must not be lost",
