  "body": "As a Besu contributor, our build pipeline runs the acceptance tests for privacy / permissioning / tessera code, regardless of if that area of the codebase is touched or not. This has a two-fold impact:\n1. Increasing build time and CI cost\n2. Develop headaches and time lost \n\nAs a Besu contributor, I would like to have the acceptance tests split out depending on what part of the code I am touching. If I push mainnet related code, it should not trigger these acceptance tests. If this is not trivial, I should be able to pass some parameter that ignores these sections of code.\n\nA fallback would be to run the acceptance tests on Main nightly as opposed to with each build for privacy. This will alleviate the issues mentioned above.",
