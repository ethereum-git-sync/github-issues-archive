  "body": "### Description\r\nA `23.4.1` besu node running as a non-validator in a QBFT network is showing in other peer tables with an enode URL that includes a `?discport=X` (where `X` is a non-zero port number).\r\n\r\nThe node is running in docker with either `--nat-method=NONE` or `--nat-method=DOCKER` (both have been tried, and `discport` still appears to be set to a non-zero value)\r\n\r\nTo some of the validators, the enode URL does not contain a `discport` query param and those validators can connect to the node correctly.\r\n\r\nTo other validators the enode URL does contain a `discport` as mention above, and these validators cannot communicate with it. Trace shows failed `PING` packets to the node on that port.\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\nThe node isn't expected to have separate UDP discovery and TCP listener ports. The `--p2p-port` CLI param has been set, and is used for the TCP port. It should also be used for the UDP port. Docker is run with port porwarding configured for that port.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, a node would only advertise a separate `discovery` port if the node was running in Kubernetes, and a `LoadBalancer` was defined with a port named `discovery`. So it's unclear why the enode has a non-zero `discport`, and also unclear why some validators show the URL with a `discport` and some don't.\r\n\r\n",
