This will reduce wear and tear on my SSD, reduce IO WAIT elsewhere in Besu, speeding it up, and may increase the speed at which I can interact with the consensus layer I have attached. \r\n\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n* Worldstate remains in memory until finalized \r\n* Memory usage does not outsize the gain in performance on IO\r\n* No regressions are introduced \r\n\r\n### Versions (Add all that apply)\r\n* Software version: Latest ",
