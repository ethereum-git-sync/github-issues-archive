  "body": "### Description\r\nWhen adding a member to an onchain privacy a second time, the rehydration doesn't happen and the member ends up out of sync with the privacy group.\r\n\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n* A member can be added and removed multiple times from an onchain privacy group\r\nâ€¢ A member can always use priv_call at any block of the group and `latest` (we need a consistent PrivacyGHroupHeadBlock mapping)\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce (Bug)\r\n1. Create an onchain privacy group with member A\r\n2. Send a private tx to the private group\r\n3. Add member B to the privacy group (rehydration happens, B is in sync with the group)\r\n4. Remove B from the privacy group\r\n5. Send another private tx to the group\r\n6. Add B to the privacy group again (rehydration DOES NOT happen, B is out of sync with the group)\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** A member added to a privacy group is always on sync with the privacy group\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** A member added to a privacy group a second time ends up out of sync with the privacy group\r\n\r\n**Frequency:** Always\r\n\r\n### Versions (Add all that apply)\r\n* Besu 1.4.1\r\n* Orion 1.5.0\r\n",
