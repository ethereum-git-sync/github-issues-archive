  "body": "Today, bytecode storage is stored by account address, but we need to store by hash. Duplicated smart contracts can point to the same hashed bytecode. We also must serve data by hash in the context of the snapsync server. \n\n* Do a comparison with a full sync node to compare the improvement in storage reduction\n* Measure the performance impact of the change on syncing and block import\n\nQuestions\n* Does this rely on changes to self destruct in EIP 6780?\n* Do we want to migrate existing data to storage by hash or will this require a resync?",
