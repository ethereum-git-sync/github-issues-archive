  "body": "Today, code storage is stored by account address, but we need to store by code hash. Duplicated smart contracts can point to the same hashed bytecode. We also must serve data by hash in the context of the snapsync server. \n\n* Do a comparison with a full sync node to compare the improvement in storage reduction\n* Measure the performance impact of the change on syncing and block import\n\nQuestions\n* Does this rely on changes to self destruct in EIP 6780?\n* Do we want to migrate existing data to storage by hash or will this require a resync?\n\n- [x] Change  code storage to be stored by code hash instead of account address\n- [x] Track code hashes by address so that self-destruct can removed when all code storage is unreferenced\n- [x] Modify self-destruct to only delete code storage when all code hash references are removed\n- [x] Backwards capability for code storage by account\n- [x] Compare stored code values from existing column family to new column to ensure consistency\n- [x] Performance test syncing to ensure read/write performance caused by changes to tracking code hashes by address have minimal impact\n- [x] Compare storage size taken by new column families with old storage mode\n- [x] Experimental flag to enable code storage by code hash\n",
