We are unable to send a new transaction with higher gas, so the only way is set our TX_POOL_MAX_SIZE to 0 , and back to default value, then we are able to sent new transactons, but , the invalid transaction was included in cache of validator and we are unable to reset then. because of network rules. So always we sent new transactions BESU will check this cache, and invalidate again because we have a higher nonce.\r\n\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\nIF we are able to set LOWEST_INVALID_KNOWN_NONCE_CACHE = 0 on bootstrap of validators nodes, we can transact normally and transactions will not being invalidated every time, because we haven't a cache, in our case this cache isn't necessary. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
