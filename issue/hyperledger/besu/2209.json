At least one other client seems to return the latest head that we have the state for, which means while fast syncing they return 0. We should work out what the behavior should be.\n\nThis has implications for how hive testing is currently done.",

    "body": "After reviewing the [json-rpc spec](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#default-block-parameter), I think the spirit of the design implies 'latest' to mean the last complete block. In no particular order:\r\n\r\n1. Latest refers to last mined block. That implies all state is established for that block.\r\n2. `eth_getBlockByNumber` is documented as returning the same value as `eth_getBlockByHash` would, which includes state, logs, txReceipts etc.\r\n3. It may be more intuitive for Latest to return head of the fully synced chain, and allow Pending to include the latest available (yet incomplete) block.\r\n\r\nThe other argument I considered was that maybe this method shouldn't use default block parameters at all. `eth_getBlockByNumber` is considered a \"history\" method. The spec implies that default block parameters are intended for use:   \r\n\r\n> \"**When requests are made that act on the state of Ethereum**, the last default block parameter determines the height of the block.\"\r\n\r\nSo what does it mean to use a history method to get the most recent entry into a ledger, when that entry may be incomplete?",
