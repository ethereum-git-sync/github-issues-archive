E.g.\r\n\r\n- Start node at `v23.10.2`\r\n- Stop node\r\n- Start node with `v23.4.1`\r\n- Node doesn't work\r\n- Stop node\r\n- Start node with `v23.10.2` again\r\n- Node doesn't work any more\r\n\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\nWhen starting Besu at a version lower than the highest version that has been used with that node's data, Besu should fail on startup with a clear error message, rather than attempt to start and correct the data.",

Specifically we changed the DB format in [23.4.4](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/releases/tag/23.4.4) and provided downgrade commands in the release notes. A change to recognize \"older versions\" would really only be compatible from the version its released with onward.  ",
