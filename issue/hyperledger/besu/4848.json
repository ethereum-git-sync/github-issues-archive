  "body": "Besu currently has 3 privacy modes. The privacy mode that provides compatibility with GoQuorum privacy is intertwined with mainnet code at the transaction and block processing level. We also have not seen demand for this privacy mode within the Besu community.\r\nWe plan to deprecate the GoQuorum-compatible privacy feature, along with IBFT 1.0, in the coming quarterly release 23.1, and then remove it in the following quarterly release 23.4.\r\nRemoving the code associated with this feature will reduce the complexity of the transaction and block processing code, reducing friction for mainnet-focused development.\r\n\r\nThis will not affect the remaining 2 privacy modes (EEA privacy and flexible privacy groups).\r\nThis will not affect IBFT 2.0 or QBFT.\r\n\r\nReach out to us on Discord with any questions.",
