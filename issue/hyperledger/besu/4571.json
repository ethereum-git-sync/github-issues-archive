  "body": "Store a limited amount of transaction receipts to reduce the amount of storage needed when using Bonsai light mode.\n\nNote that is related to #4476\n\nAcceptance Criteria\n* Ensure the pruning doesn't affect performance of Besu. This is lower priority than block processing/import\n* Storage is maintained at a small size by pruning old transaction receipts by only keeping HEAD/finalised -x of the transaction receipts.\n* Ensure that block headers, block body and transaction receipts are deleted atomically i.e. using rocksdb transactions\n* Can survive a chain reorg i.e. can handle forks\n* Ensure that syncing continues to work when pivot block is behind the pruning block\n\nTasks\n* Hidden feature flag for bonsai pruning and configuration for number of blocks to prune\n* When the threshold is reach for historical data then prune old transaction receipts below threshold\n* Create pruning scheduler so that it does not affect the performance of Besu particularly block import/block execution\n* Add remove method to KeyValueStoragePrefixedKeyBlockchainStorage for transaction receipts\n* Test syncing for checkpoint\n* Measure eth_call performance using eth_gen to ensure is not negatively affected by pruning\n* Acceptance test/integration test for pruning\n\nQuestion\n* Should this be a seperate process or built-in to the block processing?\n  * Decided on using seperate process so more control on when the pruning happens for performance and fulfilling acceptance criteria\n\nNotes\n* Lower priority process than block import. If possible prune when idle\n* Existing pruning is for Forest mode world state only and it's approach of traversing the trie is not applicable for the bonsai blockchain data pruning we need to do.",
