    "body": "So to provide some context...\r\n\r\nExecution clients use devp2p for connections between nodes and discovery v4 for the UDP based node discovery.  Both of those only support IPs and DNS can't be used.\r\n\r\nConsensus clients use libp2p connections between nodes and discovery v5 for the UDP based node discovery. discv5 has two key improvements over v4 - firstly it supports using dns names when advertising nodes, but it also supports automatic detection of your external IP address so it works fine with dynamic IP addresses and doesn't actually need to use DNS.\r\n\r\nThe difference between devp2p and libp2p doesn't really matter here because it's the discovery layer that you need to make work and it can propagate information about IP changes about as quickly as DNS will. So sadly your consensus client will just work automatically if you don't specify an external IP to advertise and let it detect the right one - it will automatically update each time your IP changes.  But execution clients have no way of doing that until discv5 gets adopted at the execution layer.\r\n\r\nThe bigger issue you're likely to have with a dynamic IP that changes regularly is that each time it changes you're going to lose all peers and take some time to reconnect, purely because IP change will interrupt all the existing TCP connections to peers you've discovered.\r\n\r\nIf you only need to look up the external IP to advertise at startup, you could do this with a wrapper script that uses `host` or `nslookup` to resolve the IP and then sets that as the advertised IP for besu. But if the IP changes often while you're running you'd need to setup a monitoring script that restarts besu each time the IP changes.",
