  "body": "If I try to do a call where I put a tx sender as contract address, it will fail saying that `Sender account not authorized to send transactions`, which happens after implementation of EIP-3607 (#2676).\r\n\r\nThis makes sense for an actual transaction being submitted to chain, but it limits the `eth_call` abilities, whereby it was possible to check that a \"sub-transaction\" from let's say some mutisig contract is going to pass or fail.\r\n\r\nThe same applies to estimate gas feature.\r\n\r\nI believe that it should be allowed to perform such queries and discard only ones that actually publish tx on chain like `eth_sendRawTransaction` etc.",
