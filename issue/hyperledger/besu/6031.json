  "body": "There are 3 things that I don't understand in the [text of your new release](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/releases/tag/23.10.0). I can't update because of that.\n\n1. You cite several times \"# 5772\" but clicking the tag doesn't work in this text when I want to learn more about this change.\n\n2.\n> `tx-pool-retention-hours`: simply remove it, since it is not applicable in the Layered txpool, old transactions will eventually expire when the memory cache is full.\n\nIsn't there a vulnerability here? By mistake (or with the goal to disturb all Besu nodes of the network), it can happen that accounts send transactions with nonces far enough in the future (up to +199) and, if the gas price is reasonable, these transactions will slowly start to clog our 2nd and 3rd layers, potentially squatting our pools forever if these accounts get abandoned before they reach such nonces.\n\n3. \n> --Xlayered-tx-pool-layer-max-capacity, --Xlayered-tx-pool-max-prioritized and --Xlayered-tx-pool-max-future-by-sender just drop the X and keep the same behavior\n\nIt contradicts what is written before. In the text above this paragraph, what seems to be dropped is _Xlayered-_. So, what should I drop to make sure that Besu understands my settings?",
