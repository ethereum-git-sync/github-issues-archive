  "body": "SnapSync is ready for prime-time. We are also preparing to ship snap server, the final piece of the puzzle. \n\nThis ticket tracks some final cleanup for UX and simplicity as we move Snap to non-experimental and the default for the client over time. \n\n- Since SNAP is an extension of FAST in the codebase, the log entries for a SNAP sync node all show as FAST sync e.g. \"main | INFO  | FastSyncDownloader | Starting sync\". It's not ideal when looking through logs that the class names logged out can mislead you as to which sync mode is being used. We should tidy this up. #6386\n- SNAP sync and --fast-sync-min-peers. In a PoW or PoA network this flag applies to SNAP and CHECKPOINT sync. A synonym should be added as part of moving it out of experimental, with --fast-sync-min-peers  deprecated for removal in a future version. We could use --sync-min-peers and update the docs to reflect this flag only impacts _non-PoS_ networks in Besu. #6385",
