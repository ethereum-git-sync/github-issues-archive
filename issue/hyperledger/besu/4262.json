  "body": "### Description\r\nAs a user, I want to extend the [Flexible Privacy feature](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Concepts/Privacy/Flexible-PrivacyGroups/) so that I am able to use it along with [Tessera's EC encryptor mode](https://docs.tessera.consensys.net/en/stable/HowTo/Configure/Cryptographic-elliptic-curves/#configure-an-alternative-cryptographic-elliptic-curve). \r\n\r\nThe Flexible Privacy feature relies on [these Smart Contracts](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/tree/main/privacy-contracts/src/main/solidity) and the Java wrappers \"above\" them. As we can see, [they expect a `bytes32` argument](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/blob/main/privacy-contracts/src/main/solidity/FlexiblePrivacyGroupManagementProxy.sol#L30) for the participants (Tessera's enclave public key). \r\n\r\nFor the EC encryptor mode of Tessera, we expect enclave public keys to be longer than 32. This means that we need to somehow adapt the code so we can use these keys as identifiers of the participants as well. For instance, we could modify the contracts so they take a `bytes` parameter. This option has pros and cons so there is still some analysis to carry out in this regard, which includes exploring other options.\r\n\r\nLooping in @NicolasMassart and @pinges since I discussed this issue with him a couple of months ago. It would be the follow-up of [this other solved issue](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/issues/3819). \r\n\r\nIf you think it makes sense, I would like to be the assignee of the issue.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n* We are able to use the Flexible Privacy Group feature along with Tessera's EC encryptor\r\n\r\n\r\n",
