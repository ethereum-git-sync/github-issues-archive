  "body": "`ProtocolSpecBuilder` has some very interconnected dependencies that lead to some strange contortions to make DI work.  The subject of this issue is the uses of `Function<DifficultyCalculator<T>, BlockHeaderValidator<T>>`.  Both the `blockHeaderValidator` and `ommerHeaderValidator` rely on this construct.  The crux of the issue is that because we build our specs in a layered fashion (example: Istanbul is Constantinople plus these extra rules) the exact `DifficultyCalculator` is not known until long after we want to add a header validation rule that says \"ensure difficulty is calculated correctly.\"\r\n\r\nThis is leaking into strange places and imposing technical debt.  \r\n\r\nPossible solutions:\r\n* Refer to the DifficultyCalculator via a `Supplier`\r\n* Use a DI framework such as dagger or guice\r\n* treat the difficulty calculator rule special and add it as late as possible\r\n* track rules instead of a validator object, and let rules be named, so we can replace a named rule.",
