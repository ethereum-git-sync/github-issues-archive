  "body": "### Description\r\nAs an Besu User, I want there to be a brief line added to https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Get-Started/Installation-Options/Install-Binaries/ so that a user upgrading from a prior version of Besu is reminded to install Command line tools (xcode-select --install) if they have upgraded their version of MacOS between installs of Besu. \r\n\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n* A brief note on https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Get-Started/Installation-Options/Install-Binaries/ notifying users that have upgraded to a newer version of MacOS and have not ensured command line tools are reinstalled, upon running\r\n`brew upgrade hyperledger/besu/besu`\r\nyou may be prompted to reinstall command line tools \r\n`xcode-select --install`\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce (Bug)\r\n1. Go to https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Get-Started/Installation-Options/Install-Binaries/\r\n2. `brew upgrade hyperledger/besu/besu`\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]\r\nBesu to upgrade from 1.2.4 to 20.10.3\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]\r\nError: The following formula cannot be installed from bottle and must be\r\nbuilt from source.\r\n  besu\r\nInstall the Command Line Tools:\r\n  xcode-select --install\r\n\r\n**Frequency:** Only after upgrading a computer from MacOS 10 to MacOS 11. During the upgrade, it appears that command line tools did not remain installed, causing the Besu upgrade to fail. \r\n\r\n### Versions (Add all that apply)\r\n* Software version: Besu to upgrade from 1.2.4 to 20.10.3\r\n* Java version: Java 15\r\n* OS Name & Version: MacOS Big Sur v11.1\r\n* Kernel Version: Not relevant\r\n* Virtual Machine software & version: Not relevant\r\n* Docker Version: Not relevant\r\n* Cloud VM, type, size: Not relevant\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\nAs many Mac users have upgraded or are upgrading to MacOS 11, I'd like to see a brief note made to say if you have upgraded to a newer version of MacOS and have not ensure command line tools are reinstalled, upon your running of \r\n`brew upgrade hyperledger/besu/besu`\r\nyou may be prompted to reinstall command line tools \r\n`xcode-select --install`\r\n",
