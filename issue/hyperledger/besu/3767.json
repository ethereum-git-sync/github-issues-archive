  "body": "### Description\r\nMainnet miners have voted to keep the gasLimit around 30,000,000 since [August 2021](https://etherscan.io/chart/gaslimit). Geth had an 8,000,000 gasLimit default on a [merge testnet which resulted in a drop in the gasLimit](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24680#issue-1200385203).\r\n\r\n>Post-merge lots of validators will run with default configs, which means the gas limit will move to the default gas limit.\r\nOn mainnet-shadow-fork-1 this resulted in a drop from a gaslimit of 30M down to 8M.\r\n\r\nGeth has since [updated their default to 30M](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/commit/c40943a167b603382bbd0f45c92c9b9c2669a080). \r\n\r\nIf I an understanding the Besu default mainnet setting correctly the [default gasLimit is still 5000](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/blob/main/config/src/main/resources/mainnet.json#L40) (The original limit at genesis ðŸ˜²). I think this should be incresed to 30M in prepeartion for The Merge since there is a chance that validators may not understand/care about miner setting. ",
