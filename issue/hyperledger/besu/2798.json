It might be possible to improve the accuracy of the timer.\n\nImpact of the block timer being triggered too early is that blocks can be created with an invalid block header timestamp leading to the header validation rule to fail and Ibft or Qbft to go to new round.",

    "body": "Tested on Ubuntu Linux LTS 20.04.3 with Besu 20.10.1 and 21.7.4 and was unable to get an \"Invalid block header: timestamp\" warning due to timestamp being incorrect. This was with validators running locally with a block period of 5s. The maximum variation I got from the expected block timer value was 66ms which is under the 500ms that would be needed to create an issue.\r\n\r\nThis was occurring in old versions of Besu due to how we were calculating the new header timestamp. In recent versions of IBFT2 and QBFT we str rounding when converting the block period to closest millisecond https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/blob/main/consensus/ibft/src/main/java/org/hyperledger/besu/consensus/ibft/statemachine/IbftBlockHeightManager.java#L115. Small variations of under 500ms from the scheduled block period no longer impact the block header timestamp.\r\n\r\nThere is no simple for improving the block period timing in Java. There are some workarounds https://gist.github.com/bric3/314c3d01a80e5e3c158965dcd459a8a5 but these would required occupying a thread for each timer.\r\n\r\nUnless we are getting an  \"Invalid block header: timestamp\" warning and I wasn't able to locally then I don't think we should be making changes to the BFT timer code.\r\n\r\n",
