  "body": "### Description\nStatic nodes are being connected in code, but are not contributing to the initial sync. It can sometimes take 25 minutes to begin syncing in a network with low peer counts, even if directly setting static peers. There seems to be a boolean that states \"isConnected\" to static nodes as true, but Besu does not make the proper requests to these peers to pull data for a sync. \n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n* [Criteria 1]\n\n### Steps to Reproduce (Bug)\n1. Specify static peers, \n2. Start Besu,\n3. Wait for a sync to begin (can take a while)\n4. Check peer table, can mostly be other peers \n\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]\nStatic nodes immediately help in peering and sync \n\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]\nStatic nodes do not seem to help with sync immediately. This can cause a huge delay in syncing a fresh node \n\n**Frequency:** [What percentage of the time does it occur?]\nEvery time with static nodes\n\n### Logs (if a bug)\nPlease post relevant logs from Besu (and the consensus client, if running proof of stake) from before and after the issue. \n\n### Versions (Add all that apply)\n* Latest",
